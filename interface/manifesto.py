<b><big>The Gnoetic Manifesto</big></b>

Language is a prosthesis of an ancient neuro-chemical
regime; but now the chemical author is dead.  Gnoetry places language at a
remove from its typical sources: pre-conscious governance, psycho-historical
flux, conscious-mind narration.

The human mind automatically imposes a semi-discrete,
hierarchical order: since we have to regard everything we think as an aspect
of our ability to self-reflect, the only way towards linguistic novelty is to
remove self-reflection from the process.

By using extant texts as a language corpus and prosodic
forms as a poetic process, Gnoetry acknowledges that language and its generic
morphology is our human inheritance.  By contextualizing language within the
machine and removing it a few historical and psychological dimensions away
from the "human atmosphere" (Jarry), Gnoems create a linguistic representation
that exists near the zero degree of validity.

Language speaks itself.

The machine replaces the artist's day-dream; no
day-dream-product is symbolically invalid and no Gnoetic-language product is
poetically invalid.

It unwraps words from their usual human
contexts until words no longer have direct instrumental relationships
to the world-in fact, the very question of instrumentality is rendered
moot.  The significance of meaning is altered.

Gnoetry, using the words of Mark Edmunson,
"provides alternatives to habitual ways of thinking.  It enlarges the
stock of available reality, as Blackmur put it, by offering a verbal
alternative to fixed assumptions about what...realities are"
(<i>Literature Against Philosophy</i>).

Gnoetry is asymptomatic poetry.

Language is moved away from the tyrannical
subject of human cognizance, away from the analog and into the
digital; Gnoetic language is almost completely free of reliance upon
traces of tone of voice, facial expressions, gestures or postures.

It is a novelty-creation device that compresses
time: the language corpus behind each Gnoetic product bypasses
biologically and culturally induced, pre-planned, over-determined
linguistic behaviors.  Releasing language from its usual
human-inherited enthusiasms, any short-hand iconographic understanding
is eliminated.

Gnoetry is poetry without 99% of human history
which in turn makes poetry more historically important than it may
have been.  Gnoetic thought is without the lie of sub-consciousness:
no human speaker is being strip-teased out from under a linguistic
bikini while the meaning governors play "ba da da dum-tsh..."

Poetic language is finally given its own
epistemic dignity.  The human is no longer accountable for meaning or
thinking about meaning since Gnoetry renders language into pure
technique.  "Diction itself is its own image."  Gnoetry renders
language into 'meaningless' diction: it is the ultimate beautiful
automation of poetry.  The reader is "forced to note the formal
pattern and conventional disposition of phrases are more important
than 'ideas' or 'themes' or 'message,' more important even than
'reality'" and thus, through Gnoetry, the reader is "re-initiated into
the rites of mediation" via language speaking as much as possible on
its own terms.  (quotes from Veronica Forrest-Thomson <i>Poetic
Artifice</i>)

Syntax is creation anticipated" (Christopher
Dewdney <i>The Secular Grail</i>).

Gnoetry is weird grammatical and syntactical
proposition par excellence; grammar and syntax, borne from our
ancestors' being in the world in time, is now a measure of meaning
made in the pieces of seconds before conscious-mind order.

A central activity of poetic language is
formal. ... While failing in the attempt to match the world, we
discover structure, distinction, the integrity and separateness of
things" (see Lyn Hejinian "The Rejection of Closure").

Gnoetic language escapes the tyranny of
indeterminacy: the combination of the uncertain (any language token
created by the Gnoetic process becomes an infinite signifier) with the
intimate (a trace of the human via any given language corpus) is
automated by Gnoetry (see Joan Retallack "Non-Euclidean Narrative
Combustion").

Oulipeans would say that Gnoetry plagiarizes by
anticipation and creates an infinite potential literature, raising the
"efficacy and viability of artificial...literary structures" (see
Francios Le Lionnais, the First and Second Lipo Manifestos).

Plagiarism is necessary," Isadore Ducasse wrote
in 1870, "[because] it stays close to the wording of an author, it
uses his expressions, erasing a false idea and replacing it with a
correct one" (Poesies).  Gnoetry fulfills the first two levels of the
Ateiler de Litterature Assistee par la Mathematique et les
Ordinateurs' approach to language: "combinatorial" and
"applicational"; the human fulfills the third "implicational" level by
providing, if she chooses, principles such as narrative logic to
create complete and complex works (see Oulipo Compendium: "ALAMO") and
by editing the work into human psycho-historical time in collaboration
with human phylogeny and deep-grammatical inheritance.

Gnoetry is The Declaration of Dependence!
