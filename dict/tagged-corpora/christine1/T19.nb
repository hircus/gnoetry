<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KD6

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>11 to 16 Jan 1992

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Leicester

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>at home, watching television/conversation

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Simon076, m, 17, student, MD, AB
<li>Kim077, f, 37, nurse, MD, AB
<li>Richard078, m, 3, n/a, MD, AB
</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>No relationships stated in BNC (but see Social Classification, below).


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>All speakers are given the BNC dialect code 
translated simply &quot;Midlands&quot;,
which corresponds to no one of Trudgill's sixteen English dialect areas and
is presumably used because the BNC respondent was no more specific.  The
parts of England standardly called the Midlands span both sides of the
CHRISTINE &quot;Midland/South East&quot; boundary, 
but these speakers are given the
MD code on the ground that Leicester is in the MD area.  (However, it is
not very far north of Trudgill's &quot;North/South&quot; isogloss.)


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>All speakers are classified DE by BNC, but this is incompatible with
Kim077's occupation, which is SOC code 340, II, hence she is AB.
Furthermore Simon076 calls Kim077 &quot;mother&quot; at s-unit 03105, so is her
son and inherits her classification.  Whether or not we are entitled to
assume that Richard078 is also son of Kim077 (as he probably is), BNC
notes that he is either son or stepson of a male nurse and hence again AB.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>03027, 03031, 03101, 03102, 03104, 03105:  The BNC transcriptions contain
names of schools either spelled out normally or, in one case,
partly and inadequately anonymized.  In CHRISTINE these names
have been made fully anonymous, 
as <tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt>, or in the case
of two-word names, <tt>&lt;name&gt;&lt;name&gt;</tt>. 

<p>03054, and the following <tt>{unclear}</tt> element, 
are ascribed in BNC to an unidentified speaker,
but they are obviously continuous with the later s-units ascribed
to Kim077

<p>03054:  <i>It starts of</i> emended to <i>It starts off</i> 
(obvious emendation)

<p>03055, 03063, 03092, 03106, 03109, 03128:  <i>any way</i> 
emended to <i>anyway</i>

<p>03057 (twice), 03077:  <i>every body</i> emended to <i>everybody</i>

<p>03060:  <i>why they were</i> emended to <i>while they were</i> 
(near-homonym, makes good sense
in context)

<p>03060:  <i>whether its drama</i> emended to <i>whether it's drama</i>

<p>03071:  <i>he's names Geoff</i> emended to <i>his name's Geoff</i> 
(obvious emendation)

<p>03073:  <i>its not</i> emended to <i>it's not</i> (twice), 
<i>and its</i> emended to <i>and it's</i>

<p>03075:  <i>its only</i> emended to <i>it's only</i>

<p>03085:  <i>its</i> emended to <i>it's</i> (five times)

<p>03085:  <i>somebody I'll</i> emended to <i>somebody ah'll</i> 
(it seems more likely that the
vowel after <i>somebody</i> is a filled pause of some kind than that it
is the pronoun <i>I</i>)

<p>03085:  <i>six formers</i> emended to <i>sixth-formers</i>

<p>03091:  <i>must of</i> emended to <i>must've</i>

<p>03097:  <i>Indipau I'll</i> emended to <i>Indipau ah'll</i> (cf. 03085 above)

<p>03097:  <i>lets</i> emended to <i>let's</i>

<p>03100:  <i>Its</i> emended to <i>It's</i>

<p>03102:  <i>its</i> emended to <i>it's</i>, <i>down hill</i> 
emended to <i>downhill</i>

<p>03109:  <i>its</i> emended to <i>it's</i>

<p>03116:  <i>parents evening</i> emended to <i>parents' evening</i>

<p>03124, 03128, 03130:  <i>its</i> emended to <i>it's</i>

<p>03134:  <i>the kids house</i> emended to <i>the kids' house</i>

<p>03140:  <i>must of</i> emended to <i>must've</i>

<p>03146:  <i>any thing</i> emended to <i>anything</i>

<p>03150:  The phrase <i>he's mummy</i> appears to mean <i>his mummy</i>, and it is
tempting to correct the transcription.  However, <i>his mummy</i> is such
an obvious phrase that the principle of <i>lectio difficilioris</i> might
suggest that <i>he's mummy</i> must have been written for a good reason;
and it has been left to stand in CHRISTINE.  (I do myself know an
adult who regularly uses <i>he's</i> for <i>his</i> in jocular baby talk.)  
-- This case might suggest that <i>he's</i> should also stand at 03071 above,
but since that transcription could not have been wholly correct it has
been fully normalized.

<p>03165:  <i>every body</i> emended to <i>everybody</i>

<p>03179:  <i>teachers looking</i> emended to <i>teacher's looking</i>
