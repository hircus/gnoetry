<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>02835, 02996, 03001:  Where these s-units contain the <i>noms 
de corpus</i> &quot;Marco&quot; (in the first case) and &quot;Neil&quot;
(in the latter two cases), the BNC original contains not the relevant
participants' real names but slight variants of those names -- it 
might be that in one or more of the cases these differences are intended
and other individuals are being addressed or referred to, but it
seems more probable that the variants arose through transcriber error.

<p>02843:  <i>gotta</i> emended to <i>got a</i> (i.e. not <i>got to</i>)

<p>02845:  It seems very strange that a 14-year-old London schoolgirl telling
a blue joke, even if belonging to social class AB, should use
the archaic hyperlect form <i>an hotel</i>; but this is the transcription
in BNC, and we have no basis for declaring it incorrect.

<p>02856, 02867:  <i>swimming costume</i> emended to <i>swimming-costume</i>

<p>02863:  <i>blonde-haired</i> emended to <i>blonde haired</i>; 
hyphenation would be normal
orthography, but this is a productive construction so the form
is separated into two words to allow consistent grammatical
annotation.

<p>02884, 02887:  <i>ice cream</i> emended to <i>ice-cream</i>

<p>02922:  The last &quot;word&quot; of this s-unit, 
beginning at byte 0370706, is
given in BNC as <tt>{unclear}</tt>; 
but the logic of the joke being told
by the speaker absolutely demands that the s-unit should end
with <i>had</i> (uttered as a noise, tagged US, rather than as a
verb form).  This change has been made in CHRISTINE.  Since the
joke is long and abstruse, it is very understandable that someone
transcribing from a tape would not have known what he was hearing
at this point.  The only other possibility would be that s-unit
02923, consisting just of <i>had</i> and assigned by BNC to PS000
(unknown speaker), was actually a continuation by Diane127 of
the wording in 02922, so that her joke ended with the word <i>had</i>
but not within BNC s-unit 02922.  However, in context it seems much
more likely that s-unit 02923 represents one of Diane's hearers
echoing her last word in puzzlement.

<p>02924:  BNC ascribes this s-unit to PS000 (unknown speaker), 
but by the logic
of the joke-telling situation it must be Diane127.

<p>02929:  <i>fortune teller</i> emended to <i>fortune-teller</i> 
(three instances)

<p>02936:  In the BNC file, the opening vocalization shift following 
<i>she goes</i>
is never followed by a closing shift.  CHRISTINE supplies
this at the end of the s-unit, where the logic of the story
requires it.

<p>02960:  It is tempting to emend <i>what's a matter</i> to 
<i>what's the matter</i>;
however, the far greater plausibility of the latter will have
been as obvious to the transcriber as to us, so the transcriber's
unexpected choice of wording has been left to stand.

<p>02960:  <i>gov</i> emended to <i>guv</i> (standard spelling 
of the jocular vocative form
derived from <i>governor</i>)

<p>02970:  <i>queuing</i> emended to <i>queueing</i> 
(transcriber's spelling mistake)

<p>02981:  In the BNC file, the opening vocalization shift 
following <i>he goes</i>
is never followed by a closing shift.  CHRISTINE supplies
this at the end of the s-unit, where the logic of the story
requires it.
