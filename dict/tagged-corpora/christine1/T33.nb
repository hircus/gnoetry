<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Robyn122, f, 31, occupation unspecified, NO, AB
<li>Robin123, m, 6, pupil, NO, AB
<li>Kylie124, f, 5, pupil, NO, AB
<li>Scott125, m, 1, n/a, NO, AB

</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Robyn122 is mother of the other speakers.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>All speakers are given the generic BNC code for 
&quot;northern England&quot;, rather
than one of the specific Trudgill area codes.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Robyn122 as AB, Robin123 and Kylie124 as DE, and leaves
Scott125 unclassified.  But it is not clear what could justify different
classes for a mother and her young children.  If Robyn122 is AB, all her
children should also receive this classification.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>00039:  <i>Jack Spratt</i> emended to <i>Jack Sprat</i> 
(nursery-rhyme character)

<p>00069:  <i>his on hip hip hip</i> emended to <i>his hat on hip hip hip</i>.  
The speaker is
singing the first line of a well-known children's song.  It
seems much easier to believe that the transcriber has accidentally
omitted the word <i>hat</i>, than that the singer left it out -- which
would make it impossible to fit the words to the tune.  The word
is included correctly in the directly following line.  (Unfortunately
this case obviously raises questions about whether similar transcriber
omissions have been made elsewhere in the Corpus, where musical
metre does not reveal them, so that some apparent speaker incoherencies
may merely represent slips of the transcriber's pen.)

<p>00117, 00118:  <i>gotta</i> emended to <i>got a</i> 
(the speaker is saying <i>you got a smack</i>,
not <i>you have got to smack</i>)

<p>00229:  <i>nut-case</i> emended to <i>nutcase</i>

<p>00260, 00284, 00402:  <i>wee wee(d)</i> emended to <i>wee-wee(d)</i>

<p>00264, 00332:  <i>sitting room</i> emended to <i>sitting-room</i>

<p>00404-00423:  <i>aunty</i> emended to <i>auntie</i>, 
five instances (<i>auntie</i> is preferred
by <i>COD</i>)
