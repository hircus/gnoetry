</ul>

<p>Note that the BNC file consistently spells <i>warehouse</i> 
as <i>wharehouse</i> both
in locale statements and in occupation descriptions.

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Jonathan008 and Pat009 are man and wife, and are parents of Pat010.
Jonathan008 is father-in-law of Darren011 and Elspeth014; nothing is said
in BNC about who either of the latter are married to.
Pete012 and Sanjay013 are friends of Jonathan008; they appear from the
dialogue to be workmates of Pat010 and Darren011, but this is not stated.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>All speakers are given the dialect code applicable to Bristol, except
Pete012 who is coded as Merseyside, and Sanjay013 who is given no dialect
code.  Since the latter has a South Asian name, the reason for absence of a
dialect code could be that he belongs to an immigrant family and uses a
variety of English more coloured by the family's original language than by
any British regional variety.  He is coded in CHRISTINE 
as &quot;dialect unknown&quot;.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Jonathan008 as C2 and Pat009 as DE, but the latter is wife
of the former and her class code has been adjusted to match his.
Pat010 is classified DE in BNC, agreeing with his SOC code 441, IV.
All other speakers are unclassified in BNC; CHRISTINE assigns the
appropriate code to the other warehouse operatives.


<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>00701:  Normally, when a participant laughs, BNC records this using
a &lt;vocal&gt; element with the 
description attribute &quot;laugh&quot;.
In this case the attribute is shown as &quot;laughing&quot;, but
since this is not a shift applying over a stretch of wording
it does not seem to be distinct from a 
&quot;laugh&quot; of unspecified
duration; CHRISTINE uses the element <tt>{laugh}</tt>.

<p>00757:  <i>Your supposed</i> emended to <i>you're supposed</i>

<p>00819:  <i>the three D one</i> emended to <i>the 3D one</i>.  
The Oxford dictionary used 
seems to contain no ruling on this abbreviation of 
<i>three-dimensional</i>, but I believe it is commonly written <i>3D</i>,
so it is here treated as a single word with an adjective tag.

<p>00830:  From context, <i>fucking miss</i> is taken to be a broken-off utterance
of <i>fucking missed</i>

<p>00832:  <i>my Mrs said</i> emended to <i>my missis said</i> 
(the spelling <i>Mrs</i> is
normally used only as a prefix to a name)

<p>00885:  <i>breeze blocks</i> emended to <i>breeze-blocks</i>

<p>00947:  <i>christmas</i> emended to <i>Christmas</i>

<p>00968:  It is unclear why Jonathan008 appears to be addressed as
<i>Alf</i>.  Alf(red) is not listed as the real name of any participant
in this BNC text.

<p>00989:  <i>to much</i> emended to <i>too much</i>

<p>01029, 01031:  It is very unclear what is being spoken about, and one may
wonder whether the repeated phrase <i>cut out</i> is a transcription
error for <i>caught out</i> -- however, the latter would not make
sufficiently better sense to justify changing the wording in
CHRISTINE.
