<h1>Text T26</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KDX

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>On or about 2 Apr 1992.  (Part of the extract must have been recorded
on the night of 9/10 April, because speakers discuss General Election
results as they are announced.)

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>South Shields

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>home, conversation

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hayley098, f, 18, sales assistant, NO, C1
<li>Edna099, f, 45, housewife, NO, DE
<li>George100, m, 22, butcher and baker, NO, C2
<li>Billy101, m, 49, unemployed, NO, DE
<li>Harry102, m, 30, electrician, NO, C2
<li>Kevin103, m, 21, machinist, NO, XX
<li>Alice104, f, XX, unemployed, NO, XX
<li>Martin105, m, XX, unemployed, NO, XX
<li>Anon106, no information in BNC

</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Billy101 and Edna099 are man and wife.
Hayley098 and George100 are their children.
Kevin103 is boyfriend of Hayley098.
Hayley098, Harry102, Alice104, and Martin105 are friends.
No information is available about Anon106.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>Alice104 and Martin105 are given a BNC dialect code translated simply as
&quot;northern England&quot;, more general than 
the Trudgill dialect classification,
presumably because the BNC respondent was not more specific in their case.
All the other speakers (apart from Anon106, for whom no information is
given) are assigned the dialect code applicable to South Shields.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Hayley098 as C2, Edna099 and George100 as DE, and does not
classify the others.  But Hayley098 is SOC code 720, IIIN, so C1.
George100 is SOC code 580/581, IIIM, so C2.  If Edna099 is correctly
classified DE, then her husband Billy101 should have the same
classification.  Harry102 is SOC code 521, IIIM, hence C2.  The description
&quot;machinist&quot; is too broad to yield a SOC code for Kevin103.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>00690:  <i>it was just the was talking</i>:  
clearly it is very tempting to
assume that the transcriber left something out accidentally,
say that the true utterance was <i>it was just the way he was
talking</i>.  But people do sometimes produce utterly mangled
grammatical structures, such as this one; so we have not
felt entitled to &quot;correct&quot; the transcription.

<p>00716:  <i>tara</i> emended to <i>ta-ra</i>

<p>00722:  <i>{unclear}'s got them</i>:  BNC has a space after the 
<tt>{unclear}</tt>
entity, but the apostrophe would not be preceded by space
whatever the inaudible wording was.

<p>00801:  <i>non</i> emended to <i>none</i> (makes sense in context, 
and this would be an
expected error given that the speaker is from N.E. England and
the transcriber is probably used to R.P.)

<p>00807:  <i>the selections</i> emended to <i>these elections</i> 
(context makes this small
phonetic reinterpretation very plausible)

<p>00871:  the use of <i>off</i> as a verb in a suitable sense 
is not familiar, but
no emendation suggests itself

<p>00893:  <i>six months time</i> emended to <i>six months' time</i>

<p>00918:  <i>thinking</i> emended to <i>drinking</i> 
(much more plausible in context)

<p>00921:  <i>no with</i>:  the word <i>no</i> is taken 
to be a regional variant of
<i>not</i>, here.  (This is common in Scottish speech; this speaker
is attributed to N.E. England.)

<p>00922:  In BNC, <i>pints.</i> appears as a single word; 
the full stop has not been
split off as a separate item as normally.  Consequently this
single numbered s-unit comprises sequences that would normally
have been assigned to separate s-units.
