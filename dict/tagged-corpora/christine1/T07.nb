<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>

<p>In BNC, all speakers are given the London dialect code, which is obviously
implausible.  Steve Crowdy of the BNC team explained to me in an e-message
dated 15 June 1997 that there had been a clerical confusion between codes
for London and for &quot;Central Northern England&quot;, 
the latter including the Doncaster area.
Crowdy did not identify BNC file KBT as one to which the
confusion had applied, but I take it that it must have done.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Scott029 as C2, George030 and Malcolm031 as DE, and leaves
others unclassified.  The classification for Scott029 seems to agree with
his SOC classification (code F889, probably IIIM, though the class
implication of the F prefix is not properly explained in 
Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (1990-1), vol. 3, p.
12).  Peter032 is SOC code 719, IIIN.  Harry033 is SOC code 872, IIIM.


<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>00150:  <i>Rumbelows</i> emended to <i>Rumbelow's</i> 
(from 1990 to 1992 the football League
Cup -- an alternative competition to the FA Cup -- was
known as &quot;Rumbelow's League Cup&quot;).

<p>00150, 00151:  <i>F A</i> emended to <i>FA</i> (Football Association)

<p>00152, 00407:  <i>an'all</i> emended to <i>an' all</i>

<p>00154:  This s-unit begins with a word <i>According</i> which, in the original
BNC file, lacks a <tt>&lt;w&gt;</tt> tag.

<p>00184:  <i>Q P R</i> emended to <i>QPR</i> (Queen's Park Rangers)

<p>00224, 00226:  <i>int</i> for Northern <i>in the</i> emended to <i>in t'</i>

<p>00382:  In <i>they've seen them int they</i>, <i>int</i> emended to 
<i>in't</i>

<p>00434:  <i>Eubanks</i>:  the boxer's name is &quot;Chris Eubank&quot;, 
without -s; but it
seems likely that the speaker is mistaken about the name.
