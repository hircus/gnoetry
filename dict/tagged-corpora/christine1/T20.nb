<h1>Text T20</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KDA

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>29 Nov to ? Dec 1991

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Camberley, Surrey

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>at work, conversation

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Hugh079, m, 25, aircraft engineer, SE, C2
<li>Kurt080, m, 24, aircraft engineer, WA, C2
<li>Adrian081, m, 21, aircraft engineer, SE, C2

</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>BNC states that Hugh079 and Kurt080, and other speakers not represented in
the CHRISTINE extract, are colleagues.  It is obvious that Adrian081 is
also one of their colleagues, though his code is omitted from the BNC
statement.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>Hugh079 and Adrian081 are assigned the BNC 
&quot;Home Counties&quot; dialect code
applicable to Surrey.  Kurt080 is assigned the 
&quot;Wales&quot; code, and this diversity is plausible in the context 
of a professional workplace.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Hugh079 as C2 and leaves the others unclassified.  Their
occupation is SOC code 516, IIIM, so all should be C2.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>02791:  <i>you're you're own</i> emended to <i>your your own</i>

<p>02807:  BNC has <i>singer- songwriter</i> as separate words, 
but with the first
ending in a hyphen.  The term is a fixed phrase rather than
a productive combination, so CHRISTINE treats it as a single
hyphenated word.

<p>02871, 02873:  <i>hallo</i> emended to <i>hello</i>

<p>02893:  <i>go an see</i> emended to <i>go and see</i> 
(between two continuants at the same
place of articulation, presence or absence of [d] is barely
phonetically distinguishable, so even the spelling <i>an'</i> for
what the phrase obviously means would seem excessively pedantic)

<p>02900, 02909, 02936, 02937, 02952, 02957:  
<i>C D</i> emended to <i>CD</i>, <i>C D's</i> emended to <i>CDs</i> 
(compact disc[s])

<p>02952:  <i>thousand pounds worth</i> emended to <i>thousand pounds' worth</i>

<p>02963, 02964: <i>A M</i> emended to <i>AM</i>.  
(Seems to be used as a Citro&euml;n model
name.  At this period Citro&euml;n marketed an <i>AX</i> and an
<i>XM</i>; I cannot trace an <i>AM</i>, but the speaker may have been
confused between the two model names just cited.)

<p>02964:  <i>Citroen</i> emended to <i>Citro&euml;n</i>, twice 
(standard orthography for the
French car manufacturer)

<p>02970:  <i>A T Cobra</i> emended to <i>AC Cobra</i> 
(AC is believed to be the name of the
original manufacturing company)

<p>02972, 02984:  <i>jag</i> emended to <i>Jag</i> (short for <i>Jaguar</i>)

<p>02995:  <i>three eight</i> emended to <i>V eight</i> 
(with fricatives the audible difference
would be small; V-8 and V-12 are two kinds of high-performance
engine structure)

<p>02995:  <i>Chevvy</i> emended to <i>Chevy</i> 
(believed to be the more usual abbreviation
for <i>Chevrolet</i>)

<p>03019:  <i>your</i> emended to <i>you're</i>

<p>03024:  <i>M O T</i> emended to <i>MoT</i> 
(Ministry of Transport [scil. <i>test certificate</i>])

<p>03037, 03038:  <i>Rekcon</i> emended to <i>Reckon</i>
