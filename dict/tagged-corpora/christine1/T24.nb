<h1>Text T24</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KDN

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>15 to 17 Apr 1992

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Belfast

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>at home, watching TV and reading/conversation (div
045807, just &quot;conversation&quot;)

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Melvin092, m, 53, unemployed, IR, DE
<li>Jane093, f, 45, housewife, IR, DE
<li>Kaley094, f, 3, n/a, IR, DE
<li>Melvin095, m, 20, painter, IR, C2
</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Melvin092 and Jane093 are man and wife.
Melvin095 is their son.
Kaley094 is described in BNC as a neighbour of Melvin092.  (These two and a
third person not represented in the CHRISTINE extract, a window cleaner,
are all defined as neighbours; possibly Kaley094 is the daughter of the
window cleaner?)


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>The BNC coding states that all speakers in this file have Irish Gaelic as
their mother tongue.  Since they live in Belfast and all, including a
three-year-old, are shown as speaking fluent English in the transcriptions,
I find this unbelievable and take it for a political rather than linguistic
statement.  CHRISTINE classifies them all as English-speakers with dialect
code IR.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies all speakers DE except Melvin095 who is unclassified.  The
latter is SOC code 507, IIIM, so C2.
