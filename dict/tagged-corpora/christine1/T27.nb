<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>Thomas107 and Mark111 are given the Irish BNC dialect code.  No information
is shown for the others, but they show non-English dialect forms
(e.g. <i>that wee fly</i>, Anon108 at s-unit 03656, <i>oh aye</i>, Anon109 at
s-unit 03671), and it seems a safe bet to take them also as Irish.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Thomas107 as AB, leaves Mark111 unclassified, and gives no
information of any kind about the other speakers.  Mark111 is SOC code 179,
II, hence AB.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>03694:  <i>water skiing</i> emended to <i>water-skiing</i>

<p>03722:  <i>I T V</i> emended to <i>ITV</i> (Independent Television)

<p>03789, 03792  <i>McCloud</i>:  in Britain this would be an unusual spelling
of the Scottish surname commonly spelled MacLeod, Macleod; but
the BNC transcriber's spelling does occur in the USA, and the
reference here seems to be to a television programme, so that
spelling has been left to stand.

<p>03808:  <i>the big diddly diddly diddly bit</i>:  
each <i>diddly</i> is a separate
word in BNC, and this seems orthographically reasonable; 
the three US tags have not been united under a tagmatag. 

<p>03821:  <i>back issues</i> emended to <i>back issue's</i> 
(it is not clear what the speaker is
talking about, and <i>issue</i> may be a mishearing, but it seems
likely that the -s goes with the following <i>loosening</i> as
a present progressive)

<p>03861, 03865:  <i>A C theory</i> emended to <i>AC theory</i>.  
(<i>AC</i> could be 
<i>alternating current</i>, though I am not sure that this is 
taught as a separate &quot;theory&quot; in secondary-school physics.)

<p>03873:  two cases of <i>them</i> used for <i>those</i> 
(but wordtagged as standard
<i>them</i>) -- the first of these
cases could be <i>them</i> in its standard usage, but is seen as
opening an interrupted Np.

<p>03873:  <i>them topics worth</i> emended to <i>them topics' worth</i> 
(appears to be a
construction parallel to <i>five pounds' worth</i>)

<p>03873:  <i>you may be do</i> emended to <i>you maybe do</i> 
(the speaker might have
produced a nonstandard verb sequence, perhaps a reduced form
of <i>you may be doing</i>, but on the other hand the emendation yields
a piece of straightforward grammar)
