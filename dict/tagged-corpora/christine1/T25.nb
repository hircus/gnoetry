<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KDT
<p>There is a complication in the structure of this BNC file.  The list of
divisions in the file header identifies the body of the file as consisting
of three divisions numbered 075801, 075802, and 075901.  However, in
reality the file contains no division 075901.  After 075802 it contains a
series of divisions numbered 133401 and higher numbers.  The CHRISTINE
extract comprises div 075802 and several of the following divisions.  It
may be that the divisions with numbers beginning 133... are subdivisions of
what was at one stage in the corpus compilation a single div 075901, but
the finished corpus includes no explanation of the discrepancy.

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>2 to 3 Apr 1992

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>div 075802 was recorded at Driffield, and 075901 (? = 133401ff.?)
at Burton Fleming, both Yorks. E.R.

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>div 075802  in car, watching it rain and drinking tea
<li>div 075901 (? = 133401ff.?)  indoors, drinking tea/conversation
</ul>
<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Simon096, m, 34, self-employed general contractor, NO, DE
<li>Martin097, m, 33, gardener, NO, DE

</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Two colleagues.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>Both speakers are given the BNC dialect code applicable to Driffield.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Simon096 as C2 and Martin097 as DE.  However, they are
respectively SOC codes 594 and 896, both IV, so both DE.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>00114:  <i>gos</i> emended to <i>goes</i>

<p>00172:  in context, one wonders whether <i>are you speaking</i> should be 
amended to <i>are you speeding</i>, but in absence of sufficient evidence
no change has been made

<p>00174, 00179, 00180:  The BNC transcription has <i>Foxhalls</i> in the first
two and <i>Foxhall</i> in the third s-unit.  This is taken to be
a reference to Foxholes, a village about 8 miles S.W. of Filey
-- not far from the recording site, and the error is phonetically
plausible for a S.E. English transcriber listening to a
Yorkshire speaker.  The lack of -s in the transcription <i>Foxhall</i>
might suggest that the speaker produced a truncated word
<i>Foxhole-</i>, but this seems over-ingenious; CHRISTINE includes
the full name <i>Foxholes</i> in each case.

<p>00174:  <i>a Foxhalls</i> emended to <i>at Foxholes</i> 
(seems a reasonable guess to make
sense of the passage)

<p>00186:  <i>of his mother</i> emended to <i>off his mother</i> 
(cf. preceding wording)

<p>00207:  <i>Magistrate's Court</i> emended to <i>magistrates' court</i>

<p>00263:  <i>pick- up</i> emended to <i>pick-up</i>

<p>00297:  <i>brand new</i> emended to <i>brand-new</i>

<p>00305:  <i>isn't It</i> emended to <i>isn't it</i>

<p>00331:  <i>an all</i> emended to <i>an' all</i>

<p>00345:  <i>Rome</i> in <i>Rome and Juliet</i> 
may be a transcription error for 
<i>Romeo</i>, but alternatively the speaker may have mispronounced
the name so the BNC form stands in CHRISTINE.

<p>00355:  <i>Five Pounds</i> emended to <i>Five pounds</i>

<p>00359:  The original BNC file reads <i>I'm so convinced about</i>, 
but the 
context absolutely requires <i>not</i>; it seems easier to believe
that the transcriber omitted it accidentally than that it was
not uttered, so it has been inserted in CHRISTINE.
