<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>BNC assigns many turns to &quot;PS6U1&quot;, 
who is identified in the BNC header as
an individual whose details are unknown (although this is not a usual
BNC code for an unidentified speaker).
However, in the text it
appears that these turns are produced by more than one speaker, so
rather than ascribing them to &quot;AnonXXX&quot;, CHRISTINE ascribes them
to &quot;unid0&quot;.  (There is insufficient evidence to distinguish
&quot;unid1&quot;, &quot;unid2&quot;, etc.)

<p>03358:  <i>Jasper Carrott</i> emended to <i>Jasper Carrot</i>
(television comedian)

<p>03363:  <i>roll ups</i> emended to <i>roll-ups</i>

<p>03367:  <i>gold shield</i> emended to <i>Gold Shield</i> 
(presumed to be a brand name,
though we do not know what product it relates to)

<p>03449:  BNC has <i>Sam.</i>, with full stop 
not separated from preceding word.

<p>03484:  <i>ras man</i> emended to <i>Ras man</i> 
(<i>Ras</i> is taken to be an abbreviation
of <i>Rastafarian</i>)

<p>03495:  <i>school girls</i> emended to <i>schoolgirls</i>

<p>03518:  <i>rasta</i> emended to <i>Rasta</i>
