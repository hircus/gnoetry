dialect code.  No dialect
information is given for Jill136.

<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>03161:  BNC reads <i>I thought there was just of them 
downstairs</i>.  It
seems certain that the speaker intended <i>of them</i> to be attached
to a number, probably <i>two</i> (though the description of the 
m&eacute;nage is sufficiently complicated that the exact number 
intended is not completely obvious).  Without a number at this point, 
the utterance would be structurally very odd, and it is hard to see 
how the other speaker could respond with <i>There are</i> in 03162.  The 
most plausible explanation of the oddity is that the transcriber left
a word out, so <i>two</i> has been supplied in CHRISTINE.

<p>03178:  <i>french windows</i> emended to <i>French windows</i>

<p>03185, 03196 (three times):  <i>T V</i> emended to <i>TV</i>

<p>03211:  <i>braille</i> emended to <i>Braille</i> (<i>COD</i> 
capitalizes this word, as originally
a surname, even when used as a common noun).

<p>03243:  <i>W T coding</i> emended to <i>WT coding</i>.  
It is not clear what this refers to;
<i>WT</i> has been tagged NN1u on the offchance that it means
<i>wireless telegraphy</i>, but this seems unrelated to the context.
The whole phrase may well have been misunderstood by the
BNC transcriber.

<p>03260:  <i>campus</i> emended to <i>Campus</i> 
(believed to be the name of a clothes shop)
