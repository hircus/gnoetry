<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KC2

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>13 to 20 Mar 1992

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Rushden, Northants.

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>home, taking tea/playing games

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Alf038, m, 77, retired, MD, DE
<li>Beatrice039, f, 71, retired, MD, DE
<li>Jeffrey040, m, 37, office manager, MD, AB
<li>Jennifer041, f, 7, student, MD, AB
<li>Sadie042, f, 39, housewife, MD, AB
</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Alf038 and Beatrice039 are man and wife.
Jeffrey040 is their son.
Sadie042 is their daughter-in-law (BNC does not state that she is
Jeffrey040's wife).
Jennifer041 is granddaughter of Alf038 and Beatrice039 (BNC says nothing
about whose daughter she is).


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>All speakers are given the BNC dialect code for &quot;Northeast Midlands&quot;.
Rushden is 4 m. East of Wellingborough on the Northants./Beds. border,
close to Trudgill's chief English isogloss between 
&quot;North&quot; and &quot;South&quot;
dialects, and on Trudgill's map it falls on the southern side of that
isogloss, into the &quot;South Midlands&quot; 
rather than &quot;Northeast Midlands&quot; area.
Accordingly it might be more appropriate to give these speakers the
CHRISTINE code SE, but they have been given MD in line with the BNC coding.
(Note that another Rushden speaker in text T18 
has been given the &quot;South
Midlands&quot; BNC code; one would hope that the BNC compilers had a positive
reason for making this difference, though we do not know what it was.)


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Alf038 and Beatrice039 as DE and leaves others unclassified.
Jeffrey040's occupation is SOC code 139, II, therefore AB.  Sadie042 and
Jennifer041 are also classified AB in CHRISTINE on the assumption that they
are Jeffrey040's wife and daughter (this is not stated in the BNC file
header, but Jennifer041 calls Jeffrey040 &quot;dad&quot; in source-unit 01875).


<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>01946:  <i>Who's</i> emended to <i>Whose</i>

<p>01980:  <i>penguin</i> emended to <i>Penguin</i> (trade name of a chocolate bar)

<p>02097:  <i>Little red head</i> emended to <i>Little redhead</i>

<p>02130:  <i>Cotswold news</i> emended to <i>Cotswold News</i>.  
This phrase is taken to be the
name of a local newspaper -- the wording could make sense if the
speaker had a copy of a paper containing a coupon for a 
supermarket promotional offer.  However, there are problems with
this reading.  <i>Willings Press Guide</i>, vol. 1: United Kingdom, 
for 1997 lists several papers with <i>Cotswold</i> in the title but
no <i>Cotswold News</i>.  Furthermore, Rushden, Northants., where the
recording took place and where the speakers were based, is quite
distant from the circulation area of any newspaper based on
the Cotswolds.

<p>02139:  <i>cheddar</i> emended to <i>Cheddar</i>

<p>02141:  <i>know</i> emended to <i>now</i>:  near-homonym, 
and the substitution is needed to make
sense in context

<p>01879-81:  <i>I don't no where</i> emended to <i>I don't know where</i>

<i>Colonel Mustard</i>)
