<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KSS

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>2 to 8 Apr 1992

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>South Shields

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>home, conversation

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Joyce142, f, 53, housewife, MD, DE
<li>Maurice143, m, 45, unemployed, NO, DE
<li>Sally144, f, 72, Salvation Army, NO, XX
<li>Oscar145, m, 75, Salvation Army, NO, XX
</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Oscar145 and Sally144 appear to be man and wife; this is not stated
explicitly in the BNC file header, but Joyce142 is identified as
daughter-in-law of both.
Maurice143 and Joyce142 are man and wife.
From the above it seems to follow that Maurice143 
is likely to be a son of
the older couple, but again this is not stated.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>The BNC dialect codes assign Joyce142 
the &quot;Northwest Midlands&quot; code,
i.e. the Derby/Stoke/Chester/Manchester area.  
To Maurice143 and Sally144
they assign a code translated simply as &quot;Lancashire&quot;, 
which is not itself
one of the Trudgill area codes; different parts of 
Lancashire fall into
four of Trudgill's sixteen English dialect areas, 
on both sides of the
cruder CHRISTINE NO/MD boundary.  
Since the BNC Manual gives no special
code corresponding to Trudgill's &quot;Central Lancashire&quot; 
area, I have taken
&quot;Lancashire&quot; to refer to this and have accordingly 
classified these two
speakers as NO (but, alternatively, the BNC information may mean that the
non-expert respondent identified these speakers vaguely as having
&quot;Lancashire accents&quot;, in which case there would be 
no basis for assigning a
CHRISTINE dialect classification).  
Oscar145 is given the BNC code for
&quot;northern England&quot;.  
None of the speakers is given the specific BNC code
applicable to the South Shields area.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Joyce142 and Maurice143 as DE, 
and leaves the older speakers
unclassified.  There are no grounds for altering these codes.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>04853:  After <i>whatever it is</i>, BNC has a full stop 
attached to <i>is</i>, not
split off as a separate &quot;word&quot;.  As a result, 
it has allotted a
single s-unit number to what by its own standards would normally
be two s-units.

<p>04878ff.:  <i>vol au vent(s)</i> emended to <i>vol-au-vent(s)</i>

<p>04912:  <i>ready made</i> emended to <i>ready-made</i>

<p>04921-2:  The phonetic transcription [gleIs]
replaces a BNC transcription <i>glace</i> accompanied by an event entity
identifying this word as having been pronounced 
as &quot;glaice&quot;.  In
04922 the transcription <i>glace</i> is given no such annotation,
so CHRISTINE assumes it was pronounced in the standard way and
gives it the standard spelling <i>glac&eacute;</i>.

<p>04925:  <i>wood'un</i> emended to <i>wood 'un</i>

<p>04947:  BNC has <i>farce.</i> as one word, with the full stop 
not split off as
a separate unit.  In consequence, the BNC s-unit numbering treats
as a single s-unit what by its own standards would normally be two.

<p>04955:  In <i>But by when I</i>, 
the word <i>by</i> is taken to be the Northern English
exclamation representing surprise/annoyance, and is wordtagged UX
(the speaker, Sally144, is registered as Lancashire dialect).

<p>04979:  <i>up to top of &lt;address&gt;'s</i>:  in the BNC file, 
the anonymization
process has introduced a spurious space before the apostrophe.

<p>04989:  BNC has <i>wents</i>, marked &quot;sic&quot;, 
where the expected word would be
<i>went</i> (<i>so she wents into town</i>).  The speaker, Maurice143, is
registered as Lancashire dialect, so the form <i>wents</i> is
taken to represent <i>went</i> with the final affrication characteristic
of Liverpool speech, rather than being morphologically nonstandard;
it is shown as <i>went</i> in CHRISTINE.
