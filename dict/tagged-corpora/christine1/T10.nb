<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>All speakers other than Jill044 are a group of colleagues.
Jill044 is the fianc&eacute;e of Fergus043.

<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>These speakers are assigned a variety of BNC dialect codes, which is
plausible for people working in a Birmingham press agency.  Fergus043 is
given the Merseyside code; Jill044 the code for &quot;Central North&quot;;
Nicholas047 the code for &quot;Central Midlands&quot;; 
and the other three are given
a code which the BNC Manual translates as &quot;Midlands&quot; 
-- this is not one of
the Trudgill dialect areas, but perhaps had to be used because the BNC
respondent gave no more exact information.  All these codes translate
unambiguously into the coarser CHRISTINE classification.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Fergus043 as C1 (agreeing with his SOC code 386, IIIN), and
Jill044 and Michael045 as DE; others are unclassified.  
But &quot;journalist&quot; is
SOC code 380, II, so these four speakers are classified AB, overriding the
BNC classification; and &quot;sales assistant&quot; is SOC code 720, IIIN.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>
This text, recorded in an office, contains many instances of speakers
talking into telephones, and switching between telephone
conversation and conversation with one another in the office.
These are noted in the BNC files with <tt>&lt;event&gt;</tt> elements
&quot;telephone conversation starts&quot;, &quot;telephone 
conversation ends&quot;,
which in CHRISTINE are represented by <tt>{onTelephone}</tt> vocalization
switches; however, after s-unit 01086, the pattern of
&quot;starts/ends&quot; elements in the BNC file ceases to make sense.
(Up to that point each &quot;telephone conversation starts&quot; is
balanced by a later &quot;telephone conversation ends&quot;, and the
nature of the wording makes these shift elements plausible.)

<p>According to the BNC file, Fergus043 starts talking on the
phone at the beginning of s-unit 01091 (which is clearly correct),
but no &quot;ends&quot; element is ever shown.  
Geoff048 is shown as starting
on the phone at the beginning of s-unit 01097 (though the
following words read more like interaction with Fergus).
The next switch is given as Geoff coming off the phone at
the end of s-unit 01103, but this is separated by two other
speaker-turns from s-unit 01097; from the wording, one would
guess that only s-unit 01103 itself was said into the phone,
though this would be concluding a conversation that does not
seem to link to anything said earlier by Geoff.
Fergus's s-unit 01105 is clearly spoken on the phone; the s-unit
ends in BNC with a <tt>&lt;shift&gt;</tt> element, which normally serves to
close a vocalization shift introduced with a <tt>&lt;vocal new ...&gt;</tt>
element (however, in this case there has been no such element);
presumably it is being used to show Fergus coming off the phone.
Geoff is shown as starting on the phone at the beginning of
s-unit 01114 (from the wording this might or might not be
right); no corresponding end shift is given, but if this 
material is said on the phone the shift would presumably occur
at the end of his turn, i.e. the end of s-unit 01116.  Fergus
is shown as starting telephone conversation at the beginning
of s-unit 01117, which again is possibly but not obviously true
from the nature of the wording (earlier, he was telling Geoff
about the Old Wine Shop, and this seems to be filling in
details about that); no end shift is given.

<p>The situation is so unclear that it might have been best to
eliminate all telephone shift elements in the latter part of
text T10, on the ground that it is better for the corpus to
make no statement than a misleading statement.  However, the
eventual decision for CHRISTINE was to include these
elements, making the minimum changes to the contents of the
BNC original which produce a possibly-correct scenario.
Specifically, we show Fergus as speaking on the telephone
continuously from the beginning of his s-unit 01901 to the end
of 01105; we show Geoff speaking on the phone continuously
from the beginning of his s-unit 01097 to the end of 01103;
and we show Geoff's and Fergus's <tt>{onTelephone}</tt> start shifts
at the beginning of their s-units 01114 and 01117 respectively
as continuing to the end of the respective speaker turns.
(CHRISTINE includes YVL and YVR shifts separately for each
turn even when successive turns by one speaker all appear to
be part of the same telephone conversation.)  Users should note
that it is not at all clear whether this analysis of the
shifts on and off the phone is correct; the telephone shifts
are particularly suspect in Geoff's case.



<p>00820:  <i>T S B</i> emended to <i>TSB</i> (Trustee Savings Bank)

<p>00829:  One may conjecture that <i>There were three hundred ... </i> should
read <i>They were ... </i>, which would seem more idiomatic; but
the text as transcribed in BNC is understandable, so it has not
been altered.

<p>00835:  <i>a lie in</i> emended to <i>a lie-in</i>

<p>00836:  <i>is a {pause} ten pounds</i> emended to <i>is er {pause} 
ten pounds</i> (homonym, 
and seems more likely)

<p>00839:  <i>it's a hundred one</i> emended to <i>it's a hundred won</i> 
(homonym, makes better
sense in context)

<p>00869:  <i>Crufts</i> (claimed to be the world's greatest dog show) 
is standardly
spelled without an apostrophe, although named after Charles Cruft.
By the rule for using the wordtag NP2s, the word is tagged with
that tag.

<p>00888ff.:  The name <i>Dessy</i> appears consistently in that spelling in the
BNC file, suggesting a pronunciation [desi].
I suspect that this may be an abbreviated form of the name
of the famous racehorse Desert Song, in which case the
pronunciation would have been [dezi] (but I have not been able
to check whether the date makes this plausible).

<p>00904:  <i>Heralds</i> emended to <i>Herald's</i> (the reference 
is rather obscure, but it 
seems to relate to something belonging to a newspaper, rather than
to multiple newspapers)

<p>00932, 00990:  <i>post</i> emended to <i>Post</i> 
(evidently a reference to a newspaper)

<p>00948-9 and 00952 are clearly parts of one continuous utterance, but in BNC
the former is ascribed to 
an unidentified speaker, the latter to Fergus043.
In CHRISTINE the full turn is ascribed to Fergus043.

<p>00956:  <i>He should o he should a, he should have been</i> 
emended to <i>He shoulda
he shoulda, he should have been</i>

<p>00970:  <i>What with that Pierce doing</i> emended to 
<i>What were that Pierce doing</i>
(near-identical pronunciation and makes much better sense.  Speaker
is not identified, but in this text speakers are from either
North or Midlands, which would make this grammar plausible.)

<p>01014:	<i>the kids</i> emended to <i>the kids'</i> (i.e. it wasn't theirs).
Since the apostrophe is a separate CHRISTINE &quot;word&quot; corresponding
to nothing in the BNC file, it is assigned a zero source location code.

<p>01029:  BNC has the utterance as <i>tel;</i>.  
We conjecture that this represents
the speaker answering the phone by stating his number.

<p>01049, 01086:  <i>bye bye</i> emended to <i>bye-bye</i>

<p>01081:  <i>hallo</i> emended to <i>hello</i>
