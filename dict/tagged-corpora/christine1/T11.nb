<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>All speakers are given the Welsh BNC dialect code.  Llanbradach is in fact
on the border between Glamorganshire and Monmouthshire, the latter county
historically having belonged politically to England though it was recently
transferred to Wales; but linguistically West Monmouthshire is probably
closer to Wales than to S.W. England, and Llanbradach communicates with
Glamorganshire rather than eastwards.  (For what it is worth, several
of the speakers have distinctively Scottish -- rather than Welsh --
Christian names, a fact which is reflected in their <i>noms de corpus</i>.)


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>All speakers are classified DE in BNC, and there is no evidence
contradicting that.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>02543:  BNC attributes this s-unit to Jackie050, which would mean that she is
interrupting herself.  The minimal change that seems to make good
sense of the dialogue is to change the attribution of 02541/2/5
to Donald049.

<p>02565:  <i>Just</i> emended to <i>just</i>

<p>02751:  In the construction <i>with anything in</i>, which from the
perspective of standard British English is not perceived as a reduction
of <i>with anything in it</i>, the word <i>in</i> is analysed as an
adverb and an R phrase, rather than as a preposition with a missing
complement.  (I understand that this construction does not occur in
American English.)

<p>02578:  A series of turns which seem to be responding to one another are all
attributed in BNC to Donald049.  The minimal change that makes sense
seems to be to change the attribution of 02580 to Tracey051.

<p>02616:  <i>Mrs</i> emended to <i>missis</i> 
(<i>COD</i> preferred spelling for nonstandard use
of this form other than as prefix to a proper name)

<p>02653:  The BNC text here makes so little sense that it is likely to be
mistranscribed, however no emendation suggests itself so it has
been left to stand.

<p>02655:  <i>an helicopter</i> looks odd from the perspective of standard English,
but since most regional dialects lose [h], probably <i>an</i> stands
before a vowel in the spoken text.

<p>02710:  <i>teachers name</i> emended to <i>teacher's name</i>

<p>02809:  <i>You</i> emended to <i>you</i>
