<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>00019:  <i>Glowworm</i> emended to <i>Glow-worm</i> (twice)

<p>00027, 00029, 00033:  <i>sleeping bag</i> 
emended to <i>sleeping-bag</i>

<p>00046, 00053:  <i>P E</i> emended to <i>PE</i> (Physical Education)

<p>00048:  <i>realised</i> emended to <i>realized</i>

<p>00055:  <i>gov.</i> emended to <i>guv</i> 
(conventional spelling of vocative abbreviation
of <i>governor</i>)

<p>00103:  <i>Guns 'n Roses</i> emended to <i>Guns n' Roses</i>.  
(This seems to be the usual
spelling of this pop group name, with the word <i>and</i> represented
by n-apostrophe, preceded and commonly followed by a space.)

<p>00105, 00110, 00111:  <i>criticise</i>, <i>criticising</i> 
emended to <i>criticize</i>, <i>criticizing</i>

<p>00171:  In the BNC file, the opening vocalization shift 
before the last word
is never followed by a closing shift.  CHRISTINE supplies
this at the end of the s-unit, where it must apply.

<p>00210:  In the BNC file the s-unit begins with two adjacent 
opening vocalization
shifts, for singing and for shouting, separated by a comma,
and ends with a single
unlabelled closing shift.  This does not seem to make sense,
so CHRISTINE assumes that what was intended was an independent
<tt>{singing}</tt> element 
followed by a <tt>{shouting}</tt> shift lasting over
the intermediate <tt>{unclear}</tt> element.

<p>00228:  <i>is isn't</i> emended to <i>it isn't</i> 
(easier to see as a transcription slip than
as what was actually said)

<p>00230:  <i>lunch time</i> emended to <i>lunch-time</i>

<p>00248:  <i>Lindzi</i> emended to <i>Lindsey</i> 
(a more normal spelling of the girl's
Christian name pronounced this way)

<p>00249:  <i>Kari</i>:  <i>sic</i> in BNC.  
Again one suspects that the girl referred
to may actually have been <i>Carrie</i>, but <i>Kari</i> could be a
correctly-spelled name of Continental origin, and might even
be pronounced with a vowel distinguishing it from <i>Carrie</i>.

<p>00249:  <i>Kari's in.</i>:  in the BNC file, 
the full stop has been left
as part of the word <i>in.</i> rather than treated as a separate
punctuation mark; CHRISTINE separates it.
