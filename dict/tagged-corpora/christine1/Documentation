<p>
In the past, the SUSANNE Corpus and other language-engineering resources
produced by my research team have been scattered at different internet
locations not all under my control, and they have more than once been shifted
to new addresses without notification to me.  I apologize to users for
the frustrations this has sometimes caused.  To avoid such problems in
future, I have acquired my own internet domain, which I intend to 
maintain indefinitely.  My Web home page, which is about to move to:
<blockquote><p>
	<tt>http://www.grsampson.net/</tt>
</p></blockquote>
will from now on always include a pointer to a list of the current locations of
the SUSANNE Corpus and other research resources produced under my
direction; as soon as practical, those resources will themselves be
shifted into the <tt>grsampson.net</tt> domain, where (D.V.) they will not be 
moved again.

<h2>Version Information</h2>

<p>
<b>Release 2</b> differs from Release 1 in that &quot;ghost&quot;
elements in the structural analysis, representing the logical
placing of elements which have been deleted or moved into a
different clause in surface structure, are shown as labelled
brackets in the parse field rather than as items in the word field.
(Lines for ghosts in Release 2 have a hyphen in the word field.)
This brings the analytic formalism of the CHRISTINE Corpus into
closer conformity with that of the SUSANNE Corpus, and makes
the files less confusing for human readers.

<p>
<b>Release 1</b> was completed on 29 July 1999.

<H2>
1. Introduction</H2>
Stage I of the CHRISTINE Corpus of structurally-annotated spoken English
("CHRISTINE/I") contains one part of the whole CHRISTINE Corpus (which
is due to be completed in the year 2000). The material in Stage I is based
on extracts from the "demographically-sampled" speech section of the British
National Corpus. It therefore forms a suitable resource for studying
grammatical
and other structural features in the spontaneous, informal usage of a
cross-section
of speakers drawn from all social classes and regions of the United Kingdom
in the 1990s.

<P>The CHRISTINE Corpus conforms to relevant recommendations of the EAGLES
(Expert Advisory Group on Language Engineering Standards) Spoken Language
Working Group (Gibbon et al. 1997), as well as to preferences expressed
by an international group of more than thirty experts consulted via the
Internet at the beginning of the project which created it.

<P>The CHRISTINE project has been sponsored since 1996 by the Economic
and Social Research Council (UK), as a successor to the project which produced
the SUSANNE analytic scheme and Corpus.[1]&nbsp;&nbsp; The main aim of
both SUSANNE and CHRISTINE projects has been to develop detailed,
comprehensive,
and explicit standards for annotating the structural properties of samples
of English language as used in real life. Such standards can be developed
only by applying an annotation scheme to language samples and refining
it in response to problematic cases; so the work yields, as a valuable
by-product, corpora, or "treebanks", annotated in accordance with the scheme.

<P>(The term "treebank" is now accepted internationally to describe a
natural-language
sample equipped with annotations representing grammatical structure.&nbsp;
I believe the term was first coined by my colleague Geoffrey Leech of the
University of Lancaster, in connexion with the treebank for whose creation
at Lancaster I took responsibility in 1983 and which is described in Garside
et al. (1987: ch. 7).&nbsp; The SUSANNE and CHRISTINE analytic scheme,
though considerably more sophisticated, is the lineal descendant of the
scheme developed by Leech and myself in the early 1980s.)[2]

<P>The SUSANNE project focused chiefly on written language. It produced
the structurally-annotated SUSANNE Corpus of written (American) English,
published in 1992, together with a 500-page book, Sampson (1995) (referred
to below as <I>EFC</I>), which defined the annotation scheme. The scheme
has been winning a measure of international recognition; for instance,
D. Terence Langendoen, President of the Linguistic Society of America,
comments that "the detail ... is unrivalled" (Langendoen 1997: 600).

<P>The CHRISTINE project is extending this work to the domain of spoken
English. Much of the notational apparatus defined in <I>English for the
Computer</I> applies equally to spoken or to written English. Chapter 6
of that book proposed additional notations to deal with the special structural
features of spoken language, such as the speech-repair structures produced
when a speaker edits his wording "on the fly". The CHRISTINE project is
testing and refining the scheme which includes these extensions, by applying
it to a range of samples of recorded speech from a variety of sources.
The material in CHRISTINE/I comprises the first part of the CHRISTINE Corpus
to have been brought to a state suitable for public distribution. (The
full CHRISTINE Corpus will include 66 further passages, drawn from the
London-Lund and the Reading Emotional Speech Corpora as well as additional
excerpts from BNC.)

<P>By now, the SUSANNE Corpus is in use in research institutions in many
parts of the world, and numerous research publications have been based
on it. It was not the first and is by far not the largest annotated corpus
to have been published, but for some research purposes it has proved specially
useful. Users have commented, for instance, on the unusual richness and
precision of its annotations. The CHRISTINE Corpus is not the first
structurally-analysed
corpus of spoken English.&nbsp; For American English there is, for instance,
the (specialized) Switchboard Corpus (Meteer et al. 1995); for British
English the ICE Corpus (<TT>www.ucl.ac.uk/english-usage/ice-gb/</TT>) pipped
us to the post by several months.&nbsp; But CHRISTINE has several virtues:
<UL>
<LI>
social representativeness</LI>

<LI>
use of the same analytic scheme as the well-established SUSANNE Corpus</LI>

<LI>
a format designed to be as "transparent" as possible for nontechnical
users</LI>
</UL>
which may give it a special value in some research contexts.

<P>CHRISTINE/I undoubtedly contains errors. I should be very grateful to
be notified of any errors discovered by users (via e-mail to the address
above), so that these can be eliminated when the full Corpus is released.
Any such help will be publicly acknowledged.

<P>More information on CHRISTINE and SUSANNE projects and Corpora is available
on the World Wide Web: visit my home page at <TT>www.grs.u-net.com</TT>
and follow the respective links.

<P>The CHRISTINE web page includes details of the research team, but it
is proper to acknowledge them by name here. Any value the CHRISTINE Corpus
may have is largely due to the dedicated hard work of Alan Morris and Anna
Rahman. The first-person pronoun is used in the documentation files, because
these are largely concerned with debatable points on which the Principal
Investigator necessarily took the final decision; but this should not detract
from the credit due to other members of the team.

<P>The electronic files comprising Stage I of the CHRISTINE Corpus may
be copied freely by anyone and used for any purpose. The Economic and Social
Research Council, as sponsoring agency, and the University of Sussex as
the contracting institution would undoubtedly appreciate acknowledgments
in any publications which emerge from research using the CHRISTINE Corpus.
<H2>
2. The British National Corpus</H2>
The British National Corpus is an electronic resource intended to supply
empirical data on the English language as "produced" (that is, spoken and
written) and "received" (heard and read) in Britain in the 1990s.[3] The
BNC was created by a consortium comprising the publishers Oxford University
Press, Longman, and Chambers Harrap, Oxford and Lancaster Universities,
and the British Library; the chief sponsors were the Department of Trade
and Industry and the Science and Engineering Research Council (now Engineering
and Physical Science Research Council). Release 1.0 of the BNC was circulated
in 1995 and is documented in Burnard (1995) -- this book is referred to
below as the BNC <I>Manual</I>.

<P>The BNC contains 4124 language samples comprising 100 million words
in all. Of this, about 10% -- ten million words -- is transcribed speech
(the remainder being published and unpublished written material). The spoken
part of the Corpus is divided into two parts:
<UL>
<LI>
a <I>demographically-sampled</I> part (about four million words)</LI>

<LI>
and a <I>context-governed</I> part (about six million words)</LI>
</UL>
I shall use the abbreviations "BNC/speech", "BNC/demographic", and
"BNC/context-governed"
to refer to the spoken part of the BNC Corpus and its subparts. In essence,
BNC/demographic is a sampling of the spoken interactions engaged in by
a cross-section of the British population over a given period; the
overwhelming
majority of these are informal conversation, so BNC/context-governed samples
speech-events on the basis of genre rather than on the basis of speakers'
social characteristics, in order to achieve coverage of other speech genres.

<P>The material in CHRISTINE/I is drawn wholly from BNC/demographic. (The
full CHRISTINE Corpus will include material from BNC/context-governed,
as well as from sources other than the BNC.) For BNC/demographic, 153
individuals
were recruited in such a way as to give, so far as possible:
<UL>
<LI>
equal numbers of males and females</LI>

<LI>
equal numbers from each of six age-bands</LI>

<LI>
equal numbers from each of four social-class categories</LI>

<LI>
representation of all geographical regions of the UK[4]</LI>
</UL>
Inevitably, practical difficulties prevented this intended distribution
from being realized perfectly, but a reasonable approximation was achieved.
(Detailed figures are given in the BNC <I>Manual</I>, p. 20. The <I>Manual</I>
acknowledges that 153 respondents are fewer than ideal, but resource
constraints
forbade a substantially larger sampling.)

<P>The recruits -- in BNC terminology, "respondents" -- were provided with
tape recorders and asked to record all speech events in which they took
part over a period comprising at least two different days of the week,
thus achieving a mixture of weekdays and weekends. As well as returning
the recordings, respondents also supplied logs which were intended to include
demographic descriptions of other participants in the conversations (though,
as we shall see below, this proved to be an area of severe weakness in
the system).

<P>BNC/demographic comprises 153 files, one for each respondent's recordings;
the average wordage in a single respondent's file is about 27,500 words,
though there is considerable variation round this mean.

<P>The recordings were transcribed using conventional orthography, with
ordinary punctuation, sentence-initial capitalization, etc. (My understanding
is that this work was done by clerical employees of the Longman Group,
based at Harlow, Essex, though this is not stated in the <I>Manual</I>
and may be incorrect.&nbsp; If it is correct, then the variety of English
familiar to the transcribers is likely to have been fairly close in
pronunciation
to RP -- "Received Pronunciation", the national standard; a number of oddities
of transcription are understandable if distant regional dialects were being
filtered through ears attuned to RP.) The Corpus as released comprises
these transcriptions encoded into an SGML-based file structure, including
various analytic annotations (e.g. wordtags) produced semi-automatically
by the consortium researchers. (The CHRISTINE Corpus ignores the BNC
annotations;
we applied our own much more detailed annotation scheme manually to a subset
of BNC/demographic, so that only the actual words uttered are common to
the two corpora.)

<P>It should be said that BNC/speech, though unrivalled as a cross-sectional
sampling of contemporary British speech, is not an ideal research resource
in every respect.&nbsp; The sound recordings are so far not available to
researchers (though this may change); in any case, having been made in
"field conditions", the recordings were clearly often of poor quality by
the standards of lab-based speech research, which was quite inevitable.&nbsp;
Furthermore, the standards of transcription often leave something to be
desired (many transcriber errors are discussed in the notes files for the
individual texts).&nbsp; The full CHRISTINE Corpus will include material
from other sources of transcribed speech.&nbsp; These other sources have
their own virtues (the Reading Emotional Speech Corpus is available as
digitized sound signals, the London-Lund Corpus is transcribed to a very
high standard of accuracy); conversely, neither of them can claim to be
representative of the national population in the way that BNC/demographic
is.&nbsp; At present, there is simply no resource available which combines
all desirable properties, so our strategy has been to take samples from
a range of sources.
<H2>
3. The Contents of Stage I</H2>

<H3>
3.1&nbsp; The Nature of the Resource</H3>
CHRISTINE/I comprises structural annotations of forty passages excerpted
from the BNC/demographic files. Altogether 147 identified speakers are
represented in CHRISTINE/I (there is also a good deal of speech by
unidentified
speakers).

<P>Rather than the SGML format used in the original BNC files, CHRISTINE
uses a one-word-per-line fixed-field format, similar to that of the SUSANNE
Corpus. This is in accordance with preferences expressed by the experts
consulted at the outset of the project. Because the field structure of
CHRISTINE is very simple, it would be a trivial matter for anyone whose
application requires an SGML-structured data resource to convert CHRISTINE
into such, given a suitable DTD (Document Type Definition). For the many
users who have no such requirement, the existing format is both more
transparent
and far more computationally tractable.

<P>Use of SGML for a data resource with such a simple structure as the
CHRISTINE Corpus is arguably a negative factor, because it creates many
possibilities of inadvertently introducing meaningless coding
distinctions.&nbsp;
We have encountered several cases of this in Release 1.0 of BNC:
<UL>
<LI>
A clear example occurs in the sample extract from the BNC Corpus displayed
on p. 47 of the BNC <I>Manual</I>, where entities representing silent pauses
are placed in one case before a wordtag/word pair, but in another case
between a word and its wordtag.</LI>

<LI>
Another type of case occurs in the BNC file section corresponding to CHRISTINE
source-unit T06.00393:&nbsp; a truncated word <I>ab</I> has an SGML
<TT>&lt;trunc></TT>
tag within a <TT>&lt;w></TT> tag, whereas elsewhere <TT>&lt;trunc></TT>
nodes normally dominate <TT>&lt;w></TT> nodes</LI>

<LI>
At the BNC file locations corresponding to CHRISTINE source-units T02.03898
and T14.05045, <TT>&lt;gap></TT> tags, inserted for anonymization purposes,
occur within <TT>&lt;w></TT> tags, whereas elsewhere <TT>&lt;gap></TT>
tags are sisters rather than daughters of <TT>&lt;w></TT> tags.</LI>
</UL>
In each of these cases, the coding distinction seems to represent no real
difference in what is being said about the structure of the relevant
utterance.[5]

<P>(Here and below, examples from the CHRISTINE Corpus are given a location
reference in the form "T12.34567", meaning "text T12, source-unit 34567"
-- for "source-units", see &sect;6.2.&nbsp; Examples are quoted with the
punctuation and capitalization provided by the BNC transcribers, where
this is helpful for understanding the structure of the utterance.&nbsp;
Some examples quoted in the present document are taken from parts of the
full CHRISTINE Corpus that are not included in CHRISTINE/I.)

<P>The 40 CHRISTINE/I passages or "texts" are similar to one another in
length, and the length was selected so as to be broadly comparable with
the texts in the Brown, LOB, and SUSANNE Corpora of written English. The
latter corpora were designed so that each text contains 2000 words, plus
a few more as needed to make each text-end coincide with a sentence boundary.
This rule is not directly applicable to a corpus of spontaneous speech,
for one thing because the concept "sentence" does not apply straightforwardly
to the spoken language, but also because transcribed speech contains many
items -- ums and ers, failed partial attempts at uttering words, markers
showing that different speakers' utterances were simultaneous, headers
identifying speaker turns, records of "noises off", pauses, etc. -- which
are not comparable to written words. For some sample passages from the
demographically-sampled BNC speech corpus, having converted them from the
original SGML format into a fixed-field format I determined the average
ratio of lines to ordinary spoken words to be about 1.46:1.[6] This ratio
would imply excerpts of about 2930 lines to get 2000 "real words". However,
the items other than words are themselves scientifically-interesting data
items, though they seem individually less "weighty" than real spoken words.
Consequently I chose 2800 lines as a target text length, as a compromise
between 2930 and 2000.

<P>Because the boundaries of excerpts from BNC were chosen to coincide
with natural breaks in the speech stream, as discussed below, most excerpts
in practice are longer than 2800 lines. The CHRISTINE/I texts as published
contain about 112,000 lines in total, corresponding to about 80,500 "full
words", ignoring hesitation phenomena, etc.

<P>My research team has worked on the principle that the task of those
who compile natural-language corpora is to represent the properties of
language samples in a clear, explicit fashion that creates the fewest possible
hurdles for researchers who wish to extract data from a corpus. We do not
see it as part of our task to produce software for data extraction. We
could not do that, since we have no way of knowing what sorts of questions
future researchers will want to pose to our data. (SUSANNE has been used
for various kinds of research that I had no thought of when I put it into
circulation.) This point seems worth making, because since the publication
of SUSANNE I have more than once encountered comments suggesting that,
in failing to supply accompanying utility software, we left a job half
done. In response, let me quote remarks I made in a recent book review
(Sampson 1998: 365) about the approach which sees utility software as an
essential accompaniment to corpus data:
<BLOCKQUOTE>It is hard to see this as a wise policy for allocating scarce
research resources. In practice there are usually two possibilities when
one wants to exploit corpus data. Often, one wants to put very obvious
and simple questions to the corpus; in that case, it is usually possible
to get answers via general-purpose Unix commands like grep and wc, avoiding
the overhead of learning special-purpose software. Sometimes, the questions
one wants to put are original and un-obvious; in those cases, the developer
of a corpus utility is unlikely to have anticipated that anyone might want
to ask them, so one has to write one's own program to extract the information.
No doubt there are intermediate cases where a corpus utility will do the
job and grep will not. I am not convinced that these cases are common enough
to justify learning to use such software, let alone writing it.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
3.2&nbsp; Choice of Extracts</H3>
Forty of the BNC/demographic files were chosen at random to serve as sources
of excerpts for CHRISTINE/I. In order to explain how 2800-line excerpts
were selected from these files, it is necessary to explain something of
the internal structuring imposed by the BNC compilers on their
demographically-sampled
speech files.

<P>These files are hierarchically structured into units delimited by SGML
tags <TT>&lt;div></TT>, <TT>&lt;u></TT>, and <TT>&lt;s></TT>. The
<TT>&lt;div></TT>
(division) unit corresponds, at least nominally, to a recording of an
individual
conversation. (In practice <TT>&lt;div></TT> breaks sometimes interrupt
what appear to be single conversations; so far as I have seen, the BNC
<I>Manual</I> does not explain how <TT>&lt;div></TT> boundaries were decided.)
The <TT>&lt;u></TT> and <TT>&lt;s></TT> ("utterance" and "segment") units
are intended to correspond to speaker turns, and to individual sentences.
Again, in practice these units are often of questionable scientific
significance.
A speaker's output is frequently split in BNC into separate <TT>&lt;u></TT>
units merely because another participant interjects a brief remark (perhaps
no more than a reassuring <I>mm</I>) in the middle of what is from all
other points of view a single continuous speech-turn. And, although the
BNC transcribers set out their transcriptions in the form of sentences,
beginning with capital letters and ending with full stops or equivalent
punctuation, the grammatical concept "sentence" is often inapplicable to
the wording of spontaneous speech, which contains many sequences of wording
that do not fit into conventional ideas of sentence structure.

<P>Within each of the 40 randomly-selected BNC/demographic files, I used
a random-number generator to select a line in the reformatted version of
the file between the first line and the line 2800 short of the last line.
I then began the excerpt at a <TT>&lt;div></TT> boundary close to this
randomly-chosen line, if there was one, and continued to the first
<TT>&lt;u></TT>
boundary at least 2800 lines later. If no <TT>&lt;div></TT> boundary occurred
near the randomly-chosen line, I began at a <TT>&lt;u></TT> boundary (and,
if the 2800th line was close to a <TT>&lt;div></TT> boundary, I adjusted
the excerpt to end there); furthermore, if a BNC <TT>&lt;u></TT> boundary
did not appear to represent a natural break in the dialogue structure,
I continued to a "better" <TT>&lt;u></TT> boundary. In general, I allowed
myself considerable latitude in ranging forward or back from the
randomly-chosen
line to find a natural break which led to another natural break roughly
2800 lines later. There was no element of planning in terms of selecting
"interesting" or "representative" excerpts from the BNC files; but I treated
the aim of finding excerpts with reasonably natural boundaries as a higher
priority than making the excerpt boundaries mechanically random, in the
sense of being wholly determined by randomizing techniques with no excercise
of discretion.

<P>As it turned out, the extracts selected in this way included a minority
of cases where the BNC header file gave little or no descriptive information
about the speakers, or where a high proportion of speaker turns were not
attributed to any identified speaker. This is unfortunate, for purposes
of studying who says what in modern Britain, and one possibility would
have been to discard those extracts and find other extracts for which
information
was more complete. But this would probably have skewed the sample. It is
surely to be expected, for instance, that less detailed identification
of speakers will happen for a recording of teenagers "hanging out" in a
city street than for a recording made in a middle-aged couple's living-room.
The chief aim of the project was to produce a representative sample of
modern British usage, so we refrained from "improving" on the outcome of
the random selection process, and we accepted some gaps in the speaker
information as a price to be paid for representativeness.

<P>In 1999, the BNC Consortium released a "BNC Sampler" corpus, containing
a selection of material from all parts of the full BNC Corpus, including
BNC/speech, for use by researchers whose circumstances made it unnecessary
and difficult to deal with the hundreds of megabytes of the full BNC Corpus.
Natural-language corpora gain value when the same language samples are
studied and processed by many different researchers in different ways,
so ideally it would have been desirable to make the CHRISTINE selections
overlap with those of the BNC Sampler, which are probably destined to be
worked over much more intensively than other parts of the BNC. However,
the Sampler was produced too late to allow this. (The BNC selections included
in CHRISTINE/I were made in late 1996; as it happened, my copy of the Sampler
disc arrived the day after I had extracted and applied initial processing
to the last set of BNC extracts to be included in the full CHRISTINE Corpus.)

<P>We saw, above, that the contents of BNC/demographic consist overwhelmingly
of informal conversation, but nothing in the sampling methodology ruled
out the possibility of including speech of other genres. (The BNC
<I>Manual</I>,
p. 20, states that respondents were asked to record all of their
"conversations",
but this is probably just intended as a nontechnical way of saying "all
speech-events"; at any rate, there is a small amount of non-conversational
material in CHRISTINE/I, for instance a sermon-like monologue.) In selecting
extracts, we made no attempt to exclude non-conversational material. The
aim was to provide a sample of the language that people actually hear in
real life; the majority of that is spontaneous conversation, but some is
not.

<P>In view of the nature of many of the conversations excerpted, it is
perhaps also worth stressing that there was no deliberate intention to
choose salacious material. The tone of CHRISTINE/I, so far as we can tell,
simply reflects a fair cross-section of British conversation in the 1990s.
<H3>
3.3&nbsp; List of Corpus Files</H3>
The forty text extracts in CHRISTINE/I are named T01, T02, ..., T40. (The
prefix letter "T" will become significant when the full CHRISTINE Corpus
is eventually published; different prefix letters are used for material
taken from different source corpora.) CHRISTINE/I consists of a set of
84 files, as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
a brief <TT>README</TT> file</LI>

<LI>
<TT>Documentation</TT>:&nbsp; the <B>documentation file </B>you are now
reading</LI>

<LI>
<TT>Lexicon</TT>:&nbsp; a listing of <B>wordforms</B> occurring in the
Corpus -- see the following subsection</LI>

<LI>
<TT>Speakers</TT>:&nbsp; a machine-usable listing of data on the
<B>speakers</B>
represented -- see subsection &sect;3.5 below</LI>

<LI>
<TT>T01.nb</TT> to<TT> T40.nb</TT>:&nbsp; <B>notes files</B> for the forty
CHRISTINE/I texts -- see &sect;3.6</LI>

<LI>
<TT>T01.tx</TT> to <TT>T40.tx</TT>:&nbsp; the <B>text files</B>, containing
the wording of the speech samples together with structural annotation of
various categories.&nbsp; The organization of the text files is defined
in detail in &sect;6.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
3.4&nbsp; The Lexicon File</H3>
The <TT>Lexicon</TT> file contains an alphabetized list of all pairs of
wordform and wordtag that occur at least once in the Corpus. Inclusion
of a list of wordforms is a recommendation of the EAGLES Spoken Language
Working Group, Gibbon et al. (1997: 170, Recommendation 6).&nbsp; In the
CHRISTINE case, separate listing of grammatically-distinct uses of single
wordforms is an obvious way of increasing the value of such a list.

<P>Each line of the file contains a wordform followed by a wordtag, separated
by a tab character, and terminated by a newline.

<P>The <TT>Lexicon</TT> file covers only actual uttered words (whether
complete or distorted/truncated); it does not contain entries for
non-linguistic
or analytic items.&nbsp; (That is, it contains entries only for word lines
of the third category listed under &sect;6.10.)
<H3>
3.5&nbsp; The Speakers File</H3>
The main goal of the CHRISTINE project has been to annotate a cross-section
of British speech, and to develop guidelines for executing such annotation
in a predictable manner -- not to study differences of usage among different
types of speaker.&nbsp; However, the BNC source files do include background
information about many of the speakers; this information is neither as
complete nor as reliable as one might ideally hope, but it is a good deal
better than no information.

<P>The file <TT>Speakers</TT> summarizes in machine-usable format the
information
available on individual CHRISTINE speakers' demographic characteristics;
&sect;4 discusses the assumptions on which this summary is based.

<P>For each speaker represented in the Corpus other than "unidentified"
speakers, the file includes one line, terminated by a newline character,
and containing eight fields separated by tabs, e.g.:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<H3>
3.6&nbsp; The Notes Files</H3>
The forty notes files, one for each text, are in HTML format and are intended
to be read by users rather than machines.&nbsp; They include information
on the following issues:
<UL>
<LI>
Identification of the BNC file from which the CHRISTINE text is
extracted.</LI>

<LI>
A statement distilled from the BNC file header about the place and date
of the recording(s) from which the text is extracted.[7]</LI>

<LI>
Descriptions, also distilled from the BNC file header, of the individual
speakers, with notes on how they have been classified in terms of social
class, region, etc.</LI>

<LI>
A list of emendations to the speakers' wording as given in the original
BNC transcriptions, made for reasons such as orthographic standardization
(see &sect;7) or correction of obvious mishearing by the transcriber (see
&sect;5.3).&nbsp; These emendations are expressed in terms of ordinary
English orthography.&nbsp; For instance, if an apostrophe were omitted
from a word which the BNC transcription treated as "sentence"-initial,
the notes file would include a note such as "<I>Hes</I> emended to
<I>He's</I>"
-- the emended form would actually appear in the CHRISTINE text file as
two words, <I>he</I> in lower case with an asterisk in the source
transcription
field, and <I>+'s</I> (cf. &sect;&sect;6.10, 7.8).</LI>

<LI>
In a few cases, notes on how the annotation scheme has been applied to
particularly problematic stretches of wording.&nbsp; &sect;&sect;13-14
list some extensions of the <I>EFC</I> annotation scheme which have been
found necessary in the CHRISTINE project.&nbsp; However, the CHRISTINE/I
files do not include detailed statements of "case law" for applying the
annotation scheme, comparable to the detailed guidelines of <I>EFC</I>.&nbsp;
The project has accumulated a great deal of such case law, relating to
the annotation elements common to written and spoken language as well as
to those peculiar to speech; it is planned to compile this material into
a systematic statement supplementing <I>EFC</I>, which will probably be
published via the World Wide Web, but this work has not yet been done.</LI>

<H2>
4. Identification and Classification of Speakers</H2>

<H3>
4.1&nbsp; Speaker Identification and Anonymity</H3>
The BNC compilers promised anonymity to the speakers represented in
BNC/speech.
The CHRISTINE Corpus extends this BNC policy in certain respects.

<P>The anonymity policy was implemented in BNC by removing surnames of
speakers, and a few other proper names, replacing them with an SGML entity
which in CHRISTINE appears as <TT>&lt;name></TT>. However, this procedure
is arguably not adequate.

<P>The headers to the BNC/speech files do specify speakers' Christian names
(forenames); and of course they also specify the dates and places of the
recordings. The places specified are sometimes small villages. The date
and place specifications represent significant scientific data, and must
be preserved. But, particularly when the speakers' Christian names are
moderately or very unusual, it seems likely that someone familiar with
the locale in question would often be able to identify groups of friends
from their Christian names.

<P>True, an outsider would hardly be able to identify individuals without
their surnames. But anonymity vis-&agrave;-vis outsiders is not the only
kind of anonymity that matters. Surely it is equally important to protect,
say, a group of youngsters who have been recorded chatting freely among
themselves from embarrassment through being recognized by their own teachers
or relatives. One may feel that the likelihood of such an "insider"
encountering
the CHRISTINE Corpus is fairly low. But the decisive point is that some
of the speakers themselves understood that the corpus compilers were offering
them this level of anonymity. For instance, T06.00524 shows the speaker
explaining the system to her companion by saying <I>they don't give them
a name, they just say ... sixteen-year-old girl, fifteen-year-old girl
with a friend</I>. It is not for us to breach this expectation of literal
anonymity.

<P>Furthermore, it is not only the speakers themselves who should be
protected.
For instance, the two speakers just mentioned comment that one of their
schoolmates, identified by Christian name, behaves like a whore. This person
is entitled to anonymity as much as the speakers, and arguably more so:
she signed no release form for the corpus compilers. When well-known public
figures or institutions are mentioned, the BNC compilers seem to have felt
that there was no need to anonymize the references at all. Clearly, if
someone announces that he has just bought the latest album by a named pop
singer, there is no point in concealing the singer's name. But it depends
what is said. One of the CHRISTINE texts contains a series of quite damaging
remarks about the management of a secondary school, named in the BNC file.
In another case, speakers comment adversely on the sexual morality of a
named American actress. Even American actresses, surely, are entitled to
have their honour guarded by corpus linguists.

<P>Consequently, the CHRISTINE Corpus has taken the BNC anonymization policy
further, in the following ways.

<P>Where a BNC file gives the name of an institution, or the surname of
a third-party individual (it never gives surnames for participants in the
dialogues), in a context where it seems possible that the identification
could cause embarrassment, CHRISTINE replaces the name with the
<TT>&lt;name></TT>
entity.

<P>Christian names of speakers are in all cases replaced by other Christian
names, both in identifying the utterers of speech-turns, and in the
transcription
of words uttered. Each speaker represented in the CHRISTINE Corpus is assigned
a name and a three-digit code, e.g. "Scott125". Each of the speaker's turns
is headed by this name/number code; and other participants in the dialogue
are shown addressing him as "Scott" -- but "Scott" is not the individual's
real name. The three-digit codes are unique across the CHRISTINE Corpus.
The names are sometimes shared by different speakers, as their real names
are.

<P>(An alternative would have been to attribute the speaker turns to the
five-byte codes used by BNC to identify speakers, e.g. <TT>PS546</TT>.
But this gives the corpus user no easy way to link the individuals who
contribute particular turns to their names used vocatively by other dialogue
participants. It is far easier to grasp what is going on in a dialogue,
if one has naturalistic names to hook the spoken interactions onto; the
fact that they are not the actual names of the speakers is scientifically
irrelevant.)

<P>Some Christian names of individuals not participating in a dialogue,
but who are talked about in it, are also changed, if the comments made
about them seem potentially embarrassing, or if the name might involve
a special risk of rendering the speakers identifiable.

<P>The <I>noms de corpus</I> are chosen to be metrically equivalent to
the real names, and also as far as possible to be socially equivalent.
Obviously, male names are replaced by male names and female by female.
But, in addition, when a name seems to be associated with a particular
age-group, social class, and/or region, it is replaced by a name which
feels similar in those respects. When (say) a two-syllable formal name
alternates with a one-syllable abbreviation, the replacement name is chosen
to preserve the same pattern, and formal name and abbreviation of the
replacement
name are inserted wherever formal and abbreviated versions of the real
name occur, respectively, in the original file. If two participants in
a dialogue share the same Christian name, their <I>noms de corpus</I> are
also the same (occasionally, the logic of the dialogue depends on this
kind of ambiguity of names).

<P>Two kinds of turn in the original BNC files are not attributed to speakers
with identified Christian names. In many cases, the transcriber could not
decide which speaker produced a particular utterance, and assigned the
turn to an "empty" speaker code, usually <TT>PS000</TT>. (Sometimes, where
it is clear that different speakers are involved but neither is identifiable,
<TT>PS000</TT> and <TT>PS001</TT> are used; however, a series of turns
all attributed to "<TT>PS000</TT>" sometimes appear in fact to have been
uttered by more than one speaker.[8])&nbsp; These turns are attributed
in CHRISTINE to speakers <TT>unid0</TT>, <TT>unid1</TT> (for <TT>PS000</TT>,
<TT>PS001</TT> respectively).

<P>In other cases, the BNC file assigns a "normal" speaker code which is
identified by the header as referring to a particular individual with
specified
characteristics, but no name is included. In those cases, CHRISTINE invents
a <I>nom de corpus</I> which seems appropriate in terms of the speaker's
sex, age, etc. (Occasionally, if sex as well as real name are not given,
CHRISTINE uses the cover name <TT>Anon</TT>.)

<P>It must be admitted that these procedures cannot offer a watertight
guarantee against speaker identification. Someone who was determined to
penetrate behind the veil of anonymity provided by CHRISTINE would only
have to link its files to the corresponding passages in the original BNC
files to discover the names we have concealed. There is nothing we can
do about that. But our policy greatly reduces the chance of an accidental
betrayal of informants' confidence. If any of their identities should ever
be revealed, it will not be the fault of the CHRISTINE Corpus.
<H3>
4.2&nbsp; Categorization of Speakers</H3>
Relevant information about the 147 identified speakers in the CHRISTINE
Corpus, adapted from the file-headers of the respective BNC files, is given
discursively in the notes files for the separate CHRISTINE texts, and is
summarized in computer-tractable form for all the speakers in the
<TT>Speakers</TT>
file. Categories such as sex and age in years are self-explanatory, but
the dialect and social class categories require some discussion.

<P>One special problem about BNC speaker categorization data relates to
the fact that some of the BNC files were created not by the BNC project
itself but by a separate project based in Norway, the "Bergen Corpus of
London Teenager Language" ("COLT") project (Stenstr&ouml;m &amp; Breivik
1993; cf. BNC <I>Manual</I>, p. 20).&nbsp; COLT material appears to have
been used where the BNC/demographic sampling system called for samples
fitting its description; but, because COLT was an independent project,
it did not collect the same types of information about speakers as the
BNC project itself.&nbsp; Users of CHRISTINE will notice that relatively
little information about individual speakers is included for those texts
which represent young Londoners.
<H3>
4.3&nbsp; Regional Classification</H3>
The BNC file headers normally identify speakers' mother tongue, almost
always as British English, and in many cases give rather detailed (though
not always very clear) information about speakers' regional dialects.

<P>The only cases where file-header information seems to mean that speakers
have a language other than English as mother tongue are two speakers in
text T08 who are identified as having European accents. (Also, the header
to the BNC file from which CHRISTINE text T24 is extracted codes all speakers
in that file as native speakers of Irish Gaelic, but this is not credible;
I take it to be a symptom of the BNC respondent's nationalist political
fervour rather than a serious linguistic description. These speakers include
members of more than one family, living in Belfast, and all including a
child of three years are shown as speaking fluent English.) Apart from
the above, the only cases in CHRISTINE/I where no information is given
about mother tongue are:
<UL>
<LI>
T18: an 8-year-old, child of native speakers, living in Northants.</LI>

<LI>
T22: a 2-year old</LI>

<LI>
T26: a speaker for whom no background information is given</LI>

<LI>
T27: three speakers for whom no background information is given</LI>

<LI>
T37: speaker Jill136, for whom other information is also lacking or
inconsistent</LI>
</UL>
I have assumed that all of these speakers should in fact be classified
as having British English as mother tongue.

<P>Regional dialects are classified by BNC on a system which, with respect
to England, seems to be adapted from the classification in Trudgill (1990:
3-5). (The BNC <I>Manual</I> does not explicitly quote Trudgill's book,
so far as I have seen.) Trudgill's book does not deal with the British
nations other than England, and BNC treats Wales, Scotland, and Ireland
as three unitary dialect regions coinciding with the respective political
units. (BNC makes no distinction between Northern and Southern Irish speakers;
and, although all the speech samples were recorded within the UK, the
CHRISTINE
Corpus includes at least one Irish speaker living in England, who may well
have come from the Republic rather than from Northern Ireland -- so CHRISTINE
likewise uses a single "Irish" category.)

<P>Within England, Trudgill recognizes sixteen dialect areas. BNC describes
speakers' dialects via three-letter codes whose definitions (BNC
<I>Manual</I>,
pp. 86-7) are too similar to Trudgill's areas to have been chosen
independently,
though they are not quite identical. (For instance, BNC uses a code XLO
for "London", which in Trudgill's system is part of the much larger "Home
Counties" area, and it uses a code XLC for "Lancashire", whereas various
parts of Lancashire fall into different areas in Trudgill's scheme -- I
infer by elimination that XLC may in reality stand for Trudgill's "Central
Lancashire" area.) The complications in the relationships between the BNC
and Trudgill's dialect classification systems seem to stem partly from
the fact that BNC aims wherever possible to use internationally-recognized
ISO classifications for geographical regions, and partly from the fact
that laymen such as the BNC respondents commonly classify speech-varieties
by reference to traditional county names; both of these classification
methods relate to political boundaries which are often irrelevant to
linguistic
realities.

<P>Be that as it may, Trudgill's classification in any case seems
unnecessarily
fine-grained for a project like CHRISTINE, which is concerned with grammar
rather than with details of pronunciation; and a sixteen-way classification
of English dialects is particularly inappropriate when one considers that
the recording sites often happened to fall rather close to one or other
of Trudgill's isoglosses, and that BNC respondents had no expertise in
classifying speakers who hailed from areas distant from the recording site.

<P>On the other hand, linguistic differences between, say, Northern and
Southern England are sufficiently large, in grammar as well as pronunciation,
that it would be a pity to ignore the dialect indications in BNC altogether.

<P>CHRISTINE has adopted a compromise strategy, which uses the data in
BNC to assign as many English speakers as possible to one of four broad
regions corresponding to the second level from the root in Trudgill's
hierarchical
classification of modern dialects (Trudgill 1990: Fig. 3.1, p. 65). CHRISTINE
uses the terms:
<UL>
<LI>
Northern England (Trudgill's "Northern")</LI>

<LI>
Midlands (Trudgill's "Central")</LI>

<LI>
South West (Trudgill's "Southwest")</LI>

<LI>
South East (Trudgill's "East")</LI>
</UL>
The boundaries of these dialect areas are defined by the heaviest lines
in Trudgill's Map 18 (1990, p. 63). In terms of traditional counties, Northern
England extends from the Scottish border south to central Lancashire
(excluding
Merseyside), all of Yorkshire, and the northernmost part of Lincolnshire.
The Midlands includes Merseyside and the counties south of Yorkshire,
southwards
to Shrewsbury, the Birmingham area, Leicestershire, and the southern boundary
of Lincolnshire. The South West includes southern Shropshire, southern
Worcestershire, Gloucestershire, western parts of Oxfordshire, Berkshire,
and Hampshire, and the counties further south and west. The South East
includes Northamptonshire and all of England south and east of that county,
including East Anglia to the east, the bulk of Hampshire to the south,
and notably the London area.

<P>Clearly, this classification can be no more than a broad and vague
indication;
habits of speech do not change sharply either side of lines drawn through
the map of England.

<P>CHRISTINE/I contains no cases of native speakers of varieties of English
from outside the British Isles. However, the complete CHRISTINE Corpus
will include some speakers to whom this applies, and consequently the coding
system given below includes further classifications:
<UL>
<LI>
"North American" for U.S. and Canadian English</LI>

<LI>
"West Indies"</LI>

<LI>
"Southern Hemisphere" for Southern African, Australian, New Zealand, and
Falkland Islands English (Wells (1982: 592) notes the broad dialectal
coherence
of this grouping)</LI>

<LI>
"Other Native speakers" as a catch-all category for speakers with English
as first language who were brought up in other regions</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
4.4&nbsp; Social Classification</H3>
BNC file headers include three kinds of information about speakers which
could broadly be described as social classifications (though in many cases
one or more items is missing for a given speaker):
<UL>
<LI>
occupation</LI>

<LI>
education level</LI>

<LI>
social class</LI>
</UL>
Of these, the education information is so patchy (it is virtually always
missing for all speakers other than the one BNC respondent for each file)
that it is ignored in CHRISTINE.

<P>The social-class information is expressed as a code drawn from a four-way
classification derived from the Standard Occupational Classification ("SOC")
scheme defined in Office of Population Censuses and Surveys (1990-1).[9]

<P>The SOC scheme assigns occupations to six social classes:
<BLOCKQUOTE>I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; professional, etc.
<BR>II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; managerial and technical
<BR>II&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skilled occupations, divided into:
<BLOCKQUOTE>IIIN&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; non-manual
<BR>IIIM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manual</BLOCKQUOTE>
IV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; partly skilled
<BR>V&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unskilled</BLOCKQUOTE>
The BNC coding (in common with much social research) collapses this into
a four-way scheme:
<BLOCKQUOTE>AB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I+II, professional, managerial,
and technical
<BR>C1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IIIN, skilled non-manual
<BR>C2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IIIM, skilled manual
<BR>DE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IV+V, partly skilled and
unskilled</BLOCKQUOTE>
In principle, this four-way scheme is at a very suitable level of granularity
for use in CHRISTINE. But there are severe problems in practice, which
presumably stem from the fact that the data in BNC file headers are only
as good as the logs supplied by the non-expert respondents who filled in
details about their friends and relatives.

<P>In the first place, many speakers are assigned an "unclassified" code
under the social-class heading. But, more worryingly, it not infrequently
happens that the social code assigned to a speaker contradicts the statement
in the same file header about that speaker's occupation, despite the fact
that the social classification is supposed to be based on occupation. An
extreme case is Gillian091 in text T23, who is socially classified DE (partly
skilled or unskilled) in BNC, and is described as a doctor by occupation.
Any doctor is SOC class I, i.e. AB in terms of the four-way scheme.

<P>Between them, these two problems are sufficiently severe that one might
think it best to abandon any attempt to include social-class data in
CHRISTINE.
That would be very unfortunate: the issue of correlations (or lack of them)
between speech patterns and social class are a topic of great interest
from many points of view. And the data in BNC, while certainly quite "dirty"
in this area, are not so irredeemably flawed as to prevent anything being
said.

<P>For CHRISTINE, therefore, I proceeded as follows. Where the BNC file
header for a speaker states that speaker's occupation, I assumed that this
statement, being relatively specific and objective, was more likely to
be correct than any social-class code shown: so I used the SOC mapping
of occupations onto classes in order to assign a social code. (Thus
Gillian091's
code was altered from DE to AB.) In the case of married couples, knowing
that wives often treat earning as a subsidiary aspect of their role and
take lower-level jobs than their background would qualify them for, I assigned
the social-class code for the husband also to the wife; and vice versa
in occasional cases where a husband was disabled or unemployed, so that
the wife was likely to be the main breadwinner. (Note that these procedures
were chosen in the light of experience of 1990s British society as it actually
is, rather than of politically-motivated theories of how it possibly ought
to be.) In the case of schoolchildren or preschool children, I assigned
the father's (or, failing that, the mother's) code, irrespective of any
code shown in BNC for the child. Only where none of these guidelines yielded
a class code for an individual did I accept the code given in the BNC file
header, if there was one. (Some speakers remained unclassified.)

<P>The notes files for the various texts explain how these guidelines were
applied in each specific case in order to derive the code included in the
social-class field of the <TT>Speakers</TT> file. I believe the resulting
classification is significantly more informative than omitting any attempt
at social classification would have been. At the same time, it should be
clearly understood that this aspect of the data is quite imperfect. Social
classification is certainly one of the least satisfactory aspects of the
information available about BNC speakers.

5. Analytic Principles</H2>

<H3>
5.1&nbsp; The Need for Explicit Annotation Guidelines</H3>
The general approach to structural analysis of real-life language samples
exemplified in the CHRISTINE Corpus was described in early chapters of
<I>EFC</I>, in connexion with the SUSANNE Corpus of written English. Our
primary aim has been to refine the analytic scheme (the set of annotation
symbols and detailed guidelines for applying them) through conscious
consideration
of every or almost every awkward case in our samples, so as to uncover
hidden ambiguities or gaps in the guidelines and replace them with new
explicit decisions. The work is analogous to the way in which the stream
of cases arising in a nation's lawcourts uncovers hidden uncertainties
in the legal framework and causes them to be settled through judicial
decisions
which stand as precedents for the future.

<P>Elsewhere (e.g. Rahman &amp; Sampson forthcoming) we have used the analogy
with the discipline of software engineering, developed in response to the
"software crisis" of the 1960s-70s caused by premature coding of solutions
to inadequately analysed tasks, in order to argue that this kind of detailed
logging and classification of linguistic phenomena should be seen as a
high priority at the current juncture in natural-language engineering.
The carefully hand-crafted nature of treebanks produced in this spirit
inevitably means that they are small, relative to some other treebanks
now available; but small size is arguably a cost worth paying in exchange
for comprehensiveness of the analytic guidelines. As Jane Edwards (1992:
139) has written, "The single most important property of any data base
for purposes of computer-assisted research is that <I>similar instances
be encoded in predictably similar ways</I>."&nbsp; Only detailed, explicit
analytic guidelines can enable this kind of internal consistency to be
maintained within future larger treebanks.
<H3>
5.2&nbsp; Indeterminacy in Spoken Structure</H3>
The exercise of adding structural annotations to samples of spontaneous
speech involves problems of a higher order than arise in the equivalent
work with edited written language. There are of course specific structural
features found only in spoken language, which require their own annotation
mechanisms; a number of such mechanisms were defined in <I>EFC</I>, chapter
6, and are used in CHRISTINE, and further notational devices developed
in the course of the CHRISTINE project are described in &sect;13 below.
But, beyond these things, there is a pervasive incidence of indeterminacy
in transcriptions of spontaneous speech which is rarely found in written
prose. When people's hasty, unstudied utterances are pinned down in black
and white, again and again it is just not clear what they are saying. This
is frequently true even when the transcriber has succeeded in distinguishing
each of the individual words on the tape (often, of course, transcribers
do not succeed in that).

<P>In some cases the reason will be that the speech refers to features
of the situation which were not visible to the transcriber (BNC transcribers
worked from tape recordings but had only general indications of the locale
in which a dialogue was recorded), or that participants in the dialogue
were tacitly drawing on their shared knowledge of some matter that is never
explicitly mentioned. In other cases the main problem seems to be that
people sometimes just speak inconsequentially. Their skill at rapidly
assembling
word-sequences suitable to express their meaning is imperfect, so they
come out with utterances which are uninterpretable (or perhaps they have
not formulated a clear meaning in the first place -- they are "engaging
mouth before putting brain in gear").

<P>In the CHRISTINE project our task is limited to annotating for linguistic
structure, rather than somehow indicating the meanings of the language
samples; so this sort of inconsequentiality is not too problematic while
it does not affect grammatical coherence. But sometimes it does. What should
one make, for instance, of a speaker turn such as the following, uttered
by Harold001:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>When, when he rang us up it, it was looking at us like for
Brian he kept, called in as I was going enjoy</I>&nbsp; T01.02733</BLOCKQUOTE>
Where the transcriber placed commas, evidently the speaker has repeated
the previous word or substituted an alternative word; and it is easy to
see that the word <I>like</I> is functioning in the colloquial "hedging"
usage. But there is no clue in the context about what the <I>it</I> was
that was <I>looking at us</I> (or why it was looking at us, whatever it
was), or how to interpret <I>for</I> ("looking on Brian's behalf", or "because
Brian called in"?); and the relationship of the closing word <I>enjoy</I>
to what precedes is completely mysterious.

<P>No set of explicit guidelines, however comprehensive, can define a clear,
predictable structure for every case like this. The CHRISTINE principle
is that, where word-sequences are open to alternative grammatical
interpretations,
the analyst chooses one, at random if there are no apparent clues (so the
CHRISTINE analysis of the above example annotates <I>for Brian</I> on the
"looking at us on Brian's behalf" interpretation); and, while words and
phrases are fitted into larger structures whenever they can be, there is
no objection to leaving individual words or short phrases as independent
elements in the stream of structures, if there is no apparent way to fit
them into their verbal environment -- so, in the example, the CHRISTINE
analysis leaves <I>enjoy</I> as a verb which is not part of any higher
structure, following a main clause <I>he kept, called in as I was going</I>.

<P>Each word is at a minimum assigned a wordtag.&nbsp; But, if the word
cannot be fitted into a larger structure and alternative wordtags are
available
for the form, a tag may have to be chosen at random (for instance, <I>off</I>
at T11.02554 is tagged RP simply because this is the commonest of the three
tags applicable to this wordform).

<P>Contrary to the rule specified in <I>EFC</I>, &sect;6.13, the CHRISTINE
Corpus does not group the succession of structures within a single speaker
turn under a single root node O. To do that would imply some degree of
coherence among the successive daughters of the speaker-turn node: it would
suggest that those daughter nodes constituted a "construction" of some
type. This is more than our data warrant. In CHRISTINE, a speaker turn
consists of a disconnected sequence of one or more grammatical units which,
if the speaker is articulate, may all be main clauses with recognizable
internal structuring, but which in some cases may be disjointed phrases
that would never be allowed to stand in writing as "complete sentences",
or may be individual words as in the case of <I>enjoy</I>, above.

<P>In the example quoted, there was no stretch of speech where the transcriber
found the wording indistinguishable. But stretches like that, shown in
CHRISTINE as <TT>{unclear}</TT>, are very frequent, and obviously they
create even greater problems for choice of structural annotation. We have
evolved explicit guidelines for annotating passages that include
<TT>{unclear}</TT>
stretches, and these are discussed in &sect;9.
<H3>
5.3&nbsp; Emendation of Transcribers' Wording</H3>
Members of the CHRISTINE project had no access to the recordings from which
the BNC transcribers worked; at present, for confidentiality reasons these
are not available to researchers.&nbsp; This means that those of us who
provided the structural annotation had no evidence about what was actually
said, other than what the BNC transcribers wrote down.

<P>This evidence went slightly beyond the words themselves; BNC was
transcribed
using ordinary English orthography, including sentence-initial capitals
and a variety of punctuation marks, and although these features were in
due course stripped off the wording and "hidden" in a subsidiary field
of the CHRISTINE text files (because they have no direct spoken significance),
at the stage when our grammatical annotations were being created the
orthographic
features were still present and visible to the analysts -- often, the BNC
transcriber's choice of punctuation was helpful in deciding between
alternative
structural interpretations which would have been equally plausible with
respect to the words alone.

<P>However, the possibility obviously arises that the BNC transcribers
may sometimes have misheard or misunderstood, and have written down words
different from those which the speakers thought they were saying. It is
at least logically possible that the kind of inconsequentiality described
in &sect;5.2 might be <I>entirely</I> an artefact of the transcription
process, and not present at all in the speakers' actual wording. Perhaps
Harold001 did not use the word <I>enjoy</I> but some phonetically-similar
form which made good sense in context. I very much doubt that cases of
apparent speaker incoherence can all be explained away in this manner,
but there is no way that we can be sure. This is very regrettable; it would
be extremely worthwhile from several points of view to be able to use this
sort of treebank to check how structurally coherent speakers are on average
in real life. CHRISTINE does not give us reliable quantitative information
about the question. Given the primary goal of making the Corpus representative
socially, regionally, etc., no speech samples were available to us that
would have enabled us to answer it.

<P>On the other hand, it is unquestionably true that <I>some</I> cases
of incoherence in the transcriptions were created by transcribers rather
than speakers. At the outset of the project, I had envisaged adopting a
principle that the transcriber's wording should never be "second-guessed";
it might be wrong, but the transcriber had heard the tape, we had not.
As I grew familiar with the nature of the BNC transcriptions, it became
clear that such a principle would be unreasonable.

<P>Clear evidence of transcriber error occurs in a few cases where the
speaker is reading aloud from a published document. For instance, T08.00933
contains a passage read out from St Matthew's Gospel, 8:11, containing
the phrase <I>... will come and decline at the table ...</I>, where it
is easy to check that the transcriber's <I>decline</I> must have been a
mistake for <I>recline</I>. But there are other cases where we have no
independent check, yet some phonetically-small adjustment to the transcriber's
wording makes such a large improvement to the sense that it seems morally
certain that the transcription is erroneous. For instance, at T29.09621,
in a discussion of unsatisfactory child-minders, one speaker is made by
the BNC transcriber to say <I>unless you've low and detest children or
unless you're out purely and simply for the money ...</I> The first clause
seems meaningless, but emending it to <I>unless you loathe and detest ...</I>
gives a passage which uses a standard clich&eacute; to express a
straightforward
piece of sense. The phonetic differences involve two voiced fricatives,
which are among the least auditorily salient classes of English phoneme;
and the BNC dialogues were recorded in non-ideal field conditions. It is
overwhelmingly likely that the speaker said <I>you loathe</I>, and the
BNC transcriber misheard. (As I understand it, the transcriptions were
done under heavy time pressure.)

<P>Therefore, we have allowed ourselves to make cautious emendations to
the BNC transcriptions (logging any such emendation in the relevant notes
file, with a summary of the justification for it). In general, where a
change to the written wording implies no phonetic difference (e.g. <I>where
as</I> changed to <I>whereas</I>), we have freely adopted the emendation
if it improves the sense. The larger the phonetic difference between the
transcribed wording and a proposed emendation, the greater we required
the gain in semantic coherence to be before the emendation was adopted;
and we tried to err on the side of conservatism. The notes files sometimes
mention possible emendations which we regarded as too adventurous to
incorporate
into the text files.
<H3>
5.4&nbsp; Reallocation of Utterances Among Speakers</H3>
Emendations to the BNC source material are not limited to alterations of
wording. Another type of apparent error in BNC is that, in some dialogues,
the assignment of turns to identified participants seems to have become
muddled. (The BNC system of distinguishing speakers via opaque sigla such
as <TT>PS0M4</TT>, <TT>PS0M5</TT> may have encouraged such confusions.)
Sometimes the error becomes apparent because a speaker seems to be addressing
himself or herself by name when it is clear that he or she is really talking
to someone else. In other cases the contents of the wording, taken with
information in the BNC file headers about what kind of people the speakers
are, makes the existence of a confusion inescapable. For instance, when
text T21.01517-8 includes the exchange:
<BLOCKQUOTE>PS0M5: <I>Did you want to have a shower with daddy?</I>
<BR>PS13T: <I>Umm yes.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
it is startling to learn from the file header that PS13T is a 34-year-old
engineer and PS0M5 his 3-year-old son; but a simple permutation of identity
codes between the three participants in this dialogue makes good sense
of this and many other seemingly bizarre aspects of the conversation.

<P>In this case the evidence is so strong that CHRISTINE has reallocated
the speaker identity codes (with an explanation in the file T21.nb); a
few other reallocations have been made elsewhere for comparable reasons.
There are other cases where the BNC attribution of individual speaker turns
looks suspicious, but either the evidence is not strong enough to justify
a reallocation, or it is not clear what particular reallocation would be
correct, and so the BNC attributions have been left to stand. Allocation
of speaker turns is an area where I suspect that CHRISTINE/I contains a
significant incidence of errors (though not, I believe, so many as to make
the information about speakers valueless).

<P>A special case of speaker-code reallocation relates to a phenomenon
found in a sizeable minority of the files, namely T06, T09, T19, T22, T28,
T29, and probably T14.&nbsp; In these files, there are speaker turns which
as a whole are transcribed as <TT>{unclear}</TT> (the transcriber could
not distinguish the wording) and are allocated by BNC to unidentified
speakers,
but in context it often seems clear that the inaudible passage is in fact
a segment of an adjacent turn whose speaker is identified.&nbsp; In the
texts where this approach seems to have been adopted by the BNC transcriber,
we have felt free to make guesses about how best to link these unclear
turns with adjacent clear turns.&nbsp; Most of them have been treated as
part of the preceding (or, sometimes, the following) turn, and only a minority
have been left as separate turns, where it is quite unclear who is speaking
and what the turn structure can be (e.g. the unclear turn between T06.00439
and 00440, or the sequence at T06.00457ff.).&nbsp; When an unclear turn
has been linked with a clear turn, the adjacent s-unit in the latter has
been made to extend over the <TT>{unclear}</TT> entity, contrary to the
structure in the BNC original.&nbsp; No log is kept of such modifications
in the respective notes files.
<H3>
5.5&nbsp; Reordering of Utterances</H3>
One respect in which we gave ourselves complete freedom to modify the source
transcriptions related to the sequencing and structuring of different
speakers'
contributions as BNC <TT>&lt;s></TT> and <TT>&lt;u></TT> units. Much of
the BNC material consists of lively conversations in which two or more
participants often interrupt one another, talk simultaneously, make brief
supportive responses while someone else holds the floor, and so forth.
The BNC compilers treated it as a high priority to record the relative
timing of various speakers' contributions, and because they did not themselves
equip the material with annotations for grammatical structure they seem
not always to have noticed that sequencing different speakers' wording
in accordance with the physical timing does violence to the integrity of
individual speakers' contributions. Although the BNC material was transcribed
in the form of orthographic sentences, a <I>yes</I> or <I>mm</I> interjected
by a hearer has sometimes led to a speaker's wording being divided into
separate "sentences" in the middle of quite a low-level grammatical tagma.

<P>The aims of the CHRISTINE project have to do with grammar rather than
with social turn-taking phenomena. Consequently, whenever a construction
produced continuously by one speaker has been split in BNC into separate
<TT>&lt;u></TT> (utterance) units interrupted by another speaker's utterance,
CHRISTINE reorders the first speaker's <TT>&lt;u></TT> units into one
continuous
speaker turn. Where one speaker holds the floor for a long time, producing
a series of clauses which are interrupted in the middle by hearer responses,
CHRISTINE will show the first speaker's contribution as continuous, followed
by the responses which in some cases may physically have occurred much
earlier than the point where they appear in CHRISTINE. (If the hearer
responses
occurred <I>between</I> independent clauses in the first speaker's
contribution,
no reordering is done, since the BNC sequencing does not distort any of
the grammatical constructions.) The source transcription field (&sect;6.8)
includes markers indicating that such reordering has occurred, though users
who need full information on relative timing will need to consult the original
BNC files.

<P>(It is perhaps fair to point out in this connexion that manual
transcriptions
like those of the BNC are unlikely to be very accurate with respect to
precise relative timing of speech events. There is plenty of psycholinguistic
research showing that hearing of relative timing of speech sounds is heavily
influenced by the hearer's understanding of grammatical structure, which
interferes with perception of the physical facts. This is one of many reasons
why it is unfortunate that the audio data from which the BNC transcriptions
were made have not so far been released.)

<P>In BNC, <TT>&lt;s></TT> (segment or sentence) units are wholly contained
within <TT>&lt;u></TT> (utterance) units, implying that when a speaker's
contribution is divided into separate <TT>&lt;u></TT> units because of
an interruption, there is necessarily also an <TT>&lt;s></TT>-unit boundary
at the same point. But, in addition, BNC <TT>&lt;s></TT>-unit boundaries
sometimes seem grammatically arbitrary even in cases where the <TT>&lt;s></TT>
units are adjacent in BNC. What seems to be a single coherent grammatical
construction has sometimes been split by the transcriber into separate
"sentences", or successive disconnected constructions have been grouped
into one orthographic sentence. CHRISTINE analysts took complete freedom
to group words into tagmas reflecting speakers' apparent logic, ignoring
the BNC <TT>&lt;s></TT>-unit boundaries where these clashed.

<P>CHRISTINE does preserve the BNC <TT>&lt;s></TT>-unit ("source-unit")
boundaries for the purely practical convenience of having a division of
the texts into short numbered chunks which can easily be cross-referred
to the corresponding locations in the original BNC files.&nbsp; But the
consequence of the analytic approach described above is that CHRISTINE
source-unit boundaries have no significance with respect to the tree structure
assigned to surrounding wording. A source-unit boundary may occur between
adjacent parse-trees, or anywhere in the middle of a tree.

<P>On the other hand, parse-trees are never divided by the higher-level
boundaries recognized in CHRISTINE: turn boundaries, and division boundaries.
The point of re-ordering the BNC <TT>&lt;u></TT> units was to ensure that
every grammatical tagma is complete within a single speaker turn.
<H3>
5.6&nbsp; No Shared Structures</H3>
One specific rule related to this last point is that CHRISTINE grammatical
annotation is never allowed to link separate speakers' wording into a single
tagma, even when speakers "complete one another's sentences" (as people
often do). For instance, T01.02825ff. has this passage (shown here in the
original BNC sequence):
<BLOCKQUOTE>Jean003:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>yeah Chris is yeah yeah</I>
<BR>Harold001:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>she is Chris she's a-coming</I>
<BR>Jean003:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>just with the kids</I>
<BR>Harold001:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>with two kids</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
At the beginning of the CHRISTINE project, I envisaged that such a passage
might be analysed in such a way that <I>just with the kids</I> would be
treated as adjunct material within the <I>she's a-coming</I> clause, and
<I>with two kids</I> perhaps tacked on as an appositional element subordinate
to <I>with the kids</I>. But it quickly became apparent that this approach
would not lead to predictable analyses -- it creates too many debatable
alternatives, particularly when speaker B completes speaker A's sentence
and then speaker A also completes it in the same or different wording (again
a frequent scenario). Accordingly, trees crossing speaker-turn boundaries
are forbidden. (This rule, though evolved independently, turned out to
coincide with the rule adopted for the Switchboard Corpus (Meteer et al.
1995: &sect;1).) In CHRISTINE, the dialogue above is structured as:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Jean003:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <I>yeah</I> [ <I>Chris is yeah yeah
</I>| <I>just with the kids </I>]
<BR>Harold001:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [ <I>she is Chris </I>] [ <I>she's
a-coming</I>
| <I>with two kids </I>]</BLOCKQUOTE>
where square brackets enclose main clauses, and the "|" symbol marks
source-unit
boundaries. (The fact that the physical timing of the words was different
from this is marked in the source transcription field.)
<H2>
6. The Text Files</H2>

<H3>
6.1&nbsp; The Structure of Text Files</H3>
CHRISTINE text files use a fixed-field file structure which is intended
to be transparent to manual inspection (that is, a non-expert newcomer
who scans a file should be able to grasp as much as possible of what is
going on in the dialogue), while making it easy, through regularity of
structure, to write code to extract information automatically. The file
structure is also somewhat similar to that of the SUSANNE Corpus, though
differences in the nature of the information recorded unfortunately made
it impossible to use identical structures. (The SUSANNE Corpus was already
published years before I began to plan the CHRISTINE Corpus.)

<P>Each CHRISTINE text file consists of a sequence of lines terminated
by newline characters; each line contains a sequence of fields separated
by tabs. Tab and newline, codes 9 and 10, are the only nonprinting characters
found in the text files (the space character, code 32, never occurs). Among
the ASCII printing characters, i.e. codes 33 (<TT>!</TT>) to 126 (<TT>~</TT>),
no use is made of the characters:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>$ ( ) ; \ ^ ` ~</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
(codes 36, 40, 41, 59, 92, 94, 96, 126).

<P>As a specimen, here is the initial part of file T02.tx.&nbsp; (As a
consequence of Web technology, tabs as field dividers are simulated using
HTML entities.)

The first field of each line is an eight-byte <B>CHRISTINE location code</B>
of the form <TT>Tnn_nnnn</TT>, where <TT>Tnn</TT> is the name of the text,
and <TT>nnnn</TT> is a four-digit number uniquely identifying the line
within the text. Successive line-numbers are guaranteed to increase, but
are not in general consecutive; they usually increase in threes, but editing
and correction of the files sometimes led to insertion of lines with
intermediate
numbers.
<H3>
6.2&nbsp; Word Lines v. Header Lines</H3>
Lines are divided into two types: <B>header lines</B>, which identify the
structuring of the dialogue into units of various levels above the individual
words, and <B>word lines</B>, which contain successive spoken words (and
certain non-word items, such as identification of "noises off"). In a header
line, the second field is composed of five identical punctuation marks
(different marks for different categories of header). In a word line, the
second field is a seven-digit <B>source location code</B>.

<P>The types of header line are:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>division header</B> (second field contains five equals signs)</LI>

<LI>
<B>turn header</B> (second field contains five hyphens)</LI>

<LI>
<B>source-unit header</B> (second field contains five full stops)</LI>
</UL>
Within the British National Corpus, a file contains one or more "division"
(nominally, separate conversations -- though see &sect;3.2); a division
contains one or more <TT>&lt;u></TT> ("utterance") unit, called in CHRISTINE
a speaker <B>turn</B>; and a <TT>&lt;u></TT> unit contains one or more
<TT>&lt;s></TT> ("segment" or "sentence") unit, called in CHRISTINE a
<B>source-unit
</B>(sometimes abbreviated as "s-unit") in order to emphasize that this
is a division of the wording which stems from our source material and to
which we attribute no consistent significance.

<P>CHRISTINE header lines mark the beginnings of corpus sections of these
three levels. In consequence:
<UL>
<LI>
the first line of each text is a division header</LI>

<LI>
any division header is immediately followed by a turn header</LI>

<LI>
any turn header is immediately followed by a source-unit header</LI>

<LI>
any source-unit header is immediately followed by one or more word lines</LI>

<LI>
the last line of each text is a word line</LI>
</UL>
Thus, the general overall structure of a text file looks like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>division header</TT>
<BR><TT>turn header</TT>
<BR><TT>source-unit header</TT>
<BR><TT>word</TT>
<BR><TT>word</TT>

<H3>
6.3&nbsp; Division Headers</H3>
A<B> </B>division header has four fields; an example is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>T02_0003&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =====&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
011303&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
m</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The four fields are:
<UL>
<LI>
the CHRISTINE location code (discussed above), e.g. <TT>T02_0003</TT></LI>

<LI>
the division-header symbol, <TT>=====</TT></LI>

<LI>
a six-digit number, e.g. <TT>011303</TT>, representing the number assigned
to the division within the BNC source file</LI>

<LI>
a single byte marking how much of the original BNC division is included
within the CHRISTINE text file:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
<TT>w</TT>:&nbsp; whole -- the CHRISTINE division includes the entire BNC
division</LI>

<LI>
<TT>e</TT>:&nbsp; end -- the CHRISTINE division includes the closing but
not the opening line(s) of the BNC division</LI>

<LI>
<TT>b</TT>:&nbsp; beginning -- the CHRISTINE division includes the opening
but not the closing line(s) of the BNC division</LI>

<LI>
<TT>m</TT>:&nbsp; middle -- the CHRISTINE division includes neither the
opening nor the closing line(s) of the BNC division</LI>
</UL>
</UL>
CHRISTINE text files are always continuous extracts from BNC files;
consequently,
a division coded <TT>e</TT> must be the first division in a CHRISTINE file,
a division coded <TT>b</TT> must be the last division, and a division coded
<TT>m</TT> must be the sole division in the CHRISTINE file.
<H3>
6.4&nbsp; Turn Headers</H3>
A turn header has three fields; an example is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>T02_0060&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -----&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Barbara004</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The three fields are:
<UL>
<LI>
the CHRISTINE location code, already discussed, e.g. <TT>T02_0060</TT></LI>

<LI>
the turn-header symbol, <TT>-----</TT></LI>

<LI>
the speaker identification code (see &sect;4.1), e.g. <TT>Barbara004</TT></LI>
</UL>

<H3>
6.5&nbsp; Source-Unit Headers</H3>
A source-unit header has three fields; an example is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>T02_0096&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
00327</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The three fields are:
<UL>
<LI>
the CHRISTINE location code, e.g. <TT>T02_0096</TT></LI>

<LI>
the source-unit header symbol, <TT>.....</TT></LI>

<LI>
a five-digit number representing the number assigned to the s-unit in the
BNC file, e.g. <TT>00327</TT></LI>
</UL>
A complication in the BNC file structure is that its hierarchical division
into <TT>&lt;div></TT>, <TT>&lt;u></TT>, and <TT>&lt;s></TT> units does
not account exhaustively for all the vocal material recorded in the
files.&nbsp;
There are certain forms which are treated as <TT>&lt;u></TT> units but
not included in any <TT>&lt;s></TT> unit; and certain other forms which
are treated as part of a<TT> &lt;div></TT> but are outside all <TT>&lt;u></TT>
and <TT>&lt;s></TT> units.&nbsp; CHRISTINE treats a form of either of these
types as a separate speaker turn consisting of a single source-unit; the
third field of the source-unit header contains five zeros, if the form
is a BNC <TT>&lt;u></TT> unit, and five hyphens, if it is not.&nbsp; Examples
of both occur adjacent to source-unit T40.00141, <I>what are you doing
here</I>.&nbsp; The immediately-following <TT>{laugh}</TT> entity, attributed
to an unidentified speaker, is in the original BNC file a <TT>&lt;u></TT>
unit not containing an <TT>&lt;s></TT> unit; the immediately-preceding
<TT>{unclear}</TT> entity, attributed to Sadie148, is in the BNC file an
empty tag outside all <TT>&lt;u></TT> and <TT>&lt;s></TT> tags.[10]
<H3>
6.6&nbsp; Word Lines</H3>
A word line has six fields; a typical example is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>T02_0108&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0051118&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
DD1a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[Ds:s.Ds:s]S?@]Nu]</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The six fields are:
<UL>
<LI>
the <B>CHRISTINE location code</B>, already discussed, e.g.
<TT>T02_0108</TT></LI>

<LI>
a seven-digit <B>source location code</B>, e.g. <TT>0051118</TT></LI>

<LI>
the <B>source transcription field</B>, in this case<TT> ?</TT></LI>

<LI>
the <B>wordtag field</B>, in this case <TT>DD1a</TT></LI>

<LI>
the <B>word field</B>, in this case <TT>that</TT></LI>

<LI>
the <B>parse field</B>, in this case <TT>[Ds:s.Ds:s]S?@]Nu]</TT></LI>
</UL>
The CHRISTINE location code was described above. There follow descriptions
of the other five fields in a word line.
<H3>
6.7&nbsp; Source Location Code</H3>
The purpose of this field is to link each word in a CHRISTINE text to its
location in the source file from which the text was extracted -- in the
case of CHRISTINE/I, from some file in Release 1.0 of the British National
Corpus. BNC contains various categories of information which were judged
to have little relevance to the aims of the CHRISTINE project and are not
preserved in the CHRISTINE Corpus; one example is detailed information
about the relative timing of various speakers' wording, in cases where
speakers interrupt one another or speak simultaneously. The source location
field is provided in order to enable users who need to do so to check
CHRISTINE
wording against the original BNC file.

<P>The BNC filename corresponding to a CHRISTINE text is given in the notes
file for that text; for instance, CHRISTINE text T02 is extracted from
BNC file KB6. The seven-digit source location code within the CHRISTINE
text file locates the individual word (in the example, the word <I>that</I>)
within the relevant BNC file. Because BNC files are based on an SGML structure
rather than on fixed-field records, the location reference which appears
in CHRISTINE ignores the internal structure of the BNC file and uses a
simple byte count from the beginning of the file.

<P>In BNC, each word uttered is enclosed within an SGML <TT>&lt;w> ...
&lt;/w></TT> tag. The source location code <TT>0051118</TT> means that
the character <TT>&lt;</TT> at the start of the <TT>&lt;w></TT> element
to the left of the word <I>that</I> is the 51118th byte in the BNC file
(counting its initial byte as 1, not 0). Where the contents of a CHRISTINE
word field correspond to an "empty" SGML tag in BNC (e.g. an indication
of a silent pause or a non-speech noise), the CHRISTINE source location
code identifies the opening <TT>&lt;</TT> of the empty SGML tag.

<P>An exception occurs in cases where an item treated as a single word
in BNC is by the rules of the SUSANNE/CHRISTINE annotation scheme split
into two or more words on successive lines in CHRISTINE. For instance,
BNC (<I>Manual</I>, p. 97ff.) treats various phrases containing multiple
orthographic words as single units within a single <TT>&lt;w></TT> element
-- often these correspond to SUSANNE "idioms", sometimes they do not, but
in either case the separate orthographic words appear on separate lines
in CHRISTINE. Also, occasionally BNC erroneously runs together items which
ought by its own standards to be separate words -- for instance, text T21
contains a passage where the BNC source has a "word":
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>five.The</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
produced by leaving out spaces between adjacent orthographic sentences,
and in CHRISTINE this form is split into its separate words. In such cases,
where words after the first do not have their own <TT>&lt;w></TT> tag in
the BNC file, the intention was that the CHRISTINE source location code
should identify the first character in the BNC file belonging to the
respective
word. Unfortunately, misunderstandings within the CHRISTINE project meant
that this plan was not correctly executed, so that the byte count for such
a word will fall within the appropriate BNC <TT>&lt;w></TT> element but
in some cases will not coincide with the initial character of the relevant
word.

<P>Where a CHRISTINE word line represents an analytic item supplied
as part of the structural annotation and having no equivalent in the BNC
source -- for instance, a "ghost" node (<I>EFC, </I>p. 353ff.) or "trace"
representing the logical position of a constituent which appears elsewhere
in surface structure -- the source location code is a sequence of seven
zeros.
<H3>
6.8&nbsp; Source Transcription Field</H3>
The source transcription field is used to record various categories of
information about the wording as transcribed in the source files (in the
case of CHRISTINE/I, the BNC files) which it is convenient to eliminate
from the CHRISTINE word field. The source transcription field always contains
a string of one or more characters; in the majority of word lines, to which
none of the relevant categories of information applies, the field contains
a pipe symbol, "<TT>|</TT>", as placeholder.

<P>Source transcription fields not containing the one-byte string "<TT>|</TT>"
contain some combination of one or more of the following elements, in the
order given:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>&amp; y i I c s t *</TT> punctuation-marks</BLOCKQUOTE>
Many of these items are mutually incompatible, but some source transcription
fields do contain more than one character.

<P>The meanings of the various items occurring in source transcription
fields are as follows:
<UL><B>ampersand,<TT> &amp;</TT></B>:&nbsp; Beginning of a stretch of wording
that is marked in the source file as occurring either simultaneously with
another speaker's wording, or after wording by another speaker that is
placed later in the CHRISTINE file.&nbsp; There are two types of situation
in the BNC transcriptions which lead to an ampersand appearing in the
CHRISTINE
source transcription field:
<UL>
<LI>
As discussed in &sect;5.5, BNC source units are re-ordered in CHRISTINE
so as to ensure that a continuous grammatical structure uttered by any
speaker is always grouped within a single speaker turn, even if BNC split
it into multiple turns in order to show another speaker's utterance
interrupting
it.&nbsp; In such cases, the first word line following the interruption
has an ampersand in the CHRISTINE source transcription field.&nbsp; (Because
the source location codes show the ordering of elements within the original
BNC file, they could if wished be used to reconstruct the relative timing
of wording as shown in BNC in such cases.)</LI>

<LI>
BNC also uses a system for marking different speakers' wording as
simultaneous.&nbsp;
Time-pointer entities (SGML tags with the generic identifier <TT>ptr</TT>
and numerical attributes) are inserted into utterances in matching pairs,
broadly in the following pattern:</LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>speaker A:<TT>&nbsp; <I>a b c </I>&lt;ptr 1> <I>d e f g
</I>&lt;ptr
2></TT>
<BR>speaker B:<TT>&nbsp; &lt;ptr 1> <I>h i j k l </I>&lt;ptr 2> <I>m n
o p</I></TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Pointers with the same number are intended to mark the same time point,
so the net effect is to show that speaker A's words <I><TT>d e f g</TT></I>
were uttered simultaneously with speaker B's <I><TT>h i j k l</TT></I>.&nbsp;
In CHRISTINE, the word line immediately following a time-pointer entity
(provided that there is such a line) has an ampersand in its source
transcription
field.&nbsp; Thus, in the example, words <I><TT>d</TT></I>, <I><TT>h</TT></I>,
and <I><TT>m</TT></I> would be marked with ampersands.[11]&nbsp; The
time-pointer
entities themselves are suppressed.&nbsp; (In early versions of the CHRISTINE
files, which kept the time pointers, they proved to interfere fairly severely
with the readability of speakers' utterances; the use of the ampersand
symbol described here seems a reasonable compromise between readability
and preservation of simultaneity data, but to find out just which stretches
of wording are asserted in BNC to be simultaneous users would need to consult
the original files.&nbsp; The CHRISTINE ampersand symbols show that BNC
makes such a claim, but the boundaries of the simultaneous stretches cannot
be reconstructed from CHRISTINE.)[12]
<BR>&nbsp;</UL>

<LI>
<B>y</B>:&nbsp; The line corresponds not to a linguistic form uttered
by the speaker, but to an analytic element inserted to mark the structure
of the utterance -- a "ghost", wordtagged YG, or an "interruption point",
wordtagged YR.</LI>

<LI>
<B>i</B>:&nbsp; The item in the word field is either an <TT>{unclear}</TT>
element, marking a section of the utterance where the transcriber could
not make the wording out, or it is a word guessed by the transcriber but
which was too indistinct for the transcription to be reliable.&nbsp; (The
second case is not exemplified in CHRISTINE/I, but will occur in some of
the texts included in the full CHRISTINE Corpus.)</LI>

<LI>
<B>I</B> (not used in CHRISTINE/I):&nbsp; The transcriber has marked part
but not all of the form in the word field as unclear.</LI>

<LI>
<B>c</B>:&nbsp; The word field contains a non-linguistic item, of one of
the kinds defined in &sect;8.</LI>

<LI>
<B>s</B>:&nbsp; The transcriber marked the form in the word field "sic",
implying that it is odd or unexpected in some way.</LI>

<LI>
<B>t</B>:&nbsp; The transcriber marked the form in the word field as
"truncated":&nbsp;
whether or not the form coincides in orthography with some complete English
word, it should be understood as a representation of an incomplete word.</LI>

<LI>
<B>asterisk, *</B>:&nbsp; Where the word in the BNC transcription had an
initial capital, but the word is not intrinsically capitalized and the
capital has been changed to lower case in CHRISTINE in accordance with
the rules of &sect;7.8, the source transcription field contains an
asterisk.&nbsp;
Thus, in the T02.tx specimen above, Gemma006's first word appeared in the
original BNC file as <I>It</I>.</LI>

<LI>
<B>punctuation marks</B>:&nbsp; Any character in the source transcription
field other than <TT>&amp; y i I c s t *</TT> or "<TT>|</TT>" as placeholder
is a punctuation mark which in the original BNC transcription was written
following the form in the word field.&nbsp; Thus, in the T02.tx specimen,
Gemma006's last word appeared in the original BNC transcription as
<I>want?</I></LI>
</UL>
In a very few cases, a word in the BNC sources is immediately followed
by more than one punctuation mark.&nbsp; For instance the BNC file from
which text T19 was extracted has a number of instances of a word followed
by question mark and comma, in that order.&nbsp; In such cases, both marks
appear in the CHRISTINE source transcription field in the appropriate order,
after any of the characters listed earlier as valid elements in source
transcription fields.&nbsp; (In every case of multiple punctuation marks,
the BNC file treats them as separate "words" -- there are no cases in
CHRISTINE
where, say, a sequence of two hyphens has been used to represent a single
dash.&nbsp; There is one case, discussed in the relevant notes file, where
BNC represents a punctuation mark as separated from the preceding word
by a space; in all other cases punctuation marks in the source transcription
field should be understood as attached directly to the end of the word
field contents.)
<H3>
6.9&nbsp; Wordtag Field</H3>
The wordtag field contains a code representing the grammatical classification
of the word. Wordtags are normally strings of two or more characters,
beginning
with two capital letters, drawn from the class of wordtags defined in
<I>EFC</I>
supplemented by some additional wordtags for spoken English (listed in
&sect;13.1). (Note that the relatively precise set of wordtags for spoken
"discourse items", defined on pp. 447-8 of <I>EFC</I>, is used in place
of the generic "interjection" wordtag UH defined on p. 118 of that book
-- UH does not occur in the CHRISTINE Corpus.) The only cases where the
wordtag field contains something other than a string beginning with two
capitals is in lines representing non-speech "events" (&sect;8.5), where
the wordtag field contains a hyphen.
<H3>
6.10&nbsp; Word Field</H3>
A word field contains a sequence of one or more characters; these sequences
fall into three classes, distinguished by the contents of the source
transcription
field on the relevant line:
<UL>
<LI>
If the source transcription field contains the character <TT>y</TT>, the
the word field on that line does not contain a spoken form but 
corresponds to an analytic
element -- a theoretical entity inserted into the word stream as part of
the machinery for representing the structure of the wording.&nbsp; In
such lines, the word field may contain:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
a <b>hyphen</b>, in cases where the parse tree contains a
a <b>ghost</b> or "trace" node -- an item which belongs logically within the
tagma in question, but which appears physically within some other tagma,
where it will be marked as functioning as a <B>guest</B> or as a
surface-but-not-logical
subject or object</LI>

<LI>
or a <tt><b>#</b></tt> symbol, representing
an <B>interruption point</B> -- a device for representing the structure
of dysfluent speech, as explained in <I>EFC</I>, pp. 448-56</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
If the source transcription field contains the character <TT>c</TT>, the
contents of the word field represents a non-linguistic item such as a silent
pause, a cough, or an "event" such as a telephone ring.&nbsp; Perhaps
illogically,
the item <TT>{unclear}</TT>, representing a stretch of wording which the
transcriber could not make out, is classified as a "non-linguistic
item".&nbsp;
On the coding of various kinds of non-linguistic item, see &sect;8.&nbsp;
(The character <TT>c</TT> is used because the London-Lund Corpus describes
representations of non-linguistic items as "contextual comments".)</LI>

<LI>
Any other word field sequence, i.e. one in a line whose source transcription
field contains neither of the characters <TT>y c</TT>, represents a word
uttered by the relevant speaker, displayed in citation form (with an initial
capital only in the case of intrinsically capitalized words, such as
<I>London</I>).&nbsp;
The remainder of this subsection deals with word fields of this third class,
which are the majority.</LI>
</UL>
On the rules for standardizing the orthography of word field contents,
see &sect;7.2.

<P>As in the SUSANNE Corpus, enclitics such as those at the end of the
words <I>won't</I>, <I>she'd</I>, are treated as separate words on lines
of their own.&nbsp; The Germanic genitive suffix as in <I>John's book </I>is
treated as an enclitic for purposes of word division.&nbsp; In the few
cases where a form ending phonetically in a sibilant must in context be
seen as a regular genitive plural, as in <I>both girls' books</I>, the
apostrophe alone is split from the stem and treated as a separate word
on its own line.&nbsp; (In the context of speech this is an odd procedure,
since this "word" never has any phonetic substance at all, but it is the
logical consequence of the preceding rules which in most cases give sensible
and convenient results.)

<P>Again as in SUSANNE, whenever the contents of a word field would in
ordinary English orthography follow the contents of the preceding word
field immediately, without an intervening space or spaces, a plus sign
is prefixed to the later word field.&nbsp; Thus the word <I>won't</I> is
divided between two lines as
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>wo</TT>
<BR><TT>+n't</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
(note that nothing in the <I>earlier</I> word field marks <I>wo</I> as
something other than an independent word); and <I>gotta</I> as a reduced
form of <I>got to</I> is represented in CHRISTINE as
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>got</TT>
<BR><TT>+ta</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The CHRISTINE words are tagged and otherwise analysed like their unreduced
equivalents:&nbsp; <TT>wo</TT>, <TT>+n't</TT>, and <TT>+ta</TT> are given
the same wordtags as <I>will</I>, <I>not</I>, and <I>to</I> respectively.

<P>(The other main use of the plus sign in word fields of the SUSANNE Corpus,
in connexion with punctuation marks, is not relevant to the CHRISTINE
Corpus.&nbsp;
When BNC transcriptions contain words followed by punctuation marks, the
punctuation is moved into a different field in CHRISTINE as not part of
the spoken material.&nbsp; Punctuation marks attached to the beginnings
of words, such as left bracket or opening inverted commas, do not occur
in the speech transcriptions.)

<P>On the treatment of hyphenated forms, see &sect;7.12.
<H3>
6.11&nbsp; Parse Field</H3>
Parse fields in successive CHRISTINE word lines define a labelled tree
structure over the corresponding sequence of <TT>word_wordtag</TT> pairs,
considered as leaves of the tree, in the same manner as in the SUSANNE
Corpus.

<P>A parse tree for a sequence of words is represented as a labelled
bracketing,
with labels always repeated in full inside each of paired brackets
(immediately
following an opening square bracket, and immediately preceding a closing
square bracket), and with no spacing between adjacent bracket/label strings
(the label of the first opening bracket is immediately followed by the
second opening bracket, and so on).&nbsp; The character string for an entire
tree ("tree string") is divided between the parse fields of successive
word lines, in a way that is rather cumbersome to define in words but which
is natural and easily grasped from an example:&nbsp; cf. the sample from
T02.tx shown earlier in this section.

<P>In every word line, the parse field contains a full stop, representing
the <TT>word_wordtag</TT> pair.&nbsp; To the left of the stop is shown
the maximal subsegment of the tree string which consists entirely of labelled
opening brackets such that the last one represents the node whose first
daughter is the <TT>word_wordtag</TT> pair in question.&nbsp; To the right
of the stop is shown the maximal subsegment of the tree string which consists
entirely of labelled closing brackets such that the first one represents
the node whose last daughter is the <TT>word_wordtag</TT> pair in
question.&nbsp;
It follows that a word which occurs medially within the tagma immediately
dominating it will have a word field consisting just of a full stop character.

<P>Referring back to the T02.tx sample:&nbsp; Gemma006's turn begins with
a tree whose root is labelled <TT>S</TT> and has four daughter nodes labelled
<TT>Ni:s</TT>, <TT>Vzb</TT>, <TT>P:e</TT>, and <TT>Rsw:c</TT>
respectively.&nbsp;
The first and second of these nodes, labelled <TT>Ni:s</TT> and <TT>Vzb</TT>,
each immediately dominates a single leaf node, <TT>it_PPH1</TT> and the
enclitic <TT>+<I>'</I>s_VBZ</TT> respectively.&nbsp; The <TT>P:e</TT> node
has the two leaves <TT>per_IIp</TT> and <TT>foot_NNU1c</TT> as
daughters.&nbsp;
Gemma006's second tree again has an <TT>S</TT> root with four daughter
nodes, labelled <TT>Rs:c</TT>, <TT>Ny:s</TT>, <TT>Vdc</TT>, and <TT>Ti:z</TT>,
and the last of these has daughters of which the first is itself nonterminal,
labelled <TT>Vi</TT> (and the second is an analytic element, <TT>#</TT>,
indicating the fact that the <TT>Ti:z</TT> tagma is incomplete).&nbsp;
This is followed by a degenerate "tree" in which a silent pause,
<TT>{pause}_YP</TT>,
is both root and sole terminal node; and the turn finishes with a tree
having a root labelled <TT>S?</TT> and four daughters each of which
immediately
dominates a leaf.

<P>A parse tree is always complete within a single speaker turn (and
therefore,
a fortiori, within a single text division); in other words, turn header
and division header lines never interrupt a parse tree.&nbsp; Source-units,
on the other hand, are segments of the BNC transcriptions which are preserved
in CHRISTINE for reference purposes but do not necessarily correspond to
any linguistic realities.&nbsp; Therefore source-unit header lines may,
and often do, occur medially within parse trees.

<P>Definitions of the meanings of the bracket labels, S, Ni:s, etc., are
outside the purview of the present document.&nbsp; The bulk of the labelling
scheme is defined in great detail in <I>EFC</I>.&nbsp; Much of that book
deals with notation that is equally applicable to written or spoken English;
its Chapter 6 describes features of the scheme applying particularly to
speech.&nbsp; The present documentation file, in &sect;13-14, does list
and discuss additional speech annotation symbols and guidelines which have
proved necessary in the light of experience with the CHRISTINE project,
but those sections are written on the assumption that readers are familiar
with the contents of <I>EFC</I>.
<H2>
7. Orthography</H2>

<H3>
7.1&nbsp; Phonetic Transcription</H3>
I begin this section by identifying the system of phonetic transcription
used, because later subsections of the present document include such
transcriptions.

<P>Phonetic transcriptions are shown (in this documentation file, and in
CHRISTINE text files) as character-sequences enclosed in square brackets,
using the SAM-PA broad phonetic notation for English, as defined in Gibbon
et al. (1997: 699ff.); except that, for reasons discussed in Sampson
(forthcoming),
the ampersand rather than opening curly bracket symbol is used for the
<I>pat</I> vowel.&nbsp; (The SAM-PA system assigns the ampersand symbol
to a slightly different vowel which does not occur in English.)

<P>Linguists for whom the "emic/etic" distinction is important might prefer
to enclose broad phonetic notation such as that of the SAM-PA system within
slashes (solidi) rather than square brackets.&nbsp; For the CHRISTINE Corpus,
the distinction has little significance, and we use square brackets with
phonetic notation in all cases.

<P>(CHRISTINE/I contains only one instance of a form represented by phonetic
transcription, but the full CHRISTINE Corpus will include many more cases
in its text files.)
<H3>
7.2&nbsp; Spelling Standards</H3>
Different BNC speech files were transcribed by various workers, and it
does not appear from the finished BNC that strong copy-editing standards
were imposed, either via instructions to the transcribers or via post-editing.
There is considerable orthographic variation, including quite a number
of straightforward spelling mistakes.

<P>For computer processing it is desirable that orthographic details should
be standardized wherever possible, even in cases where the norms of English
permit variation between alternative forms. CHRISTINE treats the orthographic
usage of the <I>Concise Oxford Dictionary</I> (8th edition, 1990) as standard.
Spellings in the original BNC files which deviate from <I>COD</I> usage
are changed in CHRISTINE wordfields to agree with <I>COD</I>. Where <I>COD</I>
lists alternative spellings (e.g. <I>gaol</I>, <I>jail</I>), CHRISTINE
uses the one shown as primary in <I>COD</I>. The <I>-ize</I> form of the
<I>-ize/-ise</I> suffix is used.[13]

<P>Wherever orthographic forms in CHRISTINE deviate, for this or other
reasons, from the form in the original BNC file, a note of the difference
is included in the relevant notes file.

<P>In some particularly common cases, changes to the orthography of the
BNC transcriptions are made without logging them in the notes files:
<UL>
<LI>
<I>alright</I> is consistently emended to <I>all right</I> (the orthography
approved by <I>COD</I>)</LI>

<LI>
<I>percent</I> is consistently emended to <I>per cent</I> (the orthography
approved by <I>COD</I>)</LI>

<LI>
the form <I>OK</I> is used for <I>OK/okay/O.K.</I></LI>

<LI>
the spoken abbreviation for (post-1970) pence is shown in CHRISTINE as
<I>p</I> (BNC commonly shows it as capital<I> P</I>)</LI>

<LI>
double-figure numbers such as <I>twenty-three</I> are consistently shown
in CHRISTINE as single hyphenated words irrespective of how they are treated
in the source transcriptions -- BNC commonly, though not invariably, uses
the style <I>twenty three</I></LI>
</UL>
Applying this standardization policy consistently depends on the analyst
spotting cases where BNC orthography needed to be checked against <I>COD</I>;
we had no means of enforcing the policy automatically. There will be cases
which have escaped us. But I believe such cases in CHRISTINE/I are few.
<H3>
7.3&nbsp; Unusual Spellings of Christian Names</H3>
In some cases, BNC transcriptions include unusual spellings of Christian
names.&nbsp; In recent years, it has become fashionable for unusual spellings
of traditional Christian names (particularly girls' names) to be used as
individuals' official names.&nbsp; However, there is no way that a BNC
transcriber could have known that a particular individual mentioned in
a dialogue, but not a participant in it, spelled his or her name in a special
way; so CHRISTINE replaces such spellings with standard spellings.&nbsp;
(Where a person shown in BNC with an unusually-spelled name was a dialogue
participant, his or her true name is changed in CHRISTINE anyway, for
anonymization
purposes.)
<H3>
7.4&nbsp; Nonstandard Wording v. Nonstandard Pronunciation</H3>
The issue of orthographic standardization relates only to standardizing
the written representation of whatever words were uttered by speakers.
Speakers' words are not themselves changed, when their usage deviates from
the standard. An idiosyncratic written form which seems to represent a
purely phonological dialect variation is replaced by standard spelling:
for instance, in text T39 the BNC original has the form <I>wents</I>,
apparently
representing a Liverpool pronunciation of <I>went</I>, and this is changed
to <I>went</I> in CHRISTINE file T39.tx (with a record of the change in
T39.nb). It is very unlikely that a BNC transcriber who recorded an occasional
nonstandard pronunciation in this manner would do so consistently. But
when the speaker's words themselves, or the structure in which the words
are arranged, differ from standard English, CHRISTINE records what was
actually said, not what would be said in the standard language. A Northern
speaker's <I>nowt</I> for <I>nothing</I> appears as <I>nowt</I> in CHRISTINE;
<I>he done it</I> as a nonstandard equivalent of <I>he did it</I> appears
as <I>he done it</I>. This type of usage variation, which is lexical or
grammatical rather than phonological, is part of the subject-matter of
the CHRISTINE enterprise, to be preserved for study rather than discarded;
and non-expert transcribers would normally be well able to reproduce it
consistently.

<P>An intermediate case is where a spelling is standardly used to represent
some special pronunciation. It is not "idiosyncratic" for a transcriber
occasionally to write <I>'e</I> for an H-less pronunciation of <I>he</I>,
or <I>an'</I> for a reduced form of <I>and</I>. Logically, it might have
been appropriate to change <I>'e</I> and <I>an'</I> to <I>he</I> and
<I>and</I>
in CHRISTINE (again there is unlikely to have been any consistency in
transcribers'
use of the deviant orthography), but this was not done; where arguments
are evenly balanced, it seemed best not to alter the material in our sources.
<H3>
7.5&nbsp; The Word <I>Cos</I></H3>
The spelling <I>cos</I> deserves special mention. The standard-English
word <I>because</I> is often reduced to a monosyllable which novelists,
etc., frequently show as <I>cos</I>, and many examples of this form appear
in our source material. There is an argument for saying that colloquial
<I>cos</I> and standard <I>because</I>, while undoubtedly sharing a common
origin, should be regarded as separate grammatically-distinct words in
current spoken usage. <I>Because</I> in standard English is a subordinating
conjunction; colloquial <I>cos</I> very often (impressionistically, more
often than any other subordinating conjunctions) begins a clause which
stands alone, or which displays only a vague logical relationship with
what precedes (as if <I>cos</I> were a co-ordinating conjunction like
<I>and</I>),
rather than being used to express the precise causative or inferential
relationship expressed by <I>because</I> in written English.

<P>The CHRISTINE Corpus preserves the orthographic form <I>cos</I> where
it occurs in the sources, rather than standardizing it to <I>because</I>,
but in other respects the word is treated as identical to <I>because</I>:
a clause beginning with <I>cos</I> is analysed as an adverbial subordinate
clause (Fa), even if it is used as an independent statement. This arguably
is a distortion of the structural realities of the spoken language.[14]
<H3>
7.6&nbsp; <I>Of</I> After Modal Verb</H3>
Another nonstandard orthographic practice proved controversial. There are
many cases in the BNC transcriptions where perfective forms are written
with <I>of</I> in place of <I>have</I>, e.g. <I>could of been</I>. This
is an orthographic deviation of long standing in English; Caldwell (1998)
quotes it as used by the American writer Booth Tarkington in his 1914 novel
<I>Penrod</I> as a device to suggest lack of interest in education. My
assumption was that this should be classified as a spelling mistake on
the transcribers' part; when unstressed, both <I>have</I> and <I>of</I>
are regularly reduced to the pronunciation [@v], and some people choose
the wrong spelling for this pronunciation in the relevant context.
Consequently,
the policy adopted in CHRISTINE is to change sequences such as <I>could
of been</I> to <I>could've been</I>. But one of my researchers who has
an English-teaching background urged strongly that this policy is misguided,
because for many speakers the word really is <I>of</I> rather than
<I>have</I>,
so that a sequence like <I>could of been</I> should be seen not as a spelling
mistake but as grammatical deviance. Presumably this would imply that the
speakers in question would sometimes produce a full vowel, [Qv], in such
a sequence.

<P>Even if that is so, nothing could guarantee that BNC transcribers wrote
<I>of</I> in just those cases where the respective speakers thought of
the word as <I>of</I> (in most if not all cases the sound on the tape will
have had an obscure vowel). But I record the disagreement here, because
it seems a matter of some linguistic interest. On the face of it, the
pervasiveness
of <I>of</I> for <I>have</I> in the writing of perfective forms is surprising,
because the logic of English verb groups might seem to make it obvious
that [@v] in this context stands for <I>have</I> (no-one, surely, would
ask <I>Of you seen this?</I> instead of <I>Have you seen this?</I>). The
notes files show which cases of <I>+'ve</I> in CHRISTINE correspond to
<I>of</I> in BNC.
<H3>
7.7&nbsp; <I>Worth</I> After Genitive</H3>
There is variation in the BNC transcriptions between the use of s-apostrophe
and plain plural forms in the construction <I>(ten) pounds' worth/pounds
worth</I>. CHRISTINE uses the s-apostrophe form, as in standard orthography,
and analyses the wording before <I>worth</I> as a genitive phrase. (Note
however that one speaker uses the phrase <I>seventy-two pound worth</I>,
T13.00974; no attempt is made to represent this as a genitive construction.)
<H3>
7.8&nbsp; Capitals</H3>
With respect to initial capitals, the contents of CHRISTINE word fields
are intended to display words as citation forms, not as they would appear
in a running text. Thus the name <I>London</I>, or the pronoun <I>I</I>,
appear with capitals in CHRISTINE, because these words are intrinsically
capitalized. On the other hand, if an utterance begins with the article
<I>the</I>, this will be shown in the CHRISTINE wordfield as <I>the</I>
even though an ordinary transcription would capitalize it as sentence-initial.
The aim of CHRISTINE is to identify the individual words used by speakers,
in a standard format, and to show via the parsefield annotations what spoken
grammatical structures the words enter into -- it is not to mimic the special
structural norms of the written language.

<P>This policy has consequences which users may find surprising, in the
case of proper names derived from universal terms. For reasons which are
discussed at length in <I>EFC</I>, pp. 86-90, and will not be rehearsed
here, the SUSANNE wordtagging standards define the concept "proper noun"
in a very restrictive way: except for names of persons, universal terms
used as names are wordtagged as universal terms, and hence in the CHRISTINE
Corpus they appear in lower case. The SUSANNE annotation scheme treats
"being a name" as a property of the syntactic category noun phrase, rather
than of individual words. Hence (to use the <I>EFC</I> example) a reference
to the town of Flagstaff in Arizona would appear in the CHRISTINE wordfield
as <I>flagstaff</I>, classified in the wordtag field as a countable common
noun, though the parsefield would show the wordtag dominated by a tagmatag
Nn..., "proper noun phrase".

<P>Cases where word-initial capitals in the original BNC transcriptions
correspond to lower case in CHRISTINE files are reflected by asterisks
in the CHRISTINE source transcription field (&sect;6.8). In some cases,
notes on orthographic corrections in the notes files show that a lower-case
form in the original BNC transcription has been capitalized, because standard
English orthographic norms require a capital although the transcriber failed
to write one; but what this means in practice is that the form occurs in
lower case in the CHRISTINE word field (because the SUSANNE annotation
rules require it to appear in lower case) but an asterisk occurs in the
source transcription field, showing that it would be capitalized in a standard
orthographic transcription. For instance, at T06.00637 the original BNC
transcription has the form <I>the incredible hulk</I>.&nbsp; The speaker
was referring to a cartoon character, <I>the Incredible Hulk</I>; so the
notes file has a comment to the effect that <I>incredible hulk</I> has
been emended to <I>Incredible Hulk</I>, but (because the words
<I>incredible</I>
and <I>hulk</I> are universal terms) the CHRISTINE text file actually displays
the words as <I>incredible</I> and <I>hulk</I>, with asterisks in the
corresponding
source transcription fields.

<P>(However, correcting the BNC transcribers' use of capitals with names
formed from universal terms is not an issue on which great effort has been
expended. For instance, at T26.00756 the original BNC file contains the
spelling <I>house of commons</I>, referring to the lower House of the UK
Parliament. By the SUSANNE annotation rules the words <I>house</I> and
<I>commons</I> must be shown in the CHRISTINE wordfields in lower case.
The phrase fits the SUSANNE definition of a proper noun phrase, so the
CHRISTINE parsefields give it an Nn... tag. Probably any publisher's stylebook
would require the phrase to be written <I>House of Commons</I>, contrary
to the BNC transcriber's usage, so ideally the notes file ought to include
a note "<I>house of commons</I> emended to <I>House of Commons</I>" and
the source-transcription fields for <I>house</I> and <I>commons</I> should
be given asterisks; but this has not been done.)

<P>There is variation in the BNC files between <I>God</I> and <I>god</I>,
in exclamations referring to the Deity. These cases are standardized to
the form <I>god</I> in the word field with an asterisk in the source
transcription
field, i.e. they are treated as if the original transcription had been
<I>God</I> in every case; the notes files do not record which examples
had lower-case <I>g</I> in the original.
<H3>
7.9&nbsp; Acronyms</H3>
A special issue arises in the case of acronyms. The original BNC files
differentiate between acronyms which are pronounced as ordinary words (e.g.
<I>NATO</I>, said [neIt@U]) and acronyms which are spelled out letter by
letter (e.g. <I>USA</I>, said [ju:eseI]). Cases like <I>NATO</I> are treated
in BNC as single words (written in modern style without abbreviatory stops);
cases like <I>USA</I> are transcribed as <TT>U S A</TT>, i.e. each individual
letter is treated as a separate word. For grammatical annotation, the latter
treatment is inconvenient; an acronym such as <I>USA</I> functions
grammatically
as "one word" as much as an acronym like <I>NATO</I>, and treating <I>USA</I>
as three words is not an appropriate way of indicating the conventional
pronunciation of the word. (We do not transcribe <I>knight</I> in a special
way to indicate that it is conventionally pronounced [naIt] rather than
[knIxt].) Consequently, <I>USA</I>-type acronyms are assimilated to
<I>NATO</I>-type
acronyms in CHRISTINE text files; but the notes files log such cases, with
remarks in the form "<I>U S A</I> emended to <I>USA</I>".
<H3>
7.10&nbsp; Special Characters</H3>
Where the <I>COD</I> standard orthography of a word uses an accented or
other non-ASCII character, this is represented as an ISO 8879 Appendix
D entity (Goldfarb 1990: 506ff.) within angle brackets, e.g.
<TT>d&lt;eacute>tente</TT>.

<P>In the SUSANNE Corpus, the entity <TT>&lt;apos></TT> is used for the
apostrophe, to distinguish it from inverted comma. In a speech corpus,
inverted commas do not occur, so the ASCII character<TT> ' </TT>(code 39)
unambiguously means apostrophe and is used as such in CHRISTINE.
<H3>
7.11&nbsp; Anonymized Forms</H3>
The elements <TT>&lt;name></TT>, <TT>&lt;address></TT>, and
<TT>&lt;telNo></TT>
are used in CHRISTINE wordfields to represent names, addresses, and telephone
numbers which have been removed from the transcriptions for anonymization
purposes. (See &sect;4.1.)
<H3>
7.12&nbsp; Hyphens</H3>
Hyphenation is an area where practice in CHRISTINE deviates from the SUSANNE
norms, which often require written hyphens to be analysed as separate "words"
with their own wordtag and place in a parsetree. This would be inappropriate
in an analysed corpus of speech, since hyphens never have any phonetic
reality. The policy applied in CHRISTINE is as follows:

<P>In the case of set phrases, the authority of <I>COD</I> is used to decide
whether to treat them as single words written solid, single words written
with hyphens, or separate words (e.g. <I>wineglass</I>, <I>wine-glass</I>,
or <I>wine glass</I>). A case written by <I>COD</I> like <I>wineglass</I>
or <I>wine-glass</I> is treated as one word and appears on a single line
in CHRISTINE, with a single wordtag; a case written by <I>COD</I> like
<I>wine glass</I> is treated in CHRISTINE as a sequence of words each with
its own wordtag on a separate line, linked only by higher-level structuring
in the parsefields. If the spelling in the original BNC file deviates from
the <I>COD</I> standard, as in other cases of orthographic discrepancy
the BNC spelling is changed to match <I>COD</I>, with the emendation logged
in the notes file.

<P>CHRISTINE does, however, depart from the <I>COD</I> orthographic standard
in cases where <I>COD</I> treats a phrase as hyphenated but the phrase
is formed productively and the SUSANNE annotation scheme would treat it
as a sequence of words with internal grammatical relationships. For instance,
at T34.02863 the BNC file includes the form <I>blonde-haired</I>, and althogh
<I>COD</I> does not contain <I>blonde-haired</I> as a headword it is clear
from examples in the dictionary that it treats forms of the pattern
<I>X-haired</I>
as hyphenated words. However, the SUSANNE annotation scheme treats the
form as an adjective phrase consisting of <I>blonde</I> as a JJ word followed
by <I>haired</I> as a JJh word. Therefore CHRISTINE changes the BNC form
<I>blonde-haired</I> to <I>blonde haired</I> (logging the change in the
notes file), and analyses the form as a two-word phrase.

<P>Conversely, there are cases where a clear verb group contains a word,
written separately by the transcriber, which is not a verb; e.g. <I>you
ought to be <U>second</U> staging the whole thing</I> W22.00168.&nbsp;
In cases like this, CHRISTINE introduces a hyphen (so that
<I>second-staging</I>
as a whole is a present participle, and the infinitival verb group has
a normal internal structure) irrespective of the transcriber's
orthography.&nbsp;
Typically, such compounds are productive and will not be listed in
dictionaries,
but it seems likely that they would be hyphenated in careful written English.

<P>The Corpus includes a number of examples of the nonstandard regional
present participle with <I>a-</I> prefix, e.g <I>a-coming</I> (Trudgill
1990:80), which were sometimes treated as two words, <I>a coming</I>, by
the BNC transcribers. These forms are normalized in CHRISTINE to single
hyphenated words, <I>a-coming</I> (which are wordtagged like standard present
participles).
<H3>
7.13&nbsp; Distorted Words</H3>
Where an uttered form is too truncated or distorted to be transcribed as
a normal word, BNC usually represents it using letters with their conventional
English values, as would be done in a representation of broken dialogue
in a novel. Here the concept of standardizing spellings to consistent norms
does not apply. The option of replacing conventional orthography with phonetic
transcription was considered but rejected, because it would involve too
much guesswork about what sounds were intended. No attempt has been made
to eliminate meaningless variation, such as the representation of a truncated
utterance of <I>she</I> as <I>sh</I> or as <I>sh-</I> at different points
in the Corpus. Where a distorted form seems to have been capitalized purely
because it is "sentence"-initial, the capital is changed to lower case
in CHRISTINE. But in some cases capitals on distorted words have been left
to stand, because they may possibly have been intended to represent a
pronunciation
difference (e.g. <I>O</I> v. <I>o</I> could conceivably correspond to [@U]
v. [Q]).

<P>If it is possible to infer from context what word was intended, the
distorted word is given the appropriate wordtag followed by the normal
orthography of the word after a slash (e.g. <I>sh-</I> for <I>she</I> is
wordtagged <TT>PPHS1f/she</TT> -- see &sect;13.1, "Slash Wordtags"), and
a grammatical structure is assigned as if the word had been pronounced
normally.&nbsp; Where the grammatical category of the intended word is
not clear, it is wordtagged <TT>FD</TT> (distorted word) and is fitted
into the surrounding tree as if it were a meaningless noise.
<H2>
8. Non-linguistic Items</H2>

<H3>
8.1&nbsp; Vocalizations v. Events</H3>
<I>Curly brackets</I> are used in the wordfield to enclose non-linguistic
items: non-linguistic vocal sounds such as coughs, laughs, etc., vocal
shifts marking the beginning and end of stretches of speech which the original
transcribers noted as being uttered in a special manner, e.g. singing or
laughing, and "events" -- non-vocal noises such as telephone rings, music
playing, etc., together with occurrences such as mechanical breaks in the
recording.

<P>In principle there is room for debate about where the line should be
drawn in this area between vocalizations and "events", for instance children
shouting in the background would be vocalization from the point of view
of the children but is recorded as an "event" by BNC transcribers who are
attending to others' speech in the foreground; with a few exceptions,
CHRISTINE
follows the BNC classification.

<P>One case where CHRISTINE deviates from BNC practice relates to the items
recorded in BNC as "vocal" elements with the description attribute "tut".
These elements appear to represent the click sound (indicating various
emotions including mild disapproval) which novelists commonly show as "tsk"
in dialogue. Although not listed in <I>COD</I>, this might be regarded
as an item of English vocabulary rather than as a non-linguistic vocalization;
it is shown as <I>tsk</I>, wordtagged UX as an Expletive, in CHRISTINE.
<H3>
8.2&nbsp; Silent Pauses</H3>
Silent pauses are shown in CHRISTINE as <TT>{pause}</TT>, wordtagged YP.
<H3>
8.3&nbsp; Inaudible Wording</H3>
The element <TT>{unclear}</TT>, wordtagged YY, represents a form or sequence
of forms which the transcriber could not identify from the recording.
<H3>
8.4&nbsp; Non-linguistic Vocalizations</H3>
Non-linguistic vocal sounds are assigned the wordtag YV; and CHRISTINE
uses vocalization shift elements, tagged YVL and YVR, to show the beginning
and end of stretches of wording to which special vocal properties apply.
An item between curly brackets in the wordfield identifies the nature of
the vocal sound or vocalization shift. The following standard vocal categories
are represented in the CHRISTINE files by name:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>{belch}</TT>
<BR><TT>{clearsThroat}</TT>
<BR><TT>{cough}</TT>
<BR><TT>{crying}</TT>
<BR><TT>{giggle}</TT>
<BR><TT>{humming}</TT>
<BR><TT>{laugh}</TT>

<BR><TT>{singing}</TT>
<BR><TT>{sneeze}</TT>
<BR><TT>{sniff}</TT>
<BR><TT>{whistling}</TT>
<BR><TT>{yawn}</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
In the case of noun/present-participle doublets such as <TT>{laugh}</TT>
v. <TT>{laughing}</TT>, the present participle is used for shifts applying
over a word or words; a sound interrupting the sequence of words is commonly
shown in BNC with the noun, but sometimes the present participle is used
in such cases also, presumably to indicate that the sound lasted for an
appreciable period. CHRISTINE simply follows BNC usage in these cases.

<P>Other vocal sounds or shifts with more complex descriptions, or which
occur less frequently in conjunction with speech, are given numerical codes
and appear in the text files in the form <TT>{vocal99}</TT>. The meanings
of these codes are as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>01&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imitates woman's voice</TT>
<BR><TT>02&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imitating a sexy woman's voice</TT>

8.5&nbsp; Non-vocal Events</H3>
Non-vocal events are shown in the wordfield as elements of the form
<TT>{event...}</TT>,
with a two-digit code identifying the event-type, as follows (trivial
differences
between BNC event-descriptions, e.g "phone rings" v. "telephone rings",
are ignored):

These "events" are given no wordtag, since they are in no sense linguistic
elements. In such lines, the wordfield contains a hyphen as placeholder.
Logically speaking, events belong to no speaker turn; they are not given
header lines of their own, so, where an event actually occurred between
adjacent speaker turns, the CHRISTINE file looks as though the event was
the closing item of the immediately-preceding turn and source-unit.
<H3>
8.6&nbsp; Duration Markers</H3>
Whenever BNC specifies the approximate duration of a pause, nonlinguistic
vocalization, or "event", this is shown as a figure (in seconds) within
the curly brackets after an underscore character. Thus <TT>{pause_20}</TT>
means a silent pause lasting about 20 seconds, <TT>{humming_7}</TT> means
humming lasting for about 7 seconds, <TT>{vocal19_10}</TT> means an imitation
of vomiting lasting for about 10 seconds, <TT>{event25_600}</TT> means
loud music lasting about ten minutes, and so forth.[15]
<BR>&nbsp;
<H2>
&nbsp;9.&nbsp; Annotating Inaudible Wording</H2>
The transcriptions contain many passages where, because of poor recording
quality or for other reasons, the transcriber has failed to make out the
wording; in the CHRISTINE text files these passages are shown with the
entity <TT>{unclear}</TT>.&nbsp; In context it seems likely that
<TT>{unclear}</TT>
elements in many cases were momentary inarticulate sounds occurring in
the middle of passages which are well-formed and meaningful without them;
in other cases, the <TT>{unclear}</TT> entity certainly stands in place
of a fairly lengthy word sequence, so that the surrounding clear wording
is uninterpretable without knowledge of the unclear wording.&nbsp; In the
texts derived from BNC (all the texts contained in CHRISTINE/I), no
distinction
is normally made between these cases.

<P>When a substantial segment of an utterance is inaudible, it can often
be quite impossible to know how the surrounding clear wording fits into
a grammatical structure; the structure prescribed by the annotation scheme
might be quite different, depending on which of alternative plausible turns
of phrase are concealed behind the <TT>{unclear}</TT> notation.&nbsp; But
it is inevitable that annotated corpora based on recordings of real-life
speech will contain inaudible passages.&nbsp; BNC/demographic perhaps has
a higher incidence of such passages than some transcribed speech samples
(and the CHRISTINE excerpting process made no attempt to avoid passages
with much inaudible wording, for fear of biasing the selection of texts),
but some incidence of untranscribable wording will occur in any corpus
of spontaneous speech.&nbsp; An annotation scheme needs strategies for
dealing with such passages, which recognize the unavoidable structural
ambiguities, but specify a predictable annotation nevertheless.

<P>The CHRISTINE project has attempted to formulate a set of annotation
rules which prescribe how to draw a tree structure in cases where inaudible
wording means that the correct tree structure cannot be known, and which
specify what claims are implied by such structures, and what claims are
<I>not</I> implied, about the grammatical constructions actually produced
by the speakers.&nbsp; The rules as they stand are not entirely satisfactory;
but I hope that describing our practice as it has developed to date, and
the problems that remain, may help the discipline to find better ways forward
in this area.

<P>Our rules are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
Each <TT>{unclear}</TT> entity is given the wordtag YY.</LI>

<LI>
Each such entity is immediately dominated by a nonterminal node with the
special formtag Y.&nbsp; This node may also dominate clear wording before
and/or after the unclear stretch, in accordance with the next rules.</LI>

<LI>
Clear wording <I>preceding</I> the inaudible stretch will be dominated
by the Y node only if it clearly belongs to some tagma whose category is
unknown because of the inaudible stretch.&nbsp; This means that wording
in this position will usually not be included under the Y, because tagmas
commonly have characteristic first words (e.g. <I>the {unclear}</I> will
be an N, so the structure will be [N <I>the</I> [Y <I>{unclear}</I> ] ],
not [Y <I>the</I> <I>{unclear}</I> ].&nbsp; But, for instance, <I>and
{unclear}</I>
will be grouped together under a node Y+, because <I>and</I> must go with
what follows but the category of the tagma depends wholly on the inaudible
wording.</LI>

<LI>
Clear wording <I>following</I> the inaudible stretch, and any tagmatags
dominating that clear wording, are placed under the Y if it could well
be dominated by some unknown tagma which also dominates some of the inaudible
wording -- even if it could equally well not.&nbsp; Consequently, when
a "lineage" of nodes from a clear word up to a root node includes a Y node
somewhere, the annotation does not amount to a claim that the word is
definitely
part of the structure below that root.</LI>
</UL>
The reason why it has seemed appropriate for these two rules to be
non-symmetric
is that tagmas in English commonly have distinctive beginnings but not
distinctive endings.

<P>Although these rules depend on analysts' judgements about what is "clearly
true", or "could well be true", of the grammar of inaudible wording, this
is not intended to require analysts to consider every remote possibility
and base the analysis on what is absolutely guaranteed to be true or to
be impossible.&nbsp; Decisions must be made on the basis of common-sense
judgements about what alternative structures are reasonably plausible in
particular cases.
<UL>
<LI>
The Y node will be attached as daughter to the lowest node that clearly
dominates at least the first of the inaudible word(s), if there is such
a node -- nothing is implied about whether it dominates <I>all</I> the
inaudible words.&nbsp; Since we will often be quite unsure where even the
beginning of an inaudible stretch fits in, there will often be no node
meeting this condition, and the Y node will be treated as an independent
root node.</LI>

<LI>
Often, the wording before and after an inaudible stretch seems to be
continuous,
and the most plausible interpretation of the <TT>{unclear}</TT> marker
is that it represents some obscure noise such as throat-clearing rather
than any articulate wording at all.&nbsp; In cases like that, the inaudible
stretch is still dominated by a Y node, but this is attached like a U...
node or a punctuation mark in annotations of written language, as high
as possible without distorting the structure of the tree as it would have
been drawn if there were no inaudible material.</LI>
</UL>
&nbsp;To illustrate, consider the sequence <I>I {unclear} Sophie can walk
over</I>, T04.02592.&nbsp; This could represent something like "I might
go by car.&nbsp; Sophie can walk over." -- in other words, two separate
parsetrees.&nbsp; But it could equally be something like "I suppose Sophie
can walk over", where the wording from <I>Sophie</I> on is a clause
subordinate
to a verb within the inaudible stretch.&nbsp; Therefore we annotate the
sequence as:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[S [Nea:s<I> I</I> ] [Y <I>{unclear}</I> [S [Nns:s <I>Sophie</I>
] [Vc <I>can walk</I> ] [R:q <I>over</I> ] S] Y] S]</BLOCKQUOTE>
The <I>Sophie ...</I> clause might be an argument of an inaudible verb,
so it is placed under the Y even though it might alternatively be an
independent
sentence.&nbsp; The word<I> I </I>clearly begins some clause which must
continue within the inaudible stretch, so the Y is placed below the root
S.

<P>The rules above fix the shape of the trees, but there are also issues
about the node labels.
<UL>
<LI>
In the example above, <I>Sophie can walk over</I> would be tagged S if
it were an independent clause, but it would be Fn if the full wording were
"I suppose Sophie can walk over".&nbsp; This might suggest that this
clause-node
should also be labelled Y as "category uncertain"; but we do not use the
symbol Y in that way.&nbsp; Y is reserved for nodes which either dominate
at least one <TT>{unclear}_YY</TT> entity, or whose grammatical category
is unknown because they are interrupted before reaching a word which is
category-diagnostic -- e.g. [Y+ <I>and</I> # ].&nbsp; Wherever all the
words of a tagma are clear and the tagma is complete, it is given a specific
formtag, not Y.&nbsp; In cases like the one discussed, where two or more
alternative formtags could be appropriate depending on inaudible words
in the environment of the clause, we choose the most "unmarked" alternative;
Fn is a more specific category than S, so the <I>Sophie</I> ... clause
is labelled S.</LI>

<LI>
When a Y node clearly represents a constituent playing an identifiable
function within the tagma that immediately dominates it by the above rules,
then that function can be indicated as e.g. Y:o, Y:e, Y+, Y@ -- that is,
by adding a functiontag or a co-ordination/apposition symbol.&nbsp; But
Y may alternatively be written without a functiontag, even in a structural
environment where a functiontag would normally be required by the rules
of <I>EFC</I>, pp. 359-60, if the function is unsure or the inaudible wording
may not represent one single tagma.</LI>

<LI>
Where the <I>form</I> of a constituent is identifiable, and it occurs in
a position where the <I>EFC</I> rules require a functiontag, but the function
is unidentifiable because of unclear or interrupted wording, the functiontag
<TT>:y</TT> is used with an "ordinary" formtag.[16]</LI>

<LI>
Daughters of Y nodes are never given functiontags, even in cases where
their own function is unambiguous.&nbsp; The rationale here is that if
one cannot identify a construction, it is questionable to assign particular
functions to individual constituents of that construction.&nbsp; (In fact
it does sometimes happen that a tagma which by the above rules is shown
as daughter of a Y node can unambiguously be identified as, say, a Time
adjunct within <I>some</I> higher construction even though we do not know
what that construction is; but we do not include that functiontag in the
annotation.)</LI>

<BR>&nbsp;</UL>
If the tagmatag Y is used because wording is inaudible (rather than because
it was interrupted), then the Y node will normally <I>immediately</I> dominate
at least one <TT>{unclear}_YY</TT> entity.&nbsp; Occasionally, however,
the rules above mean that a Y node has to be created which dominates a
YY leaf only at two or more removes.&nbsp; Thus, in:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[Y+ [CC# <I>and</I> # <I>and</I> # <I>and</I> ] [Fa <I>if er</I>
[Y<I> {unclear}</I> ] Fa]<I> </I>Y+]&nbsp; T39.04812</BLOCKQUOTE>
the rules require the Y node which immediately dominates the
<TT>{unclear}</TT>
entity to be placed below Fa (its first words must surely have gone with
<I>if</I> as an adverbial clause).&nbsp; Probably, in reality, the
<TT>{unclear}</TT>
entity also included later words belonging to the construction within which
the Fa is embedded; but we do not know what these words were, so we have
no basis for labelling the higher construction anything more specific than
Y+.

<P>In some cases, the result of the rules is to create productions with
odd relationships between mother and daughter labels.&nbsp; Consider, for
instance:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[S ... [Fa:t <I>when I'm in love</I> ] [N:s <I>my</I> [Y
<I>{unclear}</I>
] N:s] S]&nbsp; T06.00615
<BR>[S? <I>who do you reckon</I> [Fn:o [Ns:s <I>this cheap</I> [Y
<I>{unclear}</I>
] Ns:s] Fn:o] S?]&nbsp; T20.03027</BLOCKQUOTE>
By the rules stated above, the <TT>{unclear}</TT> entity in the T06 case
is placed below the N:s node, creating the oddity of an S containing a
Time adjunct followed by a subject noun phrase but no verb or further
constituents.&nbsp;
(By comparison with another remark by the same speaker immediately afterwards,
it is likely that the inaudible wording here was something like <I>face
lights up</I>.)&nbsp; In the T20 case, we assume that <I>who</I> has been
<I>Wh</I>-Fronted out of a nominal clause whose subject began <I>this cheap
...</I>; the rules for Y result in an Fn tagma consisting of a subject
noun phrase and nothing else.

<P>These strange productions could be avoided, if we allowed
<TT>{unclear}</TT>
entities to be split in two, representing successive subsequences of the
inaudible wording; then, in the T06 case for instance, one <TT>{unclear}</TT>
entity could remain within the N:s tagma but another could be placed after
it, so that the S tagma would contain the more plausible sequence of
daughter-labels
"... N:s Y".&nbsp; But to split <TT>{unclear}</TT> entities up in this
way would require us to make assumptions which we have no basis for making,
about the wording lying behind the transcriber's <TT>{unclear}</TT>
notation.&nbsp;
For all we know, the speaker in T06 may have broken off her utterance at
or before the end of the subject phrase.&nbsp; CHRISTINE does not split
up single <TT>{unclear}</TT> entities in the sources into multiple entities;
we accept occasional odd productions such as those illustrated here as
the cost of fidelity to our data.
<H2>
10.&nbsp; Annotating Speech Repairs</H2>

<H3>
10.1&nbsp; Structure Before an Interruption</H3>
Where a speaker edits his output "on the fly", CHRISTINE uses the system
described in <I>EFC</I>, p. 448ff., for annotating the structures of repaired
speech, which makes heavy use of the symbol <TT>#</TT> to mark points where
a tagma is prematurely interrupted.

<P>The discussion in <I>EFC</I> of the use of the <TT>#</TT> symbol is
explicit about how a <TT>#</TT> element is fitted into the surrounding
tree; but it is not explicit about how an interrupted construction is
annotated.&nbsp;
Immediately before a "moment of interruption" there will often be words
which were intended to begin tagmas that were never completed.

<P>CHRISTINE practice is to include the tagmatags for interrupted tagmas,
provided it is reasonably clear what these were likely to have been --
even if the word(s) actually uttered before the point of interruption would
not, in fluent, unrepaired speech, justify the relevant tagma.&nbsp; For
instance, in the (invented) example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>I must have the must get the ticket</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
an interruption point occurs between <I>the</I> and <I>must</I>, and the
<TT>#</TT> symbol will be a daughter of an S node dominating the entire
sequence; before the <TT>#</TT>, the word <I>the</I> (alone) will be
tagmatagged
N:o, although <I>the</I> alone would never be counted as a noun phrase
in fluent, unrepaired speech:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[S [Nea:s <I>I</I> ] [Vc <I>must have</I> ] [N:o <I>the</I>
] # [Vc <I>must get</I> ] [Ns:o <I>the ticket</I> ] S]</BLOCKQUOTE>
Again, the phrase:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[P <I>in</I> [N [G <I>people's</I> ] ] # <I>in</I> [Np [G
<I>people's
</I>] <I>minds</I> ] ]&nbsp; W22.00164</BLOCKQUOTE>
is analysed as shown, with the first G subordinate to an N that would
certainly
have been required in the structure if the speaker had not interrupted
himself.&nbsp; A single word will be given a phrasetag node below another
phrasetag, contrary to the normal SUSANNE rule, if that word would have
been part of a multi-word phrase which was interrupted after the first
word.

<P>In these cases, no subcategory letter is added to the "N".&nbsp; In
context it is a fair bet that the interrupted noun phrases, if completed,
would have been respectively <I>the ticket</I> and <I>people's minds</I>,
like the complete phrases which were uttered after the interruption points;
but the parts of the interrupted phrases that were actually uttered are
not marked for number, so we would not write Ns:o or Np.&nbsp; The general
principle is that, so far as it is possible to work it out, the overall
shape of the tree dominating interrupted wording should be what it would
have been if the wording had been completed, with the same number of nodes
labelled with the same main categories and functiontags; but detailed
subcategory
symbols are added only for features which are actually marked in the forms
uttered.

<P>One can scarcely ever be 100% sure how interrupted wording would have
been completed.&nbsp; Consequently, an element of guesswork is unavoidable
in this area; we allow ourselves to make reasonable guesses about the balance
of probability, in order to produce a meaningful structural annotation.&nbsp;
For instance, we created quite a lot of "hypothetical structure" for the
example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>they're new cases here though are, well no have you seen
...&nbsp; </I>T30.00633</BLOCKQUOTE>
The BNC transcriber's comma evidently marks a point where the speaker
interrupted
himself.&nbsp; The likeliest explanation occurring to us for the word
<I>are</I>
is that it was intended to begin a tag question, so the CHRISTINE annotation
is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[S ... <I>they're new cases here though</I> [Iq [S? [Vab<I>
are </I>] ] ] #<I> well</I>_UW<I> no</I>_UN [Vo<I> have </I>] ...
]</BLOCKQUOTE>
Often the intended role of words preceding an interruption is quite opaque,
and in those cases no tagmatags are inserted (even though the consequence
may be to create grammatically-odd relationships between the labels of
mother and daughter nodes).&nbsp; But where it is possible, by postulating
interrupted constructions that seem at least highly plausible, to make
the material immediately before an interruption point into part of a normal
grammatical tree structure, we do this.
<H3>
10.2&nbsp; "Markovian" Syntax</H3>
A phenomenon akin to speech repairs, though without a "point of interruption",
is what might be called "Markovian" syntax.&nbsp; I mean by this a sequence
of words which are such that, if a window of limited size were moved through
the sequence, the words inside the window at any point would appear to
cohere as part of a normal grammatical structure, but no such structure
can be imposed on the entire sequence from beginning to end.&nbsp; CHRISTINE
contains a number of examples.&nbsp; The following case was uttered by
Anthony Wedgwood Benn, MP, on a radio discussion programme:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>and what is happening {pause} in Britain today {pause} is
ay- demand for an entirely new foreign policy quite different from the
cold war policy {pause} is emerging from the Left</I>&nbsp;
X01.00539-45</BLOCKQUOTE>
With respect to what precedes it, the long noun phrase <I>an entirely new
foreign policy quite different from the cold war policy</I> functions as
the complement of a prepositional phrase postmodifying <I>demand</I>, which
in turn is the complement of a main clause headed by <I>is</I>.&nbsp; On
the other hand, with respect to what follows, that same noun phrase is
subject of a main clause headed by <I>is emerging</I>.

<P>In a case like this, it is not really meaningful to identify a single
point where one grammatical plan is abandoned in favour of another.&nbsp;
In this particular example, the fact that the transcriber recorded a pause
immediately after <I>cold war policy</I> but no pause immediately before
<I>an entirely</I> might perhaps tempt one to say that the noun phrase
is "really" the complement of <I>for</I>, and that a new clause lacking
a subject is initiated after the pause; but there are other cases where
the "hinge" element of a Markovian sequence has no pause either immediately
before or immediately after it.

<P>However, we have found no way of annotating Markovian sequences other
than by imposing an arbitrary division and treating the hinge element as
belonging to one of the constructions to which it is adjacent and not to
the other.&nbsp;&nbsp; A sequence in which a single element plays roles
simultaneously in two separate constructions resists analysis in terms
of tree-shaped constituency diagrams (or, equivalently, in terms of labelled
bracketings of word-strings).&nbsp; Yet constituency analysis is so solidly
established as the appropriate formalism for representing natural-language
structure in general that it seems impractical to think of abandoning it,
merely in order to deal with one special type of speech repair.

11.&nbsp; Annotating Nonstandard Usage</H2>

<H3>
11.1&nbsp; Dialect Difference v. Performance Error</H3>
The UK contains an intricate diversity of English dialects, and CHRISTINE
includes many turns of phrase that are clearly deviant with respect to
standard English.&nbsp; At the phonological level, there are good published
descriptions of nonstandard English dialects; but phonology is not our
concern on the CHRISTINE project.&nbsp; At the level of grammatical structure,
the literature on dialects other than the national standard is less
well-developed.&nbsp;
(Leading publications are Trudgill 1990, Trudgill &amp; Chambers 1991,
Milroy &amp; Milroy 1993.)&nbsp; This means that formulating consistent,
sensible guidelines for annotating nonstandard usage is a major problem
for a project like ours.

<P>Less than three years from the inception of the CHRISTINE project, we
certainly have not achieved a fully adequate solution to this problem;
it is too large for that.&nbsp; But we have made a start in grappling with
it.&nbsp; I discuss our provisional guidelines for annotating nonstandard
usage here, in the hope that they may help to inspire others to take the
effort further.

<P>A first difficulty lies in drawing the distinction between cases where
a speaker's usage is regular with respect to his own regional or class
dialect (though deviant from the point of view of standard English), and
cases where a speaker makes an error of performance yielding wording which
is ill-formed from his own point of view.&nbsp; When odd-looking wording
is just a hasty slip of the tongue or the like, we may annotate it in ways
which explicitly mark it as deviant, for instance using the # symbol to
identify a tagma as incomplete; and we do not expect ever to evolve guidelines
which provide well-defined, predictable structural annotations for each
particular kind of performance error -- there are just too many different
ways in which people can trip over their tongues, so that many performance
errors are likely to be "one-offs" which will inevitably have to be annotated
in ways that are somewhat <I>ad hoc</I> and arbitrary.&nbsp; If, on the
other hand, a stretch of wording conforms to structural norms that happen
to differ from those of the standard language, then our annotation scheme
ought, if possible, to provide norms for representing its structure.&nbsp;
It would be scientifically misleading (and perhaps offensive) to annotate
such cases in ways that equate them with performance errors.

<P>Between us, members of the CHRISTINE team have lived for substantial
periods in many different British dialect areas; we hope that this experience,
together with exposure to further varieties through the media and through
a cosmopolitan workplace, will usually have enabled us to recognize when
a nonstandard form is regular in its own terms.&nbsp; "Usually" is certainly
not "always", though.&nbsp; Consider, for instance, the passage:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>oh she was shouting at him at dinner-time {begin shouting}
Steven {end shouting} oh god dinner-time she was shouting him&nbsp;</I>
T19.03154</BLOCKQUOTE>
When I encountered this passage I was well aware that use of a time-noun
like <I>dinner-time</I> as a Time adjunct without a preposition (as in
the second instance of <I>dinner-time</I> in the example) is normal in
nonstandard variants of English, where the national standard language would
require <I>at dinner-time</I>.&nbsp; But I took for granted that the closing
phrase <I>shouting him</I>, where <I>shout</I> appears to be used transitively
with the person shouted at as object, was just a slip of the tongue (or,
perhaps, an accidental transcriber error).&nbsp; There are a number of
places in the texts where words are omitted by accident.&nbsp; For instance,
probably no-one would be tempted to invoke dialect difference to explain
the lack of a verb before the final word <I>photos</I> in the passage:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>There's one thing I don't like {pause} and that's having
my photo taken.&nbsp; And it will be hard when we have to photos.</I>&nbsp;
T17.03102-3</BLOCKQUOTE>
The speaker surely meant to say something like <I>to show photos</I>.&nbsp;
I took the <I>shouting him</I> case to be like this -- after all, earlier
in the same turn the speaker had produced the normal phrase <I>shouting
at him</I>.&nbsp; But this assumption was undermined when I encountered
further cases uttered by speakers in other BNC files:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>go in the sitting-room until I shout you for tea&nbsp;</I>
T33.00332
<BR><I>the spelling mistakes only occurred when {pause} I was
shouted</I>&nbsp;
T17.02798</BLOCKQUOTE>
This looks like sufficient evidence to establish that <I>shout</I> has
a transitive use with personal object in (some) nonstandard dialects, though
I had no idea of this previously.&nbsp; (The regional codes for the speakers
involved are Midlands for the T19 case, and Northern England for the T33
and T17 cases.)

<P>In this case, our material happened to contain multiple examples.&nbsp;
There must be other cases where we took nonstandard phrasing for performance
error, because we encountered only a single example, or failed to notice
similarities between separate examples.

<P>There is no ideal solution to this problem.&nbsp; One can only be aware
of it and strive to draw the distinction between nonstandard dialect norms
and performance errors, but this is never likely to be perfectly achieved.

<P>The problem seems to be particularly troublesome at the ends of
utterances.&nbsp;
Breaking a construction off prematurely is a common performance deviation;
but dialects differ in the ways in which they regularize abbreviation.&nbsp;
In:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>That's right, she said Margaret never goes, I said well
we never go for lunch out, we hardly ever really.</I>&nbsp;
T28.08744</BLOCKQUOTE>
the words <I>we hardly ever really</I> would not occur in standard English
without some verb (if only a placeholding <I>do</I>), so the sequence would
most plausibly be taken as an interrupted utterance of some clause such
as <I>we hardly ever really go out to eat at all </I>-- in which case the
CHRISTINE annotation would supply a # symbol as the last daughter of the
clause node.&nbsp; But on the basis of impressionistic awareness of dialect
variation in Britain it seems easy to suppose that the speaker's dialect
might allow <I>we hardly ever really</I> for standard <I>we hardly ever
do really</I>.&nbsp; If so, it would be misleading to insert a # symbol.

<P>Where a passage is ambiguous between an interpretation which attributes
standard grammar to the wording and an interpretation which attributes
a nonstandard construction to it, other things being equal we prefer the
former.&nbsp; Thus, in <I>They got Mr Bean on Saturday as well</I> T03.00814
(<I>Mr Bean</I> is a television programme), the word <I>on</I> is
ambiguous.&nbsp;
In standard English, <I>on Saturday</I> could be a prepositional phrase
functioning as a Time adjunct; but, alternatively, <I>on</I> and
<I>Saturday</I>
might be separate clause constituents, with <I>on</I> interpreted adverbially
as in <I>the programme is on</I>, "it is being broadcast at the time",
and <I>Saturday</I> taken as a case of the common though nonstandard
construction
in which a time noun without preposition functions as an adjunct.&nbsp;
CHRISTINE chooses the former analysis.
<H3>
11.2&nbsp; Wordtags for Nonstandard Usage</H3>
In the case of wordtagging, we have adopted fairly clear and predictable
analytic guidelines for the CHRISTINE project, but these contradict what
was said in the <I>EFC</I> book.

<P>The EFC rule (&sect;3.67) was that words used in ways characteristic
of nonstandard dialects were to be wordtagged in the same way as the words
that would replace them in standard English.&nbsp; That rule was reasonable
in the context of the written language, where nonstandard forms are a
peripheral
nuisance.&nbsp; Experience on the CHRISTINE project quickly showed the
rule to be impractical for analysing spontaneous speech, which contains
a high incidence of such forms.&nbsp; The rule creates too many
questions:&nbsp;
granted that we cannot use word <I>X</I> in exactly this way in standard
English, just how is it used in the relevant speaker's dialect, and precisely
which standard word does that equate to?&nbsp; To expect analysts to succeed
in formulating suitable answers to a stream of such questions is not
reasonable.&nbsp;
For CHRISTINE, the wordtagging rule is reversed:&nbsp; in general, words
used in nonstandard grammatical functions are given the same wordtags that
the relevant wordforms are given in their standard uses.[17]

<P>On the other hand, the phrases containing the words are tagmatagged
in accordance with their grammatical function in context.&nbsp; The general
principle here is that English dialects differ less as one moves from the
leaves towards the roots of parse-trees.&nbsp; It does not seem practical
to assign wordtags other than by reference to the known, standard language,
because word uses in nonstandard varieties are too unpredictable (from
the point of view of analysts who speak standard English).&nbsp; But phrases
and clauses should usually be assignable to the same range of categories
in any dialect, even if some of the words composing them are used in
nonstandard
ways.

<P>This revised wordtagging rule has proved to work unproblematically for
many cases:&nbsp; for instance, frequent nonstandard uses of (standard)
adjectives in place of adverbs as qualifiers, e.g:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[J <I>awful</I>_JJ <I>quiet</I>_JJ ]&nbsp; T11.02680</BLOCKQUOTE>
or (standard) personal pronouns in modifying position, as in:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>it's a bit of fun, it livens up me day</I>&nbsp; T31.03497
<BR><I>she told me to have them plums</I>&nbsp; T15.10705</BLOCKQUOTE>
-- here, the words <I>me</I>, <I>them</I> are wordtagged as object pronouns
(they are not given the wordtags which <I>my</I>, <I>those</I> would receive),
but the phrases <I>me day</I>, <I>them plums</I> are tagged as noun phrases.

<P>In these cases, since the most characteristic word of an adjective phrase
or a noun phrase is its head adjective or noun, respectively, the fact
that modifying words represent nonstandard usages does not create a strong
feeling of inconsistency between wordtags and tagmatags.&nbsp; The
consequences
of our rule are not so happy in the (less frequent) cases where the word
used in a nonstandard fashion is itself the head or characteristic word
of its tagma.&nbsp; Cases of this sort include:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[P <I>next</I>_MDt [Nj <I>the high</I> ] ]&nbsp; T13.01136
<BR><I>is it</I> [R:e <I>indoor</I>_JB ]&nbsp; T01.02688
<BR><I>wait</I> [Fa:t <I>to</I>_IIt <I>you start next year</I> ] T27.03876
<BR><I>I haven't had</I> [Ns:o <I>a lend</I>_VV0t of it ]&nbsp;
T11.02608</BLOCKQUOTE>
In <I>next the high</I> (which in context means "next to the high setting
[on a cooker]"), <I>next</I> is used as a preposition (as it can be in
archaic literary English as well as in current nonstandard dialects), but
in modern standard English the word functions only as an ordinal-type
modifier.&nbsp;
In <I>Is it indoor?</I> the word <I>indoor</I> is a regional equivalent
of standard <I>indoors</I>; in standard English the form without -<I>s</I>
can be only an attributive adjective, as in <I>indoor games</I>.&nbsp;
In the T27 case, <I>to</I> is being used as a subordinating conjunction
rather than a preposition.[18]&nbsp; Finally, the last example illustrates
the very frequent nonstandard use of <I>lend</I>, in standard English only
a verb, for <I>loan</I>.&nbsp; Although our rule produces odd-looking
relationships
between tagmatags and wordtags in cases like these, overall it seems
preferable
to continuing with the rule specified in <I>EFC</I>.
<H3>
11.3&nbsp; Abbreviated Idioms</H3>
Sometimes, what in standard English are multi-word idioms are reduced by
speakers (whether as a regular dialect feature or a performance
simplification)
to single words, for instance <I>a bit</I> appears as <I>bit</I> in <I>bit
awkward that I should think</I> W09.00485.&nbsp; In such cases we give
the word the wordtag it would receive as part of the standard idiom, without
creating a node above it with an idiomtag ending in equals sign.&nbsp;
Thus, in the case just quoted, <I>bit</I> is wordtagged DD1b22, but there
is no DD1b= node.

<P>A more complex case occurs at W15.00640, shown here with the analysis
assigned by CHRISTINE:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>I wouldn't mind</I> [N:o [Dp <I>just a</I>_DD221 # <I>just
few</I>_DD222 ] <I>miles</I> ... N:o]</BLOCKQUOTE>
-- it seems that two attempts have been made to realize the idiom <I>a
few</I>, but neither attempt was complete.

<P>In the exchange <I>Evening Olive. -- Evening Alf.</I>,&nbsp; T03.00967-8,
the word <I>evening</I> is wordtagged UGA22, as an abbreviation of <I>good
evening</I> -- though it is so usual for the words <I>morning</I>,
<I>afternoon</I>,
and <I>evening</I> to be used alone as UGA discourse items (and for
<I>night</I>
to be used alone as a UGZ item) that, arguably, it might have been preferable
to assign the simple wordtag UGA rather than treat <I>evening</I> as an
abbreviation of <I>good evening</I>.
<H3>
11.4&nbsp; Nonstandard Verbal Structures</H3>
The rule whereby nonstandard uses of words are given the tags which the
same wordforms would receive in their standard use has proved unsatisfactory
for one area of grammar, namely nonstandard verb uses.&nbsp; There are
two difficulties.&nbsp; In the first place, many standard verb forms are
ambiguous between two inflexions, for instance <I>come</I> in standard
English can be the base form or the past participle -- so that a rule saying
"give a nonstandard use the tag which the wordform would receive in standard
English" does not yield a predictable tagging decision.&nbsp; Secondly,
and more importantly, verb usage in nonstandard English dialects often
seems too different from the standard pattern to be adequately handled
by a simple rule about wordtagging.&nbsp; We find:
<UL>
<LI>
standard base forms used as past tenses, e.g.:</LI>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>a man bought a horse and <U>give</U> it to her</I>&nbsp;
T13.01096-8
<BR><I>he <U>give</U> me tablets and whatnots</I>&nbsp; T01.02717</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI>
standard past tenses used where standard English would use a past participle,
e.g.:</LI>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>do you want them <U>took</U> off</I>&nbsp; T08.00848
<BR><I>I thought you'd've <U>ate</U> them before now</I>&nbsp;
T16.07040</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI>
standard past participles used where standard English would use a past
tense, e.g.:</LI>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>what I <U>done</U>, I taped it back like that</I>&nbsp;
T11.02536</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI>
and forms which are standardly ambiguous between base form and past participle
used where the standard language would use a past tense, e.g.:</LI>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>I heard it when I <U>come</U> in didn't I</I>&nbsp;
T04.02377</BLOCKQUOTE>
The difficulties in applying the general nonstandard-wordtagging rule to
verbs seem to relate in particular to verbs referring to past time.&nbsp;
There are also nonstandard verb uses where the oddity relates to subject-verb
agreement, but the rule of &sect;11.2 works satisfactorily in these
cases.&nbsp;
Thus, in the examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>I <U>were</U> flying&nbsp; </I>T01.02626
<BR><I>I <U>says</U></I>&nbsp; T01.02763</BLOCKQUOTE>
the underlined words are tagged VBDR, VVZv respectively (rather than VBDZ,
VV0v, like <I>was</I>, <I>say</I>) -- and the verb groups <I>were flying</I>,
<I>says</I>, are tagmatagged Vwu, Vz.&nbsp; The nonstandardness of the
grammar is manifested in the parse tree through the fact that the
subcategories
of subject noun phrase (Nea) and verb group, respectively, do not match
in the normal way.&nbsp; But, if the general rule were applied to the earlier
examples, it would not be clear whether to tag <I>come</I> as base form
or past participle, and it would further be unclear how to assign higher-level
structure above the wordtags.

<P>One writer who has discussed this problematic range of verb uses is
Eisikovits (1987).&nbsp; Eisikovits's article is based on data from an
Australian urban dialect, but, as Trudgill &amp; Chambers (1991: 52) rightly
point out, the facts are similar for many UK dialects.&nbsp; Eisikovits
(p. 134) in effect argues that the tense system exemplified in a clause
like <I>what I done</I> is the same as that of standard English, but that
a single form <I>done</I> is used in the nonstandard dialect for both past
tense and past participle (in the same way as single forms such as
<I>said</I>,
<I>allowed</I>, are used for both functions in the standard language, in
the case of many other verbs).&nbsp; Other writers on nonstandard dialects,
e.g. Beal (1993: 192), seem to take a similar line.

<P>But this analysis seems to overlook cases (which are very common in
the CHRISTINE material) like:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>What it is, when you <U>got</U> snooker on and just snooker
you're quite {pause} content to watch it</I>&nbsp; T11.02572</BLOCKQUOTE>
Here it is clear that <I>got</I> is functioning as a perfective form meaning
"have", the equivalent of standard <I>have got</I>.&nbsp; It is not just
that nonstandard dialects swap verb forms between the different inflexion
categories; the syntax of nonstandard verb groups is different, in that
a perfective construction can lack a preceding auxiliary.&nbsp; Presence
or absence of auxiliary is the only diagnostic in standard English for
the perfective/past-tense contrast with the majority of verbs, whose past
tense and past participle forms are identical.&nbsp; So, if a past form
without auxiliary can in nonstandard varieties correspond to a standard
perfective construction as well as a standard past tense, it seems
questionable
whether this distinction can meaningfully be imposed in annotating nonstandard
verb constructions.

<P>The solution adopted for CHRISTINE, which might perhaps seem over-simple
if one had a comprehensive knowledge of the structures of the various
nonstandard
dialects, but which seems in practice to work well, is to say:
<UL>
<LI>
for nonstandard usage we recognize an extra finite "tense" in addition
to the standard panoply of English verb tense-aspect contrasts, which is
realized as a past participle not preceded by any auxiliary, and is
tagmatagged
Vn (in standard English, Vn occurs only in a non-finite clause or in a
clause reduced by Co-ordination Reduction)</LI>

<LI>
any verb used in a nonstandard way with reference to past time (where the
nonstandardness relates to the base v. past tense v. past participle
selection,
not just to agreement with the subject) is wordtagged as a past participle
and (if not preceded by an auxiliary) is tagmatagged as an example of this
nonstandard Vn verb-group subcategory</LI>
</UL>
Thus <I>give</I>, <I>took</I>, <I>ate</I>, <I>done</I>, <I>come</I>,
<I>got</I>
in the examples above are all given VVN... wordtags and treated as Vn phrases.
<H3>
11.5&nbsp; Subcategories for Nonstandard Verb Groups</H3>
CHRISTINE contains many sequences of auxiliary and main verbs which would
not be acceptable in standard English; an example is <I>you<U>'re not give</U>
me a sweet </I>T25.00331.&nbsp; In such cases, only those V subcategory
letters are added which are justified by the verb forms actually used.&nbsp;
Thus, in the case quoted, the verb group begins with <I>are</I> and contains
<I>not</I>, but does not meet the criteria for any other V subcategory
listed in EFC, p. 186ff.; so the tagma is labelled Vae (a combination of
symbols that will never occur in annotations of well-formed standard English).
<H3>
11.6&nbsp; <I>ain't</I>, <I>in't</I>, <I>innit</I></H3>
A new wordtag VAI is used for the <I>ai</I>- of <I>ain't</I> and the<I>
i-</I> of <I>in't</I>, <I>innit</I>, which are ambiguous both with respect
to person and with respect to the identity of the corresponding standard
verb root.&nbsp; Different cases of <I>ain't </I>would translate into standard
English as <I>isn't</I>, <I>aren't</I> (<I>aren't you </I>or <I>aren't
I</I>, i.e. <I>am I not</I>), <I>hasn't</I>, <I>haven't</I>, and possibly
sometimes <I>doesn't</I>, <I>don't</I>; without a special neutral tag VAI,
the wordtagging would have to resolve this ambiguity and represent the
forms uttered as much more specific than they actually are.

<P>The form <I>in't</I> (as in, for instance, <I>they've seen them in't
they</I> T07.00382) is, as far as I know, entirely comparable to <I>ain't</I>
and is therefore treated in the same way.[19]&nbsp; (The literature of
linguistics seems to discuss <I>ain't</I> much more than <I>in't </I>--
though see Cheshire 1982: 54ff., Cheshire et al. 1993: 73; it may be that
<I>ain't</I> is more widely discussed because it is the only one of the
two forms found in American English.&nbsp; Both forms occur in British
speech, and in CHRISTINE.)

<P>CHRISTINE divides <I>innit</I> into <I>i-</I>_VAI <I>+nn</I>_XX
<I>+it</I>_PPH1.&nbsp;
One might feel that <I>innit</I> is a different case from <I>ain't</I>
or <I>in't</I>, because the root of <I>innit</I> can safely be categorized
as 3rd person singular.&nbsp; However, I am fairly sure that this form
in its longstanding use has been ambiguous with respect to verb root, if
not to person:&nbsp; <I>innit</I> could equate to <I>hasn't it </I>and
possibly to <I>doesn't it</I>, not exclusively to <I>isn't it</I>.&nbsp;
So the need for a "neutral" wordtag remains, and the <I>i-</I> of <I>innit</I>
is also tagged VAI.[20]

<P>With <I>innit</I> there is a further complication in that this form
seems to be expanding its usage range at present.&nbsp; For some speakers
it appears to be functioning as a generalized tag question akin to French
<I>n'est-ce pas</I>, which does not vary with the verb or subject of the
declarative clause to which it is attached.&nbsp; This innovative usage
is actually discussed by speakers at one point in CHRISTINE text T36, who
describe it as characteristic of the English of the South Asian immigrant
communities.&nbsp; One can well imagine that a simplification of the very
complex traditional English tag-question formation rule might be initiated
by speakers of a different mother tongue, though if so I have the impression
that the novel usage has now spread to young members of the indigenous
British population.&nbsp; (According to my wife, what one might call
"generalized
<I>innit</I>" already occurred in rural Sussex in the 1960s, which suggests
that it is unrelated to South Asian immigration; she describes it as having
then been an aggressive, "bovver boy" usage.)&nbsp; In any case, this usage
makes it all the more appropriate to use VAI for the root of <I>innit</I>.

<P>At one point (T16.07076) CHRISTINE contains the form <I>dunnit</I>,
divided as <I>du</I> +<I>nn</I> +<I>it</I>.&nbsp; Arguably, <I>du</I>-,
although not ambiguous with respect to verb root, should be given a
person-neutral
wordtag parallel to VAI.&nbsp; I believe forms such as [dVnaI] <I>dunnI</I>,
"don't I", also occur in English speech.&nbsp; But it seemed undesirable
to coin an additional wordtag for a single example; CHRISTINE tags <I>du</I>-
in <I>dunnit</I> as VDZ.

<P>A VAI word does not lead to the Vz or Vb subcategories being marked
on the verb group it initiates:&nbsp;<I> ain't</I> as a whole verb group
is tagmatagged Ve, not Vzeb.&nbsp; However, if a VAI word acts as an auxiliary
with a present or past participle, the subcategories Vu, Vf are used.

<P>It is perhaps worth underlining the fact that the analytic guidelines
set out above are based on assumptions about patterns of non-standard English
usage which do not always rest on authoritative published descriptions.&nbsp;
The decisions made by the CHRISTINE team about how to handle forms such
as <I>in't </I>were based mainly on an impressionistic grasp of non-standard
speech patterns derived from encountering such forms in our everyday lives.

<P>Such impressions can be misleading.&nbsp; In particular, for individuals
whose usage broadly conforms to the national standard it is easy to fall
into the trap of thinking in terms of two dialects, "standard" and
"nonstandard".&nbsp;
Linguists such as Cheshire et al. (1993) suggest that there may even be
a measure of truth in this idea, but it is certainly over-simple:&nbsp;
there are many nonstandard dialects, which differ among themselves.&nbsp;
Here and there we found useful statements about particular details in the
linguistic literature.&nbsp; But, if there exists a thorough, reliable
linguistic description of the grammars of the various nonstandard dialects,
we have not encountered it.
<H3>
11.7&nbsp; Other Nonstandard Syntactic Structures</H3>
The use of Vn phrases in finite clauses, discussed above, is one area where
CHRISTINE has evolved a well-defined approach to annotating a specific
nonstandard syntactic construction.&nbsp; In other cases, we have begun
to develop annotation precedents which will be documented when a fully
detailed supplement to <I>EFC</I> is circulated, but at this point we do
not yet feel confident that our current approach will remain satisfactory.

<P>Consider, for instance, relative clauses containing undeleted relativized
items -- a structure which occurs regularly in some nonstandard English
dialects (and in some standard languages, e.g. Hebrew) but which is
unacceptable
in standard English.&nbsp; A CHRISTINE example is:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>... bloody Colin who, he borrowed his computer that time,
remember?</I>&nbsp; T19.03075</BLOCKQUOTE>
For this example, the solution initially chosen for CHRISTINE was to make
the relativized noun phrase, <I>he</I>, appositional to the relative
pronoun.&nbsp;
But that solution only works provided that the relative clause begins with
a relative pronoun and that the relativized element is subject of the relative
clause.&nbsp; More recent experience, with material to be included in the
full CHRISTINE Corpus, shows that this is not always so; e.g.:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>a {beep} {pause} cock-up by</I> [Ns <I>a farrier {pause}</I>
[Fr <I>that I would really like to go and hammer those nails into <U>his</U>
feet {pause} and make <U>him</U> walk for two weeks</I> Fr] Ns]</BLOCKQUOTE>
The relativized elements are in one case a genitive and in the other case
an item raised to surface object of its clause; and in any case the <I>EFC</I>
parsing scheme counts <I>that</I> as a conjunction, not as a pronoun which
could be postmodified by an appositional element.&nbsp; Thus the initial
approach cannot be made to work for this latter example, which suggests
that it ought probably to be revisited and modified in the case of the
T19 example also.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BR>Cases like this show the limits to the policy of developing a
comprehensive
analytic scheme which provides a predictable annotation for anything that
may be encountered in the data.&nbsp; There are good reasons for maintaining
that policy as an ideal; but when our scheme is required to apply not just
to a single, intensively-studied language variety but to a diverse range
of poorly-studied dialects, we cannot hope to get very close to that ideal
for many years to come.&nbsp; Arguably, there is a conceptual confusion
in the idea of specifying consistent grammatical annotation standards for
a spectrum of different, unpredictably varying structures; yet somehow
that is what we have to do.
<H2>
12.&nbsp; Swearwords</H2>
CHRISTINE samples contain a high incidence of what in everyday parlance
is called "bad language" or "swearing". This area of English has structural
features of its own, but the previous analytic guidelines have not served
it well. Part-of-speech information in standard dictionaries seems patchy
and inconsistent for these words, probably because they are felt to be
marginal to the respectable core of the language; and the SUSANNE analytic
scheme, which was based mainly on the written language, did not adequately
get to grips with swearwords. For CHRISTINE, a new approach has been adopted,
overriding earlier decisions in <I>EFC</I> and dictionary information about
word classification.

<P>The usages which the following discussion is intended to cover are cases
where words are used without literal reference, in order to "let off steam"
in speech, but (at least in some occurrences) the words used in this way
are integrated to a certain extent into the surrounding grammar. These
words are assigned wordtags beginning FL... (from "four-letter word", for
want of a better mnemonic -- of course not all the words are actually spelled
with four letters). Wordforms given FL... tags will always receive those
tags when the words are used as swearwords -- they will never be tagged
UX even when occurring as isolated expletives; but they may sometimes receive
ordinary tags as nouns, verbs, etc. when used with substantial reference
rather than as swearwords.

<P>An example of a swearword that is not given an FL... tag is <I>blimey</I>;
this always seems to occur as a grammatical isolate, reflecting its derivation
from the imperative <I>blind me</I>, so it continues to be tagged UX as
in the <I>EFC</I> system.

<P>Examples of words which would be classified by some or all speakers
as "bad language" but which are given "ordinary" part of speech tags would
be:
<UL>
<LI>
<I>twat</I> meaning "worthless person", as in <I>I'm sure they could frighten
the little twat</I> T19.03085</LI>

<LI>
<I>crap</I> meaning "something that is no good", or just "no good", as
in <I>it's crap innit</I> T06.00351, <I>looks a bit fucking crap like the
rest of them</I> T03.00812 (here, <I>fucking</I> is given an FL... tag
but <I>crap</I> is tagged as a singular noun)</LI>

<LI>
<I>bugger</I> in its Northern English use as an intimate equivalent to
"man" or "thing", as in <I>I said I don't want that bugger</I> T38.01091
(for many Northern speakers <I>bugger</I> would not count as "bad language"
-- this is a frequent source of social misunderstandings between Northerners
and Southerners), or as a verb meaning "wreck", as in <I>I completely buggered
up my dinner</I> T36.01662</LI>
</UL>
All of these and many other comparable uses of socially-deprecated words
are tagged as ordinary nouns, verbs, or other parts of speech. But this
leaves many cases (e.g. <I>bloody</I> except when it either refers to blood
or means "obnoxious in character", e.g. <I>he really is a bloody man</I>,
or <I>fuck</I> other than referring to copulation) where words are used
purely in order to modify the emotional tone of an utterance. The emotional
effect can be very mild: for instance, the class of words given FL... tags
includes <I>flipping</I> as well as <I>fucking</I>. (However, the "mild"
FL... words probably in most cases arose specifically as polite replacements
for particular swearwords, for instance it seems clear that <I>frigging</I>
functions as a replacement for <I>fucking</I> which it is permissible to
utter in prudish company.)

<P>The FL... tags used are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
FL1 for words which, when acting as swearwords in contexts which make their
grammatical function clear, are always nouns: <I>heck</I>, <I>hell</I></LI>

<LI>
FLG for words with a present-participle suffix, which typically function
as adjectives or adverbs: e.g. <I>fucking</I>, <I>blooming</I></LI>

<LI>
FLJ for words with an adjectival suffix, e.g. <I>bloody</I></LI>

<LI>
FL for words without grammatical suffix and which can occur in environments
typical of more than one part of speech, say verb and noun, e.g. <I>damn</I>,
<I>fuck</I>.</LI>
</UL>
The full list of words given FL tags in CHRISTINE/I is:
<UL>
<LI>
<I>bleeding</I> FLG</LI>

<LI>
<I>blimming</I> (a variant of <I>blooming</I>) FLG</LI>

<LI>
<I>blinking</I> FLG</LI>

<LI>
<I>bloody</I> FLJ</LI>

<LI>
<I>blooming</I> FLG</LI>

<LI>
<I>bugger</I> FL</LI>

<LI>
<I>chuff</I> FL</LI>

<LI>
<I>chuffing</I> FLG</LI>

<LI>
<I>damn</I> FL</LI>

<LI>
<I>flipping</I> FLG</LI>

<LI>
<I>frigging</I> FLG</LI>

<LI>
<I>fuck</I> FL</LI>

<LI>
<I>fucking</I> FLG</LI>

<LI>
<I>god-damn</I> FL</LI>

<LI>
<I>heck</I> FL1</LI>

<LI>
<I>hell</I> FL1</LI>

<LI>
<I>piss</I> FL</LI>

<LI>
<I>pissing</I> FLG</LI>

<LI>
<I>ruddy</I> FLJ</LI>

<LI>
<I>shit</I> FL</LI>

<LI>
<I>stuff</I> FL</LI>
</UL>
The analytic scheme allows FL... words to occur in any category of tagma
suggested by the surrounding wording, including as head of the tagma: thus
<I>I don't give a fuck</I> is analysed as including [Ns <I>a</I>_AT1
<I>fuck</I>_FL
], <I>fuck me</I> as [Tb! [V <I>fuck</I>_FL ] [Neo:o <I>me</I>_PPIO1 ]
]; the frequent exclamation <I>bloody hell</I> is [Ns! <I>bloody</I>_FLJ
<I>hell</I>_FL1 ]. FLG and FLJ words often act as qualifiers, e.g. <I>he's</I>
[J:e <I>bloody</I>_FLJ <I>mad</I>_JJ ] T25.00316. At the same time, like
U... words, FL... words are allowed to appear inserted in the middle of
other tagmas to which they are grammatically redundant, e.g.:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[S+ <I>but</I> [Nea:s <I>I</I> ] <I>bloody</I>_FLJ [Vdce
<I>couldn't
get</I> ] [R:n <I>out</I> ] ... ] T04.02478

<P>[S [Nea:s <I>I</I> ] [Ve <I>don't get</I> ] [Nop:o <I>them</I> ]
<I>bloody</I>_FLJ
[R:q <I>back</I> ] ] T16.06978</BLOCKQUOTE>
Only as much higher structure is included above FL... words as is essential
to show the relationship to the environment; thus in <I>fuck me</I> the
word <I>fuck</I> has to be dominated by a V node to show that the whole
exclamation is a clause with <I>me</I> as object, but for instance FLG
words are never given Vg or Tg nodes above them, thus <I>fucking slapper</I>
(T36.01648, commenting on a show-business personality) is [Ns
<I>fucking</I>_FLG
<I>slapper</I>_NN1c ], not [Ns [Tg [Vg <I>fucking</I>_FLG ] ] ] ... ].

<P>Utterances of the type <I>does it heck?</I> T16.07077 are analysed with
the FL1 inside rather than outside the interrogative clause:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[S? [Vzx <I>does</I> ] [Ni:s <I>it</I> ] <I>heck</I>_FL1
]</BLOCKQUOTE>
Phrases of the pattern <I>damn all</I> are analysed as [D <I>damn</I>_FL
<I>all</I>_DBa ], e.g.
<BLOCKQUOTE>[S <I>there's</I> [Np:s [D <I>piss</I>_FL <I>all</I> ] <I>jobs</I>
] [Rw:p <I>in there</I> ] ]&nbsp; T47.00087</BLOCKQUOTE>
The word <I>hell</I> tagged FL1, if modified, will be head of a noun phrase
but this is not annotated as a proper noun phrase, Nn... (This contradicts
various passages in <I>EFC</I>.)

<P>There is a use of swearwords in which they interrupt a single
multi-syllable
word -- the stock example is <I>abso-bloody-lutely</I>. The sole case in
CHRISTINE/I is <I>I go with-bloody-out</I> T16.06989, which is analysed
by treating <I>with- -out</I> as two halves of an idiom:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>I go</I> [R:h [RR= <I>with</I>_RR21 <I>bloody</I>_FLJ
<I>out</I>_RR22
] ]</BLOCKQUOTE>
A case where it is difficult to decide whether the wordform should be counted
as occurring in a "swearing" or "literal" use is <I>a hell of a storm</I>
T38.01011. One might feel that this means that the storm constituted a
hell, literally. But <I>a hell of ...</I> is often used in contexts where
this interpretation would be hard to maintain; so the CHRISTINE analysis
is [Ns <I>a</I>_AT1 <I>hell</I>_FL1 [Po <I>of a storm</I> ] ].

13.&nbsp; New Annotation Symbols</H2>

<H3>
13.1&nbsp; Symbols not Defined in <I>EFC</I></H3>
This section is provided as a concise checklist of symbols used in CHRISTINE
annotations which are not listed or defined in the <I>EFC</I> book.&nbsp;
Some of the symbols are discussed in greater detail in other sections of
this documentation file, and cross-references are provided in these cases.
<H3>
13.2&nbsp; New Wordtags</H3>

<H4>
FL, FL1, FLG, FLJ:&nbsp; swearwords</H4>
See &sect;12 for the definitions of these wordtags.
<H4>
NP1a:&nbsp; anonymized name</H4>
The entities <TT>&lt;name></TT> and <TT>&lt;address></TT>, representing
a name or address removed from the speech transcription for anonymization
purposes, are wordtagged NP1a.&nbsp; In context some names are clearly
Christian names, some are clearly surnames, and some are names of things
rather than persons, but often it is not possible to be sure what category
the name belonged to; and addresses are likely to have been multi-word
phrases.&nbsp; The "neutral" tag NP1a is used in all cases, rather than
the more specific NP... tags defined in <I>EFC</I>.

<P>The other anonymization entity, <TT>&lt;telNo></TT>, is given the wordtag
FOt already defined in <I>EFC</I>.
<H4>
UGA, UGZ:&nbsp; hail and farewell</H4>
EFC defines the discourse-item tag UG, Greeting, and gives examples such
as <I>hello</I>, <I>good morning</I>, all of which are said at the opening
of a social interaction.&nbsp; It offers no tag for words such as
<I>goodbye</I>,
said at the close.&nbsp; Instead of UG, CHRISTINE uses UGA for "hail"-type
and UGZ for "farewell"-type discourse items.
<H4>
UO:&nbsp; <I>sort of</I>, etc.</H4>
The wordtag UO is used for the idioms<I> sort of</I>, <I>kind of</I>, <I>sort
of thing</I> (i.e. these phrases are tagmatagged UO=).

<P><I>EFC</I>, pp. 446-7, argued that the Lund group (who pioneered the
classification of discourse items on which <I>EFC</I> drew) were misguided
in treating (most cases of) <I>sort of</I> as discourse items, and it urged
that the phrase should normally be counted as an adverb idiom, RR= (and
only occasionally as UE=, Engager).&nbsp; Experience with CHRISTINE has
shown that the Lund group were wiser in this respect than I appreciated;
<I>sort of</I>, and the other similar phrases listed, are commonly dissimilar
in their usage to either adverbs or Engagers.&nbsp; CHRISTINE uses UO for
all cases of these forms, except for thoroughly literal uses (as in <I>this
is an unusual sort of watch</I>, where <I>sort of</I> would not be a
constituent
at all).
<H4>
US:&nbsp; "sound"</H4>
The wordtag US is used for elements which resemble words rather than
non-linguistic
vocalizations, in the sense that they obey the rules of English phonology
(or most of them), but which are intended to represent non-linguistic
sounds:&nbsp;
e.g. <I>ding ding dee dee</I> (T09.02011, imitating something unknown in
a children's game), or <I>tra-la</I> (T14.04877, imitating music or
"generalized
singing" divorced from any particular words).

<P>I say that US items obey "most" phonological rules, because such forms
frequently are slightly phonologically exceptional.&nbsp; The late Prof.
Eug&eacute;nie Henderson used to point out the phonological oddity of the
word <I>boing</I>, standardly used to represent the sound of a spring
rebounding:&nbsp;
the velar nasal does not normally follow diphthongs such as [OI], and the
form is mandatorily pronounced on a level tone although English is not
a tone language.&nbsp; Nevertheless, even this form is phonetically much
more like an English word than like an attempt to use the vocal organs
to create an imitation of the actual physical sound referred to.

<P>A form such as <I>ha ha</I> or <I>ho ho ho</I>, representing laughter,
is tagged US -- these syllables consisting of [h] followed by a vowel or
diphthong are conventional English indications of laughter, quite different
from actual laughing, which is shown as with a non-linguistic vocalization
entity.[21]

<P>The boundary between US and UX, Expletive, is fuzzy.&nbsp; Having adopted
US for <I>tra-la</I>, CHRISTINE also uses this tag for less conventional
nonverbal sounds integrated into pop lyrics, e.g. <I>wo oh ooh ooh</I>
T06.00375.&nbsp; But UX is used e.g. for fairly conventional "coaxing"
noises in ordinary speech, <I>wooty coochy coochy coochy bing</I> T34.02876,
and for odd noises made in the heat of children's horseplay, <I>wom um</I>
T05.01005.
<H4>
VAI:&nbsp; <I>ai(n't)</I>, etc.</H4>
See &sect;11.6.
<H4>
VVNH:&nbsp; <I>got</I></H4>
The word <I>got</I> as a past participle (not as a past tense, as in <I>I
got it at Tesco's yesterday</I>) is tagged VVNH.&nbsp; The commonest use
of this word is in the forms <I>have got</I>, +<I>'ve got (</I>and similar
with other forms of<I> HAVE</I>, e.g.<I> +'s got</I>,<I> had got)</I>,
or just <I>got</I>, as colloquial equivalents to literary <I>have</I>.&nbsp;
The <I>EFC</I> annotation scheme provides no special annotation for <I>have
got</I>, treating it simply as a perfective verb group, Vf, like <I>have
eaten</I>; but semantically it is quite different from other perfective
forms, and probably occurs with a higher frequency.&nbsp; It seemed desirable
to mark this special status in the annotation somehow, so CHRISTINE does
so in the wordtag.&nbsp; (If <I>HAVE got</I> ever occurs in the literal
perfective sense, "have acquired", it would be annotated in the same way;
my impression is that this usage is rare in colloquial speech.&nbsp; In
practice, people seem to say <I>HAVE gone and got ...</I> to avoid the
ambiguity.)
<H4>
YMN, YMV:&nbsp; nasal and vocalic filled pauses</H4>
"Filled pauses", sounds made as a conventional way of continuing a speech
turn while formulating one's next words, fall into two classes in
English:&nbsp;
sounds based on a nasal consonant, normally [m] -- e.g. <I>mm</I>, <I>um</I>;
and sounds which are purely vocalic, e.g. <I>er</I>, <I>ah</I>, Scottish
<I>eh</I>.[22]&nbsp; <I>EFC</I> defined one wordtag, YM, for all filled
pauses.&nbsp; However, the EAGLES speech group recommend distinguishing
nasal from vocalic fillers (Gibbon et al. 1997: 170, Recommendation
5.4.4).&nbsp;
Consequently, CHRISTINE does not use the wordtag YM; it uses YMN for filled
pauses containing a nasal consonant, and YMV for wholly vocalic filled
pauses.
<H4>
YV, YVL, YVR:&nbsp; non-linguistic vocalizations, vocal shifts</H4>
The wordtag YV is used for a non-linguistic vocal sound;&nbsp; YVL and
YVR are used as shift elements identifying the beginning and end of stretches
of speech having special vocal properties.&nbsp; For details see &sect;8.4.
<H4>
YY:&nbsp; inaudible wording</H4>
YY is used to tag the entity <TT>{unclear}</TT>, representing a stretch
of speech whose wording could not be made out by the transcriber.&nbsp;
For details on the annotation of passages including such material, see
&sect;9.
<H4>
Slash Wordtags</H4>
When the form in the wordfield is identifiable as an incomplete or distorted
attempt to utter some particular word (as opposed to an unidentiable distorted
word, tagged FD), CHRISTINE assigns a wordtag made up of the tag that would
be assigned to the complete word, followed after a slash (solidus) character
by the dictionary form of the complete word:&nbsp; e.g. <I>thi</I> for
<I>this</I> is wordtagged <TT>DD1i/this</TT>.

<P>Because, typically, an imperfect word-token preserves the beginning
but not the end of the intended word, sometimes it is quite clear what
the word-stem is and only the inflexion is in doubt.&nbsp; However, since
CHRISTINE is concerned with grammatical structure, for our purposes the
inflexions of words are more significant than the stems.&nbsp; So, if there
is real doubt about which inflected form was intended, a word token will
be tagged FD even if the stem is unambiguous.

<P>Slash wordtags are not used for word forms which are nonstandard but
nevertheless conventional, e.g. <I>'em</I> for <I>them</I>, <I>+ta</I>
for <I>to</I> in <I>gotta</I>, <I>nowt</I> for <I>nothing</I> in Northern
dialect, etc.&nbsp; These are given simple wordtags, usually the same as
those assigned to the standard forms.&nbsp; Slash wordtags are used only
for forms which appear from the transcription to be performance deviations
from the speaker's own idiolectal norms.

<P>Since the CHRISTINE Corpus has been compiled from speech transcribed
by others, we are obviously in the original transcribers' hands for purposes
of deciding when a word was pronounced so imperfectly that it should be
transcribed other than in its standard orthography.&nbsp; No doubt some
transcribers were more skilled than others at "hearing" the intended words
behind the blunders of performance; so far as CHRISTINE annotation is
concerned,
a word was distorted or incomplete if it was intentionally transcribed
with abnormal orthography.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
13.3&nbsp; New Tagmatag Subcategories</H3>

<H4>
:y, Y:&nbsp; formally or functionally unanalysable</H4>
On the use of the formtag Y and the functiontag :y for material that is
unanalysable because inaudible or interrupted, see &sect;9.

<P>Except for these two symbols, which are irrelevant in the case of written
language, the CHRISTINE team made strenuous attempts to avoid postulating
new categories above the wordtag level (and, in general, to avoid modifying
the annotation guidelines laid down in <I>EFC</I> other than where it was
quite necessary to do so).&nbsp; Tagmatag categories relate to the logic
of linguistic expression more than to the superficial manner of expression;
it seemed reasonable to think of spoken and written English as two modes
for expressing the same range of logical relationships.

<P>Nevertheless, at one point it seemed unreasonable not to add two
subcategories
which were omitted from <I>EFC</I> by oversight:
<H4>
Mp, Mq:&nbsp; plural numeral phrase, <I>wh</I>- numeral phrase</H4>
With hindsight it seems irrational that <I>EFC</I> did not define the same
subcategories "plural" and "containing <I>wh</I>- word" for the phrase
category M, numeral phrase, as were defined for N (noun phrase), D (determiner
phrase), etc.&nbsp; It was a principle of the SUSANNE scheme that modification
by a number greater than one was not in itself a reason to ascribe the
plural subcategory to a phrase:&nbsp; <I>two sheep</I> is N, not Np (because
in practice numbers greater than one often occur in singular phrases).&nbsp;
But that is not a reason to avoid using the plural subcategory where the
head word of a numeral phrase is grammatically plural; and the arguments
for marking numeral phrases modified by a <I>wh</I>- word, e.g. <I>which
one</I>, with a distinctive subcategory symbol are as strong as for other
phrase categories.

<P>Accordingly CHRISTINE uses Mp for phrases whose head is a word tagged
MC2, and Mq for M phrases containing a modifying <I>wh</I>- word or ...q
phrase.

<P>This does leave a lack of parallelism between M and the other phrases
using the subcategory symbol p for plural.&nbsp; Ms is defined in <I>EFC</I>
not as a numeral phrase whose head is grammatically singular, but specifically
a phrase whose head is the word <I>one</I>.&nbsp; Accordingly, most M phrases,
where the head is a number word other than <I>one</I> but not with a plural
inflexion, are tagged just M, not Ms or Mp.
<H2>
14.&nbsp; New Precedents for Applying Existing Symbols</H2>

<H3>
14.1&nbsp; Accumulation of Precedents</H3>
It is beyond the scope of this documentation file to state a list of
annotation
precedents for speech at the level of detail contained in the 500-page
<I>EFC</I> book (which was based mainly on the experience of annotating
written corpora).&nbsp; Many new precedents have been set in the course
of annotating the CHRISTINE samples -- some relating specifically to
spoken-language
features, others of which might equally well have arisen in connexion with
written English.&nbsp; The project team has been collecting these precedents,
and we intend to compile them into a systematic statement and publish them,
probably via the Web, as a supplement to <I>EFC</I> in due course.&nbsp;
At this point, we must restrict ourselves to stating a limited number of
new precedents which proved to be specially significant because the features
to which they relate occur relatively frequently in our spoken samples.&nbsp;
They are listed below in the order in which the respective topics are dealt
with in <I>EFC</I>.
<H3>
14.2&nbsp; ICSk, <I>like</I></H3>
The word <I>like</I> has two uses as a "hedge" word in colloquial speech:
<UL>
<LI>
a long-established use in which <I>like</I> occurs following the item being
"hedged", e.g. <I>and then there were another six empty like</I>
T04.02392.&nbsp;
Impressionistically, this usage seems to be associated with provincial
or working-class speakers.</LI>

<LI>
a use which has come in recently from North America, and seems to be
associated
with young speakers on both sides of the Atlantic, in which <I>like</I>
precedes the "hedged" item, e.g. <I>it's like going very well</I>
T06.00647.[23]</LI>
</UL>
CHRISTINE wordtags both of these uses with the ordinary SUSANNE tag for
<I>like</I>, ICSk, but treats this item structurally like a discourse item
(U...), or a punctuation mark in written English:&nbsp; i.e. it is attached
to the tree as high as possible within the structure created for the
surrounding
wording.

<P>In the expression <I>feel like</I> meaning "feel inclined to (have)",
<I>like</I> is treated as initiating a P:e phrase (the complement of which
may be a noun phrase or a present-participle clause, e.g.<I> I feel </I>[P:e
<I>like</I> [Tg [Vg <I>dying</I> ] ] ] T12.04069).
<H3>
14.3&nbsp; UL, Response Elicitor</H3>
Many words and idioms which can occur as UR (Response) items, e.g. <I>all
right</I>, <I>really</I>, <I>oh</I>, also occur (with question intonation)
in the function of UL, Response Elicitor.&nbsp; Not all UR items have this
double use:&nbsp; for instance, <I>fine</I> occurs as UR but would not,
I think, occur as a Response Elicitor.

<P>Contrary to the usual SUSANNE practice of giving words fixed wordtags
independent of context where possible, we decided in this case that any
UR word would be tagged UL in cases where it occurs in the UL function.&nbsp;
Also, <I>mm</I> is tagged UL rather than UY when functioning interrogatively
(e.g. at T10.00944).&nbsp; (Other, more explicit UY forms are not tagged
UL even if functioning interrogatively -- <I>Yes?</I> would be UY.)

<P>The word <I>what</I> is tagged UL when it functions as a request for
the previous speaker to repeat what he has said.&nbsp; On the other hand,
in an exchange like <I>You've forgotten something -- What?</I>, where the
word abbreviates a question beginning <I>what</I> ("What have I forgotten?"),
or <I>why did you do that David -- what</I>, T35.00074-5, where David is
echoing the question and asking "why did I do what?", the word is wordtagged
DDQ and analysed as a Dq tagma.
<H3>
14.4&nbsp; Additional Idioms</H3>
The following multi-word phrases have been treated as "idioms" in the sense
of <I>EFC</I>, p. 99ff., though not listed in that book as such.&nbsp;
The list below includes all the new idioms from CHRISTINE/I, and some of
those from the additional texts to be included in the full CHRISTINE Corpus.

14.5&nbsp; Conflicting Phrase-Category Cues</H3>
More weight is given to closed-class than to open-class words in deciding
how to classify a phrase (even though the head word is usually an open-class
word), because it is much commoner for an open-class than a closed-class
word to acquire a new grammatical function.&nbsp; An example is the phrase
<I>a bit fucking crap ...</I> discussed in &sect;12.&nbsp; <I>Crap</I>
is listed as a noun and not as an adjective in the dictionary, but the
idiom <I>a bit</I> introduces an adjective phrase; so the phrase is analysed
as a J with a noun rather than an adjective as head.
<H3>
14.6&nbsp; Counting</H3>
When someone counts, e.g. <I>Right, one two {humming}</I> T27.03765, the
number words are not incorporated into a grammatical structure of
co-ordination
or the like:&nbsp; <I>right</I>_UR <I>one</I>_MC1 <I>two</I>_MC
<I>{humming}</I>_YV
with no tagmatags.
<H3>
14.7&nbsp; Adverbial Clause Disconnected from Main Clause</H3>
In speech, an adverbial clause adjacent to a question often logically modifies
not the questioned proposition but the speaker's reason for asking it:&nbsp;
<I>did I see him in that pub cos I've got no memory at all
</I>W09.00635.&nbsp;
In these cases the Fa is treated as disconnected from the S?, not subordinate
to it.&nbsp; Likewise, <I>I said</I> [Q:o [S? <I>why don't you go and see
if Martin will let you stay</I> ] [Fa <I>cos you've met him</I> ] Q:o]
W09.00681.&nbsp; In both of these examples the Fa begins with <I>cos</I>,
discussed above as being only marginally a subordinating conjunction in
colloquial speech; but I believe similar patterns can be found with "true"
subordinating conjunctions.
<H3>
14.8&nbsp; Adverbial Clause without Subordinating Conjunction</H3>
A subordinate clause functioning as an Fa is analysed as such even if it
lacks a subordination marker:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[S* [Fa:c <I>you think this year's bad for physics</I> ] <I>wait
to you start next year </I>] T27.03876</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
14.9&nbsp; L, Verbless Clause</H3>
Normally discourse items, wordtagged U..., are grammatically disjoint from
adjacent wording; but there are cases where such an item occurs as a
constituent
of a larger tagma.&nbsp; In these cases the higher tagma is labelled L.&nbsp;
Particularly common examples are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[L [UT= <I>thank you</I> ] [Ds:h <I>very much</I> ] ]
<BR>[L <I>yes</I>_UY [S+ <I>but</I> ... ] ]</BLOCKQUOTE>
or cases where an "interpolation" occurs not medially within but adjacent
to a single tagma to which it is linked in sense (so that it would be
misleading
to treat the two tagmas as disconnected):
<BLOCKQUOTE>[L [J:e <I>rather good</I> ] [I [S<I> I think</I> ] ] ]
W22.00136</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
14.10&nbsp; Ot, Title</H3>
The Ot category is used for names of school periods, e.g. <I>Geography</I>.

<P>It is also used for cases where a personal name is used as the name
of a regular television programme.&nbsp; Well-known cases are <I>Wogan</I>,
<I>Parkinson</I>.&nbsp; Examples occurring in CHRISTINE are <I>Carrot</I>,
<I>Mr Bean</I>, at T03.00830ff.&nbsp; It is noticeable in the latter passage
that these names are referred back to subsequently as <I>it</I>, not
<I>he</I>.
<H3>
14.11&nbsp; Q, Quotation</H3>
Written English uses inverted commas and other orthographic devices to
maintain a very clear distinction between direct and indirect quotation;
in the SUSANNE scheme, the category Q was strictly reserved for material
orthographically marked as direct quotation.&nbsp; In speech there is no
equivalent of inverted commas, and the Q category is used more freely for
any wording that the speaker seems to be "quoting" rather than "using";
if a speaker asked <I>what does wayzgoose</I> <I>mean</I>, the word
<I>wayzgoose</I>,
wordtagged NN1c, would be tagmatagged Q.

<P>When a speaker quotes someone else at length, it is common for him to
insert phrases such as <I>he said</I> periodically as a way of indicating
that "I am still quoting -- I haven't switched back to expressing my own
views yet".&nbsp; The CHRISTINE rule is that <I>he said </I>or similar
preceding the beginning of the quoted material (if there is such a phrase)
is treated as a superior clause within which the quoted material is a Q
or Fn, depending whether the quotation is cast predominantly in direct-
or indirect-speech form; any phrase like <I>he said</I> after the start
of the quoted material is a clause inserted as an interpolation:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[S <I>he said</I> [Q:o [S ... ] [S ... ] [I [S <I>he said</I>
] ] [S ... ] [S ... ] [I [S <I>he said</I> ] ] [S ... ] Q:o] S]</BLOCKQUOTE>
If quoted material is not preceded by a quoting phrase, but contains a
quoting phrase internally, the quoted material is analysed as a root Q
tagma containing the quoting phrase as an interpolation:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[Q <I>oh</I> [I [S <I>she said</I> ] ] [S <I>I </I># <I>you
can't do that</I> S] Q]&nbsp; T03.00945</BLOCKQUOTE>
(If there is no quoting phrase anywhere, then structurally speaking the
utterance is not marked as a quotation and is analysed as if it were the
speaker's own wording, without a Q node.)&nbsp; CHRISTINE does not use
the category Ss, Embedded Quoting Clause (<I>EFC</I> pp. 246-7), which
was introduced into the SUSANNE scheme for written English as a (perhaps
over-elaborate) way of dealing with the fact that direct quotation in writing
is sometimes governed by a quoting phrase placed medially within the
quotation.

<P>Rahman &amp; Sampson (forthcoming) discuss the fact that, in speech,
cues for classifying quoted material as direct or indirect speech can often
conflict.&nbsp; Consider, for instance:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[reporting the speaker's own response to a directly-quoted
objection]:&nbsp; <I>I said well that's his hard luck!</I> T15.10673
<BR><I>well Billy, Billy says well take that and then he'll come back and
then he er gone and pay that</I>&nbsp; T13.01053-5</BLOCKQUOTE>
In the former example, the discourse item <I>well</I> and the present tense
of <I>[i]s</I> after past-tense <I>said</I> suggest direct quotation; but
<I>his</I> rather than <I>your</I> suggests indirect speech (in context,
<I>his</I> refers to the person who was addressed).&nbsp; In the latter
case, after <I>says</I> the word <I>well</I> and the imperative <I>take</I>
imply direct speech, <I>he'll</I> rather than <I>I'll</I> implies indirect
speech.&nbsp; Arguably, it is artificial in annotating speech to use two
separate categories, Q and Fn; the linguistic reality is perhaps that
"directness
of quotation" is a cline with no sharp direct/indirect distinction to be
drawn.&nbsp; From a logical point of view, the distinction seems so
fundamental
that we have retained it in CHRISTINE; individual quotations are classified
as Q or as Fn depending whether the majority of indicators point one way
or the other.

<P>Quotations, particularly in young people's speech, are often introduced
by the verb <I>go</I> rather than by a transitive verb such as
<I>say</I>:&nbsp;
e.g.<I> I go sorry but I won't do it</I> T06.00365.&nbsp; Because <I>go</I>
is otherwise intransitive, quotations introduced by this verb are
functiontagged
Q:e rather than Q:o.[26]

<P>There are cases where speakers incorporate non-linguistic vocalizations
into the grammar of their surrounding wording, e.g. <I>and the fortune-teller
goes {vocal22}</I> T34.02929, where <TT>{vocal22}</TT> represents "sharp
intake of breath".&nbsp; In such a case the vocalization entity, wordtagged
YV, is tagmatagged as a Q within the clause:
<BLOCKQUOTE>[S+ <I>and the fortune-teller goes </I>[Q:e <I>{vocal22}</I>_YV
] ]</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>
14.12&nbsp; Co-ordinate Clauses</H3>
As discussed in <I>EFC</I>, &sect;6.14, in analysing speech we do not assume
that every clause beginning with a co-ordinating conjunction must be treated
as part of a larger co-ordinate construction.&nbsp; It is common for people
to utter clauses beginning <I>and</I>, where there is no strong logical
connexion between the <I>and</I> clause and what preceded -- sometimes
<I>and</I> may function as little more than verbal throat-clearing, an
audible warning that the speaker is about to take the floor, or to retain
it after his preceding utterance.&nbsp; Cases like this are treated as
S+ tagmas in which the node labelled S+ is a root node.&nbsp; In other
cases, clauses beginning with co-ordinating conjunctions are analysed as
"subordinate conjuncts" (<I>EFC</I>, p. 311) within larger co-ordinate
structures.&nbsp; Factors taken as reasons for assigning a co-ordinate
structure include:
<UL>
<LI>
use of a conjunction other than <I>and</I> (in particular, <I>but</I> normally
expresses a specific logical relationship between preceding and following
clauses)</LI>

<LI>
Co-ordination Reduction phenomena in the second clause (omission of
logically-needed
terms which are identical with terms at the corresponding positions in
the first clause)</LI>

<LI>
particularly close connexion in sense between the respective clauses, even
if the conjunction is <I>and</I> and there is no Co-ordination Reduction</LI>
</UL>
The third of these factors is quite vague, and we cannot pretend that
decisions
about whether to treat successive main clauses as co-ordinated or as separate
tagmas are as predictable as we have tried to make most aspects of the
annotation scheme.&nbsp; Written English uses punctuation to put this issue
beyond doubt; speech has no equivalent machinery, and it is difficult to
find any satisfactory hard-and-fast rule for discriminating between [S
... [S+ ... ] ] and [S ... ] [S+ ... ] structures.

<P>(Of course, when clauses linked by a co-ordinating conjunction are jointly
subordinate within a higher clause, they must be analysed as co-ordinated.)
<H3>
14.13&nbsp; :h, <I>don't bother</I></H3>
The turns of phrase <I>don't bother Verbing ...</I>, <I>don't bother to
Verb ...</I>, are common in speech.&nbsp; The material after <I>bother</I>
is treated as a Tg:h or Ti:h clause:&nbsp; <I>they don't bother</I> [Tg:h
<I>having scarecrows</I> ] <I>this time of year</I> T05.01167.
<H3>
14.14&nbsp; :r, <I>to do with</I></H3>
This expression, as in e.g.<I> it's nothing to do with the fact that he
stinks </I>T12.03958, is analysed as <I>it's</I> [Ns:e <I>nothing</I> [Ti
<I>to do</I> [P:r <I>with the fact ...</I> ] ] ].
<H2>
15. Errors and Inconsistencies in <I>English for the Computer</I></H2>
Since the publication of <I>EFC</I>, it has inevitably emerged that that
book contained a number of internal inconsistencies and mistakes. This
section lists these, so far as they have come to light, and specifies how
they have been resolved for the purpose of our further annotation work.
Note that this section deals only with actual errors in <I>EFC</I>. The
work of applying the annotation scheme to spoken English, under the CHRISTINE
project, has thrown up many issues on which the <I>EFC</I> scheme needs
to be extended with further detail; those are not treated here. (The most
important points were treated in &sect;14.)

<P>p.90, &sect;3.26: The list of proper-name wordtags should include NP1t
for names of towns, etc., cf. p.113.

<P>p.105, APPGi1: The words "as possessive" do not eliminate any use of
<I>my</I> (&sect;4.457, pp.308-9, explicitly states that <I>my</I> as an
exclamation receives the same wordtag). APPGi1 applies to all uses of
<I>my</I>.

<P>p.105, CC:&nbsp; the idiom <I>as well as</I> should have been classified
as II, not CC.&nbsp; (This phrase is annotated wrongly in Release 4 of
the SUSANNE Corpus.)

<P>p.106, CSf; p.109, IF; and cf. pp. 269-70, &sect;4.357:&nbsp; it should
be made explicit that the <I>for</I> of a Tf clause is wordtagged IF, not
CSf.

<P>p.106, DDo: the word <I>plenty</I> should be added to <I>a_lot</I>.

<P>p.111, MD: The statement that ordinal forms such as <I>third</I> are
given this tag even when used as fractions is inconsistent with the statement
(&sect;4.268, p.238) that spelled-out fractions are wordtagged as nouns.
The latter rule is preferred to the former.

<P>p.116, RGi: The alternative tags for <I>about</I> should include RL,
and for <I>over</I> should include JB.

<P>p.120, II: The inclusion of <I>given</I> is inconsistent with note 48,
p.133; the approach of the latter is preferred, and II is dropped as a
tag for <I>given</I>.

<P>p.121, middle of page, list of II words having the alternative tag RL:
this list should not contain <I>by</I>, since its tags are IIb and RL.

<P>p.121: The list of RL words should include <I>about</I>, as in e.g.
<I>play about</I>, <I>go about</I>.

<P>p.122, middle of page: <I>midway</I> should not be listed as having
the alternative tag RR (see the note under RR, p.117, about incompatibility
of the wordtags RL and RR).

<P>p.122, RR= idioms: <I>all_the_same</I> should be added.

<P>p.123, RR= idioms: This list should not include <I>upside_down</I>,
which is an RL= idiom (see the note under RR, p.117, about incompatibility
of the wordtags RL and RR).

<P>p.137, &sect;3.107: The sentence about animal names is inexplicit but
seems to refer exclusively to cases where animals are named after other
entities. A proper name applying only to an animal is tagged NP1m or NP1f.

<P>p.175, &sect;4.56: The example <I>a shear field ...</I> should not have
been included here, because the word <I>shear</I> (which is in any case
not the head of its phrase) is being used as a noun (a technical usage
listed in <I>COD</I>). This is an error in Release 4 of SUSANNE, as well
as in <I>EFC</I>: repeatedly in SUSANNE text J03 this sense of <I>shear</I>
has inappropriately been tagged as a verb.

<P>p.191, &sect;4.102: With respect to examples in which a modal verb,
or the quasi-modal <I>had</I>, is followed by <I>better</I>, <I>rather</I>,
etc., without a further verb following in the same group (e.g. the D11
example, or the sequence <I>... would rather this was put ...</I>, CHRISTINE
T28.08740), the rule stated here contradicts the rule stated on p.271,
&sect;4.363. The latter rule is preferred. (On the other hand, in a sequence
like <I>... would rather go ...</I>, the main verb <I>go</I> completes
the verb group initiated by <I>would</I>, and this is analysed as a Vc
with <I>rather</I> as an included adverbial.)

<P>p.194, &sect;4.111:&nbsp; It ought to be more explicit than it is made
here that Vx is not intended to include verb groups in which <I>DO</I>
replaces a more specific main verb, e.g.:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Suzanne056:&nbsp; <I>I do</I> # <I>can't remember that --</I>
Zoe055:&nbsp; <I>oh you</I> [Vc <I>must do</I> ]&nbsp;
T12.03911-13</BLOCKQUOTE>
p.229, &sect;4.233: The word <I>everywhere</I> should be included in the
list of words yielding the Rw subcategory.

<P>pp.242-3, &sect;4.281: This rule implies, but ought to state explicitly,
that when the verb omitted in informal usage is the sole verb of its clause,
as in <I>you busy</I> for "Are you busy?" W30.0133, the category used is
L rather than S: <I>he said</I> [Q:o [L? <I>you on the finance committee</I>
] ] T28.08721.

<P>p.256, &sect;4.315: "as discussed in &sect;5.77" should read "as discussed
in &sect;5.85".

<P>p.273, &sect;4.368: In the first bullet point, the pattern <I>the same
... as ...</I> should be added to <I>as ... as ...</I> and <I>so ... as
...</I> (cf. &sect;4.319).

<P>p.298, &sect;4.424: In the first displayed example, <I>Having all the
guns ...</I>, the tag Vex should read Vzex.

<P>pp.303-4, &sect;4.40: The sequence <I>not even to Fergus</I> should
be tagged L@, not S@: in co-ordination, "subordinate conjuncts" are given
the category of the full tagma from which elements have been removed through
Co-ordination Reduction, but the latter concept is not applicable to
appositional
constructions.

<P>p.304, &sect;4.444: The rule beginning "and, if this material begins
with a verb, ...", which is restated in &sect;5.71, p.382, seems with
hindsight
to be one of the most unfortunate decisions included in <I>EFC</I>. Many
existential-<I>there</I> examples (including the <I>a lot of rot talked
...</I> case here) would be most naturally analysed by treating the part
of <I>BE</I> following <I>there</I>, and the verb following the subject,
as two halves of one divided verb group.&nbsp; (Nevertheless, CHRISTINE
sticks to the <I>EFC</I> rule.)

<P>p.305, &sect;4.447: It should be made explicit that this passage, dealing
with annotation of written English, and &sect;6.28, p.446, dealing with
annotation of speech, specify contrasting analyses for exactly the same
construction.

<P>p.330, &sect;4.507: In the CHRISTINE project, which is concerned with
the spoken language where there are no elements such as inverted commas
or italics marking quoted wording, a decision was made to treat the sequences
which in this section are classified as appositional instead as Q tagmas.
This would probably have been a better decision for the written language
also.

<P>p.334, &sect;4.514: The reference "&sect;4.517" in the last line of
this section should read "&sect;4.510".

<P>p.379, &sect;5.64, first displayed example: "Nns:S1" should read
"Nns:S123".

<P>p.388, &sect;5.85: In the first displayed example, the tags "Ncs:e"
and "Ps:q" should read "Ns:e" and "P:q". (An earlier version of the SUSANNE
scheme used subcategories Nc and Ps which were eliminated from the version
of the scheme used in the published corpus and in <I>EFC</I>.)

<P>p.418, &sect;5.154: The inclusion here of the last example, <I>But</I>
[A:m <I>as I have said before</I>] ..., contradicts the statement at the
end of &sect;5.198, p.433, that A clauses are given the functiontag :x
when they act as propositional relatives, as in &sect;4.370, p.275. The
<I>as I have said before</I> example is indistinguishable from the examples
in &sect;4.370, and should be tagged A:x rather than A:m.

<P>p.422, &sect;5.164: This section is contradicted by &sect;5.188, pp.428-9,
which states that W clauses are always functiontagged :b. It will be
preferable
to give up the rule of &sect;5.164 and to change all its examples of :c
to :b.

<P>p.434, &sect;5.200, first displayed example: The tag Vaet should read
Vaeut.

<P>p.448, &sect;6.31, UX: Listing <I>the_hell</I> here implies a different
analysis of this construction when it occurs in speech from the analysis
prescribed on p.307, &sect;4.452, for the same construction when it occurs
in written representations of dialogue. The CHRISTINE project has meanwhile
evolved a new approach to the annotation of "swearwords", explicitly changing
various decisions in this book.&nbsp; Of the items listed under UX,
Expletives,
on p. 448 of <I>EFC</I>:
<UL>
<LI>
<I>damn</I>, <I>hell</I>, <I>the hell</I>, <I>oh bloody hell</I>, <I>fuck
off</I> are now handled as discussed in &sect;12, above (<I>oh bloody hell
</I>would be UR [Ns! FLJ FL1 ])</LI>

<LI>
<I>good heavens</I>, <I>good heavens above</I> are given "ordinary" wordtags
(<I>heavens</I> is NN2) and as phrases are tagmatagged Np!</LI>

<LI>
<I>gosh</I> remains UX (by the reasoning in &sect;12 -- like <I>blimey</I>,
it seems never to be integrated into surrounding grammar)</LI>

<LI>
<I>for goodness sake</I>, and other exclamations ending in <I>sake</I>,
continue to be treated as UX= idioms</LI>
</UL>
p.448, &sect;6.31, UR: In fact <I>right?</I> is often used in speech as
a tag question of the kind discussed on p.298, &sect;4.425, and this use
is appropriately wordtagged UL.

Notes</H2>
[1]&nbsp; The name CHRISTINE was chosen as a distinctive label for the
project under discussion, which is unlikely to coincide with names of other
projects formed on the acronym principle, and has an appropriate relationship
with the name of the earlier SUSANNE project.&nbsp; My group has a tradition
of using names of female saints, Anglicized for brevity.&nbsp; CHRISTINE
is the successor project to SUSANNE, and St Christina is the successor
to St Susanna in the Calendar of Saints.&nbsp; (The life of St Christina
also had features making her a suitable patroness for a project concerned
with speech; see the project web page.)

<P>[2]&nbsp; Other, independently-invented treebank annotation schemes
have since been developed for other treebanks.&nbsp; It has not seemed
practical or desirable to change our scheme to make it more like
later-emerging
schemes, which have not always been defined at the same level of detail.

<P>[3]&nbsp; Some of the written material in the BNC pre-dates the 1990s,
since published writings are often read years after they were written.

<P>[4]&nbsp; The BNC <I>Manual</I> does not explain the principles behind
the regional sampling. It appears that Britain was divided into a limited
number of large regions, and recruits were selected from the different
regions, perhaps in proportion to population, but there was little or no
attempt to achieve geographic spread within each individual region: there
are many cases where several recruits all came from the same small village,
perhaps because the Corpus compilers happened to have connexions there.

<P>[5]&nbsp; There is also at least one case of the opposite type of coding
confusion in BNC, where the same coding is used with contrasting
meanings:&nbsp;
see contributions to the BNC discussion list,
<TT>bnc-discuss@maillist.ox.ac.uk</TT>,
by David McKelvie and by Lou Burnard, both dated 6.1.1997.

<P>[6]&nbsp; The ratio would be slightly different for the published version
of CHRISTINE, which has redistributed various categories of information
between fields in wordlines and independent lines of their own.

<P>[7]&nbsp; To avoid confusion stemming from frequent changes of counties
and county boundaries over the last quarter-century, place names in CHRISTINE
notes files, as commonly in long-term scholarly publication, use the
traditional
pre-1974 counties.

<P>[8]&nbsp; The BNC <I>Manual</I> seems confused on this point. For instance,
BNC text F8R, the source of CHRISTINE text V01, is described on p. 229
of the <I>Manual</I> as a lecture and as involving "two participants",
PS000 and the lecturer PS1PR; but the section of the file from which the
CHRISTINE text is extracted appears to be a tutorial discussion involving
several different students, all shown as PS000.

<P>[9]&nbsp; A revised version of this scheme has now appeared, changing
the range of categories in the light of changing social and employment
patterns during the 1990s.&nbsp; The 1990-1 version of the scheme was the
one in standard use at the period when the BNC/demographic recordings were
made, and is the version discussed here.

<P>[10]&nbsp; The rationale for this complication in the BNC structure
is not entirely clear.&nbsp; The BNC compilers perhaps felt that a nonverbal
vocalization could not be called a "sentence", though there seems no good
reason why an inaudible stretch of wording should not count as an "utterance".

<P>[11]&nbsp; Occasionally, BNC shows a "beginning" time-pointer entity
occurring within a word rather than between words (e.g. at T05.01149 a
pointer interrupts <I>mini-series</I>, which is otherwise treated by BNC
as a single word).&nbsp; CHRISTINE marks such a case with the ampersand
symbol as if the time-pointer preceded the word within which it occurs.

<P>[12]&nbsp; Our original plan was to mark the words following "opening"
but not "closing" time pointers -- words <I>d</I> and <I>h</I> in the example
-- which would have made for a more logical system.&nbsp; However, the
BNC time-pointer entities are not themselves marked as opening or closing
-- this status can only be inferred from their pattern of occurrence; and
their distribution is not always as straightforward as in the schematic
example above.&nbsp; For instance, the BNC original of source-units
T01.02621-3
displays the following pattern:
<BLOCKQUOTE>Harold001:&nbsp; .<I>.. ptr1 ... ptr2 ...</I>
<BR>Jean003:&nbsp; <I>ptr1 ... ptr3 ... ptr2</I>
<BR>Harold001:&nbsp; <I>ptr3 ... ptr2</I></BLOCKQUOTE>
On the face of it, this seems to mean that part of Harold's first turn
was simultaneous with the whole of Jean's, and that Harold produced a further
turn which was simultaneous with the latter part of Jean's turn -- and
therefore with part of his own first turn.&nbsp; This is senseless; we
have no way of establishing what was actually happening, so we adopted
the ampersand system described here as one into which the BNC notation
could be mechanically translated.

<P>[13]&nbsp; From the "localization" aspects of some modern word-processing
software, it appears that American information technologists are under
the impression that standard British English requires the <I>-ise</I> variant
of this suffix. That is incorrect; <I>-ise</I> is an optional variant,
and high-prestige publishers and style manuals tend to prefer <I>-ize</I>.

<P>[14]&nbsp; Disyllabic v. monosyllabic pronunciation (<I>because</I>
v. <I>cos</I>) and status as subordinating v. co-ordinating conjunction
may be two independent issues; there may be cases where <I>because</I>,
pronounced as such, is equally drained of subordinating force. Note that
the point made above is not the banal one that spontaneous speech is sometimes
logically vague or confused; other subordinating conjunctions, e.g.
<I>although</I>,
<I>if</I>, <I>when</I>, seem to retain their subordinator status even in
spontaneous speech, and the point made here is specific to <I>cos/because</I>.

<P>[15]&nbsp; Certain duration markers were unfortunately lost by an oversight
in the process of reformatting BNC into CHRISTINE files.&nbsp; This is
believed to apply only to markers occurring in the exceptional source-units
numbered <TT>00000</TT> or <TT>-----</TT>, discussed in &sect;6.5.&nbsp;
For instance, the <TT>{unclear}</TT> entity produced by Sadie148 immediately
before T40.00141 should have been recorded as <TT>{unclear_8}</TT>.

<P>[16]&nbsp; However, when a clause is interrupted immediately after its
subject, the functiontag :s is used, as overwhelmingly most likely to apply,
even though in theory the verb might have turned out to be passive in which
case the subject would have been functiontagged :S.&nbsp; Thus:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>this sort of idea {pause}</I> [Fn <I>that</I> [Ny:s <I>you</I>
] # <I>it wasn't your own room</I> ] W09.00502</BLOCKQUOTE>
[17]&nbsp; This rule may be not only easier to apply but more appropriate
with respect to user needs.&nbsp; An important application area for annotated
speech corpora is likely to lie in the area of improved automatic speech
understanding systems; the wordtag hypotheses generated by speech-recognition
software are likely to be limited to those listed for particular wordforms
in standard dictionaries.

<P>[18]&nbsp; Here it is possible that the oddity is not grammatical but
is the transcriber's misunderstanding of the speaker's London accent.&nbsp;
A London [tIw] for <I>till</I> might be heard from an RP perspective as
<I>to</I>.&nbsp; But there is no indication in the transcription that the
wordform was anything other than a normal utterance of <I>to</I>, so we
have taken the transcription at face value.

<P>[19]&nbsp; The BNC transcribers typically fail to distinguish <I>in't</I>
(= <I>ain't</I>) from <I>in t'</I> (N.E. England <I>in the</I>), writing
both as <I>int</I>.&nbsp; But in context these are easily distinguished.

<P>[20]&nbsp; In fact the <I>i-</I> of <I>innit</I> is probably ambiguous
with respect to person also; for instance Cheshire (1982: 58) records a
tag question in the form <I>in I</I> where standard English would have
<I>aren't I</I>.

<P>[21]&nbsp; It is very common to represent a laugh with exactly two such
syllables, <I>ha ha</I> or <I>ho ho</I>, so that these "phrases" might
be treated as US= idioms.&nbsp; However, this treatment was rejected as
over-ingenious; in CHRISTINE, each "laughter" syllable, written as a separate
word in our source transcriptions, is treated as a whole US "word", and
a sequence of such "words" are not grouped as a tagma.

<P>[22]&nbsp; For the benefit of any American users of CHRISTINE, it should
perhaps be explained that, because standard RP is a non-rhotic variety
of English, the letter sequence <I>er</I> is seen in England as a digraph
representing the shwa vowel, and is the conventional orthographic device
for representing shwa as a filled pause -- the sound which American writings
typically show as <I>uh</I>.&nbsp; The BNC transcribers spelled almost
all vocalic filled pauses as <I>er</I>.&nbsp; Scots English is strongly
rhotic and, I believe, contains shwa only as a checked vowel; in consequence
Scots use a different, front vowel as a pause filler, and this is
conventionally
written <I>eh</I>.&nbsp; (I am not sure what speakers of other rhotic regional
dialects do about filled pauses.)

<P>[23]&nbsp; Mahdi (1998) comments that he first encountered this use
of <I>like</I> "in <I>Mad</I> magazine around 1959 or 1960, when it was
still explicitly characterized as Californian colloquial or youth".&nbsp;
In Britain I am sure it is a more recent innovation.&nbsp; A possible example
does occur at W09.00511, recorded as early as 1975; but this might
alternatively
be seen as a case of <I>like</I> in its literal sense.

<P>[24]&nbsp; This corresponds both to a comparative adjective, JJR, and
to an adjective used only predicatively, JA. We do not want to invent a
new wordtag such as JAR, so the idiomtag JJR= was used.

<P>[25]&nbsp; One phrase, <I>how are you</I>, listed in <I>EFC</I> as a
discourse-item idiom, is treated instead in CHRISTINE as a question with
ordinary internal grammar.&nbsp; It is noticeable both that most CHRISTINE
speakers treat <I>How are you?</I> as a question to be given an answer,
and that speakers sometimes vary the grammar of the phrase.

<P>[26]&nbsp; Incidentally, this construction is probably not as peculiar
to "youthspeak" as some commentators suggest.&nbsp; I think it would be
normal in the speech (or writing) of all age-groups to use wording such
as <I>The timer went "ping"</I>; the only thing that is distinctive about
young people's use of the construction is that it is generalized to cases
where the sounds described are verbal.
