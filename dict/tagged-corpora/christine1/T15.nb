<h2>Date</h2>

<h2>Place</h2>

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>

<li>Ernest068, m, 78, retired, SE, XX

</ul>

Malcolm066 is their son.
Malcolm066 and Joyce064 are man and wife.
Anthony065 is their son.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>All speakers are given the &quot;East Anglia&quot; 
BNC dialect code applicable to
Norfolk, and hence are labelled SE in CHRISTINE.  However, note that
Walpole St Peter (about 8 m. West of King's Lynn) is adjacent to the point
where Norfolk, Lincs., and Cambridgeshire meet, and hence not far from
Trudgill's main &quot;North/South&quot; English isogloss.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Joyce064 as C2, Anthony065 and Malcolm066 as DE, others
unclassified.  Malcolm066 seems by occupation to be SOC class IIIM (though
the system is not quite clear, cf. Scott029 in text T07), in which case he
would be CHRISTINE class C2.  This confirms his wife Joyce064 as C2, and
implies also C2 for their son Anthony065.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>10662:  <i>I said you give me my bloody keys</i>:  
in context it seems rather likely
that the word transcribed <i>I</i> was intended as <i>he</i>.  But the issue
is not certain, and the word may have been a slip of the tongue
rather than a mistranscription, so the BNC transcription has been
preserved in CHRISTINE.

<p>10710:  <i>Who's is that caravan</i> emended to <i>Whose is that caravan</i>

<p>10717:  <i>alright</i> emended to <i>all right</i>

<p>10740:  <i>a back up</i> emended to <i>a backup</i>

<p>10740:  <i>policeman</i> emended to <i>policemen</i> 
(the context requires plural, and there
would be no pronunciation difference in ordinary speech)

<p>10755:  <i>theirself</i>, although nonstandard, is taken to have been intended
as transcribed, and to count as a singular rather than plural
reflexive pronoun

<p>10797:  <i>could well of</i> emended to <i>could well've</i>

<p>10825:  <i>to have open that</i> emended to <i>to have opened that</i> 
(between [n] and
voiced interdental fricative, presence v. absence of [d] would
be scarcely detectable)

<p>10860:  <i>coming at and</i>:  it is tempting to emend to <i>coming out and</i>, 
but with so little clear context this seems too risky to adopt.

<p>10878:  <i>mud guards</i> emended to <i>mudguards</i>

<p>10888:  <i>however</i> emended to <i>how ever</i> 
(the sense is <i>how ever</i> comparable to
<i>how on earth</i>)

<p>10890:  <i>Course</i> emended to <i>Cos</i>:  this is a rather bold emendation, 
but the context
strongly calls for <i>because</i> rather than <i>of course</i>, and the
pronunciation difference might not be great

<p>10921:  <i>forever</i> emended to <i>for ever</i> (according to <i>COD</i>, 
the one-word orthography
is not used in this sense)
