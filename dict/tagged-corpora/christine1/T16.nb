<h1>Text T16</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KCX

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>30 Jan to 7 Feb 1992

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Dunscroft, near Doncaster

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>at home, making tea/conversation

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Maureen069, f, 37, crossing warden, NO, C2
<li>Nick070, m, 39, electrician, NO, C2

</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Speakers are man and wife.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>In BNC, both speakers are given the London dialect code, which is obviously
implausible (many features of the speakers' utterances contradict it).
Steve Crowdy of the BNC team explained to me in an e-message
dated 15 June 1997 that there had been a clerical confusion between codes
for London and for &quot;Central Northern England&quot;, which
covers the Doncaster area, 
and that these two speakers should have been given the latter code.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Maureen069 as C2 and leaves Nick070 unclassified.  His
occupation is SOC code 521, IIIM, hence C2, and this confirms the BNC code
for his wife (who would by occupation be DE).



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>06968:  <i>Ah went in</i> emended to <i>I went in</i>.  
Speaker is classified as Central Northern
England; <i>ah</i> represents the regular Northern vowel corresponding
to the RP <i>I</i> diphthong, and is given a special transcription only
because it is specially noticeable in the word <i>I</i> at the beginning
of an utterance -- CHRISTINE would not normally use nonstandard
spellings for phonologically-predictable dialect variation.

<p>06989:  <i>with bloody out</i>:  see the discussion of this form in
the &quot;Swearwords&quot; section of the Documentation file.

<p>07011:  <i>big'un</i> emended to <i>big 'un</i>  
(Note that, unlike <i>Ah</i> for <i>I</i> above,
<i>'un</i> and <i>one</i> are two distinct forms even in 
standard informal 
English.)

<p>07035, 07062:  <i>a laughing</i> emended to <i>a-laughing</i>

<p>07083:  <i>int</i> emended to <i>in't</i>

<p>07096:  <i>hell fire</i> emended to <i>hell-fire</i>

<p>07172:  <i>Snot snot</i> emended to <i>'s not 's not</i> 
(this seems to be what he is saying -- i.e. <i>it's not, it's not</i>)

<p>07244:  <i>Were where it?</i> emended to <i>Where were it?</i> 
(this is assumed to be
transcriber error rather than an idiosyncratic spoken construction)
