<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>01293:  <i>your mother's</i> emended to <i>your mothers</i>

<p>01330:  <i>she do n't</i> emended to <i>she don't</i>.  
The original BNC file is coded as
though the transcriber put a space between <i>do</i> and the
negative enclitic; probably this is a random error in the
HTML encoding rather than an error by the original transcriber,
but either way it is clear that the normal orthographic
version is <i>don't</i>.

<p>01341:  The word <i>swinehunt</i>, marked <i>sic</i> in BNC, 
is clearly a version of
the German insult <i>Schweinhund</i> (pig-dog).  But the spelling seems
to imply that the pronunciation has been Anglicized, so it would
be misleading to correct the form to the German spelling; conversely,
to spell it <i>swinehound</i> would imply a greater difference from the
German pronunciation than was actually used.  So it seems best to
leave the BNC transcription and treat <i>swinehunt</i> as an English
nonce-word.

<p>01355:  <i>on heritage</i> emended to <i>on Heritage</i>.  
In context, it sounds as though
the speaker Charlie133 
(identified in the BNC files as a &quot;security
guard&quot;) is working as a warden for English Heritage, the 
organization which preserves and entertains visitors to
historical monuments.

<p>01366:  <i>G C S E</i> emended to <i>GCSE</i> 
(General Certificate of Secondary Education);
<i>geography</i> emended to <i>Geography</i> (CHRISTINE treats names of school
subjects/courses as &quot;titles&quot;, like book titles, though NB
<i>new geography</i> in 01369 is treated as a descriptive term
rather than a title).

<p>01385:  <i>uncompromising</i> should be <i>compromising</i>, 
but this is evidently
the speaker's malapropism (arguably quite an well-chosen one).

<p>01423:  <i>spaghetti bolognaise</i> emended to 
<i>spaghetti Bolognese</i> (the <i>COD</i>-approved
spelling)

<p>01432-4:  BNC has the speakers exchanging the word <i>bonsai</i> 
(a type of
Japanese decorative miniature tree) apparently as a greeting; 
nothing relating to bonsai trees occurs elsewhere in the text, and
this passage reads bizarrely.  It can be made much more plausible
by taking <i>bonsai</i> to be a transcriber's mishearing of <i>bon soir</i>,
French for <i>good evening</i>, and this emendation has been adopted
although it is admittedly a bold one.  The speakers are both
students, and from other passages appear to have a slightly
literary turn of mind.  (It is possible, perhaps, that a couple
might use a private language in which <i>bonsai</i> was deliberately
substituted for <i>bon soir</i>, rather as English schoolchildren 
say <i>mercy buckets</i> to one another as a deliberate distortion of
<i>merci beaucoup</i>; but this seems a remote possibility.)

<p>01525:  BNC has an opening vocalization shift before <i>all right</i> which
is never balanced by a closing shift.  CHRISTINE has inserted
a closing shift at the end of the speaker's turn, as a guess
at the appropriate location.

<p>01531, 01534 (twice):  <i>Ebonezer Good</i> emended to <i>Ebenezer Good</i>.  
(A reference to 
this name was found on the WWW, however the page referred to was 
not available so it is not known who he is.)

<p>01546:  <i>U two</i> emended to <i>U2</i> (name of a pop group)

<p>01576:  <i>D L T</i> emended to <i>DLT</i> 
(apparently the name of a radio station)

<p>01587-94:  This passage quotes a pop song by the singer Apache Indian,
the title of which according to his website is spelled
<i>Boomschackalak</i>.  This word occurs several times in the passage,
and has (understandably) been mangled in various ways by the
transcriber; it is corrected in CHRISTINE, but the present notes do not
specify the exact forms found in the BNC text.  The first instance
of the word is split in BNC across two non-contiguous s-units,
01587 and 01589, split by an interruption by speaker Leonie132; each
part of the word is separately marked as sung rather than spoken.
CHRISTINE places the whole word on one line and hence s-unit number
01589 does not occur, and only one pair of vocal-shift entities are 
shown.

<p>01609:  <i>God damn woman</i> emended to <i>God-damn woman</i>

<p>01623:  <i>F M, T T V</i> emended to <i>FM TTV</i>.  
<i>FM</i> presumably stands for <i>frequency
modulation</i>; <i>TTV</i> is surmised to stand for <i>terrestrial
television (set)</i>, though the abbreviation is not familiar.

<p>01624:  <i>EastEnders</i>:  <i>sic</i>, this is the 
BBC's spelling of their soap
opera series

<p>01641:  <i>any one</i> emended to <i>anyone</i>

<p>01646-7:  CHRISTINE has anonymized the name of a female show business
personality (whose name is spelled out in BNC), in view
of the tone of the remarks made about her.

<p>01661:  The full stop after <i>Bye-bye</i> 
is not split off in BNC as a separate
&quot;word&quot;.  Hence by BNC standards s-unit 01661 should be, 
but is not,
two separate s-units.
