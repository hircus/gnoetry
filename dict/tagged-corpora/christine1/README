The CHRISTINE Corpus, Stage I

Prof. Geoffrey Sampson, University of Sussex


Apart from this README file, Stage I of the CHRISTINE Corpus comprises
83 files, named "Documentation", "Lexicon", "Speakers",
"T01.nb" to "T40.nb", and "T01.tx" to "T40.tx".  The file "Documentation"
is in HTML format, and so can be read in any Web browser; it contains
full details about the make-up of the Corpus, and new users should begin
by consulting that file.
