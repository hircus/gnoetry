<h1>Text T22</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KDJ

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>21 to 28 Feb 1992

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Newton Abbot, Devon

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>sitting at table, talking about work/conversation

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mary085, f, 26, unemployed, NO, C1
<li>Jim086, m, 53, sales assistant, SC, C1
<li>Sharon087, f, 26, telephonist, SC, DE
<li>Peter088, m, 2, n/a, SC, DE
</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Mary085, Jim086, and Sharon087 are friends.
BNC shows Peter088 as a colleague of Mary085, but for a two-year-old this
cannot be correct.  From various passages including s-units 01331-2 it
appears that he is in fact son of Sharon087.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>The Northern English and Scottish dialect codes are surprising for a group
of people in Devon, however they are confirmed by features of their speech.
 (It is not clear what kind of locale the recordings were made in.  Several
speakers not represented in the CHRISTINE extract are described as 
&quot;canvassers&quot;, and most of the file divisions 
are characterized as &quot;talking
about work&quot;, so the material may perhaps have been recorded at premises
used by one of the political parties in the run up to the General Election
of April 1992.  But there are other types of &quot;canvasser&quot;.)
Peter088 is not assigned a dialect code in BNC, perhaps because the concept
seems inapplicable to a two-year-old; as Sharon's son (see above) he
has been assigned the Scottish code.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Mary085 as C1, Jim086 and Sharon087 as DE, and does not
classify Peter088.  Jim is SOC code 720, IIIN, hence C1.  Sharon is SOC
code 462, IV, so DE is correct; and Peter088 inherits her code.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>01224 and passim:  Jim086, as a Scottish speaker, frequently uses the
form <i>eh</i> as a filled pause where an Englishman would say
<i>er</i>

<p>01332:  <i>wee wee</i> emended to <i>wee-wee</i>

<p>01337:  <i>were</i> emended to <i>where</i>, <i>won't</i> 
emended to <i>want</i> (emendations are suggested by
the sense; the speaker is Scottish, which possibly makes the latter
more plausible as an English transcriber error)

<p>01345:  <i>one two four</i> emended to <i>one to four</i> 
(in context, the phrase seems to
stand for a period of hours)

<p>01345:  <i>should of</i> emended to <i>should've</i>

<p>01371-2:  BNC has <i>ambiguity and sprouts and spuds</i>, 
apparently describing a 
meal.  This bizarre sequence may possibly represent a place where the
BNC transcriber used the word <i>ambiguity</i> to note that a portion of
the speech was ambiguous, and this note later was misinterpreted as
a transcription of a spoken word; alternatively, <i>ambiguity</i> could
be a mishearing of some particular food name.  The only possibility
occurring to the CHRISTINE team as at all similar was <i>hamburgers</i>,
and the decision was made to adopt this extremely risky emendation.

<p>01437:  <i>Crunella</i> emended to <i>Cringila</i> (name of 
a township S.W. of Sydney; this is
the closest plausible interpretation found for the form in BNC).

<p>01441:  <i>got to</i> emended to <i>got two</i> (in context 
it is clear that this was the
broken-off beginning of a sequence such as <i>got two million</i>)

<p>01461:  <i>swimming pool</i> emended to <i>swimming-pool</i>

<p>01470:  <i>must of</i> emended to <i>must've</i>
