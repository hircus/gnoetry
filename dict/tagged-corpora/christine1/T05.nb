<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Penny023 as C1, Sophie024 and Pat025 as DE, and leaves
Celine026 unclassified.  But Pat025's occupation is SOC code 190, II, so
CHRISTINE classifies him and his wife and daughter AB.


<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>01032: <i>Cellywelly</i> represents a pet-name created by abbreviating
the <i>nom de corpus</i> Celine and adding a rhyming extension.  The
corresponding form in BNC, based on the child's real name, was transcribed
as two separate words, perhaps because the transcriber misunderstood it.

<p>01037ff:  This turn has been reassigned from Sophie024 (in BNC) to Penny023 to
make sense of the social situation.

<p>01086, 01090:  <i>thingie</i> emended to <i>thingy</i>

<p>01143:  <i>Waller Birds</i> emended to <i>Whirlybirds</i> 
(television programme about an
Australian helicopter rescue team).  BNC marked <i>Waller Birds</i>
<i>sic</i>; that marker has been removed, since
we believe <i>Whirlybirds</i> is the correct reading.

<p>01159, 01169, 01204:  <i>int</i> emended to <i>in't</i>

<p>01167:  <i>don't see in</i> emended to <i>don't seed in</i>, 
to make sense of the utterance
(this is assumed to be mishearing by the transcriber)

<p>01174:  <i>dee da, dee da's</i> emended to <i>dee-da-dee-da's</i>.  
This is an imitation of
notes from a fire engine siren; there is no standard orthography
for such a thing, and since it is treated by the speaker as a
noun with a plural ending, for CHRISTINE purposes it is most
conveniently placed on a single line.

<p>01205:	<i>Ooh er</i> emended to <i>Oo-er</i> (this seems to be 
an example of a recognized
two-syllable exclamation)

<p>01214:	<i>Zouch</i> is evidently a reference to the market town of 
Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leics. 
(or possibly to the nearby village of Zouch).
The form <i>Zouch</i> is derived from
the name of Alain de Parrhoet la Zouch, who became lord of the
manor in 1160, hence by SUSANNE rules the wordtag is NP1s.

<p>01260:	<i>Dennis</i> emended to <i>Denis</i> (the default spelling of the name)
