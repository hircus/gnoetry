<h1>Text T23</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KDL

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>30 Nov to 5 Dec 1991

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Woking, Surrey

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>shops, shopping/conversation

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Pauline089, f, 16, student, SE, AB
<li>Angela090, f, 65, retired (spelled <i>retied</i> in BNC), SW, DE
<li>Gillian091, f, 44, doctor, SW, AB

</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Gillian091 is daughter of Angela090.
Pauline089 is daughter of Gillian091.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>BNC assigns Pauline089 the London dialect code, and assigns the code 
&quot;Upper
Southwest&quot; (i.e. the Gloucester/Hereford area) to the other two speakers.
This is a reasonable scenario if, say, Angela090 had moved from the West
Country to the London area at a point when Gillian091 was still young
enough to be living in the same household, but then Gillian had brought her
own child up in the South East.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Pauline089 as AB, and both the older women as DE.  That is
absurd; the occupation &quot;doctor&quot;, SOC code 220, is class I, 
hence AB in
CHRISTINE terms.  This glaring error leaves one suspicious about the
classification of Angela090, but there are no positive grounds for judging
it mistaken so it has been allowed to stand in CHRISTINE. 



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>00574:  It is tempting in context to amend <i>strips</i> to <i>stripes</i>, but
the speaker may have used the wrong word

<p>00588:  <i>he want's</i> emended to <i>he wants</i>

<p>00592:  <i>would of</i> emended to <i>would've</i>

<p>00614:  <i>were getting</i> emended to <i>we're getting</i>:  
these sound different, so the
emendation implies a definite error on the transcriber's part;
but it makes far better sense in context, and apostrophes are
very commonly misused (by commission or omission) by clerical
workers with an imperfect command of orthographic standards, such
as many of the BNC transcribers.

<p>00623, 00624:  <i>go onto Mark's</i> emended to <i>go on to Marks</i> 
(referring to the
chain store Marks and Spencer)

<p>00624:  <i>come to Mark's</i> emended to <i>come to Marks</i> 
(see preceding note)

<p>00648, 00650, 00651:  <i>battle cross</i> emended to <i>Butter Cross</i>.
The phrase <i>battle cross</i> as it stands is incomprehensible; but
Chichester contains an ancient edifice called the Market Cross, close
to the Buttermarket -- I conjecture that the speaker confused these
two names.

<p>00661:  <i>on musical composer's</i> emended to <i>on musical composers</i>

<p>00684:  <i>little plan ones</i> emended to <i>little plain ones</i> 
(bold but seems justified
in the context)

<p>00698:  <i>a big bigger</i> emended to <i>a bit bigger</i> 
(an easy confusion to make in
transcribing; compare the following s-unit 00699)

<p>00729:  <i>any way</i> emended to <i>anyway</i>

<p>00736:  <i>bye bye</i> emended to <i>bye-bye</i>

<p>00746:  <i>There</i> emended to <i>They're</i> (homonyms, 
for one pronunciation of <i>there</i>, and
needed for the sense)

<p>00755:  <i>every where</i> emended to <i>everywhere</i>

<p>00759:  <i>Were out</i> emended to <i>We're out</i> (obvious 
emendation in context)

<p>00759:  <i>there twelve</i> emended to <i>they're twelve</i> (cf. 00746)

<p>00773:  <i>the peeler's</i> emended to <i>the peelers</i>

<p>00774:  The form <i>grater/peeler</i> (sort of kitchen implement) was treated 
as a single word in BNC and CHRISTINE has followed this.

<p>00792:  <i>in it</i> emended to <i>innit</i> (taken in context 
to be the colloquial reduction
of <i>isn't it</i>)

<p>00803:  <i>Any one know where Richards gone</i> emended to <i>Anyone 
know where Richard's gone</i>

<p>00808:  <i>photo's</i> emended to <i>photos</i> (twice), <i>should of</i> 
emended to <i>should've</i> (twice)

<p>00812:  <i>should of</i> emended to <i>should've</i> (twice), 
<i>few hours service</i> 
emended to <i>few hours' service</i>

<p>00813:  <i>be</i> emended to <i>he</i> (some emendation seems 
quite necessary to make sense;
this is the smallest plausible change that was found)

<p>00813:  <i>it's slipping</i> emended to <i>its slipping</i>

<p>00820:  <i>there summer holidays</i> emended to <i>their summer holidays</i>

<p>00825:  <i>any thing</i> emended to <i>anything</i>

<p>00825:  <i>to talk a lot to</i> emended to <i>to talk a lot too</i> 
-- represents a small
phonetic difference which makes much better sense, and this
level of spelling mistake seems normal for this transcriber.
