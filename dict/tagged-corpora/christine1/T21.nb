<h1>Text T21</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KDE

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>3 to 6 June 1991

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Bickley, Kent

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>home, conversation

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jennifer082, f, 33, housewife, SE, C2
<li>Benjamin083, m, 3, n/a, SE, C2
<li>Tom084, m, 34, mechanical engineer 
(spelled <i>mechcanical</i> in BNC file), SE, C2


</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Benjamin083 is son of Jennifer082.  BNC says nothing about how Tom084 is
related.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Jennifer's dialect as &quot;Home Counties&quot; 
and the two male
speakers' as &quot;London&quot;, in CHRISTINE terms both SE.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Jennifer082 C2, Benjamin083 as DE, and leaves Tom084
unclassified.  Tom is SOC code 516, IIIM, so he and his wife and child
should all be C2.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>In the first two divisions of this text, there is abundant evidence that
the speaker codes attributing various turns to the respective speakers
have been confused; for instance, if the BNC attributions are
taken as correct, then individuals would more than once be using their
own names to address other individuals, and the three-year-old would ask his
father whether the latter would like to have a shower with daddy.

<p>The relationships revealed by the utterance contents become perfectly
normal if the following code substitutions are made, and this has been
done in the CHRISTINE file:
<blockquote>
division 007016, PS0M5 (Benjamin083) becomes PS13T (Tom084)<br>
division 007017, PS0M5 (Benjamin083) becomes PS0M4 (Jennifer082)
and PS13T (Tom084) becomes PS0M5 (Benjamin083)
</blockquote>
<p>In the following division, 007101, most of the attributions make sense as
they stand; however, the conversational exchange reads much more naturally
if the single turn comprising s-units 01567-8 is reallocated to Tom084.
(This might have seemed over-bold in a text containing no other speaker
coding problems, but in view of the major problems in the preceding 
divisions, this change has been made in CHRISTINE.)

<p>The speaker codes in the remaining divisions are plausible, and are 
confirmed in many places e.g. by use of names in addressing hearers.


<p>01465:  the word <i>know</i> is followed in the BNC transcription
by both exclamation mark and full stop, in that order,
treated in BNC as separate &quot;words&quot;.  Since punctuation
marks are peripheral to CHRISTINE purposes, no emendation has been made.

<p>01485:  <i>saying it.?</i> emended to <i>saying it?</i>  
(BNC had <i>saying.</i> as one &quot;word&quot; and
the question mark as the next -- this led to differential
treatment of this and the previous case in CHRISTINE, though it
might have been better to treat both alike.)

<p>01534:  <i>always use to put</i> emended to <i>always used to put</i>

<p>01546:  <i>its getting</i> emended to <i>it's getting</i>

<p>01558:  <i>such and such</i> emended to <i>such-and-such</i>

<p>01570:  <i>to hand the clothes</i> emended to <i>to hang the clothes</i> 
(a hypothetical [d]
would be so hard to detect before the interdental fricative that
this reading, which makes better sense, seems far more plausible)

<p>01656:  Space inserted after stop in <i>five.The</i> (by the BNC's own standards,
this sequence should have two s-unit numbers)

<p>01666:  <i>baby grows</i> emended to <i>Babygros</i> 
(</i>Babygro</i> is the trade name of a 
garment for babies)

<p>01670:  Note that the hyphen following 
<i>I think with twins</i> had a space
on either side in the source, and thus represented a dash.
This is the only case in CHRISTINE where the source text
contains a punctuation mark not written immediately adjacent
to the preceding word.  (Such cases can only occur in the
sections of CHRISTINE derived from the British National Corpus,
because this is the only one of our sources which uses 
orthographic punctuation marks in its transcriptions.)

<p>01706:  <i>the dining room and sitting room</i> emended to 
<i>the dining-room and
sitting-room</i>

<p>01714, 01722, 01723, 01725 (twice):  <i>aught</i> emended to <i>ought</i>

<p>01725:  <i>Get</i> emended to <i>get</i> (BNC had it at 
the start of an s-unit, but CHRISTINE
analyses it as internal to a sentence)

<p>01726:  <i>sitting room</i> emended to <i>sitting-room</i>

<p>01726:  <i>Yeah</i> (first of a sequence) emended to <i>yeah</i>:  
the BNC punctuation gives
no reason to capitalize this as sentence-initial

<p>01733:  <i>blamed.'Cause</i> emended to <i>blamed +. Cos</i>  
(BNC omits space after the
full stop and hence the stop was treated in BNC as part of the
word it followed; the single-syllable abbreviation of <i>because</i>
is commonly written <i>cos</i> in our materials.  By the BNC's own
standards, s-unit 01733 should be two s-units; cf. 01656 above.)

<p>01748:  Space inserted after stop in <i>then.Come</i> 
(a case exactly analogous
to 01656)

<p>01748:  BNC has two dots after <i>bed</i>.  
This could conceivably be a variant
of the three-dot &quot;sentence tailing away&quot; punctuation mark,
but punctuation of that level of subtlety would not normally be
found in the spoken BNC, and it is assumed here to be an error
for a single full stop.

<p>01774:  BNC has <i>Daddy' crying</i>.  This could be a mistype of 
<i>Daddy's crying</i>,
echoing the speaker's preceding words; but it seems more likely
to be a nonstandard spelling, influenced by the preceding words,
of the phrase <i>Daddy crying</i>, hence the apostrophe has been deleted.

<p>01776:  <i>cringing</i> emended to <i>crying</i> (a bold emendation; 
but the whole passage is
about Daddy crying, and it seems far more likely that a handwritten
transcription has been misread than that the 3-year-old speaker
really used the word <i>cringing</i>)
