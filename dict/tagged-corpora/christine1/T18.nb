<h1>Text T18</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KD3

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>12 to 20 March 1992

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Rushden, Northants.

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>home, feeding baby/watching TV/preparing meal/relaxing

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Karen073, f, 30, housewife, SE, C2
<li>David074, m, 8, schoolboy (presumably - not stated in BNC), XX, C2
<li>Raymond075, m, 29, self-employed panel beater, XX, C2

</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Raymond075 and Karen073 are man and wife.
David 074 is their son.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>BNC gives Karen073 the dialect code applicable to Rushden (though note that
this town is close to Trudgill's chief &quot;North/South&quot; 
English isogloss).  No
dialect information is included for the other two speakers, so CHRISTINE
treats them as unclassified.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Karen073 as C2 and the male speakers as DE.  However,
Raymond is SOC code 542, IIIM, hence he and also their son should receive
the classification C2.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>01228:  In <i>don't it</i>, a main verb is lacking in the BNC text.  
It is tempting
to conjecture that this is a transcriber error, but there is no
basis for supplying any particular verb.

<p>01230-1:  BNC attributes this speaker turn to David074; that would
imply that the 8-year-old child is addressing himself by name and
describing himself in the third person.  The most plausible emendation
seems to be that the turn was produced by Raymond075, and this is
adopted in CHRISTINE.

<p>01290:  <i>Gotta</i> emended to <i>Got a</i> (the spelling <i>gotta</i> 
normally represents <i>got to</i>)

<p>01322:  <i>before his crawling</i> emended to <i>before he's crawling</i> 
(very little difference
in pronunciation and makes far better sense)

<p>01338:  <i>there at</i> emended to <i>they're at</i> 
(sound the same, with one pronunciation
of <i>there</i>, and the latter fits the context)

<p>01344:  <i>wanna</i> emended to <i>want a</i> (the spelling 
<i>wanna</i> normally
represents <i>want to</i> -- cf. <i>gotta</i> above).  The transcription
<i>wanna</i> clearly represents a distinctive pronunciation, but
(unlike <i>wanna</i> for <i>want to</i>, where the reduction has
grammatical implications) not a pronunciation with structural
significance, so CHRISTINE uses standard orthography.
