<p>28 Nov to ? Dec 1991

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Bristol (speakers' home is Cadbury Heath, 4 m. East of the city
centre)

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>conversation

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Peggy015, f, 57, housewife, SW, DE
<li>Lena016, f, 76, housewife, SW, DE
<li>Madge017, f, 64, housewife, SW, DE
<li>Heather018, f, 33, housewife, SW, XX
<li>Jackie019, f, 25, production worker, SW, DE
<li>Polly020, f, 23, production assistant, SW, DE
<li>Peter021, m, 55, disabled unemployed, SW, DE
<li>Norah022, f, 76, housewife, SW, XX

</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Peter021 and Peggy015 are man and wife, and parents of Polly020.
The other speakers are friends of Peggy015.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>All speakers are given the BNC dialect code applicable to Bristol.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Peggy015, Lena016, and Madge017 as DE, and leaves others
unclassified.  Jackie019's occupation is SOC code 859, IV, so she and
Polly020 are DE.  CHRISTINE assigns DE to Peter021 as husband of Peggy015;
since she is the able-bodied member of this couple it seems reasonable
to take her social code as decisive.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>There is a recurring oddity in the grammar of Jackie019, who produces
each of the following three utterances:
<blockquote>
02352: <i>and there are what at Woolies they're 
about three fifty-six</i><br>
02368: <i>but if they're got a lot they will</i><br>
02450: <i>there's got to be about eight foot wide</i>
</blockquote>
Each of these sequences would seem much more normal (not standard, but
&quot;ordinary&quot; nonstandard) if the word <i>there</i>  
in the first and third example,
and <i>they're</i>  in the second example, were replaced by <i>they</i>.  (In the
first example, the speaker had already mentioned a product and was commenting
on its price at Woolworths -- she was not asking &quot;what is there ...?&quot;)
<p>It is tempting to assume that the BNC transcriber has misheard
a regional pronunciation, and to make this substitution in CHRISTINE.
If Jackie019 were a Northern speaker, this would seem very plausible:  a
Northern <i>they</i>  with pure vowel rather than diphthong could easily be mistaken
by a Southern transcriber as <i>there, they're</i>  (which in some Southern
varieties have pure vowels, and of course no postvocalic [r]).  However,
Jackie019 (and her interlocutors) are all coded as Central Southwest dialect,
and the conversation was recorded in Bristol.  I am reasonably familiar
with Bristol speech (I attended school there for ten years), and do
not find the mistranscription plausible:  <i>they</i>  would be expected to have
a fairly marked diphthong in Southwestern speech.
<p>Accordingly, the BNC transcriptions have been retained in these
cases, and the tagmatagging reflects the strange grammar as best it can.



<p>02346:  <i>some at</i>  emended to <i>summat</i>  (nonstandard equivalent of <i>something</i>, recognized
as such by the transcriber in the following turn but not in this one)

<p>02412, 02413:  Successive speaker turns begin <i>as with ... </i>:  it is difficult
to believe that this is really what was said, but it is not
easy to find a plausible emendation.  These speakers come from
the Bristol area, where <i>that's</i>  often sounds rather
like <i>ass</i>  so that <i>that's with</i>  might have been transcribed
<i>as with</i>  by a mystified transcriber; but even <i>that's with</i> 
would not make specially good sense in the context.

<p>02412:  The BNC transcription has <i>Double Decker</i>.  As a common noun this
word is hyphenated, <i>double-decker</i>; but the transcriber seems
to have taken it as a confectionery brand name like <i>Crunchie</i>,
though I have not been able to confirm this.  It seems quite
likely that, if the phrase is a confectionery name, it would
not be hyphenated in that use, so no hyphen is inserted in
CHRISTINE.

<p>02442:  <i>mass produced</i>  emended to <i>mass-produced</i> 

<p>02443:	<i>work out</i>  emended to <i>workout</i> 

<p>02499, 02500:  <i>kill joy</i>  emended to <i>killjoy</i> 

<p>02512:  The transcriber had <i>can we plays that tape so that everybody's can
hear</i>.  The words <i>can ... plays</i>  are
 taken to be a nonstandard V sequence;
<i>everybody's</i>  is taken to be a nonstandard pronoun with plural
ending, and is spelled <i>everybodies</i>  in CHRISTINE.  In view of
the contradiction between <i>every-</i>  and <i>-ies</i>, it is counted as
unmarked for number.

<p>02543:  <i>ear phones</i>  emended to <i>earphones</i> 

<p>02560:  <i>realise</i>  emended to <i>realize</i> 

<p>02621:  <i>stone deaf</i>  emended to <i>stone-deaf</i> 

<p>02637:  This s-unit and s-unit 02639 are manifestly part of a single utterance,
but were attributed respectively to PS000
(i.e. an unidentified speaker) and Lena016 in BNC.
They have jointly been attributed to Lena016 in CHRISTINE.

<p>02671:  <i>Halloween</i> emended to <i>Hallowe'en</i>

<p>02675:  <i>Courages</i>  emended to <i>Courage's</i>  (a brand of beer; 
the firm is called John Courage)
