<h1>Text T28</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KE2

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>20 to 27 Feb 1992

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Newton Abbot, Devon

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>

<li>div 039701  at home, eating lunch and doing crossword
</ul>
<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Howard112, m, 70, retired, SE, C2
<li>Josephine113, f, 70, retired, IR, C2
</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The speakers are man and wife.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>According to the BNC file header, Howard's dialect is East Anglian, and
Josephine's is Irish.  (It is an oddity of the CHRISTINE text selection
that although two extracts were recorded in Newton Abbot, not a
particularly cosmopolitan Devon town, all the speakers in both those
extracts evidently stemmed from far-distant parts of the British Isles.)


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Howard112 as C2 and Josephine113 as DE, but since the latter
is the former's wife CHRISTINE adjusts her class to match his.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>08563:  <i>Tin Valley</i>, <i>Tingrace</i> emended to 
<i>Teign Valley</i>, <i>Teigngrace</i> (Devon
placenames derived from the river Teign, pronounced [tIn])

<p>08565:  The BNC file marks the beginning of the 
<tt>{onTelephone}</tt> vocalization
shift, but not its end.  However, from the wording it is
clear that it ends at the end of s-unit 08572, and CHRISTINE
marks it accordingly.

<p>08597:  <i>bye bye</i> emended to <i>bye-bye</i>

<p>08621, 08624:  The BNC file supplements the vocalization shifts showing that 
Howard is reading aloud with an event entity &quot;newspaper&quot;.
The latter is not an &quot;event&quot; in the normal sense, and it seems
unnecessary for the CHRISTINE annotations to include the information
that the reading is from a newspaper.

<p>08620:  <i>Offgas</i> emended to <i>Ofgas</i> (normal abbreviation 
for the quango supervising
the privatized gas industry)

<p>08639, 08640:  <i>washing machine</i> emended to <i>washing-machine</i>

<p>08649:  <i>sending stuff of</i> emended to <i>sending stuff off</i> 
(the sense requires it,
and the phonetic difference would be minimal preceding the word
<i>for</i>)

<p>08725:  <i>nitty gritty</i> emended to <i>nitty-gritty</i>
