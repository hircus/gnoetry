<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>02879:  <i>Tt.</i> in BNC 
is taken to represent the click sound often 
(and in CHRISTINE regularly) represented as <i>tsk</i>,
and is wordtagged UX.

<p>02939:  <i>we've never to</i>:  it is tempting to guess that the transcriber
has accidentally omitted the word <i>been</i>, but to impose an
emendation of that order on the original material would be 
a step down a slope leading to standardization of all
non-standard usage; CHRISTINE has not done it.

<p>02970:  <i>recognised</i> emended to <i>recognized</i>

<p>03009, 03010:  <i>nerve-wracking</i> emended to <i>nerve-racking</i>

<p>03026ff.:  note that there is no inconsistency in alternative wordtags
for the name <i>Sherry</i>; the same name is being used to refer both
to a woman and to a dog.

<p>03053:  <i>T V</i> emended to <i>TV</i>

<p>03074:  <i>Gees</i> emended to <i>Jeez</i> 
(an exclamation taken to be short for <i>Jesus</i>, and
as an abbreviation commonly written that way)

<p>03077:  <i>Schwarzanegger</i> emended to <i>Schwarzenegger</i>

<p>03081, 03083:  <i>Calkin</i> emended to <i>Culkin</i> 
(surname of child film actor)

<p>03127:  <i>parachute jumping</i> emended to <i>parachute-jumping</i> 
(this seems the more
plausible orthography, and for CHRISTINE purposes is more convenient)
