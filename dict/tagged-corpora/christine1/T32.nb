<h1>Text T32</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KP8

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>30 Jan to 8 Feb 1992

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Mid Calder, Midlothian

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>at home, telephone conversation

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Heather119, f, 33, nurse, SC, AB
<li>Oliver120, m, 5, n/a, SC, AB
<li>Gina121, f, 60, retired, SC, XX

</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Heather119 is daughter-in-law of Gina121.
Oliver120 is son of Heather119.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>BNC assigns the Scottish dialect code to the female speakers.  No code is
given for Oliver120, but since he is the son of a Scottish speaker and
living in Scotland it would be remarkable if his speech were not Scottish.
CHRISTINE assigns the SC code in all cases.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Heather119 and Oliver120 as DE and leaves Gina121
unclassified.  But Heather119 is SOC code 340, II, hence AB, and therefore
Oliver120 should also be given this classification.  (In confirmation,
Heather's husband, not represented in the CHRISTINE extract, is also AB by
occupation.)



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>02337:  <i>T V</i> emended to <i>TV</i>

<p>02340:  <i>Alistaire</i> emended to <i>Alistair</i> 
(a more usual Anglicization of this
Gaelic Christian name)

<p>02374:  <i>Russell &lt;name&gt;'s new wife</i>:  
the anonymization process seems to have
introduced a space between the 
<tt>&lt;name&gt;</tt> entity and the following
apostrophe, CHRISTINE represents the latter as <i>+'s</i> since it
would obviously be written continuously with the actual name
preceding it.

<p>02435:  <i>half term</i> emended to <i>half-term</i>

<p>02467:  <i>lunchtime</i> emended to <i>lunch-time</i>

<p>02470:  <i>short- staffed</i> emended to <i>short-staffed</i>

<p>02515:  <i>blown-out</i> emended to <i>blown out</i>

<p>02520, 02530:  <i>doctors</i> emended to <i>doctor's</i>

<p>02548:  <i>it was also {unclear}</i> may well in reality have been
<i>it was all so ... </i>; without knowing what the unclear wording
was, an emendation is not justified.
