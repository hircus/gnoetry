<h1>Text T14</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KCN

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>12 to 20 Mar 1992

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Johnston, Pembrokeshire

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>home, conversation (the entry for div 027304 is
&quot;sitting together/conversation&quot;) 
-- according to BNC file header; from 
the dialogue, one might guess that part of the conversation was recorded in 
a car driving through a shopping area.

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Margaret060, f, 54, housewife, WA, C1
<li>Trudy061, f, 84, old age pensioner, WA, DE
<li>Eddie062, m, 57, disabled, WA, C1
<li>Miles063, m, 25, assistant manager, WA, AB

</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Eddie062 and Margaret060 are man and wife.
Miles063 is their son.
Trudy061 is mother of Margaret060.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>All speakers are given the Welsh BNC dialect code.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Margaret060 as C1, Trudy061 and Eddie062 as DE, and leaves
Miles063 unclassified.  There is no obvious reason for the two members of
the married couple to be differently classified, and since Margaret060 is
the able-bodied member of the couple it seems reasonable to apply her
coding also to Eddie062.  (This last point is debatable, but it is of
little practical significance since Eddie062 contributes only a handful of
words.)  Miles063 is SOC code 179, II, hence AB.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>04848:  <i>you win the caravan</i> emended to <i>you in the caravan</i> 
-- after the [u] sound
of <i>you</i>, presence v. absence of an initial [w] would make 
little audible difference, and it seems likely that the conversation
is about one of the speakers being away in her caravan at a
relevant time.

<p>04877:  <i>to the &lt;name&gt; in Milford</i>:  
the BNC text contains a word following
<i>the</i> which looks like a surname.  I conjecture that this is
the name of a hairdressing salon, though the current telephone
directory for S.W. Wales does not list one by this or a similar
name, and in CHRISTINE it has been anonymized.

<p>04877:  <i>tra la</i> emended to <i>tra-la</i>

<p>04944:  <i>Its</i> emended to <i>It's</i>

<p>04946:  <i>D H S S</i> emended to <i>DHSS</i> 
(Department of Health and Social Security)

<p>04958:  <i>long red books</i> seems senseless; 
should it read <i>bungalows</i>?  The
emendation is too adventurous to adopt.

<p>04966:  <i>a Land rover</i> emended to <i>a Land Rover</i>

<p>04973:  <i>doctors</i> emended to <i>doctor's</i>

<p>05036:  <i>an'all</i> emended to <i>an' all</i>

<p>05055:  <i>scotty</i> emended to <i>Scottie</i>
