<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KBN

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>12 to 15 March 1992

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Johnston, Pembrokeshire

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>home, chatting to friend/conversation/listening to music

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Eve027, f, 15, student, WA, C2
<li>Rebecca028, f, 16, student, WA, DE

</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Two friends.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>Both speakers given Welsh dialect code in BNC.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Eve027 as C2, Rebecca028 as DE.  BNC shows Eve027 as
daughter of a carpenter, SOC code 570, IIIM, confirming her classification;
we have no grounds for querying the coding of Rebecca028.


<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>


<p>00361:  <i>cos er my</i> emended to <i>cos of my</i>:  
even if the speaker included a [v] in
<i>of</i>, as a voiced fricative this is intrinsically non-salient
and is almost homorganic with the following [m], so this
emendation which is grammatically more plausible seems fairly safe.

<p>00373:  <i>spanish</i> emended to <i>Spanish</i>

<p>00402-3:  The source-units 00402 and 00403 have been exchanged between
Eve027 and Rebecca028 (relative to the assignments in BNC), as the minimal
change needed to make sense of the conversational exchange.

<p>00434:  <i>ta ra</i> emended to <i>ta-ra</i>

<p>00450:  Here and below, the speaker is singing snatches from the Slade
lyric <i>Radio wall of sound</i>, which the transcriber has 
evidently not recognized.  At this point, the original lyric
runs <i>I'm in trouble, I'm in deep, I don't know why I can't sleep</i>.
CHRISTINE has replaced <i>know ooh er I can't see</i> with <i>know why
I can't sleep</i>.  The opening transcribed words <i>say me in trouble</i>
are mystifying and have been left to stand.  It is possible
that the speaker had forgotten the words (though the ones
in BNC are so grammatically odd that this seems implausible;
it was not easy to decide how to parse them).  Another possibility
was that the speaker began by announcing the singer's name:
<i>Slade, I'm in trouble ... </i>, and that <i>Slade I'm</i> was misunderstood
as <i>say me</i> -- but this emendation would be too adventurous
to adopt.

<p>00452:  <i>what a sound</i> emended to <i>wall of sound</i>, as in the lyric

<p>00455:  <i>radio what a sound mm mm mm of power</i>:  
<i>what</i> emended to <i>wall</i>, as
in the lyric.  The <i>mm mm mm</i> should be <i>24 hours</i>, but it seems
likely that the singer was humming notes where she had forgotten
the words.

<p>00482:  <i>hi</i> emended to <i>high</i> 
(in view of what follows, this is likely to be the
appropriate spelling of the syllable)

<p>00483:  <i>radio all</i> emended to <i>radio wall [of sound]</i> -- 
a [w] would be virtually
indistinguishable after the final diphthong of <i>radio</i>.

<p>00488:  <i>radio what a sound</i> emended to <i>radio wall of sound</i>

<p>00501, 00506, 00509:  Here the speaker is singing the Queen lyric 
<i>Bohemian
Rhapsody</i>;  the BNC transcription <i>ma ma just killed man</i> is
changed in CHRISTINE in three places to the original
<i>Mama, just killed a man</i>.
<p>00536:  <i>he man</i> emended to <i>he-man</i> 

<p>00542:  <i>Jean Claude Van Don</i> emended to <i>Jean-Claude Van Damme</i> 
(martial arts exponent)

<p>00548:  <i>honky tonk</i> emended to <i>honky-tonk</i>

<p>00586:  <i>this is suppose to be</i> emended to <i>this is supposed to be</i>
(no pronunciation difference before the [t] of <i>to</i>)  

<p>00609, 00610: <i>gis</i> emended to <i>gi +'s</i>  (i.e. <i>give us</i>)

<p>00626:  <i>must of been</i> emended to <i>must've been</i>

<p>00629:  <i>er up</i> emended to <i>eh up</i>.  This is a bold emendation; 
the speakers are Welsh,
whereas <i>eh up</i> as an introductory discourse item is associated with
Yorkshire.  But the BNC transcription is extremely difficult
to make sense of.

<p>00631:  <i>black board</i> emended to <i>blackboard</i>

<p>00637:  <i>the incredible hulk</i> emended to <i>the Incredible Hulk</i> 
(cartoon character)

<p>00646:  <i>heaven</i> emended to <i>Heaven</i>

<p>00681:  <i>terminator</i> emended to <i>Terminator</i>
