<h1>Text T30</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KP0

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>unknown, not later than Nov 1994 (recorded as &quot;1992&quot; 
in the Speakers
file as a best guess)

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Greater London

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>conversation

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dan116, m, XX, student, XX, XX
</ul>

<h2>Dialect and Social Classification</h2>
<p>No age or dialect information is specified in the BNC file header, and nor
is any social classification given.  The speakers' utterances at and
about s-unit 00648 include self-descriptions as &quot;upper-class
 teenagers&quot;
(in connexion with the corpus compilation exercise), but it might be
rash to attribute a social class code to Dan116 on that basis.  From
s-unit 00777 it appears that one speaker, at least, is aged 15.

<p>00842-3:  There is a confusing situation in the BNC file with respect to
vocalization shifts (the elements wordtagged YVL, YVR in
CHRISTINE).  In BNC, the nature of the shift is regularly shown
only with an opening shift element, not with the closing element.
BNC opens a &quot;reading&quot; (i.e. reading aloud) shift before the
words <i>I think you should</i>, a &quot;laughing&quot; shift at the beginning
of s-unit 00843, and a shift described as &quot;reading+laughing&quot;
before the final <tt>{unclear}</tt> element; corresponding to these
three opening shifts it has only two unlabelled closing shifts,
immediately after the two <tt>{unclear}</tt> elements at beginning and
end of 00843 respectively.  Since the body of s-unit 00843 is
manifestly part of what is being read aloud, CHRISTINE
makes the <tt>{readingAloud}</tt> shift apply to the whole of the two
s-units, and the <tt>{laughing}</tt> shifts apply just to the two
<tt>{unclear}</tt> elements.

<p>00842:  <i>one off page</i> emended to <i>one-off page</i>
