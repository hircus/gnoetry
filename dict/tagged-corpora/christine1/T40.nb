<h1>Text T40</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KSU

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>unknown, not later than Nov 1994 
(recorded as &quot;1992&quot; 
in the Speakers
file as a best guess)

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>unknown, possibly South Essex (cf. s-unit 00168)

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>conversation

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Peter146, m, 13, pupil, XX, AB
<li>Linda147, f, 45, credit controller, XX, AB
<li>Sadie148, f, 45, unemployed, XX, DE
<li>Nick149, m, 21, unemployed, XX, XX
</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Peter146 and Nick149 are brothers.
Peter146 is son of Linda147; it follows that Nick149 
must also be her son,
though BNC does not say so.
Sadie148 is Nick149's aunt.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>No information about dialect is given in BNC 
for any of these speakers.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Peter146 as AB, Linda147 and Sadie148 as DE, 
and does not
classify Nick149.  But Linda147 is SOC code 130, II, hence AB.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>00099:  <i>thingie</i> emended to <i>thingy</i>

<p>00190:  Normally, numbers uttered by the speakers 
are represented written
out in words.  In this case, the BNC transcriptions contain
&quot;85 135&quot; written digitally, both 
numbers marked &quot;sic&quot;.  It is not at
all clear what the speaker is referring to (and the way
that &quot;135&quot; was said depends on what it referred 
to -- it might have been <i>one three five</i>, <i>a hundred and
thirty-five</i>, etc.).  Rather than leave the words in digital
form, which would be likely to create problems for corpus
users, I have conjectured that the speaker was giving a rough
idea of the cost of her mascara, i.e. &quot;85p or &pound;1.35&quot;,
and have accordingly represented the words as 
<i>eighty-five</i>, <i>one thirty-five</i>.

<p>00193:  <i>E F five</i> emended to <i>EFi</i>:  
taken to be a reference to the Ford
Orion 1.6EFi, introduced to the Ford car range
in March 1991.  <i>EFi</i> probably stands for 
&quot;electronic fuel injection&quot;, though I have not managed to
confirm this.

<p>00204:  BNC gives no information about 
the location of this recording, but
from the references in 00168 it would appear to be taking
place in South Essex.  In that case, the name <i>Wickham</i> is
mystifying:  there is no place with that name in the area.
There is a Wickford north of Basildon, but this would be
a surprising transcription error.  The BNC form has been left
to stand in CHRISTINE.

<p>00287:  <i>He int</i> emended to <i>He in't</i>

<p>00346:  <i>fire engines</i> emended to <i>fire-engines</i>

<p>00366:  <i>World title</i> emended to <i>world title</i>

<p>00368:  BNC reads <i>to win that will back</i>; 
in context, the word <i>will</i> is
inexplicable and has been tagged FD (distorted word) in CHRISTINE.
(A possibility is a truncated form of <i>world title</i>, but this would
be so conjectural that there is no basis for changing the text.
Another, perhaps less plausible possibility is <i>we'll back</i>, as
a relative clause.)

<p>00426:  <i>R S turbo</i> emended to <i>RS Turbo</i> 
(a model within the Ford Escort and Fiesta ranges)
