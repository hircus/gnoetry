<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>00774: <i>the widows might</i> emended to <i>the widow's mite</i> 
(transcriber's misunderstanding)

<p>00778:  <i>in er big town</i> emended to <i>in a big town</i> 
(since there would normally be
no difference in pronunciation, and the latter makes good sense)

<p>00778:  <i>the cross is er all the criminals</i>:  
it is tempting in the context
to emend this to <i>the crosses on the criminals</i> or <i>the cross is
on the criminals</i>, but neither change seems fully cogent so the
BNC wording has been let to stand

<p>00804:  <i>in Dartfield</i> emended to <i>Ian Dartfield</i> 
(to make sense in context; NB that
</i>Dartfield</i> has not been found as a place-name in gazetteers consulted)

<p>00812:  <i>self started</i> emended to <i>self-started</i>

<p>00875:  This turn would make much more sense if one took the first word,
<i>of</i>, to be a transcriber mishearing of <i>have</i>.  But this
emendation seemed too bold to adopt.

<p>00879:  BNC has <i>it's all dated in isn't it</i>; 
this makes little sense, and
in context it seems likely that the speaker has turned <i>data</i> into
a verb and used its past participle -- the difference in pronunciation
would be small for any speaker and nonexistent for some dialects.

<p>00919ff.  contain several Biblical quotations marked (by 
vocal shift entities) as read aloud.
The transcriptions of the wording are often clearly
mistaken (and these passages can be used to demonstrate the
quality of the transcriptions more generally); they have been
corrected here by reference to the original texts.  Unfortunately,
whichever translation the speaker was reading from was not 
identical either to the King James or the Revised Standard Version.

<p>00919:  <i>where as</i> emended to <i>whereas</i>

<p>00919:  <i>the luck we thing the lashing of the teeth</i> 
emended to <i>the like weeping
the gnashing of the teeth</i> (here the speaker appears to be
paraphrasing Matthew 8:12 rather than directly reading, 
and the transcriber's <i>luck</i> is conjectured to be <i>like</i>
in its colloquial &quot;hedging&quot; use)

<p>00933:  <i>decline</i> emended to <i>recline</i> (Matthew 8:11)

<p>00938:  <i>must of done</i> emended to <i>must've done</i>

<p>00960:  <i>and we've taught</i> emended to <i>and you've taught</i> 
(assuming that a
transcription error is more likely than that the speaker misread
Luke 13:26)
