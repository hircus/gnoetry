<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>

<li>Zoe055, f, 16, student, SW, DE
<li>Suzanne056, f, 13, student, SW, XX
<li>Dean057, m, 19, student, SW, XX
</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Four friends.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>Redditch is only about 15 m. South of Birmingham; it is close to Trudgill's
main &quot;North/South&quot; English isogloss, and one might expect people living
there to group linguistically with Birmingham rather than with the &quot;Upper
Southwest&quot; area which the BNC dialect codes assign to all the speakers but
Eleanor054.  However, CHRISTINE follows these codes in classifying those
three speakers as SW.  Eleanor054 is given the BNC code for &quot;Northeast
Midlands&quot;; this is distant from Redditch, so she presumably is not local
there and is unproblematically given the CHRISTINE MD code.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Eleanor054 as C2, Zoe055 as DE, and leaves the other two
unclassified.  However, Eleanor054's mother is shown as a driving 
instructor, SOC code 393, IIIN, so her classification has been changed
to C1.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>03864:  <i>over excited</i> emended to <i>over-excited</i>

<p>03883, 03933:  <i>Zo</i> is intended to represent a monosyllabic
reduced version of the addressee's <i>nom de corpus</i> Zoe; the BNC original
has a correspondingly reduced version of the addressee's real name.

<p>03898:  <i>living room</i> emended to <i>living-room</i>

<p>03921:  <i>polo</i> emended to <i>Polo</i> 
(the speaker is more likely to be contemplating
rectal insertion of a mint with a hole than a sport with horses)

<p>03927:  <i>El-bel</i> is intended to represent a pet name based on
the <i>nom de corpus</i> Eleanor.  In the original BNC passage, the
corresponding pet name derived from the addressee's real name has been
shown as two separate words, probably because the transcriber did not
understand what the speaker meant.

<p>03929:  In the BNC file, this s-unit contains two opening vocal shifts
(for singing and shouting), but only one closing shift, at the
end of the s-unit, which like other BNC closing vocal shift
elements does not contain a specific descriptive attribute.
It might be that the BNC conventions treat a single closing
vocal shift as terminating all open shifts (the Manual is
not clear on the subject, and I have not found other examples
from which practice could be inferred); it seems to me that
an utterance cannot be both sung and shouted simultaneously,
so CHRISTINE assumes that a closing shift has been accidentally
omitted before the second opening shift, and restores it. 

<p>03982:  <i>sitting room</i> emended to <i>sitting-room</i>

<p>04018:  <i>just got to close down</i>:  
the lyric actually runs <i>they forgot
to close down</i>, but it is as likely that the speaker got
the words wrong as that the transcriber misheard.

<p>04070:  <i>chewing gum</i> emended to <i>chewing-gum</i>

<p>04088:  <i>a go slow</i> emended to <i>a go-slow</i>

<p>04018:  <i>armageddon</i> emended to <i>Armageddon</i> (three times)

<p>04108, 04111:  <i>the channel tunnel</i> emended to 
<i>the Channel Tunnel</i>
