<h1>Text T02</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KB6

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>2 to 6 Dec 1991

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Bristol

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>home, conversation

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Barbara004, f, 29, housewife, SW, DE
<li>Barbara005, f, 32, housewife, SE, XX
<li>Gemma006, f, 28, housewife, SW, XX
<li>Dan007, m, 3, SW, DE

</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>The two Barbaras and Gemma006 are friends.  
Dan007 is son of Barbara004.

<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>Barbara004 and Gemma006 are given the BNC dialect code applicable to
Bristol.  Barbara005 is coded as London dialect, therefore SE.  Dan007 is
given no dialect code in BNC, but is coded SW here to agree with his home
area and mother's dialect.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Barbara004 as DE and leaves others unclassified.  
CHRISTINE assigns DE to Dan007 as Barbara004's son.  
Barbara004's husband, and
Dan007's father, is listed as an &quot;engineer&quot;, 
but this term is too vague
to imply a specific SOC code -- it is compatible with code DE.


<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>00348-9:  The original BNC file treats the unnumbered s-unit by Dan007
between these two s-units as consisting of an open-shift
&quot;crying&quot; element with no corresponding closing shift (i.e.,
an item which in CHRISTINE terms would be tagged YVL with
no YVR).  This makes no sense, and is replaced in CHRISTINE
with a YV element.

<p>00446:  the original had 
<i>Steve's mum had fifty pounds worth off of Steve' aunty</i>.  
The apostrophe has been deleted from the second <i>Steve'</i>, on the
assumption that it was the transcriber's attempt to indicate a
name which in standard English should have been marked as genitive
but in fact was not.  On the other hand, <i>pounds</i> has been
changed to <i>pounds'</i> because this form would be genitive in
standard English orthography
(and there is no phonetic distinction in speech).  
Also, <i>aunty</i> emended to <i>auntie</i>  
(<i>COD</i> preferred spelling).

<p>00503:  <i>shebumkin</i> emended to <i>shubunkin</i>  (type of 
goldfish, presumably the transcriber did not know the word)

<p>00580:  <i>by</i> emended to <i>buy</i>

<p>00580, 00618:  <i>artex</i>, <i>artexed</i> emended 
to <i>Artex</i>, <i>Artexed</i> (a trade name, checked by WWW)

<p>00583:  <i>polyripple</i> emended to <i>Polyripple</i> 
(a trade name, checked by WWW)

<p>00632, 00641:  <i>half way</i> emended to <i>halfway</i>
