<h2>Date</h2>

<p>Dunscroft, near Doncaster

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mary137, f, 52, housewife, NO, C1
<li>Janice138, f, 50, housewife, NO, DE
<li>Tracey139, f, 23, housewife, NO, DE

</ul>

<p>There is a confusion in BNC about the Christian name of 
the speaker whose BNC identity code is
PS59F (CHRISTINE speaker 141); 
the file header gives him one name, but he seems to be called
by an entirely different name
in the text.  CHRISTINE uses 
the <i>nom de corpus</i> &quot;Fred&quot; 
both on turn-header lines and when
speaker 141 is named within turns.


<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Fred141 and Tracey139 are children of Mary137.
Janice138 and Ella140 are friends of Mary137.


<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>BNC assigns the &quot;Northeast&quot; dialect code to 
Mary137 and Ella140; in
Trudgill's terms this refers to an area well to the 
north of Dunscroft.  It
assigns the &quot;London&quot; 
code to Janice138, Tracey139, and Fred141, which is
implausible.  Steve Crowdy of the BNC team explained to me 
in an e-message
dated 15 June 1997 that there had been a clerical confusion 
between codes
for London and for &quot;Central Northern England&quot;, 
the latter area including
Doncaster, and he identified Tracey139 and Fred141 
as two speakers who
should have received the latter code.  
He did not say the same for
Janice138; but she too has clear Northern speech features.  
It seems safe
to assign all of these speakers the CHRISTINE code NO.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Mary137 as C1, Janice138 and Tracey139 as DE, 
and leaves the
other two speakers unclassified.  Since Fred141 is only just at the age of
majority, and membership of the Armed Services does not yield a SOC class,
arguably Fred should be given the same classification as his mother; but
CHRISTINE has accepted the BNC classifications unchanged.

<p>The meaning of &quot;houseperson&quot; as Ella140's 
occupation is unknown; 
it may be
a &quot;politically correct&quot; equivalent of housewife, 
but if so it is not clear
why this special form is used for just one of the four female speakers.


<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>


<p>01083:  <i>yank</i> emended to <i>Yank</i> 
(slang for &quot;American&quot;)

<p>01089:  <i>half-past six</i> emended to <i>half past six</i>

<p>01117, 01118:  <i>realise</i> emended to <i>realize</i>

<p>01117, 01118:  <i>there voice</i> emended to <i>their voice</i>

<p>01123:  In the BNC, <i>collieries</i> is followed by a full stop 
which was not
split off as a separate &quot;word&quot;.  
In consequence, what would by
the BNC's normal standards be two separate s-units is numbered
as a single continuous s-unit.  (In fact, by the usual BNC approach,
01123 would have been divided into three s-units, with another
full stop after <i>I'll tell you what</i>; the transcriber may have been
confused by failing to realize that <i>since</i> in 
<i>two years since</i> is
being used as equivalent to standard <i>ago</i>.)

<p>01158:  <i>shouldn't around</i> emended to <i>shouldn't go round</i>.  
(The original BNC 
transcription represents an implausible grammatical error or 
omission.  Although a risky emendation, it seems on balance more 
likely that the syllable recorded as the <i>a-</i> of <i>around</i> was 
really a weakly-pronounced <i>go</i>.  The speaker is a 23-year-old
housewife with dialect recorded as Central Northern England, social
class DE.  <i>Go round</i> seems normal for such a speaker, whereas 
<i>go around</i> would have a somewhat American flavour.

<p>01160:  The reference is to Suzy Lamplugh 
(girl estate agent who disappeared
after going to show an unknown client a vacant house); but
the speaker admits uncertainty about the name, and <i>Lamplaugh</i>
is not a likely spelling by a S.E. transcriber of a Yorkshire
pronunciation of <i>Lamplugh</i> (it might represent <i>Lamplow</i>),
so there is no reason to change the BNC transcription.

<p>01177, 01267:  <i>int</i> emended to <i>in't</i>

<p>01188:  <i>Muirlins</i> emended to <i>Moorlands</i> (three times), 
<i>Lindorm</i> emended to <i>Lindholme</i>.
The references are to HM Young Offenders Institution Moorland,
and HM Prison Lindholme, both at Hatfield Woodhouse, near
Doncaster.  The transcriptions are consistent with a
representation by a S.E. transcriber of pronunciations in
a Yorkshire accent.  The fact that the transcription consistently
has an S at the end of <i>Muirlins</i> implies that the speaker
mistakenly took the name to be <i>Moorlands</i> 
rather than <i>Moorland</i>.

<p>01218:  <i>an all</i> emended to <i>an' all</i>

<p>01235:  <i>thirty-odd</i> emended to <i>thirty odd</i> 
(for the sake of SUSANNE annotation)

<p>01238, 01239:  <i>Barbra</i> emended to <i>Barbara</i> 
(Barbara Windsor, not Barbra Streisand!)

<p>01252:  <i>cafe</i> emended to <i>caf&eacute;</i>

<p>01259:  <i>lad whose</i> emended to <i>lad who's</i> 
(for <i>who has</i>)

<p>01283:  <i>a blow-up doll</i>:  strictly, as a verb 
<i>blow up</i> would not be
hyphenated, but treating it as two separate words would make
it difficult to annotate in the SUSANNE scheme so the BNC
hyphen has been allowed to stand.

<p>01295, 01297:  <i>half way</i> emended to <i>halfway</i>
