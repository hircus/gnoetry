<h1>Text T29</h1>

<h2>Source</h2>
<p>BNC file KE6

<h2>Date</h2>
<p>21 to 28 Feb 1992

<h2>Place</h2>
<p>Andover, Hants.

<h2>Locale/activities</h2>
<p>home, talking/conversation

<h2>Identified Speakers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mary114, f, 54, machine minder, SW, C2
<li>Steph115, f, 25, production engineer, SW, AB

</ul>

<h2>Relationships</h2>
<p>Steph115 is daughter of Mary114.

<h2>Dialect Classification</h2>
<p>BNC assigns both speakers the dialect code applicable to Andover, 
hence SW
in CHRISTINE terms.  Note, though, that Andover is close to Trudgill's
isogloss dividing the CHRISTINE SW and SE areas, and that this linguistic
boundary is probably even less fixed and well-defined than most.


<h2>Social Classification</h2>
<p>BNC classifies Mary114 as C2 and Steph115 as DE.  However, the term
&quot;production engineer&quot; while possibly ambiguous 
looks like SOC code 217, I,
hence AB.  &quot;Machine minder&quot; is certainly ambiguous; C2 is one of the
classes with which the description is compatible.



<h2>Emendations and Comments</h2>

<p>09422:  <i>wouldn't of</i> emended to <i>wouldn't've</i>

<p>09426:  <i>lighter for you, fuel</i> emended to 
<i>lighter fu-, fuel</i> (the phrase <i>for you</i>
would be mysterious in context, but is very plausibly reinterpreted
as a first broken-off attempt to say <i>fuel</i>)

<p>09432:  <i>this this morning</i> emended to <i>This This Morning</i>.
(<i>This Morning</i> is believed to be the name
of a television programme -- the double <i>This</i> is a speech repair)

<p>09439:  <i>would of</i> emended to <i>would've</i>

<p>09446:  <i>But the say</i> emended to <i>But they say</i> 
(this interpretation may have been
less obvious to the transcriber, because the speaker's wording
after <i>say</i> was broken up in BNC by many interruptions on the
part of the other speaker)

<p>09461:  <i>a buying</i> emended to <i>a-buying</i> 
(seems likely to be the 
dialect version of present
participle with <i>a</i> prefix)

<p>09477:  <i>Coffeemate</i> emended to <i>Coffee-mate</i>

<p>09494:  The word <i>Colander</i> (name of a kitchen implement) 
at this point is
quite mysterious in context, and may well be a mishearing of some
other word(s), however no plausible emendation has occurred to us.
Later in the text, the speakers seem to be playing a word game
(a crossword?), so perhaps arbitrary words are in fact intended.

<p>09500:  <i>scream</i> emended to <i>screen</i> (a more plausible 
reading, entailing minimal
phonetic change)

<p>09506:  <i>thereof</i> is such a rare word that the transcription is
likely to be at fault; the speaker might have begun and broken off
some sequence such as <i>they're of -- </i>, 
<i>they're a v-</i>, or the
like.  But there is no basis for choosing any specific emendation,
so the BNC reading has been allowed to stand.  (Again the word
may have arisen in the game being played, rather than being
relevant to the surrounding chat.)

<p>09517:  The first &quot;word&quot; of the s-unit has been emended 
from <i>T</i> to <i>P</i>.
A word is being spelled out, and the word intended is clearly
</i>PATTERN</i> (even though the speaker gets the spelling wrong, and
is corrected).

<p>09532, 09533:  <i>dish water</i> emended to <i>dishwater</i>

<p>09549:  <i>missus</i> emended to <i>missis</i> 
(<i>COD</i> preferred spelling for the jocular or
nonstandard use of <i>Mrs</i> other than as a prefix to a proper name).

<p>09567:  <i>could only of</i> emended to <i>could only've</i>

<p>09571:  <i>must of</i> emended to <i>must've</i>

<p>09574:  <i>the poll tax</i> seems a surprising topic 
in context and one suspects
a mistranscription.  On the other hand, the recording dates to
February 1992, so if <i>poll tax</i> is correct the following words
<i>I thought there was one more</i> could well refer either to one more
monthly instalment to pay in that financial year, or perhaps one more
year before poll tax was replaced by council tax.

<p>09584:  <i>would never of</i> emended to <i>would never've</i>

<p>09599:  <i>was his neighbours</i> emended to 
<i>uses neighbours</i> (the BNC wording is
obviously nonsensical; this seems phonetically a minor emendation
which yields good sense in context)

<p>09605:  <i>there a,</i> emended to <i>there are,</i> 
(the construction is broken off, but
<i>are</i> is clearly far more plausible than <i>a</i> and would often
sound identical)

<p>09605:  <i>it's a complex</i> emended to <i>it's er complex</i> 
(in context, <i>complex</i> seems
to be used in its adjectival sense, not as a noun for a
psychological syndrome; <i>er</i> as a filled pause is phonetically
indistinguishable from indefinite article.

<p>09607:  <i>their selves</i> emended to <i>theirselves'</i> 
(</i>theirselves</i> is a nonstandard dialect
equivalent to <i>themselves</i>, and would normally also be written
as one word; in this case it appears to be used in the genitive,
meaning <i>their own [children]</i>)

<p>09607, 09619, 09627:  <i>childminder, childminding</i> 
emended to <i>child-minder, 
child-minding</i>

<p>09609:  <i>how she er was as that child</i> emended to 
<i>how she abuses that child</i> (this
would be an over-bold emendation in an otherwise well-transcribed
text, but so many passages are clearly mistranscribed here that
this change seems justified:  it alters incomprehensible wording
to clear, common usage, and the phonetic difference is not great)

<p>09611:  <i>gran children</i> emended to <i>grandchildren</i>

<p>09615:  <i>T S B</i> emended to <i>TSB</i> (Trustee Savings Bank)

<p>09617:  <i>her she saw around kid</i> emended to 
<i>her she saw her own kid</i> (speaker's
subsequent repetition makes this reading obviously correct)

<p>09621:  <i>you've low and detest children</i> emended to 
<i>you loathe and detest children</i>.
(Changes the sequence from ungrammatical word-salad 
to a clich&eacute;,
at the cost of treating one voiced fricative as having been
wrongly introduced by the transcriber, and of introducing another
not heard by the transcriber.  This is the least audible class of
phonemes.)

<p>09631:  <i>must of</i> emended to <i>must've</i>

<p>09632:  <i>would of</i> emended to <i>would've</i>

<p>09633:  <i>they'll of</i> emended to <i>they'll've</i>
