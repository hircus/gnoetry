Dear Sir,                                        
         
Based on the recommendation made to me by a reputable
official of the commercial sector of the South African
Chamber of Commerce who guaranteed me of your
reliability and trustworthiness in business dealings,
I wish to entrust a large amount with you believing
that it will be of our mutual benefit; this has to be
highly confidential. If I may introduce myself, I am
Dr Ben Oguejiofor of the Nigerian Army. I was the
former Director of Projects and engineering in the
Nigerian Army; I retired recently after the handing
over to a democratically elected government in
Nigeria. I wish to crave your indulgence in this
business relationship that I will like to establish
with you.
During my 33 years in service and as the Director of
Projects in Nigeria, I was able to award some
contracts to some foreign contractors. In the process
of the award of the contracts the invoice values were
inflated to reflect twice the amounts involved in the 
actual execution of the awarded contracts; the
contractors have since completed the projects and the
actual contract amount duly paid to them.
These contracts were carried out on behalf of the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Kaduna
Refinery in 1992, NNPC awarded a contract to
PETRO-TECH. NIG. LTD. ; CONTRACT NO. :
NNPC/EPR/PED/001/1-44 RE 94DT  for the supply of 
200,000 monax axial erection  of system optimizations
and commission conveyors for the Kaduna Refinery
Complex. The Project has been commissioned since
August 1996 and the Contractors have been paid their
full contract fees. It is the U$D 45.1 MILLION
over-invoiced sum that we want to remit.

Now the Project Engineer in collaboration with the
Chief Accountant of the Corporation together with
other officials of the NNPC have been able to process
the over-invoiced amount for payment
(NNPC/FAX/888/514-8). Therefore, it is in our effort
to get this money paid into a foreign account,
company/ private bank account. To this effect, I am
therefore asking for your co-operation to remit this
sum of U$D 45.1 million into your private/company^Òs
account 



We have unanimously resolved to compensate you with
30% (thirty percent)  of the total amount involved for
your assistance, while I and my associates take 60%
(sixty percent) of the total amount which of course
will be released to us by you after the transaction is
completed and 10% (ten percent) will be mapped out to
cover envisaged expenses by both parties in the course
of processing the documents for the transaction. For
reasons bordering on confidentiality every
message you are sending should go to my phone/fax line
in Miami, the number to call in Miami is 1 - 305 ^Ö 675
- 0185 . I need this transaction done with every sense
of urgency that it requires and  I believe hearing
from you today will enable me arrange the transfer to
your  account. 

While I expect an immediate confirmation of your
interest in addition with your account details as well
as fax and telephone numbers which are to be sent to
me by fax, I urge of urgency and confidentiality that
it deserves and keep this transaction between you and
I alone.  I am looking forward hearing from you on my
direct Tel/fax : 1 - 305 ^Ö 6-275 - 0185 in Miami,
U.S.A where
I^Òm on vacatiofor three weeks for now orall here for
confirmation 234-1-5457466lagos

Yours


Dr Ben Oguejiofor.

Fax: 234-1-7596736

Dear Sir/ Madam
SAVE OUR SOUL
With deep sense of frustration and desperation I have decided to reach 
out to the world for help and that is what this letter is all about. I am 
Mr. Abbas Abacha the third son of Late General Sani Abacha ^Ö 
Nigeria former Head of State and Commander in Chief of the Armed 
Forces, whose sudden death occurred on 8th June, 1998.

Owing to allegations of financial misappropriations levelled against my 
father, the immediate past Military Government of Gen. Abdulsalami 
Abubakar freeze all traceable local and foreign bank accounts in the 
family's name and also seized our vast estates together with other fixed 
assets of my family. My mother is still under house arrest since June last 
year and my elder brother Mohammed is currently in detention being 
prosecuted by the incumbent democratic government charged with 
series of allegations.

I consider you reputable and trustworthy enough to assist me in 
receiving the sum of USD$27m Million (Twenty Seven Million U.S. 
Dollars) in cash in Europe which was not detected by the security 
operatives, that was stashed by my father in one of our private house. It 
has become obvious that if immediate action is not taken our family will 
be ruined forever by this hideous administration. I have equally agreed 
in principle to offer you 25% of the fund for your services. The 
evacuation of the fund is not a problem, I desperately require your 
candid assistance to act as the Trustee of the fund in your personal or 
corporate name with a valid bank account in Europe or America. 
Should you be interested contact me on fax no. 234-1-7596739
Regards,
ABBAS ABACHA

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction; this
is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.

I am the Legal adviser of the Contract Review Panel instituted by H. E.
President Olusegun Obasanjo to probe/review all Contracts executed and
payments made during the regime of late General Sani Abacha.  My
colleagues on the Panel have mandated me to seek your assistance in the
transfer of the sum of US$18.5 Million into your Bank Account.

As you may know, the late General Abacha and members of his government
embezzled billions of dollars through spurious contracts and payments to
foreigners between 1993 ^Ö 1998 and this is now the subject of probe by my
Panel.  In the course of our review, we have discovered this sum of $18.5
Million, which the former dictator could not transfer from the dedicated
account of the Central Bank of Nigeria before his sudden death in June
1998.  It is this amount that my colleagues and I have decided to acquire
for us through your assistance. This assistance becomes crucial because we
cannot acquire the funds in our names and as government officials we are
not allowed to own or operate foreign bank accounts.  We have thus
developed a, fool proof, legal and totally risk free scheme through which
the fund can be transferred to your nominated bank account within a very
short time. The scheme is to use our position and influence on the Panel
to represent you as a foreign Contractor beneficiary of the funds.  We
shall arrange all documentation to support this claim and get Approval for
the transfer of the funds for your benefit on our behalf.

The scheme is perfected to be 100% risk free and we are sure the funds can
arrive your Account within 10 working days from when you agree to assist
us. You should acknowledge the receipt of my mail through the above e-mail
address so we can further discuss the modalities of your cooperation and
negotiate the charge for the usage of your Account. You definitely have a
lot to benefit from this transaction as we are prepared to give you
between 20% of the total funds as soon as you secure it in your account.

Please, endeavor to send me an e-mail indicating your interest as to
enable me furnish you with my confidential telephone/fax number through
which we can communicate with you in confidence (in your response) as the
need for secrecy is great to this transaction. We expect your urgent
response.

Yours faithfully,

DR. INU ZEMEDE (MB.BS, PH.D, FNMA.)

DEAR SIR, 

I GOT YOUR CONTACT FROM A CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE THAT 
INFORMED ME YOU HAVE THE CAPABILITY OF TRANSACTING A 
BUSINESS OF THIS GREAT MAGNITUDE.

I WISH TO INTRODUCE MYSELF TO YOU. I AM COL. IBRAHIM 
MUSTAPHA (RTD), ELDER BROTHER TO MAJOR HAMZA AL 
MUSTAPHA WHO WAS THE FORMER CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER 
TO THE MILITARY DICTATOR OF NIGERIA, GENERAL SANI 
ABACHA. THE LATE GENERAL SANI ABACHA 
DIED UNEXPECTEDLY ON THE 8TH OF JUNE 1998. HIS 
COLLEAGUES IN THE ARMY POISONED HIM IN THE PRESIDENTIAL 
VILLA (ASO ROCK) BECAUSE HE RULED NIGERIA WITH AN IRON 
HAND. 

WITH THE DEATH OF THE DICTATOR, ELECTIONS WERE HELD IN 
THE COUNTRY AND A CIVILIAN ADMINISTRATION WAS SWORN 
INTO POWER. WITH THE ADVENT OF THE NEW CIVILIAN 
ADMINISTRATION, A DECISION WAS TAKEN BY THE PRESIDENT 
OF NIGERIA TO PROBE AND PROSECUTE ALL MILITARY OFFICERS 
THAT SERVED IN THE LAST MILITARY REGIME OF THE LATE 
GENERAL SANI ABACHA. MY BROTHER, MAJOR HAMZA AL 
MUSTAPHA WAS SINGLED OUT BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE 
DAY AS AN ARMY OFFICER THAT MUST BE PUNISHED BECAUSE 
OF HIS CLOSENESS TO THE LATE DICTATOR AND GROSS HUMAN 
RIGHT ABUSES ON THE CITIZENS OF NIGERIA. MY BROTHER AND 
I WERE BEST OF FRIENDS AND HE SHARED ALL HIS SECRETS 
WITH ME. 

THE FORMER CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER TO THE LATE HEAD OF 
STATE MAJOR HAMZA AL MUSTAPHA HAD PRIVATE ACCOUNTS 
THAT ARE WORTH HUNDREDS MILLION UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS AROUND THE WORLD. PRESENTLY HE HAS BEEN 
ARRESTED BY THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DAY AND IS 
PRESENTLY HELD IN PRISON ON TRUMPED UP CHARGES ON 
BEHALF OF THE STATE. I WAS DIRECTLY INFORMED BY MY 
CONTACTS AT THE PRESIDENTIAL VILLA, THAT HE WILL BE 
CONVICTED BECAUSE OF HIS POSITION AS THE FORMER CHIEF 
SECURITY OFFICER TO THE LATE DICTATOR. 

SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT ARRESTED MY 
BROTHER, HE ENTRUSTED TO ME THE SUM OF US$30.5M FOR 
SAFEKEEPING. THIS AMOUNT WAS TO BE SENT TO HIS MISTRESS 
IN LEBANON TO LAUNDER FOR HIM. I HAVE SINCE HAD THIS 
AMOUNT WITH ME STASHED AWAY A PRIVATE SECURITY 
COMPANY IN NIGERIA. I CANNOT SEND THIS MONEY TO MY 
BROTHER'S MISTRESS ANY MORE BECAUSE OF THE SITUATION 
OF THINGS OVER HERE. I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE IN MOVING 
AND SECURING THIS MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT ABROAD. I WILL 
ADEQUATELY COMPENSATE YOU WITH 20% OF THE TOTAL SUM 
FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE AND CO-OPERATION WITH ME TO MOVE 
THIS FUND OUT OF THE COUNTRY. 

THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION COLLECTIVELY RETIRED 
NINETY-TWO SERVING OFFICERS INCLUDING MYSELF A COUPLE 
OF MONTHS AGO. THIS MONEY IS NOT SAFE WHERE IT IS KEPT 
ANY MORE BECAUSE THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT ALL THE 
RETIRED OFFICERS MIGHT HAVE THEIR ESTATE CONFISCATED 
AS PART OF THE CURRENT SANITATION EXERCISE TO STOP 
CORRUPTION IN THE COUNTRY. ALREADY OUR VARIOUS 
PRIVATE BANK ACCOUNTS HAVE BEEN FROZEN PENDING THE 
OUTCOME OF THEIR INVESTIGATION AND WE ARE BEING 
CLOSELY MONITORED. I INTEND TO SAFEGUARD AND INVEST 
THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY ABROAD WITH A 
RELIABLE FOREIGN BUSINESS PARTNER SO THAT WE CAN 
INVEST THE FUNDS IN REAL ESTATE BUSINESS IN YOUR 
COUNTRY. THAT IS WHY I AM SOLICITING YOUR ASSISTANCE AND 
COOPERATION AS REGARDS THIS BUSINESS. ARRANGEMENTS 
HAVE BEEN CONCLUDED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY THAT HAS 
FOREIGN OFFICE IN EUROPE TO RECEIVE THE MONEY IN CASH, 
DEPENDING ON WHERE IS CONVENIENT FOR YOU. 

PLEASE INDICATE YOUR WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST ME BY 
SENDING TO ME THE FOLLOWING AS THE BENEFICIARY 
INFORMATION; BENEFICIARY'S NAME, ADDRESS AND YOUR 
PRIVATE PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS SO THAT I CAN CONTACT 
YOU AND COMMENCE THE TRANSACTION IN EARNEST. I 
AM WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOU VERY SOON. 

BEST REGARDS.

COL. IBRAHIM MUSTAPHA (RTD)

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by
virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET.  
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at
the end of the day.  We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of
this transaction, as we have been reliably informed of your disecretness
and ability in transactions of this nature.

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you.  I am DR. ABBAS
BABA, a director with the Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Lagos.  I came to
know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to
handle this confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge
sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence.

THE PROPOSITION:
A foreigner, Engineer Johnson Creek, an Oil Merchant/Contractor with the
Federal Government of Nigeria, until his death three years ago in a
ghastly air crash, banked with us here at Union Bank Plc, Lagos and had a
balance of USD$12.5m (Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars) which the bank now unquestionably expects it to be claimed by any
available foreign next-of-kin of the late beneficiary or alternatively be
donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military
war college here in Nigeria.  Fervent valuable efforts are being made by
the Union Bank to get in touch with any of the Creek's family or relatives
but proved to no avail.

It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any
of late Engr. Johnson Creek's next-of-kin (he had no wife and children)
that the management under the influence of our Chairman and member of the
board of directors, retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that an
arrangement be made for the funds to be declared "UNCLAIMABLE" and
subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and Ammunition to
further enhance the course of war in Africa and the world in general in
order to avert this negative development, some of my trusted colleagues
and I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next ^Öof-kin to
late Engr. Johnson Creek so that the funds USD$12.5m would be released and
paid into your bank account as the beneficiary's next-of-kin.  All
documents and proofs to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked
out and more so we are assuring you of a 100% risk free involvement.  
Your share stays while the rest would be for myself and my colleagues
for investment purposes in your country.

We have agreed that, the funds will be shared thus, after it has been
transferred into your account.

1. 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the
funds.

2. 10% will be set aside for reimbursement to both parties for any
incidental expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transfer.

3.	60% to us the originators of the transaction.

If this proposal is OK by you and you do not wish to take undue advantage
of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly get me
immediately via my Direct Fax#234-9-2720239 furnishing me with your most
confidential telephone, fax number and exclusive bank particulars so that
I can use these information to apply for the release and subsequent
transfer of the funds in your favour.

Yours faithfully,

DR. ABBAS BABA.
Executive Director operations(Union Bank Plc).

N.B.:  PLEASE, FOR CONFIDENTIAL REASON, I WOULD LIKE YOU TO SEND YOUR
REPLY TO MY CONFIDENTIAL DIRECT TELEPHONE NUMBER 234-1-7754093 FAX NUMBER
234-9-2720239.

DEAR SIR/MADAM,

COMPLIMENTS OF THE SEASON. GRACE, PEACE AND LOVE FROM THIS PART OF 
THE ATLANTIC TO YOU. I HOPE MY LETTER DOES NOT CAUSE YOU TOO MUCH 
EMBARRASSMENT AS I WRITE TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH. BASED ON THE CONTACT 
ADDRESS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND WHO WORKS AT THE NIGERIAN CHAMBER 
OF COMMERCE ATTACHED TO YOUR EMBASSY IN  MY COUNTRY. PLEASE 
EXCUSE MY INTRUSION INTO YOUR PRIVATE LIFE.I AM BARRISTER  HAMMA BEN
,I REPRESENT MOHAMMED ABACHA, SON OF THE LATE GEN. SANI 
ABACHA, WHO WAS THE FORMER MILITARY HEAD OF STATE IN NIGERIA. HE DIED 
IN 1998. SINCE HIS DEATH, THE FAMILY HAS BEEN LOOSING A LOT OF MONEYDUE 
TO VINDICTIVE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO ARE BENT ON DEALING WITH THE 
FAMILY. 

CONSEQUENTLY, THE FAMILY HAS ASKED ME TO SEEK FOR A

Sir, 

May I briefly introduce myself. I am Edward Mambo of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) and
the former aide de camp of the Late President
Laurel Kabila of blessed memory.

I am presently living in Nigeria on asylum. In case
you are wondering how I got your contact, I got your
contact from a source at the foreign trade office of
the Nigeria Chamber of commerce, trade and industry.
The events of the past one year in my country has been
very unfortunate. The Late president Kabila
successfully toppled the very corrupt government of
the Late Dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and ruled justly
and peacefully for a few months. Unfortunately, the
Tutsi from Goma, the Northern part of the country
rebelled against his government and since then
my country has been at war.

I am very dedicated and committed to winning the war
against the rebels until recently when to my shock I
found out that Senior Army Officers and Government
officials were stealing public funds and looting
government treasury and sending them to foreign
countries. They have exploited the war situation to
bring back the lawlessness and corruption of the Mobutu
days.

After the late President Kabila was assainated in very
questionable circumstances, I knew I was in danger of
losing from both ends. Due to this development and as
a way of survival, I have joined the train. I have in
my possession funds amounting to US$15.5million. In
the usual manner of conveying such funds, the money is
in defaced form in a trunk box for security reasons.
It is now in the safe custody of a security company.
The company is however not aware of the real
contentsof the trunk box.

My problem is that the financial Law of Nigeria does
not give assylum seekers any financial rights. And
because of the economic instability and religious
crisis, I have decided that it will be unwise to
attempt investing the funds here. The climate here is
very unfavourable and as a result, I have not
disclosed even to my hosts anything about this fund.

Now I am seeking foreign assistance to transfer the
funds overseas. If you can assist, I am willing to
give you 20% of the funds, that is US$3.1Million. You
will understand that my entire life and future depend
on this money and I shall be very grateful if you can
assist me. The major thing I demand from you is the
absolute assurance that the money will be safe and you
will not sit on it when it is transferred to
your account.

If you are ready to be of assistance, please contact me immediately by
e-mail, so that I can furnish you with the modalities for the transaction
and what is expected of you. I shall be most grateful if you maintain
utmost confidentiality and keep this message entirely to yourself.

Best Regards,
MR. Edward Mambo.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL/URGENT

FROM: MRS. MARIAM ABACHA
C/o BARRISTER 
E-mail:barrister_momoh50@yahoo.com    
ATTN: THE DIRECTOR

I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha, the widow of the late Gen.
Sanni Abacha former Nigerian Military Head of State
who died mysteriously as a result of Cardiac Arrest.
Since after my husband^Òs death, my family is under
restriction of movement and that notwithstanding, we
are being molesting; policing and our Bank Account
both here and abroad are being frozen by the Nigerian
Civilian Government. Furthermore, my elder son is in
detention by the Nigerian Government for more
interrogation about my husband^Òs assets and some vital
document.

Following the recent discovery of my husband^Òs Bank
Account by the Nigerians Government  with Swiss Bank
in which the huge sum of US$700 Million and Dutch 450
Million was logged. I therefore decided to contact you
in confidence that I was above to move out the sum of
US$41.5 Million Dollars, which was secret and is
sealed in two Metal Boxes for security reasons.

I personally therefore appeal to you seriously and
religiously for your urgent assistant to move this
money into your country where I believe it will be
safe since I cannot leave the country due to the
restriction movement imposed on the members of my
family by the Nigerian Government.

You can contact me through my family Lawyer who will
arrange with you for face to face meeting outside
Nigerian in order to liaise with you toward effective
completion of this transaction.

However, arrangements have been put in place to move
this money out of the country in the secret vault
through a security company to any of the West African
State and as soon as you indicate your interest, my
Lawyer shall send you the Air Bill of the Luggage and
other related documents so that you can help to claim
the Luggage.

Conclusively, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the
total sum, while 60% is to be held on trust by you
until we decide on a suitable business investment in
your country more also 10% is mapped out for internal
and external expenses. Subsequent to our free movement
by the Nigerian Government. Please, reply urgently and
treat with absolute confidentiality and
sincerity.Reply and include your phone and fax number.

Best regards,

MRS. MARIAM ABACHA

Lagos, Nigeria.
Fax: 234 1 7596174
Wednesday 17th 2001

Attention: president/CEO.

Dear Sir,

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.

Firstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject. This is
by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret. A
member of the Nigeria Export Promotion Council (N.E.P.C.) who was part of
the federal government delegation to your country during a trade
exhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a
confidential operation with you in the execution of the deal described
hereunder for the benefit of all the parties and hope that you keep it top
secret because of the nature of the business.

Within the ministry of petroleum resources where I work as a director of
engineering and projects, and with the co-operation of four other very top
officials, we have under our control as overdue contract payments, bills
totaling Thirty One Million United States Dollars, which we want to
transfer to a foreign account, with the assistance and co-operation of a
foreign company to receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable
foreign individual account to receive the funds.

The source of the fund is as follows: during the last military government
here in Nigeria which lasted bout eleven months, government officials set
up companies and awarded themselves various contracts which were grossly
over-invoiced in various ministries.  The present civilian government is
not aware of the atrocities committed by their predecessors and as a
result, we have a lot of such over invoiced contract payment s pending
which we have identified floating at the central bank of Nigeria ready for
payment.  However by virtue of our position as civil servants, we cannot
acquire this money in our names.  I was therefore delegated as a matter of
urgency by my colleagues to look for an over seas partner into whose
account we would transfer the sum of US$31,000,000.00 (THIRTY ONE MILLION
UNITED STATES DOLLARS) hence we are writing you this letter.

Since the present civilian government is determined to pay foreign
contractors l debts owed so as to maintain an amiable relationship with
foreign governments and non-government financial agencies.  We have
decided to include our bills for approval with the co-operation of some
officials of the federal ministry of finance (F.M.F) and the central bank
of Nigeria (C.B.N).  We are seeking your assistance in providing us with a
good company account or any other offshore bank account into which we can
remit this money by acting our main partner and trustee or acting as the
original contractor.  This we can do by swapping of account information
and changing of beneficiary and other pertinent information to apply for
payment.  By this act, we would be using your company information to apply
for payment, and prepare letters of claim and job description on behalf of
your company.  This process would be an internal arrangement with the
departments concerned.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in this transaction, your share as compensation will
be us$6.2 million (20%), us$21.7 million (70%) for us and us$3.1 (10%) for
taxation and miscellaneous expenses.

The business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality.  Also your area of specialization is not m
hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.  I have reposed
my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me.

You may Fax your response to my home fax: 234 1 7596174 to indicate your
willingness in assisting us.  I will bring the complete picture of the
transaction to your knowledge when I have heard from you.

Thanks for your co-operation,

Yours faithfully,
Dr. Spiff Mustapha

I will begin by soliciting your strictest confidence in this transaction.
This is by its nature being utterly confidential and top secret.

I am DR. ADEWOLE AREMU, the financial controller of the late Nigeria head
of state General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. Before the
federal budget of the 1996 fiscal year was announced, an account was open
to take care of his miscellaneous expenses. The actual intention of
setting up this account is to make ready funds to be singed at will
without official beau racy or protocol that might expose his illegal
expenses to transform himself into civilian president in 1999.

The funds put in this account emanated from subversion of 10% per barrel
of crude oil sold by the government and direct to a special account of the
president Called security account. I was appointed by the late Head of
state on trust to look after the daily running of the inflow from crude
oil sale and his expenses.

In the late president bid not to allow the CBN trace The government of the
accrued funds, he instructed me On trust to arrange a special security
company where The sum of US$38,020.000.00 will be deposited for his Own
personal expenses by cash to avoid any official Protocol from coming into
the process.

It was on this instruction that I deposited this sum on his behalf in a
special vault in a security company for safe keeping. This deal is known
to only myself, the late head of state, and his chief security officer who
is presently facing a life jail term for murder? I state categorically
here that the sudden death of Abacha and subsequent imprisonment of the
chief security officer has created an opportunity for me to solicit for
the support of your firm or person for the transfer of these funds through
a special secured process to your bank account. The process will be made
known to you upon your response and indication of interest. However,
please maintain absolute confidentiality as this is the only way we can
achieve our goal.

Your share for assisting us in this transacting will be 25%, 65% for
myself and the family of the chief security officer while 10% will be used
to settle expenses incurred by both parties. This project is 100% safe and
risk free as long as the instructions are followed very carefully,
religiously and prompt this is my assurance and guarantee to you?

Please contact me immediately you receive this message Indicating your
interest and willingness to assist me in this transaction of our mutual
benefits. You are to first contact me via this medium (E-mail) for further
detail to bring you abreast with our perfect Modalities.

I await your prompt response the shortest period.

Warm Regards,
Dr. Adewole Aremu.

ATTENTION PLEASE. 

I am writing with my personal respect with regards to your reposed
personality/firm as being reliable and God fearing. I am the son of Mr.
Michael F. Kadiar from Sierra-Leone. My mother, my younger sister and I
are presently staying in Ghana as Refugees. My father was one of the
ministers of Johnny Paul Koromah's regime in Sierra-Leone. During the
intervention of the ECOMOG soldiers to restore the presidency of
AlhajiTejan Kabbah from Johnny Koromah, my father was among the 23
executed ministers. After the execution of my father our stay in
Sierra-Leone was no more safe, my mother, my younger sister and I have no
option than to move to Ghana a neighbouring African country for safety.
Due to our status in Ghana as refugees, we have asses to very few things.

We escaped to Ghana only because it's safe and near to my country but
because a week before my father died, he told my mother of a lodgement
containing $27m and other treasures like Gold which he deposited in a
security company here in Accra Ghana for safe keeping. Since our arrival
here in Accra we have been receiving help from our mission because we are
staying in one of the visitors villa in the church premises. We attend
fellowship regularly in the missions premises under the supervision of the
refugees commission. We are hardly allowed to go out.
 
It's a thick life circle of cold comfort. 
 
I believe that God will touch you to understand my request. My mother and
I have agreed to work out our father's deposit and improve our lives
again. We have agreed to invest our money in any overseas country through
your assistance and directives. You will look for a lucrative venture
where this money can be invested on and also buyers of Gold depending on
the current market value. Before proceeding, we will get to be more
familiar and also into an understanding working agreement because our
future now depends on this money. The boxes containing the money and
treasures were deposited and registered as a family treasures. I am sure
my father did it for security reasons.

We would like to know what you will take as your percentage for assisting
us. We sincerely wish to introduce and make you our business partner and
overseer of our proposed investment in your country or any where else. We
are prepared to send all the documents regarding to this deposit as soon
as you show your immediate response by E-mail.


Best regards, 
   
Michael F. Kadiar. 

NB: I am 19 years of age and need to further my education. My mother has
been sick of cancer even before the death of her husband, making her unfit
to do any work and my younger sister is just dreaming her life away.

            URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL
      (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 152,000.000.00 USD
  ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS
   
 Dear sir,
   
We want to transfer to overseas ($ 152,000.000.00 USD) One hundred and
Fifty two million United States Dollars) from a Prime Bank in Africa, I
want to ask you to quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will
be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up
a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can
serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till
the end for this important business trusting in you and believing in God
that you will never let me down either now or in future.
   
I am MR,LUKE the Auditor General of prime banks in Africa, during the
course of our auditing I discovered a floating fund in an account opened
in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account
again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that
the owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the money is floating
and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for
nothing. the owner of this account is Mr.  Allan P. Seaman, a foreigner,
and an industrialist, and he died, since 1993. and no other person knows
about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Allan P. Seaman
until his death was the manager Diamond safari [pty]. SA.
   
We will start the first transfer with fifty two million [$52,000.000] upon
successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining rest amount to your account,
 
The amount involved is (USD 152M) One hundred and Fifty two million United
States Dollars, only I want to first transfer $52,000.000 [fifty two
million United States Dollar from this money into a safe reigners account
abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I am only
contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a
local person here, without valid international foreign passport, but can
only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or
drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is in us dollars and the
former owner of the a/c Mr. Allan P. Seaman is a foreigner too, [and the
money can only be approved into a foreign a/c
   
However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together I got your
contact address from the Girl who operates computer, I am revealing this
to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this
business, you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for
this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next
step to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax number
including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.
 
I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding
agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any
account of your choice where the fund will be safe. Before we fly to your
country for withdrawal, sharing and investments.
  
I need your full co-operation to make this work fine. because the
management is ready toapprove this payment to any foreigner who has
correct information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will
meet up with instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved
with me in this business. I need your strong assurance that you will
never, never let me down.
  
With my influence and the position of the bank official we can transfer
this money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with
assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in
your country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all documents of
transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any
place and to build confidence you can come immediately to discuss with me
face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and
three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money
going into the account.
   
I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that
you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. I will use my
position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer
of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant
ministries andforeign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total
amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties
might have incurred during the process of transferring. I will send you
all my phone and fax numbers as soon as you indicate interest in this
businesses
   
I look forward to your earliest reply through my
email address,luke_dabo@yahoo.com

From: PRINCE KAMARA
Tel: 225 07 97 39 24


Attn: President/ Director

CONFIDENTIAL

Dear Sir, 
	I am PRINCE KAMARA the only son of late former
Director of finance,Chief Vincent R. Kamara
Sierra-Leone diamond and mining corporation.
I must confess my agitation is real, and my words is
my bond, in this proposal. My late father
diverted this money meant for purchase of
ammunition, for my country, during the peak of
disastrous civil war in my country, now he has
deposited the money with ECOBANK Abidjan, where  I am
residing under political asylum with my younger sister.

Now the war in my country is over with the help of
ECOMOG soldiers, the present government of Sierra
Leone has revoked the passport of all officers who
served under the former regime and now ask countries
to expel such person at the same time freeze their
account and confiscate their asset, it is on this note
that I am contacting you, all I needed from you is to
furnish me with your bank particulars:
1) Account name
2) Account number
3) Bank address, telephone and fax number
For you to assist me transfer this money in your
private bank account, the said amount is  (TWELVE
Million Dollars) $12 Million.

I am compensating you with  5% of the total money
amount, now all my hope is banked on you and I really
wants to invest this money in your country, were their
is stability of Government, political and economic
welfare.

Honestly I want you to believe that this transaction
is  real and never a joke. My late father Chief Kamara
gave me the photocopies of the certificate of deposit
issued to me by ECOBANK on the date of deposit, for
you to be clarify because, I do not expose my self to
anybody I see, I believe that you are able to keep
this transaction secret for me because this money is
the hope of my life, it is important.

Please call me immediately after you must have gone
through my message fill free and make it urgent. That
is the reason why I offered you  5% of the total
money amount, and in case of any other necessary
expenses you might incur during this transaction.
N.B Try and negotiate for me some profitable blue chip
investment opportunities which is risky free which I
can invest with this money when it is transferred to
your account, personally I am interested in estate
management and hotel business, please advise me.

Call me back immediately you receive this message for
more explanation. And promisse me and my younger sister
to be a father considering our situation and not to
betray us.


Thanks and God bless
Best regards

PRINCE KAMARA TEL: 225 07 97 39 24
NB: my late father used me the only son as the
beneficiary / next of kin on the day of deposit and
also told me I need a foreign assistance of a
foreigner with a legitimate bank Account abroad who
will stand as co-beneficiary and partner abroad.

Calvary Greetings.

I am a preacher with the Seed Harvest Ministry, and I will like to get
advice from you. I believe the advice I need is secular to some extent,
but do have the patience to understand my intention.

A few year's ago I was in Liberia where I had established a little
congregation where I preached regularly, but the civil war escalated and
the church was converted to a hospital of sought. On one faithfull day
three Nigerian Soldiers came to me and left trunks of money with me and
swore to come back for it.

When the war in Liberia intensified I deposited this box in a security
vault in The Netherlands (Holland), I was escorted to Holland, by the
ECOMOG soldiers who felt the content of the trunks were documents and
never cared to check the trunks, I was air lifted to England with other
refugees then, I stayed in England and when I was getting frustrated I
returned to Africa only to find out that two of the three Soldiers died in
Battle while the last was declared MIA (Missing in Action).

Now I have the fund, which the soldiers said was over thirty million
dollars (US$30 million), but it lies in a security vault in a Security
Company in Holland. I was contacted in a letter dated 12th of September by
the security company asking me to indicate if I was in receipt of the
letter as a sign that I am living and still subscribed for their service.

I am interested in using a small fraction of this money, much less than
one percent for a re- organization of the work of God, but I do not need
the rest and do not want to have any direct dealing with it, but I need
someone who will be able to use the fund better maybe for charity or
something universally profitable, I have thought of doing it myself but,
my ministry is the apocalypse and I believe and preach the soon coming of
the Lord which make me not indulgent in reliance on money or wealth in any
form.

I also do not have the money that has accrued on the service and safe
deposit of the company that holds the fund, I will be glad if you have any
interest in the direction of maybe managing or transmitting the fund as
you prefer in your capacity and understanding.

I will be glad to get a response from you ASAP.

Regards.

Rev. Sunday Nana

Dear Friend,

I will like to solicit your help in a business preposition, which is by
nature very confidential and a Top Secret.

I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one worried and
apprehensive but I am assuring you not to worry, as all will be well at
the end of this endeavor.

I am Mr. Kenneth Odey and I am the General Manager of the African
Development Bank PLC and I and my partners have decided to seek your help
in transfer of a huge sum of money requiring maximum confidence .


THE PREPOSITION

A foreigner, Late Engineer Mark Otagaki who was an oil merchant and
contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria until his death onboard
the ill fated Kenyan Airways bus {A310300}was our customer at the AFRICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK and had a balance of US$32 .2million which the bank now
expects his next of kin to claim as the beneficiary.We have made valuable
efforts to get his people to no avail as he had no known relatives,due to
this development our management and our board of directors are making
arrangements for the funds to be declared unclaimed and subsequently paid
into the federal government purse and to avert this negative development
me and my colleagues have decided to look for a reputable person to act as
the next of kin to late Mr. Otagaki so that the funds will be released and
paid into your account and this is where you come in.

All documents to aid your claim will be provided by me and my colleagues
and for your help you will be getting a % of the total sum .

Please be assured that this transaction is risk free and we will need your
fax number and phone number for more communication.


Please reply soon.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

DEAR Sir/Madam,

I am engineer Daniel Ibe, an engineer with the federal ministry of
petroleum Resoures,I got your contact through a friend whom I told I
needed an assistance on some information,although I did not disclose the
nature of business to him,since it demands absolute secrecy.

The tiny Republic of benin a country in west africa discovered crude
oil,black Gold in port-novo and since they are not members of ORGANIZATION
OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRY(OPEC)they reqested for our assistance
through our ministry whose subsidiary is the (NNPC),we were able to assist
in drilling and excavating of this black Gold and also spot lifting.

As a result of the spot lifting an escess of(us$50.5m)fifty million five
hundred thousand united states Dollars was recorded and it is in our
favour,my colleagues then decided we should look for an honest and sincere
person who would clear responsibility of this amount because the law of
our country does not allow civil servants to operate foreign
account.presently the money is safely kept in an escrow account secure
from all eyes.

We shall be meeting with you if you accept to assist us,secondly it would
also afford us to know what percentage that will be given to you,foryour
assistance.It will take seven working days to actualize this project and
safely transfer into your bank account on our behalf and yourself.

I will appreciate your quick response through my e-mail address,Iam open
to further question you may wish to ask in respect of this business
transaction.Please kindly send your private telephone and fax numbers.

Best Regards
Daniel Ibe

Iam Mrs. Marian Abacha, the widow of late Gen. Sani
Abacha.Former Nigeria military head of state who died
mysteriouly as a result of cardiac arrest. Since after
my husband`s death. my family has been going through
immense harassment including undue police restriction
and molestation .The family account with the bank here
and abroad have been frozen by the government for
reasons that are rather 
vindicative. Our plight ever made worse by the
confiscation/seizure of our family landed properties
and 
investment in Nigeria.One of the witch-hunting search
light of the government beamed on our account a Swiss
bank which had a sum of US$ 700 Million in it and
another US$ 450Million. Threats of freezing and clamp
on the account have been too much.It is for this
reason that I have decided to move the sum of US$ 60
Million in defaced form packed carefully in sealed
metal boxes for reason of security.I  humbly  appeal
to you on behalf of the entire family members to safe
us from starvation,poverty 
and strangulation by assisting us move the money into
your country where it shall be safe, since I cannot
leave Nigeria now due to the movement restriction
place on us.You can reach us through our fax number
above. Our Lawyer shall arrange a face to face meeting
outside Nigeria for effective and logical 
movement of the money. You can equally get in touch
with my younger son, Abba Abacha (Mr) on his cellular
phone number: 234-802-305-0272 or his e-mail
address:(abbabcha@onebox.com,)

We have moved the money to a security company in
europe. My son shall give you details of this
confidential movement as soon as you get in touch. For
the anticipated co-operation, we have set 
20% of the money for you while 75% shall be held on
trust until we decide on a joint venture business to
do with the money as soon as we regain freedom, while
5% shall be mapped out for any incidental expenses
that may arise. Treat with confident and do reply to
safe us from the stifling grip
of the merciless government.


Best regards,

Hajia Marian Abacha

Dear ,
 
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make any one  apprehensive and worried, but I
am assuring you that everything will be well at the
end of the day. We have decided to contact you due to
the urgency of this transaction.
 
Let me start by introducing myself properly to you.I
am Mr. SHIKA UMUNDI an auditor  with Ned Bank,
Johannesbourg, South Africa .
 
THE PROPOSITION: 
A Foreigner a french, Late Engr.Jean claude Pierre
(Snr) a merchant with The Federal Government of 
South Africa, Formerly working in Witwatersrand
Johannesbourg Gold Mine, Johannesbourg South Africa
until his death months ago in Kenya Air Bus (A310 -
304)Flight KQ431, He banked with us at Ned Bank
Johannesbourg and had a closing balance as at the
end of September, 2000 worth $33,800.000.00 (Thirty
Three Million eight hundred United State Dollars),
(this is aside the accrued interest so far from that
date) the bank now expects his next of kin as
beneficiary. Valuable efforts are being made by the
Bank  to get in touch with any of the Claude's Family
or Relatives but to no success.
 
It is because of the perceived possibility of not
being able to locate any of Late Engr. Jean Claude
Pierre(Snr.)'s next of kin (He had no wife or
children that is known to us). The Management under
the influence of our Chairman and Members of the Board
of Directors, that arrangement has been made for the
fund to be decleared "Unclaimed" and subsequentlly be
donated to the trust fund for arms and ammunition to
further enhance the course of War in Africa and the
World in General.
 
In order to avert this negative development, some of
my trusted colleagues and I now seek your permission
to have you stand as next of kin to the late Engr.
Jean Claude Pierre (Snr.) so that the fund will be
released and paid into your Account as the beneficiary
next of kin.
 
All documents and proves to enable you get this fund
will be carefully worked out. We have secured from
the probate registry, an order of Mandamus to locate
any of the deceased's beneficiary(ies), and more so
we are assuring you that this business is 100% Risk
Free. Your share will be 30% of the total sum while
the rest will be for myself and my colleagues for
investment purposes, According to agreement between
both parties.
 
However,It might interest you to know that you can
claim the fund in our  bank's main branch here in
Johannesbourg South Africa or in our corresponding
bank in London.
 
Should you be interested in claiming the money from
our correspondent bank in London, we have a
colleague in that bank who will offer you assistance
in London and who will be willing to talk with you on
phone as soon as possible.
 
We shall arrange to change the name of beneficiary
in your favour with our bank and also the Probate
Registry of the Government of South Africa.
 
Kindly indicate your interest to enable us make
arrangements to get the neccessary supporting and back
up documents that will make you eligible to claim
the fund as his next of Kin. 
 
Please note that for the purposes of confidentiality,
all further correspondeces would be through my
alternative email address:shika_mundi1@email.com

Accept my warm regards as I await your response.
 
Sincerely,
 
SHIKA UMUNDI.

Subject: Urgent Attention
Date: Mon, 25 Feb 2002 01:49:33


STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT

Dear Sir,

I am Mr.Thabo M. Masebe, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an
Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural
Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you
for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that
a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at 
the
Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your
enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a
confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described
Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a 
top
secret because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty-one
Million, Five Hundred Thousand US. Dollars ($21,500,000.) which we want to
transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable
foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are
handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code 
of
Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your 
importance
in the whole transaction.

This amount $21.5m represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which 
we
the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost
have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune
of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by
Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you
will provide by filing in an application through the Ministry of Justice
here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the
former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your
share of the sum will be 25% of the $21.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for
taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on
your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality.
Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and 
hope
that you will not disappoint me.

Endeavor to contact me immediately through my e- mail:
<thabo_masebe@yahoo.com> to confirm whether or not you are interested in
this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign
artner to carry out this deal.

I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to
make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very
strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please,
remember to treat this matter very confidential , because we will not
comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government
Service .Once again, remember that time is of great essence in this
transaction. I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,
T. M Masebe.

ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF ESTATE 
 
I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed
properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and
Finance Allocation of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in
Nigeria.
 
Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would want the
transaction to be strictly confidential as possible. He further wants his
identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, until the completion of
the transaction. Hence our desire to have an overseas agent. I have
therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our
overseas agent in order to actualize this transaction. 
 
The deal, in brief, is that the funds with which we intend to carry out
our proposed investments in country is presently in a coded account at the
Nigeria Apex Bank (i.e. the Central Bank of Nigeria) and we need your
assistance to transfer the funds to your country in a convenient bank
account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use
in your country. For this, you shall be considered to have executed a
contract for the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria for
which payment should be effected to you by the Ministry. The contract sum
of which shall run into US$25 Million, of which your share shall be 20% if
you agree to be our overseas agent.

As soon as payment is effected, and the amount mentioned above is
successfully transferred into your account, we intend to use our own share
in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too you shall also serve as our
agent. In the light of this, I would like you to forward to me the
following information:
 
 1. Your company name and address 
 2. Your personal fax number 
 3. Your personal telephone number for easy communication. 
 
You are requested to communicate your acceptance of this proposal through
my above stated email address after which we shall discuss in details the
modalities for seeing this transaction through.
 
Your quick response will be highly appreciated. Thank you in anticipation
of your cooperation.

Yours faithfully, 

Dr. Jonathan Ibori.

From the Desk of DR.WILLIAM DABO.
NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION
LAGOS  NIGERIA.
 
Dear,  

Your contact was given to me by a friend who was once
on diplomatic mission in your country upon my enquiry
for a reliable firm to engage in business. The same
guaranteed your reliability and trust-worthiness in
business matters. I therefore wish to explain this
lucrative business intention for our mutual benefit,
though I did not let that friend have the real idea of
my intended business proposal due to the level of
confidentiality which the transaction demands.

I am chief accountant with ^ÓNigerian National
Petroleum Corporation^Ô (NNPC) headquarters in Lagos-
Nigeria. I am in a position to remit the sum of
$30,000,000.00 (THIRTY MILLION POINT ZERO ZERO UNITED
STATES DOLLARS ONLY) into a reliable foreign account
for our personal use.

This sum of $30,000,000.00 originated from a
deliberate over-invoice (in the contract payment
voucher) of total value of contracts awarded to some
foreign contractors for the supply and erection of
petrochemical and pipeline equipment to ^ÓNNPC^Ô
refinery, Finnima, in Rivers State of Nigeria in 1994.
With the view that as son as the bonafide contractors
receive their full contract payments, we claim the
balance for our personal use. The contractors who
executed the relative contracts have since been paid
their full contract sums leaving the $30.Million
floating in the federated account of ^ÓNNPC^Ô with the
Central Bank of Nigeria, secured as credit/payment to
a foreign contractor. It is therefore due for us to
claim this balance sum as final phase payment to a
foreign contractor but we cannot accomplish this
without collaborating with a foreign firm into whose
account this sum will be transferred as the
beneficiary of the fund. Moreover, as civil servants,
we are not allowed to operate foreign accounts. It is
to this effect that I have been mandated to
communicate you for maximum assistance/co-operation.

For your understanding, we (partners here) have
solidified and perfected arrangements to push out this
fund legitimately on  legal grounds in such a way that
no risk of partners on either sides is involved. We
have made careful and necessary arrangements for the
smooth transfer of the fund to your account as would
be provided. 

For your assistance, we have agreed to compensate you
with 25% of the whole sum to be transferred to your
account and 5% set aside to replenish expenses
incurred in the process of the transaction while 70%
comes to the officials on my side.

Let me know immediately, your interest and willingness
to enable me furnish you with the modus operandi of
the business.

Please send your reply through this alternative email
address willdabo@omaninfo.com  

Yours Faithfully,
DR.WILLIAM DABO

<pre>

Dear Sir/Madam,
I am Bada Musa, Bank Manager of ORIENT BANK OF
NIGERIA, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very
confidential business proposition for you.
On June 6 1997, an American oil consultant/contractor
with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr.
Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for
twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00
(Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon
maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we
sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an
automobile accident. On further investigation, I found
out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to
trace his next of kin were fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin
in all his official documents, including his Bank
Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is
still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each
year. No one will come forward to claim it. According
to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five)
years, the money will revert to the ownership of the
Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry
Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will
not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This
is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately
with your full names and address so that the attorney
will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits,
which will put you in place as the next of kin. We
shall employ the services of two attorneys for
drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the
necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor the transfer. A
bank account in any part of the world, which you
provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the
ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the attorney and my
position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction. If you are
interested, please reply immediately via the private
email address below. Upon your response, I shall then
provide you with more details and relevant documents
that will help you understand. Please observe utmost
confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us
because I shall require your assistance to invest my
share in your country.
Awaiting your urgent reply via email. 

Thanks and regards

Bada Musa.

ATTN: SIR,

I do recognize the surprise this urgent but
confidential letter brings to you, especially as came
from a stranger. It is occasioned by the urgent
demands. However, your contact was made possible at
your country's jornal at the World Trade Centre (WTC)
in Johannesburg after reading through your profile I
became assured of your capability of handling this
transaction, hence this is for urgent action. I am
GEORGE KOJO KABBA from the Republic of Sierra Leone.
My
father was the external affairs minister in the
government of Sierra Leone President, TEJA AHMED
KABBA. At the mid term of the rebillion, which is
still until this date, my father thinking fast decided
to send my younger brother and I out of Sierra Leone
because of fate of my country was yet to be decided.
We left Sierra Leone for South Africa with a total sum
of US$40.5MILLION (FORTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
UNITED STATES DOLLARS), sealed in a diplomatic baggage
meant for the purchase of arms in South Afria. On our
arrival in South Africa, because we are political
asylum seekers, we were not allowed to operate a bank
account so with the instruction of my father, we
deposited the money in a security company, through we
did not reveal the content of the baggage to the
security company, nor did we declare the actual
content to them, because we wanted to be on a safe
side.We told them that the baggage belong to my
foreign affiliate who is the beneficiary of the item,
unfortunately because of my father's political
position and influence he was assissinated. Since
then, we have been looking for a reliable and
trustworthy person to help me transfer this money,
into a foreign account overseas prior to investment in
that country or any other conducive country overseas.
We got in contact with somebody from Denmark but he
became unnecessary greedy concerning his share in the
transaction, luckily, we ran into your number and
details and decided to contact you and see if you can
be of any help to us. We intended to share this money
(US$40.5 MILLION) as follows:

1. 20% of the total sum to you if you assist us in
transferring this money into any of your account.
2. 5% of the total sum will be set aside to offset all
bils and expenses incurred in the process of the
transaction and the bank official that will help in
this transaction.
3. 80% of the total sum will be for my brother and I
for investment in any country of which you will be a
guide to us. Please, note that this transaction is
risk free on your side  as well as concuded all
modalities to aid this transfer, should this meet your
utmost consideration please give us your earliest
reply through my e-mail address. Be kind to provide us
with your communication facilities for a hitch-free
and confidential link, feel free to ask questions
consider neccessary, the confidentiality in this
transaction cannot be over emphasized as we trust
security and attention it demands, please treat this
transaction with absolute confidentiality.

Thanks,

Best regards,

MR. GEORGE KOJO KABBA

I am Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha, wife to the late Nigerian Head of state,
General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 while still on
active service for our Country. l am contacting you with the hope that
you will be of great assistance to me, I currently have within my reach
the sum of 24million U.S dollars cash which l intend to use for
investment purposes outside Nigeria. This money came as a result of a
payback contract deal between my husband and a Russian firm in our
country's multi-billion dollar Ajaokuta steel plant. The Russian
partners returned my husbands share being the above sum after his 
death.

Presently, the new civilian Government has intensified their probe into
my husbands financial resources which has led to the freezing of all 
our
accounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all our business licences
and the arrest of my First son. In view of this I acted very fast to
withdraw this money from one of our finance houses before it was closed
down. I have deposited the money in a security company with the help of
very loyal officials of my late husband. No record is known about this
fund by the government because there is no documentation showing that
we
received such funds. Due to the current situation in the country and
government attitude to my family, I cannot make use of this money
within, thus I seek your help in transferring this funds out of the sub
African region. Bearing in mind that you may assist me, l have decided
to part with 20% of the total sum. Your URGENT response is needed. All
correspondence must be through my e-mail niija701@yahoo.com  Please
include your personal phone and fax number.

Regards
Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha

E-MAIL: fg_private@onebox.com
TEL: +2348033159488         



              BUSINESS PROPOSITION:

I know this will reach you as a surprise, need not to
worry as we are using the only secured and
confidential medium available to seek for foreign
assistance / partnership in a business transaction
which is of mutual benefit. I work in the Auditing
Department of the First Atlantic Bank, Lagos-Nigeria,
where I have served as an auditor and accountant for
eighteen years. Presently I am the head of the
Auditing Department. 

It is the tradition of the First Atlantic Bank, under
the supervision of the Central Bank of Nigeria, (the
apex bank), to audit all dormant accounts at least
once in five years. During the course of this
exercise, it was discovered that an account containing
the sum of USD$18.5 Million (Eighteen Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) belonging to a
foreign businessman, Engineer Peter Heindrich, who
died five years ago in a ghastly air crash involving a
Nigerian carrier, ADC Airline, is yet to be collected
as none of his relatives has come forward for the
claim. At this discovery, the auditing department then
reported its findings to the Board of Directors, who
after series of meetings has no choice other than to
follow the Federal Government of Nigeria directive on
unclaimed funds. Nigerian financial law clearly states
that ^Óif an account remains dormant for a period of
five years, six month notification should be given to
the account owner after which the fund will be
declared UNCLAIMABLE and then transferred into a trust
fund solely operated by the Federal Government.

In other similar circumstances, there has been cases
where funds transferred to the Federal Government
Trust Fund were either misused or stolen by senior
government officers. This will definitely not be any
different since the same government who could not
account for the previous funds are still  the same
people hoping to manage this one. Having this in mind,
myself and four other top management staffs of this
bank has decided to secretly scout for any foreign
businessman who will assist us in the transfer of the
said sum. If you agree to work with us as a team, we
will furnish you with all that is required for the
transfer to be effected while you will stand as a
cousin / next of kin of late Engineer Peter Heindrich.


The First Atlantic Bank and the Central Bank of
Nigeria are quite ready to hand over the fund to
anyone who can come forward with proofs of genuine
relationship with the deceased. My colleagues and I
have access to the archives of late Peter Heindrich,
we will provide you with all that you need to know.
Also since we are working at top positions here at the
bank^Òs head office, endorsing approvals in your favour
will not be a problem as long as our direct
involvement in this transaction is not mentioned to
anybody.

We heard from some reliable sources that some members
of the board of directors are working to see that the
fund is declared unclaimable because the First
Atlantic bank stands to retain for itself the interest
that may have accrue for the five years period the
money was dormant. We on our part really want to trace
any relative of the deceased but time is not on our
side since the six months notification as stated in
the constitution is fast eating up. 

At the successful completion of this transaction, you
will retain for yourself 30% of the total amount, 10%
of the total amount shall be set aside to cover all
expenses that might be incurred during the course of
transfer. My colleagues and I shall retain the balance
60%. 

I wish to on behalf of my colleagues state
categorically that this transaction is 100% risk free
as long as you stick to our instructions. Myself and
my colleagues (who are also involved in this deal) are
among the privileged few who has any knowledge about
the fund. Bearing this in mind, we have therefore put
in place all machinery that will bring this
transaction to a successful completion. This we can
100% guarantee. 

If this proposal is okay by you and you do wish to
take advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you,
then kindly get to me immediately through my
confidential e-mail addresses(fg_private@onebox.com)
as stated above. Please provide me with your most
confidential telephone and fax numbers where I can
reach you immediately. Alternatively, you can reach me
on my mobile pnone line: +234-803-3159488. 
 
Awaiting your urgent response.

Yours truly,
MR. RAWAL LUKMAN.

NOTE: THIS TRANSACTION SHOULD BE TREATED WITH UTMOST
CONFIDENTIALITY..

FROM: DR. Hamza Bello
DIAMOND BANK PLC.
53, ADEOLA HOPEWELL STREET
VICTORIA ISLAND, LAGOS.


Dear Sir,

I know that this email will surely come to you as a
surprise, but I will crave your indulgence to view it
seriously and I apologise, but I hope that it will be
a welcome surprise. Before I run out of steam, I will
like to introduce my self and go straight to the
point. My name is Dr. Hamza Bello and I am a banker. My primary reason for 
writing to you is to seek your partnership/assistance in a business 
transaction. I need your partnership and assistance because of the
following reasons:

a. it is practically impossible for me to carry out
this business alone.

b. you live in a foreign land far away from mine. This
should normally not be a requirement, but when you
understand the transaction then you will understand
why it is important that you live far away from me.

c. The amount of money involved in this transaction is
US$18,500,000.00, which is too much for a man of
modest means like my self to handle in my country.

I believe from my few points above, you can begin to
get an idea why I need your participation.

Let me explain how the money, which is the basis of
this business I am proposing,  came about. Before I
became a deputy director, some years ago I used to be
Accounts Officer to some special corporate customers.
One of these very important customers of our
bank(Diamond Bank PLC) was Engineer Roland Simons an
American citizen, who had spent most of his years
before his death working in Africa and mostly in
Nigeria. He died in a plane crash in 1996 in Nigeria.
This money belonged to him. Technically speaking now,
it belongs only to his name. The money is payment he
received for a contract he executed on behalf of the
Federal Ministry of Works and Housing for the
government.

My reason for deciding to carry out this transaction
is that Engr. Simons did not mention any next of kin
in any of the documents held by the bank for the
number of years he had banked with us. Since 1996 we
have searched for any body that could be related to
Simons, I was mandated by the bank to search
for a relation of Engr. Simons and I did this from
January 1997 to December 1999 after which the search
was called off in the belief that soon a relative
may turn up to claim his estate. Nevertheless, as it
is, there is no relative.


Now, the chairman of the bank who is a retired soldier
has indicated his intentions for the money. During the
last meeting of Directors and Deputies he said that
he would donate the money to a military trust if it is
not claimed soon, this invariably means the continuous
flow of more arms and ammunition. I know for sure that
not all of the money will go to the military trust
some will surely line his pockets and that of any body
who is in support of his plan.

My plan is to get a trust worthy person that can under
my constant guidance present him self as a cousin to
the late Engr. Simons. I want you to note that your citizenship does not 
matter; you do not have to be an American. The papers demanded by the normal 
procedure for the claiming of an inheritance will take care of everything. 
You will be sole beneficiary to the estate of Engr. Simons. All I need is 
for you to follow my instructions closely because  I am experienced in 
inheritance matters here and I am on ground here to advice you on every step 
until you receive the money. Then we meet.

For your participation, we will allow you 30% of the
gross. All expenses incurred in the process of this
transaction will be deducted form the gross value and
shared at a commensurate ratio; this we will do at the
end of the transaction, because the money is bonded.
An estimated 10% or less will cover all necessary
expenses and we will take 60% for ourselves. The most
important thing to me right now is trust on both
sides. Now the money is still in the care of
the bank, I hope the trust will still be there when we
must have legally established your relationship as
cousin to Engr. Simons and the money is paid to you. I
need also to trust that you will not tell people or
your bank about this business. Collect the money first then I get my share, 
then you can tell any body what you chose. I shall need your help to invest 
in your country; therefore, any experience you have in this area will be 
beneficial.


Surely, you must have some questions or may be you
just need further clarification. I will be happy to
receive a telephone call from you or a fax message to
this effect, this will enable me explain further what
the next step is and the general plan. I will also
need your most confidential telephone number and fax
number, if you have a mobile phone I believe it will
help so that I can reach you anytime.
Please kindly respond.

I look forward to your positive and negative response is highly welcome.

Dr.Hamza Bello

Dear Sir,

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE

I am Hajia (Mrs.) Maryam F. Abacha, wife of Late
Nigeria head of state, General Sani Abacha. We have
not met before, I got your contract from my husband's
personal assistance's diary and I feel like I should
trust you.

It's no news telling you that my family has been going
through untold hardship since the 18th of June 1998
when my husband died. My family has lost so much
including some fixed assets my husband acquired while
in power. Eventually, the pages of all Nigeria
Dailies, which you can equally get from Nigeria
Embassy in your Country, will tell better of our
story. Even now, our homes are under surveillance,
worst of all the Government has restored to
confiscating everything that has to do with our
family. I also refer to case No. 1999 folio 404, 1999
folio 405, 1999 folio 831 in the High Court of Justice
Queen's Bench Division Commercial Courts of Justice
strand London WC 24 2LL.
Date Monday 27th February 2001 before Lord Justice
RIX. 4. I implore you in the name of Allah to seek
knowledge of this Judgement.

Before the death of my husband, General Sani Abacha,
he ran among other business of his own a Bureau De
Change", which was flourishing with every support from
the Bureau De Change Business, which has now been
clamped down by the Nigerian Government, I was able to
save US$35.5 Million in cash. I tried to safeguard it
in the Security Company here in Nigeria but failed.
Through the help of a family who works in the Security
Company I defaced the US$35.5 Million and moved it out
of Nigeria, under the label photographic material, to
a Security Company in Switzerland. I am therefore
seeking your assistance to help me claim this money
and bank it properly. Let me state here that this is
not of the many run - of the- mills letter of support
being sent out from here in Nigeria by some people. To
avoid an error of Judgement, I shall take care of all
incidental expenses from here.

Should you help me in this regard, you will have 20%
of the money for yourself and guide me further to
invest the remaining 80% in any viable business
venture. Please if you ever find it in your heart to
help me, send to my lawyer Barrister Ali koloma your
complete names and address as in your International
passport. You may be required by the security Company
to tender your passport for identification before you
can claim the consignment.
Your Telephone and fax number will also be needed to
enable my lawyer get back to you with the lodging code
and clearance permit from the security Company.

As soon as you send this information through my
lawyer, I will go ahead and instruct the Security
Comapy to arrange for you to pick up the Consignment.
 For security reasons, I will prefer you always
communicate with you my lawyer on this matter through
Tel:234-1-7757558/Fax 234-1-7594728. Email
Aliu_n2001@yahoo.com

While thanking you for your anticipated understanding
and co-operation.

I look forward to your urgent response through my
lawywer.

Best Regards.
Hajia (Mrs.) F. Abacha

DEAR SIR,
MY NAME IS BARRISTER  JAMES WILLIAMS, I AM A PRIVATE 
ATTORNEY AND I HAVE A CLIENT WHO IS INTERESTED IN 
INVESTING SOME GOOD MONEY IN YOUR COMPANY. 
MY CLIENT IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND PROMINENT PERSON WHO 
HAS MANDATED ME TO CONTACT YOU OR YOUR COMPANY FOR A 
VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS TRANSACTION. MY CLIENT IS BY 
NAME MRS. MARYAM ABACHA AND SHE IS THE WIFE OF A LATE 
MILITARY HEAD OF STATE IN MY COUNTRY. 
HER HUSBAND LATE GENERAL SANNI ABACHA MADE A LOT OF 
MONEY THROUGH OIL PROCEEDS DURING HIS TENURE IN 
OFFICE. INFACT, IT WAS DISCOVERED AFTER HIS DEATH 
THAT HE WAS WORTH WELL OVER $4.5 BILLION UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS AND SOME OF THIS MONEY WAS RETRIEVED AFTER HE 
DIED WHILE SOME WAS RECOVERED FROM OFFICIALS THAT 
SERVED UNDER HIM DURING HIS REIGN AS PRESIDENT OF 
NIGERIA. 
THE TRUTH OF THIS CASE IS THAT MY CLIENT DESPITE THE 
PROBLEM SHE IS GOING THROUGH NOW, SHE STILL HAS A LOT 
OF MONEY IN HER POSSESSION. WHICH SHE INTENDS TO 
INVEST OUTSIDE OUR COUNTRY. 
WHAT MY CLIENT NEEDS FROM YOU NOW IS A RELIABLE 
ACCOUNT WHERE SHE CAN TRANSFER SOME MONEY BUT MIND 
YOU, ALL THE MONEY IN HER POSSESSION CAN NOT LEAVE AT 
ONCE BECAUSE SHE NEEDS TO BUILD CONFIDENCE AND TRUST 
IN SOMEONE WHO WOULD NOT EXPOSE HER PLAN TO REMIT AND 
POSSIBLY INVEST IN YOUR COMPANY. SO SHE HAS AGREED 
THAT I SHOULD MAKE ARRANGEMENT FOR THE TRANSFER OF 
$45.5 MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS AND YOU ARE FREE 
TO NEGOTIATE YOUR MODE OF COMPENSATION EVEN IF SHE 
INTENDS TO INVEST THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY. 
PLEASE, DO NOT HESITATE TO INDICATE YOUR VIEW OF THIS 
REQUEST BY CONTACTING ME IMMEDIATELY YOU RECEIVE THIS 
MAIL, SO THAT THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS CAN BE MADE 
FOR THE MONEY TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY. 
DUE TO THE PRESENT SITUATION OF MY CLIENT, I WOULD BE 
HAPPY IF THIS REQUEST CAN BE KEPT A SECRET. I WOULD 
ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THERE IS NO RISK INVOLVED. 

I HOPE MY CLIENT WOULD BE HAPPY INVESTING WITH YOU. 
PLEASE KINDLY SEND DOWN YOUR REPLY THROUGH MY PERSONAL 
E-MAIL ADDRESS 
DO NOT FORGET TO SEND YOUR TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS 
WHEN REPLYING. 

THANKS, 

BARRISTER.  JAMES WILLIAMS

     (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 152,000.000.00 USD  
     ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS )  

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 152,000.000.00 USD)
One hundred and Fifty two million United States
Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to 
quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable  and fit to provide either an existing
bank account  or  to set up a new  Bank a/c 
immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c
can serve to receive this money, as long as you will
remain honest to me till the end for this important
business trusting in  you and believing  in God that
you  will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr. hillary,biodun the Auditor General of a bank
in Africa, during the course of our auditing  I  
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files
in the records I discovered that the owner of the
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner
of this account is  Mr. Magnus Leon, a foreigner, and
a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993. and  no other
person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that Magnus
Leon until his death was the manager Magnus
Coy.(pty). SA.  

  
We will start the  first transfer with fifty two
million [$52,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account, 

The amount involved is (USD 152M) One hundred and
Fifty two million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $52,000.000 [fifty two million
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us
dPOST
http://us.f203.mail.yahoo.com/ym/Compose?YY=19893
HTTP/1.0ollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr.
Magnus Leon is a foreigner too, [and the money can
only be approved into a foreign a/c] 

However, we will sign a binding agreement,  to bind us
together. I got your contact address  from the Girl
who operates computer,  I am revealing this to you
with believe in God that you will never let me down in
this business,  you are the first and the only person
that I am contacting for this business, so please
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you 
are  capable  and will meet up with instruction of  a
key bank official who is deeply involved with me in
this business.
I need your strong assurance that you will never,
never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately  to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us will
fly to your country at least two days ahead of the
money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries
and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply.
 
Yours,

hillary -biodun

My name is Antonio Nzam, top ADVISER to UNITA Leader,
Jonas Savimbi(DECEASED); Angola's Jonas Savimbi,
legendary guerrilla leader of UNITA (the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola), was
killed by communist MPLA (Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola) forces in combat Feb. 2002 (
please see
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_1839000/1839252.stm
 and   http://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.html  )

In addition to my official job, I was also in charge
of the consolidated budget and personal finances of
the late leader; these include Gifts, anonymous
donations from individuals and Countries, revenues
from Crude Oil sales and Precious Stones etc.
When UNITA fortunes and conditions began to
deteriorate rapidly, I took the precaution of
converting ALL  MONIES INTO GOLD BARS, AND  SHIPPED
THE GOLD BULLION CONSIGNMENT TO A SECURITY SAFE
DEPOSIT COMPANY IN EUROPE. AT TODAY'S PRICE OF $304.90
PER OUNCE, THE GOLD BULLION CONSIGNMENT IS WORTH ABOUT
$45,000,000.00 ( FORTY-FIVE MILLION US DOLLARS).

Unfortunately for me, after Jonas Savimbi's death, my
personal safety and life came  under threat by
Government Security Agents, and consequently I went
into hiding, living in a Safehouse location in the
outskirts of Luanda, the Capital City. I cannot travel
freely at the moment but hopefully an opportunity will
present itself soon so that I can catch my freedom!

I therefore need your help in two ways:-

1.  To collect the Gold Bullion consignment in Europe
and keep in safe custody for me until I am free. I
will provide the shipping document with which you can
present to the Company, which will immediately release
the consignment on demand.

2.  To arrange permanent asylum/immigration for me in
your Country. This is because I will require to settle
permanently in your Country as soon as I am free.
Please bear in mind that I do not have a visa;
therefore it will be necessary for you to consult an
Attorney for advice in this regard.

I freely offer you 25%  or one quarter of the Gold
Bullion consignment now in Europe in return for your
anticipated help and assistance .

If you are interested in helping me, please reply
immediately giving me your full contact details
including your phone , fax numbers etc; You can reach
me by phone via my security World Mobile Phone No. +
874 762 127 825; Please DO NOT PUT THE ANGOLA
INTERNATIONAL PREFIX 244 WHILE DIALING; SIMPLY DIAL
YOUR COUNTRY'S OUT GOING CALL PREFIX AND ADD 874 762
127 825. IF YOU STILL EXPERIENCE ANY DIFFICULTY, THEN
CALL YOUR INTERNATIONAL PHONE OPERATOR FOR HELP.

Regards,

Antonio

Dear Sir, 


My name is MR Tanko Bamaiyi the eldest son of Rtd 
General Ishaya Bamaiyi who was the estwhile Minister 
of Defence/Chief of army Staff in the late General 
Sani Abacha^Òs Regime of 1993-1998. 
I am contacting you in a benevolent spirit; utmost 
confidence and trust to enable us provide a solution 
to a money transfer of $46,100,000.00M that is 
presently putting my entire family into great 
disarray. 
You may be quite surprised at my sudden contact to you

but do not despair, I got your contact from a business

site on the internet and following the information I 
gathered about you, I was convinced that you could be 
of assistance to me. So, decided to contact you at 
once due to the urgency required for us to immediately

transfer the said funds out of the country. 
During the time my father was in the government with 
the late General Sani Abacha as the head of state, 
they were both involved in several deals that yielded 
Billions of Dollars. The prominent amongst the deals 
was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the 
importation of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the 
Nigerian Defence; funds set to embark on an overseas 
campaign to counter the United States action to put a 
stop to the self-succession bid of The Abacha^Òs 
government to retain power, and monies set aside to 
rehabilitate the ailing Nigerian Petroleum Refineries 
and the National Electric Power Authority which 
supplies Electricity to the entire nation. If you were

conversant with world news, you would understand 
better. 
During this period my father was able to make some 
good money for himself and kept in his private bank 
accounts. The then head of state General Sani Abacha 
transferred his share of the money through a Lebanese 
businessman, Chagoury and a Jewish businessman, Mark 
Rissar to bank accounts overseas. 
Unfortunately, all the secrets were revealed by the 
investigation agencies set up by the successive 
governments and most of the Abacha^Òs loots were traced

and repatriated from the various accounts to the 
Federal Government Treasury. 
Out of the money my father made, he left the sum of 
N50 Million (Fifty Million Naira) in the CBN escrow 
account for further transfer into a foreign account 
and a sum of $46,100,000.00M (forty-six million, one 
hundred thousand united state dollar only) was kept in

a Private security firm here in Nigeria. 
Through the confessions made by the Abacha^Òs Family, 
the N50 Million was recovered by the investigating 
agency from the CBN escrow account. But were unable to

discover the $46,100,000.00M, which he kept in the 
vaults. The reason is because no names were used to 
lodge in the funds. Instead, he used PERSONAL 
IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS (PIN) and declared the contents

as Bearer Bonds and Treasury Bills. Also the firm 
issued him with a certificate of deposit of the 
consignments. Note that I have these information in my

custody. 
Right now, my father has been arrested and detained 
for interrogation. As the eldest son of my Father, I 
believe that I owe the entire family an obligation to 
ensure that the $46,100,000.00M is successfully 
transferred abroad for investment purposes. With the 
present situation, I cannot do it all by myself. It is

based on this that I am making this contact with you. 
I have done a thorough homework and fine-tuned the 
best way to create you as the beneficiary to the funds

and affect the transfer accordingly. Is rest assured 
that the modalities I have resolved to finalize the 
entire project guarantees our safety and the 
successful transfer of the funds. So, you will be 
absolutely right when you say that this project is 
risk free and viable. If you are capable and willing 
to assist, contact me at once via email for more 
details. 
Believe me, there is no one else we can trust again. 
All my fathers^Ò friends have deserted us after 
exploiting us on the pretence of trying to help my 
father. As it is said, ^Óit is at the time of problems 
that you know your true friends^Ô. So long as you keep 
everything to our self, we would definitely have no 
problems. For your assistance, I am ready to give you 
as much as 20% of the total funds after transfer and 
invest a reasonable percentage into any viable 
business you may suggest. 
Please, I need your assistance to make this happen and

please do not undermine it because it will also be a 
source of up liftment to you also. You have absolutely

nothing to loose in assisting us instead, you have so 
much to gain. 
Awaiting your urgent and positive response. And feed 
back to me your private phone, fax and mobile numbers 
for further communication. 
BEST REGARDS, 
Mr.Tanko Bamaiyi

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL.

RE:TRANSFER OF U$21,500.000{TWENTY ONE MILLION FIVE
HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY.

I AM A MEMBER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA
NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION(NNPC) SOMETIME AGO, A
CONTRACT WAS AWARDED TO A FOREIGN FIRM IN THE PTF BY
MY COMMITTEE. THIS CONTRACT WAS OVER INVOICED TO THE
TUNE OF US$21.5M US DOLLARS. THIS WAS DONE
DELIBRATELY. THE OVER- INVOICING WAS A DEAL BY MY
COMMITTEE TO BENEFIT FROM THE PROJECT. WE NOW WANT TO
TRANSFER THIS MONEY WHICH IS IN A SUSPENSE ACCOUNT
WITH PTF INTO ANY OVERSEA ACCOUNT WHICH WE EXPECT YOU
TO PROVIDE FOR US.

SHARE:

60% WILL BE FOR MY PARTNERS AND ME.
30% OF THE MONEY WILL BE YOURS FOR PROVIDING THE
ACCOUNT WHERE WE SHALL REMIT THE MONEY.
10%  HAS BEEN MAPPED OUT FROM THE TOTAL  SUM TO COVER
ANY EXPENSES THAT MAY BE INCURRED BY US DURING THE
COURSE  OF THIS TRANSFER, BOTH LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL
EXPENSES.
IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW THAT SIMILAR TRANSACTION
WAS CARRIED OUT WITH ONE MR. PATRICE MILLER, PRESIDENT
OF CRANE INTERNATIONAL TRADING CORP. OF 153 EAST 57TH
ST; 28TH FLOOR, NY10022, TELEPHONE: 212-3087788 AND
TELEX:6731689. THE DEAL WAS CONCLUDED AND ALL COVERING
DOCUMENTS WERE FOWARDED TO MR. MILLER TO AUTHENTICATE
THE CLAIM. ONCE THE FUNDS WERE TRANSFERRED, MR. MILLER
PRESENTED HIS BANK WITH ALL THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS AND
REMITTED THE WHOLE FUNDS TO ANOTHER BANK  ACCOUNT AND
DISAPPEARED  COMPLETELY. MY COLLEAGUES WERE SHATTERED,
SINCE SUCH OPPORTUNITIES ARE NOT EASY TO COME BY.
AT THIS JUNCTURE, I WOULD LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT 
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN ASSISTING US IN THIS DEAL, WE
WOULD REQUIRE THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION FROM YOU,
WHICH WOULD ENABLE US MAKE FORMAL APPLICATION TO THE
VARIOUS MINISTRIES\PARASTATAL FOR THE RELEASE AND
ONWARD TRANSFER OF THE MONEY  TO YOUR ACCOUNT. THE
INFORMATION WE REQUIRE ARE:

YOUR  NAME, COMPANY`S NAME, ADDRESS , TELEFAX NUMBER.
YOUR BANK NAME ,ADDRESS, TELEFAX NUMBER.
YOUR BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER AND BENEFICIARY NAME.

WE HAVE STRONG RELIABLE CONNECTIONS AT THE CENTRAL
BANK OF NIGERIA AND OTHER GOVERNMENT PARASTATALS TO
ASSIST US IN THE DEAL, AND WHEN IT IS FINALLY
CONCLUDED WE SHALL USE SAME CONTACTS TO WITHDRAW ALL
DOCUMENTS USED TO AVOID ANY TRACE TO YOU OR US.
IT MIGHT ALSO INTEREST YOU TO KNOW THAT WE ARE
ORDINARY CIVIL SERVANTS WHO DO NOT WANT TO MISS THIS
OPPORTUNITY, SINCE WE WANT THIS MONEY TRANSFERRED
BEFORE THE NEWLY DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT
STARTS PROBING THE ACTIVITIES OF ALL PREVIOUS MILITARY
GOVERNMENTS.
PLEASE CONTACT ME THROUGH MY ABOVE TEL\FAX NUMBER
WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE INTRESTED IN THIS DEAL. IF YOU
ARE NOT IT WILL ENABLE ME SCOUT FOR ANOTHER FOREIGN
PARTNER TO ASSIST US. BUT IF YOU ARE INTRESTED PLEASE
SEND THE REQUIRED INFORMATION IMMEDIATELY SO THAT WE
CAN SWING INTO ACTION, SINCE TIME IS NOT ON OUR PART.
I WAIT IN ANTICIPATION OF YOUR FULLEST CO-COPERATION.
YOURS FAITHFULLY,

DR.UBA JEGA.

IKOYI-LAGOS, 
NIGERIA. 
TEL/FAX: 234-1-774-2913
10TH MAY,2002.

Dear Sir,
 
REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. 

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction. This 
is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top 
secret. You have been recommended by your country's Chamber of 
Commerce in confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute a 
transaction of great magnitude involving a pending business transaction
requiring maximum confidence. 

We are top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel 
who are interested in importation of goods into our country with 
funds which are presently trapped in Nigeria. In order to commence 
this business we solicit your assistance to enable us RECEIVE the 
said trapped funds ABROAD. 

The source of this fund is as follows : During the  regime of our 
late head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, the government officials set 
up companies and awarded themselves contracts which were grossly 
over-invoiced in various Ministries. The NEW CIVILIAN  Government 
set up a Contract Review Panel (C.R.P) and we have identified a 
lot of inflated contract funds which are presently floating in the 
Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N). However, due to our position as 
civil servants and members of this panel, we cannot acquire this 
money in our names. I have therefore, been delegated as a matter 
of trust by my colleagues of the panel to look for an Overseas 
partner 
INTO whose ACCOUNT the sum of US$31,000,000.00 (Thirty one Million 
United States Dollars) WILL BE PAID BY TELEGRAPHIC TRANSFER. Hence 
we are writing you this letter. 

We have agreed to share the money thus: 
1.       70% for us (the officials) 
2.       20% for the FOREIGN PARTNER (you) 
3.       10% to be used in settling taxation and all local and 
foreign expenses. 

It is from this 70% that we wish to commence the importation 
business.Please 
note that this transaction is 100% safe and we hope THAT THE FUNDS 
CAN ARRIVE YOUR ACCOUNT in latest ten (10) banking days from the 
date of reciept of the following information  by E-MAIL
A SUITABLE NAME AND BANK ACCOUNT INTO WHICH THE FUNDS CAN BE PAID. 

The above information will enable us write letters of claim and 
job description respectively. This way we will use your companys
name to apply for payments and re-award the contract in your company 
name.

Private Business Proposal.

Request for Urgent Business Relationship.

First I must solicit your confidence in this transaction. This is by virtue
of its nature as being
utterly confidential and top secret. We shall be counting on your ability
and reliability to
prosecute a transaction of great magnitude involving a pending business
transaction
requiring
maximum confidence.

We are top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel who are
interested
in importation of goods into our country with funds which are presently
trapped in Nigeria.
In order to commence this business we solicit your assistance to enable us
RECIEVE the
said trapped funds ABROAD.

The source of this fund is as follows : During the regime of our late head
of state, Gen. Sani
Abacha,
the government officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts
which were
grossly
over-invoiced in various Ministries. The NEW CIVILIAN Government set up a
Contract
Review
Panel (C.R.P) and we have identified a lot of inflated contract funds which
are presently
floating in
the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N). However, due to our position as civil
servants and
members of this
panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names. I have therefore, been
delegated as a
matter of
trust by my colleagues of the panel to look for an Overseas partner INTO
whose ACCOUNT
the sum
of US$31,000,000.00 (Thirty one Million United States Dollars) WILL BE PAID
BY
TELEGRAPHIC TRANSFER.
Hence we are writing you this letter.

We have agreed to share the money thus:
70% for us (the officials)
20% for the FOREIGN PARTNER (you)
10% to be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses.

It is from this 70% that we wish to commence the importation business.
Please note that this
transaction is 100%
safe in all it's ramifications and we hope that the funds arrive your
account in latest ten (10)
banking days from
the date of reciept of the following information by email: A suitable name
and bank account
into which the funds can
be paid.

The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job
description respectively.
This way we will use your
company's name to apply for payments and re-award the contract in your
company name.

We are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your
confidentiality in this
transaction.

For security reasons and in order to move forward quickly, please respond to
me by
Tel:234 17758442 so I can
bring you into the complete picture of this pending project and provide more
information as
to the succcessful conclusion of this project. The best response however,
would be by
telephone, so we can
discuss fully all issues needed to complete this venture in good time, and
successfully.

Thank you and God bless.

Yours Faithfully,
Mr.Ojo Adams.

SAMINY KANJO
Banque internationale De l'Afrique
TOGO-LOME.


My Dear friend,

                    (TOP SECRET)

I am saminy Kanjo,  one of the director in charge of
auditing and accounting section of Banque
internationale De l'Afrique(IBA) Togo-Lome West Africa
with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact
you on a business transaction that will be very
beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction
.

During our investigation and auditing (year ending
2001) in this bank, my department came across a very
huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person (
Arthur Billings) who died on October 31st 1999 in a
plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his
account with this Bank without any claim of the fund
in our custody either from his family or relation
before our discovery to this development.

The said amount was U.S $3.2M (Three million two
hundred  Thousand United States dollars). As it may
interest you to know, I got your impressive
information through the Togolise chamber of commerce
on foreign business relations here in Lome.

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over
this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,
get the required approval and transfer  of this money
to a foreign account has been put in place and  the
directives and needed information will be relayed to
you as soon as you indicate your interest and
willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to
this great business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because
of my position in this country as a civil servant(A
Banker),we are not allowed to operate a foreign
account.moreover, this may eventually raise an eye
brow on my side during the time of transfer because I
work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it
will require a second party or fellow who will forward
claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of
oath to the Bank and also present a foreign account
where he will need the money to be re-transferred into
on his request as it may be after due verification and
clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank
where the whole money will be remitted from to your
own designation bank account.

I will not fail to inform you that this
transaction is 100% risk free. On smooth conclusion of
this transaction, you will be entitled to 25% of the
total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside

to take care of expenses that may arise during the
time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 70%
will be for me and my partners.
Please, you have been adviced to keep "top secret" as
I am still in service and i intend to retire from
service after we conclude this deal with you.

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this
bank until you confirm the money in your account and
ask me to come down to your country for subsequent
sharing of the fund according to percentages
previously indicated and further investment, either in
your country or any country you advice us to invest
in. All other necessary vital information will be sent
to you when I hear from you.

I look forward to receive your email or your telephone
call.

Yours faithfully,

Mr.SAMINY KANJO

MY NAME IS BARRISTER AHMED JOHNSON(SAN), I AM A PRIVATE ATTORNEY
AND I HAVE A CLIENT WHO IS INTERESTED IN INVESTING
SOME GOOD MONEY IN YOUR COMPANY.

MY CLIENT IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND PROMINENT PERSON
WHO HAS MANDATED ME TO CONTACT YOU OR YOUR COMPANY
FOR A VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS TRANSACTION.  MY CLIENT
IS BY NAME MRS. MARYAM ABACHA AND SHE IS THE WIFE OF A
LATE MILITARY HEAD OF STATE IN MY COUNTRY.

HER HUSBAND LATE GENERAL SANNI ABACHA MADE A LOT OF
MONEY THROUGH OIL PROCEEDS DURING HIS TENURE IN
OFFICE.  INFACT, IT WAS DISCOVERED AFTER HIS DEATH
THAT HE WAS WORTH WELL OVER $4.5 BILLION UNITED
STATES

DOLLARS AND SOME OF THIS MONEY WAS RETRIEVED AFTER
HE DIED WHILE SOME WAS RECOVERED FROM OFFICIALS THAT
SERVED UNDER HIM DURING HIS REIGN AS PRESIDENT OF
NIGERIA.

THE TRUTH OF THIS CASE IS THAT MY CLIENT DESPITE THE
PROBLEM SHE IS GOING THROUGH NOW, SHE STILL HAS A
LOT OF MONEY IN HER POSSESSION.  WHICH SHE INTENDS TO
INVEST OUTSIDE OUR COUNTRY.

WHAT MY CLIENT NEEDS FROM YOU NOW IS A RELIABLE
ACCOUNT WHERE SHE CAN TRANSFER SOME MONEY BUT MIND
YOU, ALL THE MONEY IN HER POSSESSION CAN NOT LEAVE
AT ONCE BECAUSE SHE NEEDS TO BUILD CONFIDENCE AND
TRUST

IN SOMEONE WHO WOULD NOT EXPOSE HER PLAN TO REMIT
AND POSSIBLY INVEST IN YOUR COMPANY.  SO SHE HAS
AGREED
THAT I SHOULD MAKE ARRANGEMENT FOR THE TRANSFER OF
$12.5MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS AND YOU ARE FREE
TO NEGOTIATE YOUR MODE OF COMPENSATION EVEN IF SHE
INTENDS TO INVEST THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY.

PLEASE, DO NOT HESITATE TO INDICATE YOUR VIEW OF
THIS REQUEST BY CONTACTING ME IMMEDIATELY YOU RECEIVE
THIS MAIL, SO THAT THE NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS CAN BE
MADE FOR THE MONEY TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY.

DUE TO THE PRESENT SITUATION OF MY CLIENT, I WOULD
BE HAPPY IF THIS REQUEST CAN BE KEPT A SECRET.
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THERE IS NO RISK
INVOLVED.


I HOPE MY CLIENT WOULD BE HAPPY INVESTING WITH YOU.
PLEASE KINDLY SEND DOWN YOUR REPLY THROUGH MY
PERSONAL E-MAIL ADDRESS (ahmedjohnson123@yahoo.com)
my personal fax no:234-1-7594648.

THANKS,
BARRISTER AHMED JOHNSON(SAN)

 Mr Abdul One Useni,
May 11, 2002
Dear Sir,
 My name is Mr Abdul One Useni , the eldest son of rtd. General Useni
Mustafa, the estwhile Minister of the Federal Capital territory Abuja in the
late Dictator, General Sani Abacha, between 1993-1998.
I am contacting you in a benevolent spirit, utmost confidence and trust to
enable us provide a solution to a money transfer of $60M that is presently
putting my entire family into great disarray.
You may be quite surprised at my sudden contact to you but do not despair,
 I got your contact from a business site on the internet and following the
information I gathered about you, I was convinced that you could be of
assistance to me.
 So, I decided to contact you at once due to the urgency required for us to
immediately transfer the said funds out of the country.
During the time my father was in the government with the late General Sani
Abacha as the head of state, they were both involved in several deals that
yielded Billions of Dollars. The prominent amongst the deals was
 monies that emanated from funds set aside for the importation of Arms and
Ammunitions to boost the Nigerian Defense, funds set to embark on an oversea
Campaign to counter the United States action to put a stop to the self
succession bid of the
 Abacha^Rs government to retain power, and monies set aside to rehabilitate
the ailing Nigerian Petroleum Refineries and the National Electric Power
Authority which supplies Electricity to the entire nation. If you are
conversant with world news, you would understand better.

During this period,
 my father was able to make some good money for himself and kept in his
private bank accounts. The then Head of State, General Sani Abacha
transferred his share of the money through a Lebanese businessman, Chagoury
and a Jewish businessman, Mark Rissar to bank accounts overseas.
 Unfortunately, all the secrets were revealed by the investigation agencies
set up by the successive governments and most of the Abacha^Rs loots were
traced and repatriated from the various accounts to the Federal Government
Treasury.
Out of the money my father made, he left the sum of N50Million (Fifty
Million Naira) in the CBN escrow account for further transfer into a foreign
account and a sum of $60M (Sixty Million Dollars) was kept in a Private
security firm here in Nigeria.
Through the confessions made by the Abacha^Rs Family, the N50Million was
recovered by the investigating agency from the CBN escrow account. But were
unable to discover the $60M, which he kept in the vaults. The reason is
because no names were used to lodge in the funds.
Instead, he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS (PIN) and declared the
contents as Bearer Bonds and Treasury Bills. Also the firm issued him with a
certificate of deposit of the consignments. Note that I have these
information in my custody.
Right now, my father has been arrested and detained for interrogation. As
the eldest son of my Father, I believe that I owe the entire family an
obligation to ensure that the $60M is successfully transferred abroad for
investment purposes.
With the present situation, I cannot do it all by myself. It is based on
this that I am making this contact with you. I have done a thorough homework
and fine-tuned the best way to create you as the beneficiary to the funds
and effect the transfer accordingly.  It^Rs rest assured that the modalities
I have resolved to finalize the entire project guarantees our safety and the
successful transfer of the funds.  So, you will be absolutely right when you
say that this project is risk free and viable. If you are capable and
willing to assist, contact me at once via email for more details.Believe me,
there is no one else we can trust again. All my fathers^R friends have
deserted us after exploiting us on the pretence of trying to help my father.
As it is said, ^Sit is at the time of problems that you know your true
friends^T.  So long as you keep everything to yourself, we would definitely
have no problems. For your assistance, I am ready to give you as much as 20%
of the total funds aft
er transfer and invest a reasonable percentage into any viable business you
may suggest.

Please, I need your assistance to make this happen and please, do not
undermine the reality because it will also be a source of up liftment to
you.  You have nothing to loose in assisting us instead, you have so much to
gain.Awaiting your urgent and positive response
Best regards,
Mr. Abdul O. Useni.

MR.SAMUEL OPUTE
TEL:+225 077-779-24
ABIDJAN COTE D'IVOIRE
W/AFRICA


I am writing to solicit your assistance in executing a
very profitable and risk free transaction. I got your
contact from my boss file. I have confidence that
you have the ability to execute this business to our
mutual benefit and believe that you will not let down
the trust and confidence I am willing to repose in
you.

I work with an Ivorian based private and investment
firm "a Mic" I work as the corporate affairs manager.
Between the 17th-19th of March, 2001, I attended a
business seminar in Bouaké, Côte d'Ivoire.
While in this seminar, I was lucky to meet Alhaji
DANGOTE, the president of DANGOTE farm ets. Alhaji
DANGOTE is an accomplished agriculturist who
specialise in cattle farms and various other
agricultural product for export. He has farm in
different countries of West Africa. But above all he
is one of the greatest supplier of cattle, beef and
other dairy products in this part of the world. On
getting to know my profession; Alhaji DANGOTE took me
into confidence by informing me about huge amount of
money he spends on the purchase of a particular and
very important medicine for his cattle. He informed me
that he buys this product at the rate of $5,000.00USD
per carton, and that he mostly buy to the excess of 300
cartons. He informed me that he was only asking me to
find out if my organisation could source for him a
cheaper supplier considering the recent trend of falls
in the general price of beef in the world
marketwhichis affecting his business.

Back to my office, I discussed this business proposal
with my boss and he decided to handle the supply by
himself. We carried out a market research and
discovered that we could purchase this 
cattle medicine somewhere cheaper in Holland for $
2,000.00 USD per carton. We moved a proposal to Mac
Dowels to make a supply to him at $ 4,800.00 USD per
carton of which he accepted. Owing to my role in the
whole arrangement; I had an agreement with My boss to
be receiving 15 % of whatever gain is made on each
supply of which he agreed. But on the 21st of may,
2001, when the first supply of 120 cartons were made
to the DANGOTE farms ets, my boss decided to renegade
on our agreement. He refused to give me anything near
the agreement we arrived at but gave me only
what he termed an
offer of appreciation. When I protested, he threatened
to dismiss me from office. I decided to overlook this
betrayal but since then our relationship has seized to
be cordial. He never said anything to me again about
DANGOTE farms ets as I assumed that the business
relationship has stopped between them.

But recently, I intercepted some letters from Alhaji
DANGOTE to my boss. I was shocked to know that he has
made three more supplies to DANGOTE farms
ets.Now,Alhaji is
requesting for supplies of 250 cartons of these
substance following a suspected out break of disease
among his cattle in Mali. He has requested that these
supplies be made before the end of June, 2002.
These
letters have not reached my boss and never will.
Instead I called Alhaji MUSURU DANGOTE and convinced
him that I can arrange for an international supplier
who can supply him at the price of $ 4,400.00 USD per
carton. But that he Alhaji DANGOTE or his
representative will have to go to Holland and inspect
it before lifting the goods. At the moment Alhaji
DANGOTE is waiting for me or my foreign contact as he
has agreed to stop all further dealings with my boss.

If you can handle this project, please contact me
immediately on my direct telephone line +225
077-779-24
or via my e-mail for details on how to go about
it and the negotiation on what is to be my commission.
I am ready to give you Alhaji's contact for your
direct conversation with him on the mode
of payment method.

Note: Alhaji Musuru DANGOTE must not know our
purchasing source in Holland. If not he will not be
needing our services anymore. He will also
payinadvance before we supply him.

Thank you and God bless you.
Yours Sincerely,
Samuel Opute

ABEL McDONALD
Director, Project Implementation
Falomo Office Complex,
Ikoyi-Lagos,



CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL.


Sir,
It is my great pleasure writing you this letter on
behalf of my colleagues and myself. Your particulars
were given to me by a member of the Nigerian Export
Promotion Council (N.E.P.C) who has had extensive
dealings with members of trade organizations in so
many countries. I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal
described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and
hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the
nature of this business.

Within the Ministry of Works & Housing where I work as
a Director, Project Implementation and with the
co-operation of four other top officials, we have in
our possession as overdue payment bills totaling
$25million which we want to transfer
abroad with assistance and co-operation of a foreign
company and/or individual to receive the said fund on
our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account
to receive such fund.

The amount represented some percentage of the total
contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a
foreign contracting firm, which we the officers
over-invoiced. Though the actual contract cost have
been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
balance in the tune of the said amount which we have
in principle got approval to remit by Telegraphic
Transfer (TT) to any foreign bank account you will
provide.

Since the present Government of Nigeria is determined
to pay every foreign contractor, all debts owed as to
maintain good relationship with Foreign Governments
and Non-Government Financial Agencies; we have decided
to include our bills for approvals with the
co-operation of some officials from the Federal
Ministry of Finance (FMF) and the Central Bank of
Nigeria (CBN). We are seeking your assistance in
providing a good company's account or any other
offshore bank account into which we can remit this
money by acting as our main partner and trustee or
acting as the original contractor. This we can do by
swapping of accounts and changing of beneficiary and
other forms of documentation upon application for
claims to reflect the payment and approvals to be
secured on behalf of our company. This process is an
internal arrangement with the departments concerned.


I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that, should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction, your share of the sum will be 15% of
the US$25 Million, 75% for us and 10% for taxation
and miscellaneous expenses.

The business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat
it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your
area of specialization is not a hinderance to the
successful execution of this transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint me.
Thanks for your anticipated co-operation.

Yours Faithfully,
ABEL McDONALD.

Attn. How are you today?please let me introduce myself, I am Engr. Edward
Savimbi. The Younger brother of the Late leader of the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) who was killed by Angolan
Government forces on February 22nd 2002.

I would not want you to use any of the media reports as a yard stick for
measuring your decision on what I am about to ask of you. As most of these
publications have been highly exaggerated and also a lot of people had
very wrong concepts about my late brother. He formed UNITA to fight for
the Independence of the Angolan people and also against bad Governments in
Angola. However, since his death I have received wide spread condemnation
even from family members. This mainly is largely attributed to envy and
jealousy as he was highly attached to me.

I have in my possession two deposits my brother had made both with my
son's name as codes in Europe. One deposit contains some pieces of
diamonds and family documents and the other deposit contains an amount of
US$25.3Million United States Dollars. I intend now, with your help to
collect the deposit with amount which I now intend to use to investments
abroad. I am particularly happy as the deposits were made with codes
relative to my son's names.

All the necessary documents relating to these deposits are securely in my
care. So what I require of you now are: 1, For you to help me contact the
Private Investor through whom these deposits were made for collection. 2,
That you will also assist me in traveling to your country or somewhere
else abroad where I could invest part of this funds. 3, I am willing to
offer you 25% of the total sum for your help of 1 $ 2 above.

I look forward to an early response from you to enable have further
discussions with you. However, if for any reason you do not feel
comfortable with the transaction, please feel free and discontinue.
Thanks, Engr. Edward Savimbi

Albert Conde.
Lagos, Nigeria.
Tel/Fax #: 234 1 7742619.
E-mail: albert.conde@lycos.co.uk
Date: 25th May 2002.



REQUEST FOR AN IMPORT/EXPORT PARTNERSHIP.

Let me commence by first expressing my most sincere apology for infringing
on your privacy as I am an uninvited guest to your address. I got your
e-mail address from an Internet listing, let us immediately put your mind
to rest in that regard.

We are interested in the purchase and importation of certain goods into
our country, with funds, which are presently trapped in this same country,
Nigeria. In order to commence this business and achieve our goal, we need
your assistance in the release of the said trapped funds and ultimately,
your receipt and custody of these funds abroad. But before I proceed any
further, I crave your indulgence and confidence in this communication and
transaction in the long run, this is necessitated by virtue of this
proposal as being utterly confidential and classified.

We are top officials of a major Government parastatal (name withheld) here
in Nigeria, and due to our very membership of this parastatal, we are
privy to the information I am about to vaguely reveal to you in trust and
confidence as obtained in the urgent business relationship we solicit for.
We crave your indulgence for total Confidentiality.


Explicitly, the source of this fund is as follows:

During the regime of our late head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, the then
Military officials set up private companies and lobbied the award of
contracts to their companies, these contract were grossly over-invoiced in
various ministries all in the bid for self-enrichment by these military
men. Fortunately, after the mysterious death of the head of state followed
by the collapse of the military dictatorship, the current civilian
Government set up a body to look into the activities of the past military
regime. We hold exalted designations/positions this recently set up panel
and we have successfully identified several inflated contract funds, which
are presently floating in coded terms and accounts at the Central Bank of
Nigeria.

We desire to release and use for the purpose stated above a particular
contract entitlement from the very several, but due to our position as
civil servants and members of this body, we cannot acquire this fund in
our names and without a much needed foreign assistance. My colleagues have
therefore delegated me as a matter of trust to source for an overseas
partner into whose account the sum of US$31,000,000.00 (Thirty-one Million
United States Dollars), being the contract entitlement of this particular
contract will be transferred into, hence this written request.

Upon the success of this transaction, which is after the receipt of the
fund into your account and the use of the funds for the purchase of the
desired goods, we propose a sharing ratio as thus:

1.  70% for us (the officials)
2.  20% for the foreign partner (you)
3.  4% 	for the reconciliation of all expenses, including taxation and all
foreign costs
incurred by you during the course of the transaction.
4.  6%	for the reconciliation of all local expenses incurred by all parties
involved on the
home front during the course of this transaction.

Please do not have the erroneous impression that the monies are going to
come to you that easily. You will have to earn it as nothing good comes
that easily. As they say, there is no free lunch in America. Your complete
dedication and commitment to the course will be required. Basically, what
we are doing is to use you as a front to get these monies transferred out
of this country.  However, we shall equally require your assistance in
advising us on good investment opportunities in your country as we intend
to invest a substantial part of our share of the funds in your country. We
are poor civil servants (Government workers) who are presented with a
lifetime opportunity to secure our future and those of our immediate
families in particular and the suffering masses in general.

Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and hitch free, devoid of
any form of uncertainty in its entire ramification. We hope that the funds
can arrive your account within ten (10) banking days from the date of our
receipt of some relevant details that I shall intimate you with in my next
correspondence. The required details will enable us write letters of claim
and job description respectively. This way, we will use your already
existing company name or initiate one for you (or as applicable) to
prepare the necessary and solid documentary foundation necessary to re-
award the contract in your company name and prepare an application for
fund release/payments with you as the beneficiary.

Please acknowledge receipt of this letter using either telephone/fax
number already provided above or respond via e-mail, so I can bring you
into the complete picture of this pending project as soon as possible. We
are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your
confidentiality in this transaction.

Yours Faithfully,
Albert Conde.

URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL.

ATTN: Director/C.E.O.
FAX: 27 83 364 7707
TEL: 27 83 42 77 077

I write to solicit for your utmost assistance on a business proposal that
would be of immense benefit to both of us involved. I got your contact
information while making inquiries through a business Trade Journal for
investment purpose in your country.

Permit me to introduce myself. I am Mr. Johnson Savimbi, Personal
Assistant to the Angolan rebel leader Mr. Jonas Savimbi of Unita Rebels in
Angola. I was sent on a diplomatic mission to the Republic of South Africa
to purchase arms and ammunition worth US$12.5 Million (Twelve million,
five hundred thousand United States Dollars) and the money was properly
arranged and delivered to South Africa by a diplomatic itineraries, a
border post monitored by our rebel group.

On my arrival here in South Africa, I had a change of mind and decided to
part ways with all the money under my control, following the facts that I
had realized that we were fighting for the selfish interest of my
brother, the rebel leader Mr. Jonas Savimbi. Moreover, I decided to give
peace a chance to reign for the emancipation of a new era in our country,
Angola.

This money in the diplomatic luggage was deposited in a
security and finance company here in South Africa for safety reasons and
I intend to invest this money in a business that could generate an income
for me, as I am no more in service to anybody.

Furthermore, I am
presently seeking for political asylum here in South Africa, while making
contact to see a way I can move this money to a foreign country where I
could invest, as the country South Africa did not permit any investment
by refugees.

I decided to contact you to stand as a foreign partner
to provide an account where I will lodge this money into as the
beneficiary. If you are interested in helping me with this transfer, I am
offering you 25% of the total money and 70% is for me while 5% will be
for any expenses that could be made in the course of this transaction.

There is no risk involved, as I have made every necessary arrangement
for a successful transfer of this money. Always call me through the phone
before sending me a fax through the number above.

Thanks while expecting your reply.

Best regards,

Johnson Savimbi (Mr.).

    [ Some characters may be displayed incorrectly. ]

It is my pleasure to request your assistance on this business proposal
which if pursued to its conclusion, will be of immense benefit to both of
us.

This request may seem strange but I will crave your indulgence and pray
that you view it seriously. My name is COL. THOMAS IDAH of the Democratic
Republic of Congo and one of the close aides to the former President of
the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his
soul rest in peace. Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to
force out the rebels in my country, I was instructed by Late President
Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of THIRTY
Million United States Dollars only (US$30,000,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shootout by one of
his aide a day before I was schedule to travel out of Congo, I immediately
decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo
for safe keeping.The security of the said amount is presently being
threatened here following the unwanranted arrest and seizure of properties
of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (The aide that shot Laurent Kabila) tribesmen
,where I am from,by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo
the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila.

In view of this,I need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can
assist me to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. I have
sufficient ''contacts'' to move the fund under Diplomatic cover to a
security company in the Netherlands in your name, this is to ensure that
the diplomatic baggage is marked ''confidential''and it wil not pass
through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. My inability to
move this money out of Congo all this while lies on my lack of trust on
our supposed good friends (western countries) who have suddenly become
hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Laurent Kabila,
since his son took over office. Though we have neither seen nor met each
other, I know we will be able to establish all the trust that we need to
ensure that the money will be safe with you. Thus, if you are willing to
assist me to move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my
email address with your telephone and fax numbers to enable us discuss the
modalities and what will be your share (percentage)for assisting me. I
will highly appreciate it if my request is given utmost priority and
consideration.

Best Regards,

COL. THOMAS IDAH (RTD) .

WITH CONTRACT AWARDS AND APPROVAL. WITH OUR POSITIONS,
WE HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SECURED FOR OURSELVES THE SUM OF

THIS FUND (US$55.5M) INTO A SAFE ACCOUNT. IT HAS BEEN
AGREED THAT THE OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT WILL BE
COMPENSATED WITH 30% OF THE REMITTED FUNDS, WHILE WE
KEEP 60% AS THE INITIATORS AND 10% WILL BE SET ASIDE
TO OFFSET EXPENSES AND PAY THE NECESSARY TAXES.WE
INTEND TO USE PART OF OUR OWN SHARE TO IMPORT FROM
YOUR COUNTRY AGRICULTURAL AND CONSTRUCTION MACHINERY.
THIS IS BECAUSE THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT OF MY COUNTRY
IS EMPHASISING ON PROVIDING FOOD AND HOUSING FOR ALL
ITS CITIZENS BEFORE THE NEXT ELECTION. HENCE,
AGRICULTURAL AND CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT ARE IN HIGH
DEMAND OVER HERE. WE SHALL ALSO NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE
IN THIS REGARD ON A COMMISSION TO BE AGREED UPON WHEN
WE FINALLY MEET.

WORKED OUT AND ONCE STARTED WILL NOT TAKE MORE THAN
SEVEN (7) WORKING DAYS, WITH YOUR FULL SUPPORT. THIS
TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE.

MOREOVER, WE SHALL NEED THE FOLLOWING FROM YOU TO ENABLE
US BEGIN THE TRANSACTION FORMALLY. THIS INFORMATION WILL
BE USED ALONGSIDE OTHER VITAL DOCUMENTS OVER HERE IN
PREPARING THE NECESSARY APPLICATION FOR PAYMENT TO THE
CONCERNED QUARTERS WHERE PAYMENT APPROVALS WOULD BE
SECURED IN FAVOUR OF YOUR COMPANY FOR THE PAYMENT OF OUR
FUND(US$55.5M) INTO YOUR NOMINATED ACCOUNT FOR US ALL.

BY OUR APPLICATION, IT WILL BE ASSUMED THAT THIS SUM IS
BEING REQUESTED AS PAYMENT, WHICH IS LONG-OUTSTANDING,
FOR A CONTRACT, WE SHALL CLAIM WITH OUR POSITION, YOU OR
YOUR COMPANY EXECUTED FOR (NNPC) SOMETIME IN 1997. HENCE,
WE SHALL FOLLOW ALL THE LEGAL OFFICIAL PROTOCOLS USUALLY
OBSERVED BY FOREIGN CONTRACTORS WHENEVER THEY ARE DEMANDING
PAYMENT FOR CONTRACTS EXECUTED FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF MY COUNTRY.

FURTHERMORE, IMMEDIATELY THE FINAL APPROVAL IS GRANTED, THE FUND WILL BE

ABSOLUTE CONTROL OVER. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE WOULD NOT WANT A
SITUATION WHEN THE MONEY IS IN THE ACCOUNT, YOU NOW TELL US YOU WOULD NEED
TO BE AUTHORISED BY ANOTHER PERSON BEFORE WE CAN HAVE OUR OWN SHARE.

YOU WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO TRAVEL OUT OF YOUR COUNTRY, ME AND MY
PARTNERS, WE TRAVEL DOWN TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR THE DISBURSEMENT OF THE FUND,
AFTER THE THE FINAL TRANSACTION. WE WILL ALSO DISCUSS ABOUT OIL BUSINEES
IN MY COUNTRY WHEN WE COME DOWN OVER THERE. BECAUSE WE WOULD LIKE TO

Dear Sir/Madam


SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. 

Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This
is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy
foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I will
crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL.
FRANK LANGA of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides
to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA
of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. 

Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in
my country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President
Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only
(US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. We were then given this money
privately by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of
other Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody
shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out
of Congo, We immediately decided to put the funds into a private security
company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is
presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of
properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila)
a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the
new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late
President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 

In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who
can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. 
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic
Cover to a security company in Europe in your name. This is to ensure that
the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it 
will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. 

Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while lies on our
lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who
suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President
Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen
nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has
worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your
sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state
fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. 

We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this
fund in Europe. This is because we are under restricted movement and watch
and hence we want to be very carefull in other not to lose this fund which
we have worked so hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us move
this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address,
Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal
information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your
share (percentage) for assisting us.

Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as every ones
Security is Gurranteed as far as we follow the required guidlines. I will
hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as soon as I am
assured of your Sincere interest to assist us. 

I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the
utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential,
Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and
God Bless. 
Best Regards 


COL. KENNETH ABELANGE (RTD). kenlanga2000@yahoo.com

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

I am KINGSLEY ODOMS, Bank manager of Globaltrust Bank
Nigeria Ltd, Abuja, Nigeria; and for
reasons which will become obvious to you as read on,
Please exercise some patience and
read through my message.

I have very urgent and confidential business
proposition for you. On June 6th 1997, an Oil
Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Ahmed Youseff Mustafa , a
national of Iraq, made a numbered time ( fixed)deposit
for 12 calendar months, value USD30,000,000.00in my
branch.On maturity, we sent a routine notification to
his forwarding address but got no reply. After a
month, we sent a reminder and finally, his contract
employers,the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
( NNPC)wrote to inform us that Mr. A Y Mustafa died
from an automobile accident; that he died without
making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of
kin through the Iraqi embassy were fruitless. At first
I was surprised that I did not receive much official
cooperation in my inquiries in order to trace his kin
in Iraq, and inform them about Mr. Mustafa^Òs deposit
of USD30m plus accrued interest.I therefore made
further investigation and discovered that Mr. Mustafa
had actively opposed the Government of President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and was consequently driven
into exile. Being an Oil Expert,he subsequently
obtained a job with the NNPC, and settled in Nigeria.
Thereafter, he walked into my Office to make the
aforementioned deposit of USD30m.He did not declare
any kin in his application paperwork, and when I asked
him he informed me that he wished it so. I accepted
his application because banks are conservative and
will always honor a customer^Òs wishes, especially high
net worth customers.No one knows the source of his
money because apparently the time frame of his
employment with the NNPC does indeed preclude such a
large amount of money. It can be assumed that he
brought his money over from Iraq, but that is open to
speculation. However, the point is that his employers
are not aware of this money , and therefore it can be
safely assumed that no one will ever come forward to
claim this money. This money total USD31.5m (
inclusive of accrued interests) is still sitting in my
Bank in the Dormant Account Portfolio. No one will
ever come forward to claim it, and according to
Nigerian law,after 5 years, the money will
automatically revert to the Federal Government
Treasury if the Account owner is a foreigner, is
certified dead , and there is no valid claim. This
indeed, is the situation.

My proposal therefore is that I am looking for a
foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to
Mr.Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood relation
to Mr. Mustafa, nor have the same name. It is not also
necessary to come from the same Country. I have worked
out the modalities to achieve my aim of appointing a
next of kin, and therefore also by this means transfer
this money total USD31.5m abroad for us to share.The
method of achieving the objective of transferring this
money abroad in a completely legal and proper way is
simple. I intend to use a n Attorney ( representing
you as BENEFICIARY) to execute a series of affidavits
in support of your claim. These will be approved. The
money transfer paperwork itself will include a
certificate of origin so that the receiving bank does
not ask questions or refuse the money as money
laundering. Also, the paperwork will include proper
certification that the funds being transferred are
from non criminal sources. In short this will be a
proper and legal money transfer and there is no risk!I
will have to process the initial paperwork to obtain
approval from the Probate Registry ( Ministry of
Justice ) to obtain the Letter of Administration
empowering you as Sole trustee/executor to the Estate
of Mr. Mustafa. If you therefore agree to be the
official Beneficiary, then please note that you will
not be required to sign any Money Transfer Documents (
my Attorney will do all that), you will not be
required to come to Nigeria.Only the following is
required from you:

(1) Send to me immediately A bank account ( a bank
account with zero credit balance is ok)
(2) Complete name and address of the Bank
(3) Bank Account Number
(4) Name of Account Holder/Beneficiary
(5) Your address, phone and fax Once you send me the
requested information as above,I will initiate the
processing of the transfer and in about 14 working
days
the money total USD31.5m will be in your nominated
bank account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for
me and 20% for you, while 10% is set aside for any
expenes incur during the transcation.This transaction
is guaranteed to
succeed without any problems. If you agree to assist
me by sending me the above requested information, I
will give you my complete address, including phone/
fax etc and any further clarifications you may
require.Looking forward to your urgent reply.

Yours truly,

KINGSLEY ODOMS.

DEAR FRIEND,

I am the first son of the late Mobutu Sese Seko, the
former President of the Zaire. I am presently
under protective custody in Nigeria as a political
refugee. I got your contact during
my search for a stranger that can cooperate with me in
this mutual transaction. I want you to note that this
business will
benefit both of us. However, you must confirm your
ability to handle this because it involves a large
amount of money. The money (47 million US DOLLARS is
my
share of my father's estate). I boxed and shipped the
money to a security company IN Europe at the peak of the
war/political crisis that rocked my country few years
ago. Now the crisis has abated i am looking for a 
person like you to proceed to the place of the
security company in order to clear the fund and invest
on my behalf as I dont want my name to be used for
now as i realise very much the type of hatred late 
kabila the former head of state has for my late father
and even his son who is now the head of state.
Note that I will send to you the relevant documents
that will enable you take possesion of the the fund
for onward investment for our mutual benefit. All I
need from you is as follows:
1. A  committment that you
will keep the transaction strictly confidential.
2. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this.
3. Your telephone and fax numbers including
mobile for easy communication.
4. Your full permanent address.
As soon as I get the above information from you, I
will disclose to you the name and the country of the
security company so that you can make arrangements
to travel and collect the luggages.Note that this is
a very safe transaction as
this money is my share of my father's estate.
I am waiting for your response via email:msekou1@qrio.com to enable
us proceed.

Regards.

SEKOU MOSHOOD.

currently floating in our Apex Bank. At this moment we have worked out
modalities within ourselves to transfer the sum of US$ 8,500,000,00 (Eight
Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) only, for our
personal use.

ATTN:  


REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP. 

It is with my profound dignity that I write you this very important and
highly confidential letter. First, I must solicit your strictest
confidentiality in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature as
being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and "TOP SECRET". Though I know that a
transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and
worried,considering the fact that we have not met each other before, but I
am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. We have
decided to contact you by email due to the urgency of this transaction, as
we have been reliably informed that it will take at least a minimum of two
to three weeks for a normal post to reach you, so we decided it is best
using the e-mail,which is quicker and also to enable us meet up with the
second quater payment for the year 2000.

However, let me start by introducing myself properly to you. I am Dr.Peter
Ego, a Director General in the Department Of Petroleum Resources(D.P.R)
and I presently head The Contract Award Panel incharge of Contract Awards
and Payment Approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable
and reputable person to handle a very confidential business transaction
which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account
requiring maximum CONFIDENCE. I and my colleagues are Top Officials of the
Federal Government Contract Award Panel. Our duties include Evaluation,
Vetting, Approval for payment of Contract jobs done for the D.P.R e.t.c.
In order to commence this business we solicit for your assistance to
enable us transfer into your Account the said funds. The source of this
funds is as follows: In the second quarter of 2001 this committee was
mandated to review and award contracts to the tune of US$400 million US
dollars to a group of five firms for the supply construction and
installation of Oil Pipe lines in Warri and Port Harcourt. During this
process my colleagues and I decided and agreed among ourselves to
deliberately over-inflate the total contract sum from US$400 million to
US$431 million United States dollars with the main intention of sharing
the remaining sum of US$31 miilion amongst ourselves.

The Federal Government of Nigeria has since the second quater of year 2001
approved the sum of US$431 million for us as the contract sum, and the sum
of US$400 million has also been paid to the foreign companies concerned as
contract entitlements for the various contracts done, but since the
companies are entiltled to US$400 million dollars only, we are now left
with US$31 million dollars balance in the account which we intend to
disburse amongst ourselves, but by virtue of our positions as civil
servants and members of this panel, we cannot do this by ourselves, as we
are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from
opening and/or operating foreign accounts in our names while still in
Government service, making it impossible for us to acquire the money in
our names right now. I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust
and urgency by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner
into whose account we would transfer the sum of US$31 million. Hence we
are writing you this letter. My Colleagues and I have agreed that if you
or your company can act as the beneficiary of this funds on our behalf,
you or your Company will retain 20% of the total amount (US$31 million),
while 70% will be for us(OFFICIALS) and the remaining 10% will be used in
offsetting all debts/expenses and Taxes incurred both local and foreign in
the cause of this transfer. Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at
this juncture is enormous. In return we demand your complete honesty and
trust.

You must however NOTE that this transaction will be strictly based on the
following terms and conditions as we have stated below;  a) Our conviction
of your transparent honesty and diligence b) That you would treat this
transaction with utmost secrecy and confidentiality c) That you will not
ask for more share or try to sit on the funds once it is under your
custody, or any form of blackmail.  d) That upon receipt of the funds you
will release the funds as instructed by us after you have removed your
share of 20% from the total amount.  Please, note that this transaction is
100% legal and risk free and we hope to conclude this transaction seven to
fourteen bank working days from the date of receipt of the necessary
requirements from you . We are looking forward to doing business with you
and solicit your Total Confidentiality in this transaction. There is no
cause for alarm. I give you my word that you are completely safe in doing
business with us. Transactions like this have been successfully carried
out in the past by most Government executives. Here in my country there is
great economic and political disarray and thus looting and corruption is
rampant and the order of the day, thus explaining why you might have heard
stories of how money is been taken out of Nigeria, this is because
everyone is making desperate attempts to secure his or her future, so that
when we retire from active service we donot languish in poverty. I will
explain more to you when I have heard from you.

Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the above e-mail
address.  I will bring you into the complete picture of this pending
business transaction when I have heard from you and also receive your
confidential telephone and fax numbers to enable me fax to you all
necessary information you need to know about our pending business
transaction. I will also send to you my private telephone and fax numbers
where you can always reach me. Your urgent response will be highly
appreciated to enable us transfer the funds under the second quarter of
the year 2002. Thank you and God Bless.

 ATTENTION: PRESIDENT/CEO
 Dear Sir,

 REQUEST FOR YOUR UNRESERVED ASSISTANCE Firstly, I must solicit your
confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being
utterly confidential and top secret. Though I know that a transaction of
this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. We have decided
to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been
reliably informed of it's swiftness and confidentiality.

 Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am DR. BAYOLA
BULE, a Manager at the Union Bank Nigeria PLC, Lagos. I came to know of
you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a
very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum
of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence. A foreigner,
Late Engineer William Adams, an oil Merchant /contractor with the federal
Government of Nigeria, until his death three years ago in a ghastly air
crash, banked with us here at the Union Bank PLC ,Lagos, and had a closing
balance of USD$22.2M (Twenty-Two Million, Two Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars) which the bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by
any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a
discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war collage
here in Nigeria.

 Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch
with any of late Engr. William Adams's next of kin (he had no known wife
and children) that the management under the influence of our chairman,
board of directors, Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that an
arrangement for the fund to be declared "UNCLIAMABLE " and then be
subsequently donated to the trust fund for Arms and Ammunition, which will
further enhance the course of war in Africa and the world in general. In
order to avert this negative development, myself and some of my trusted
colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission to have you stand as
late Engr.WILLIAMS ADAMSs next of kin so that the fund, USD$22.2M, would
be subsequently transferred and paid into your bank account as the
beneficiary next of kin. All documents and proves to enable you get this
fund have been carefully worked out and we are assuring you a 100% risk
free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount. 10% has
been set aside for expenses, while the rest would be for myself and my
colleagues for purposes in your country.

If this proposal is OK by you and you do not wish to take advantage of the
trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly get to me
immediately via my e-mail address furnishing me with your most
confidential telephone, fax and e-mail, so that I can forward to you the
relevant details of this transaction. Thank you in advance for your
anticipated co-operation.  Regards.

 DR. BAYOLA BULE 
(MANAGER UNION BANK OF NIGERIA PLC).

BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER
BANQUE INTERNATIONAL POUR L'AFRIQUE AU TOGO (BIAO)
13 RUE DE COMMERCE LOME TOGO WEST AFRICA
TEL:00228.9103274


Dear 

I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department
of Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique au Togo (BIA-Togo)I am writing
following the impressive information about you during my chat conversation
with you. my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 18.5m US
dollars (eighteen million, five hundred thousand US dollars) . In an
account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with
his entire family in November 1997 in a plane crash. Since we got
information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to
come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody
applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in
our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed
next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving
nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I
and other officials in my department now decided to make this business
proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or
relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since
nobody is coming for it and we don^Òt want this money to go into the Bank
treasury as unclaimed Bill. The Banking law and guideline here stipulates
that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be
transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by
the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Togo leis cannot stand as
next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for
expenses incurred during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my
colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for
disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of
the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your
private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and
location where in the money will be remitted .

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of
fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer .

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.
Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Yours faithfully,

Dr Hassan Musa.
Bill and exchange manager,
Banque Internationale pour l'Afrique au Togo (BIA-Togo)

THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT WANT MY IDENTITY REVEALED.
I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN 
MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND

Dear Sir,
I am Mr.Eduado De Mello, one of the Principal
Commanders of the Union for the Total Independence of
Angola,UNITA.Well needless telling a very long story
here for our story is indeed interwoven with the
history of the world and the liberation struggle in
the Southern African region of the African continent.

The bubble burst just a couple of weeks ago today when
my supreme commander, the late Dr.Jonas Savimbi was killed in an
encounter with the government forces of the MPLA
government of my country.The rest is now history but
suffice it to say that I am tired of the unfortunate
role of waging a war against my fatherland.

I have
therefore decided to pull out my troops from the bush
even if the other field commanders decide otherwise am
therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life
and I have decided to make South Africa my new home at
least for the interim period until I am sufficiently
sure that I would be welcome home whole heartedly by
the MPLA government in Luanda the capital of Angola.
Needles to say I was the single most important
commander who was very close to the late supreme
commander; Dr.Jonas Savimbi.Indeed because I am a
brother to one of his wives,he confided in me a great
deal.

The result of such trust is my reason for
contacting you I was the commander whom he sent to
deposit the sum of Thirty two million USD ($32million)
with a security/finance company in South Africa.This
was immediately after the events of September 11,2001
in the United States of America.Indeed it had become
increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money
around the world particularly for a liberation
movement like UNITA hence the recourse to keeping the
money with the security company in South Africa.


I have decided to inherit this money which was taken out
and deposited with the said security/finance company
as cash in Hundred dollar denominations.The money is
kept in my signature and would have been used in the
purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of
continuing the civil war in Angola.The supreme
commander is dead and as already stated I have decided
to quite the whole thing and this is without regard to
the fact that other commanders may wish to continue !

I want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit
the $32million.I am still in the bush here but I have
been able to establish contact with the company in
South Africa to the effect that I would soon come to
take possession of the money that I kept with them.
Note also that I deposited the money as a foreign
national who is the head of a Mining company in Angola
(Never as a commander of UNITA).

If you are able to cooperate with me over this am willing to give you
20%
of the $32million.Please come back to me through
email: eduadomello@mail-senders.net.The security/finance
company is standing by to receive my instructions on
this and I will link you up with them as soon as you
are ready to take possession of the $32million.
Finally you are to note that in you reply, you are to
state your residential or company address and if
possible send a copy of your international passport so
as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands.
Yours truly,
Eduado de Mello

 PrivateAddress: dragujulius@presidency.com or dragujulius@myself.com 
 
 ATTN.: THE MANAGING DIRECTOR / C. E. O. 
 
 REQUEST FOR URGENT (CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP 
 OF THE TRANSFER OF US$45,560,000.00 (FORTY FIVE 
 MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND UNITED STATES 
 DOLLARS ONLY). 
 
 I hope this letter will not embarrass you since we 
 have not had any previous communication. I got your 
 reference from your country's trade department under private enquiry that 
 is not related to my aim of writing you this letter and went further to 
 have it confirmed by the Nigeria Exports Promotion Council(NEPC). 
 
 I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different 
 Federal Government of Nigeria owned parastatals 
 decided to solicit your assistance as regards the 
 transfer of the above stated amount into your bank 
 account. This fund arose from the over-invoicing of 
 various contracts awarded in my parastatals to certain 
 foreign contractors some time ago. 
 
 We as holders of official positions in various 
 parastatals, were mandated by this new civilian 
 government to scrutinize all payments made to certain 
 foreign contractors by the past Military Government 
 and we discovered that some of the contracts they 
 executed were grossly over-invoiced, either by 
 omission or commission. Also we discovered that the 
 sum of $65,560,000.00 (Sixty-Five Million, Five 
 Hundred and Sixty Thousand United States Dollars Only) 
 was lying in a suspense account, although the foreign 
 contractors were fully paid their entitlements after 
 executing the said contracts. We all agreed that the 
 over-invoiced amount be transferred (for our own use) 
 into a bank account provided by a foreign partner, as 
 the code of conduct of the Federal Civil Service does 
 not allow us to operate foreign accounts. 
 
 However, we have succeeded in transferring some of 
 these money, precisely US$20,000,000.00 (Twenty 
 Million United States Dollars Only) into a foreign 
 account in GENEVA (SWITZERLAND). But 
 unfortunately, the provider of the account has severed 
 all forms of contacts with us as he has refused to 
 adhere to our earlier mutual agreement insisting that 
 the total amount be paid into his nominated bank 
 account before disbursement will take effect. If for 
 US$20M (Twenty Million United States Dollars Only) we 
 are not compensated, how can one guarantee full 
 compensation on remittance of the balance of 
 US$45.560M (Forty-Five Million, Five Hundred and Sixty 
 Thousand United States Dollars Only). 
 
 We are therefore seeking your assistance based on the 
 balance amount of US$45.560M, which can be speedily 
 processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank 
 account. On successful remittance of the fund into 
 your account, you will be compensated with 25% of the 
 amount for assistance and services and 5% set aside 
 for expenses contingency. 
 
 This transaction is closely knitted and in view of our 
 SENSITIVE POSITION we cannot afford a slip, I assure 
 you that this transaction is 100% risk free. We will 
 avail you with our identities as regards our 
 respective offices, when relationship is fully 
 established and smooth operation commences. I am at 
 your disposition to entertain any question(s) from you 
 in respect of this transaction, so contact me 
 immediately through the above private email addresses( presidency &
myself) 
 and fax number for 
 further information on the requirements and procedure. Please note that 
 the DEAL needs utmost confidentiality and your immediate response will be 
 highly appreciated and we will use our own share of the money to establish 
 a lucrative business in your country. 
 Please you should contact me immediately with your 
 private fax and telephone numbers where further 
 details in respect to this transaction would be sent 
 to.Please you can also reply me through my dr_agujulius@justice.com. 
 Yours truly, 
 
 DR AGU JULIUS

expertise to enable us recieve the said trapped funds abroad, for the

ministries. The new civilian government now setup a contract review panel
which i and my colleagues are members and we have identified a lot of
inflated sum, due to our position as civil servants and members of this
panel, we cannot aquire this money in our names. I have therefore, been
delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of the panel to look for
an oversea partner into whose account the sum of us$31,000 000,00
(thirty-one million united states dollars) will be Paid by telegraphic
transfer. Hence we are writting you this letter.
 
We have agreed to share the money thus:
 1.  70% for us (the officials)
 2.  20% for the foreign patner(you)
 3.  10% to be used in settling taxation and local and
Foreign expenses.
 
It is this 70% that we wish to commence the importation business and the
investment abroad. Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and we
hope that the funds can arrive your account in latest ten(10) banking days
from the date of reciept of the following information .A suitable company
name and bank account(company or personel) into which the funds can be
paid.
  
The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job
description respectively. This way we will use your company's name to
apply for payments and re-award the contract to your company name.
  
We are looking foward to doing business with you and solicit your
confidentiality in this transaction.

Dear Friend,

This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not
yet met. The message could be strange but reel if you pay some attention
to it. I could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your
integrity. Please accept my sincere apologies.  In bringing this message
of goodwill to you, I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you
any pains.

I am Ms. Nnengi savimbi, daughter of the late rebel leader Jonas savimbi
of Angola who was killed on the 22nd of febuary 2002 . I managed to get
your contact details through "The World Business Journal", a journal of
the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce in South Africa in the time I was
desperately looking for a trustworthy person to assist me in this
confidential business.

my late father, Jonas savimbi was able to deposit a large sum of money in
differnt banks in europe My father is presently death and the movement of
his family members (including me) is restricted. We are forbidden to
either travel abroad or out of our localities. Presently, the
US$8,500,000.00 EIGHT MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS my father
transfered to Netherlands is safe and is in a security firm. Before you
can get access to it i have to give you the password I am therefore
soliciting your help to have this money transfered into your account.
before my government get wind of this fund .You know my father was a rebel
leader in Angola before his death My reason for doing this is because it
will be difficult for the Angolan government to trace my father's money to
an individual's account, especially when such an individual has no
relationship ,I decided to keep that money for my family use. At present
the money is kept in a Security Company in nertherland.

I am currently and temporarily living in Angola with my husband my brother
has a refugee status'in The Netherlands. Moreover the political climate in
Angola at the moment being so sensitive and unstable.With this password
and information I will send to you, and power of attorney to the security
firm, When you are ready i will give you the information needed before you
can get access to the fund you will then proceed to Netherlands where the
US$8,500,000.00 EIGHT, MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS will be
given to you as payment. Alternatively, you can have the fund transferred
into any account that suits you.

Yours sincerely,

Sandra Savimbi.

Subject: URGENT FOR INVESTMENT

From the Desk of MR IBRAHIM ALI 
NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION
LAGOS  NIGERIA.


ATTN: MANAGING DIRECTOR(CEO) .   


Your contact was given to me by a friend who was once on diplomatic mission
in your country upon my enquiry for a reliable firm to engage in business.
The same guaranteed your reliability and trust-worthiness in business
matters. I therefore wish to explain this lucrative business intention
for our mutual benefit, though I did not let that friend have the real
idea of my intended business proposal due to the level of confidentiality
which the transaction demands.

I am chief accountant with ^ÓNigerian National Petroleum Corporation^Ô
(NNPC) headquarters in Lagos- Nigeria. I am in a position to remit the
sum of $30,000,000.00 (THIRTY MILLION POINT ZERO ZERO UNITED STATES DOLLARS
ONLY) into a reliable foreign account for our personal use.

This sum of $30,000,000.00 originated from a deliberate over-invoice
(in the contract payment voucher) of total value of contracts awarded
to some foreign contractors for the supply and erection of petrochemical
and pipeline equipment to ^ÓNNPC^Ô refinery, Finnima, in Rivers State of
Nigeria in 1994. With the view that as son as the bonafide contractors
receive their full contract payments, we claim the balance for our personal
use. The contractors who executed the relative contracts have since been
paid their full contract sums leaving the $30.Million floating in the
federated account of ^ÓNNPC^Ô with the Central Bank of Nigeria, secured
as credit/payment to a foreign contractor. It is therefore due for us
to claim this balance sum as final phase payment to a foreign contractor
but we cannot accomplish this without collaborating with a foreign firm
into whose account this sum will be transferred as the beneficiary of
the fund. Moreover, as civil servants, we are not allowed to operate
foreign accounts. It is to this effect that I have been mandated to
communicate
you for maximum assistance/co-operation.

For your understanding, we (partners here) have solidified and perfected
arrangements to push out this fund legitimately on  legal grounds in
such a way that no risk of partners on either sides is involved. We have
made careful and necessary arrangements for the smooth transfer of the
fund to your account as would be provided. 

For your assistance, we have agreed to compensate you with 25% of the
whole sum to be transferred to your account and 5% set aside to replenish
expenses incurred in the process of the transaction while 70% comes to
the officials on my side.

Let me know immediately, your interest and willingness to enable me furnish
you with the modus operandi of the business.

Please send your reply through this e-mail address for more informations.
THIS IS MY ALTERNATIVE EMAIL ADDRESS ibej@avu.org

Yours Faithfully,
IBRAHIM ALI

HE CARES FOR THOSE WHO TRUST IN HIM
FROM: MRS. ROSE SANKOH
E-MAIL: rosesankoh2@mail.co.za


Dearest,

I want to confide in you knowing that you are in the vineyard of God and
you may not have the mind to do otherwise when it finally materialise.

With due respect and humility I write you this letter with the belief that
you would be very much obliged to assist us. Since we have no place or
person to turn to for assistance,I feel it is very necessary to bring to
your notice, the problem we are going through,now,I am very optimistic
that you owe a moral obligation to look into our plight and come to our
rescue, thus my writing to you.

I am MRS. ROSE SANKOH, the Wife of the late DR.FREDRICK SANKOH of the
blessed memory. Prior to my husband's assasination by the Rebel forces
loyal to Major John Paul Koromah, he was the Director General, National
Gold and Diamond Mining Corporation in Sierra Leone.

Two days before my husband was assasinated,he instructed me and my
children (Mr. Justin and Evelyn Sankoh) to move out of Sierra Leone
immediately before the powerful Ecowas Mobilization Group (ECOMOG) forces
intervened which eventually resulted into a brutal civil war. I and my
children managed to escape to Johannesburg the Republic of South AFrica by
ship through the help of my husband's friend who is a trawler. We came to
Johannesburg with some valuables including a cash sum of $18.3m (EIGHTEEN
MILLION, THREE HUNDREND THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in boxes
which I deposited with a Security company here in Johannesburg , with my
first son's name (Justin Sankoh).

For your information, we did not disclose the real contents of the boxes
to the Security Company and we do not wish them to know this under any
circumstances.Rather, we deposited the boxes as containing family
valuables.

Meanwhile, I want to leave Johannesburg entirely with this money for
investments in your country because of the unstable political situation in
my country and mostly for the future of my children.

I want you to please assist us in claiming these boxes from the Security
Company, deposited the funds in a local account here in your name and
order the Bank to transfer the funds to your country.You should also
source for good investments opportunity so that we can invest wisely in
your country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.

We have in mind to reward you handsomely for your assistance with at least
20% of the total sum. If there should be any incidental expenses on your
side,an amount not exceeding 5%would be given to you an additional
reward.Please as soon as I hear from you, I will forward my son's
temporary telephone number in Johannesburg for you to speak with him
immediately to enable us proceed in earnest towards retrieving the boxes
and transferring of the funds into your account.There is no risk in this
transaction since we are the bonafide owners of the valuables.

Please ensure that no one else knows about this money;it is only myself,
my son and you that knows about it.

May God bless you as you assist us.

Yours sincerely,

MRS. ROSE SANKOH

 AUDITING AND ACCOUNT UNIT.
  FORIEGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
  UNION TOGOLAISE DU BANQUE
  LOME-TOGO.IN WEST AFRICA.
 
    Attn,
 
  I am Mr.Alex princewill. the director in charge of
 auditing and account section of Union Togolaise Du
 Banque Lome-Togo with due respect and regard.
 
 I have decided to contact you on a business
 transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us
 at the end of the transaction . 
 During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my
 department came across a very huge sum of money
 belonging to a deceased person who died on november
 1997 in a plane crash and the fund has been dormant in
 his account with this Bank without any claim of the
 fund in our custody either from his family or relation
 before our discovery to this development. Although
 personally, I keep this information secret within
 myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea
 Profitable and successful during the time of
 execution.
 The said amount was us$15M (fifteen million united
 states dollars).
 
 As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive
 information through my good friends who works with
 chamber of commerce on foreign business relations here
 in Lome- Togo. It is him who recommended your person
 to me to be viable and capable to champion a business
 of such magnitude without any problem.
 
 Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over
 this fund as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased,
 get the required approval and transfer this money to a
 foreign account has been put in place and directives
 and needed information will be relayed to you as soon
 as you indicate your interest and willingness to
 assist us and also benefit your self to this great
 business opportunity.
 
 In fact I could have done this deal alone but because
 of my position in this country as a civil servant, we
 are not allowed to operate a foreign account and would
 eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the
 time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is
 the actual reason why it will require a second party
 or fellow who will forward claims as the next of kin
 with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also
 present a foreign account where he will need the money
 to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be
 after due verification and clarification by the
 correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money
 will be remitted from to your own designation bank
 account.
 
 I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is
 100% risk free.
 On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be
 entitled to 25% of the total sum as gratification,
 while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses
 that may arise during the time of transfer and also
 telephone bills, while 70% will be for me and my
 partners. Please, you have been adviced to keep top
 secret as we are still in service and intend to retire
 from service after we conclude this deal with you. I
 will be monitoring the whole situation here in this
 bank until you confirm the money in your account. and
 ask us to come down to your country for subsequent
 sharing of the fund according to percentages
 previously indicated and further investment, either in
 your country or any country you may advice us to
 invest in.  
 
 All other necessary information will be sent to you
 when I hear from you. 
 I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible
 stating your wish in this deal. 
 
 Yours faithfully,
 Mr.Alex princewill

ENUGU STATE
NIGERIA, WEST AFRICA.

Dear Sir,

I am, the Bank Manager of African continental Bank in Nigeria (ACB). There
is an account opened in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 no body has
operated on this account again. After going through some old file in the
records I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it
will be fortified for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr., Smith B.
Andreas, a foreigner and a miner at kruger Gold Co, a geologist by
profession and he died since 1990. No other person knows about this
account or anything concerning it. The account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know
anything about this account and the amount involved is (USD 36m) Thirty
Six Million United States Dollars.

I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can only be
claimed by a foreigner, I know that this message will come to you as
a surprise as we don't know ourselves before, we will sign agreement,
but be sure that everything concerning this deal is real and nothing
to fear about. With believe in God that you will never let me down in
this business because you are the only person I have contacted in this
business.

I need your full cooperation to make this work fine. Because the
management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has
correct information of this account which I will give to you later, if you
are able and with the capability to handle such amount in strict
confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice because this
opportunity will never come again in my life. With my position in the
office. I will use my position to influence and affect legal approvals and
onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance
from the ministries and foreign exchange department.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 30% of the total
amount, 65% will be for me while 5% will be for the expenses both parties
might have incurred during the process of transfer. I look forward to your
earliest reply through my e-mail address.

to sign a binding
agreement that will  bind us together  before
transferring the money to any account of  your choice
where the fund will be safe. Before we fly to your

Subject: urgent assistance needed.

Dear friend,

I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu
Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this
letter. This was in confidence considering my present
circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my
husband and two of our sons Benson and Basher out of
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Cote
d'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later
moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later
died of cancer disease.

However, due to this situation we decided to change
most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in
Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of
money coded for safe purpose because the new head of
state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement
with the Swiss government and other European countries
to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in
some european countries. Hence, my children and I
decided laying low in Africa to study the situation
till when things gets better. Like now that
president Kabila is dead and the son taking over
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in
Southern France was confiscated by the french
government, and as such I had to change my identity so
that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.

I have deposited the sum Thirty Million United State
Dollars (US$30,000,000,00.) With a security company
for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate
your interest that you can assist us in receiving the
money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my
son (JAMSE) who has the out modalities for the claim
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing
this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.
I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in
other safe and non-speculative investments as advise
by your good self.

May I at this point emphasize the high level of
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,
and hope you will not betray the trust and
confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if
you want to assist us, my son (JAMES) shall divulge
to
you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where
the funds are currently being maintained and also
discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason
kindly furnish us your contact information,that is
your personal telephone and fax number for validation
purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the
above email address.

Yours sincerely,

Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.

Dear,

I am Marcey Monte,wife of the late chief Abbey
Monte, the former chief justice of Gabon. Proposing a
mutual business relationships. We (I and my
son)currently have within our reach the sum of
Fifteen  Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars (US$15.5M) cash which we agreed to use for
investment purpose specifically in your country or your country of
choice.

This money came as a result of a pay back contract
deal between my Husband and a Chinese firm on our
country's Multi Billion Railway Construction Scheme
and the Chinese partners returned my husbands share
after his death and lodged it with our finance firm
here of which I am the director.

Right now, the opposition government has revoked our
Licenses that permits us to own a financial and oil
company which resulted to the death of my husband.

In view of this I acted very fast to withdraw the
US$15.5M from the company's vault well preserved and
packed in cases and deposited it in ECOWAS SECURITY
COMPANY. I have since declared our Finance
company bankrupt  and no record  has ever existed
concerning the money because there is no document
showing we received the money from the Chinese firm.

Furthermore, due to the current situation in the
country concerning the present government attitude
towards some retired officers,  It has become quite impossible for me
and my family to make use of the money here (Gabon), thus I seek your
assistance to move the money out of this country and keep it in your
care. It is a risk free transaction, its  a
transfer through a diplomatic baggage( security
company).
My son and I have agreed to compensate you or the
owner of the account used for this transaction with
25% of the total amount remitted.

We shall have 70% and the remaining 5% reserved for
taxes and other miscellaneous expenses in your
country.

Finally, on your consent, I shall expect you to
contact me urgently to enable us discuss in details
about this transaction and bear in mind that your
early response is highly needed to transfer this fund.

It is 100% risk free,contact me through this e-mail
address  furnishing us with most
confidential telephone and fax numbers.
I must also use this opportunity to implore you to
exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this
transaction as a confidential issue.

Best Regards,

Madam Marcey Monte

It is my humble pleasure to write this letter
irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.
However, I came to know of you in my private search
for a reliable and trustworthy person that can handle
a confidential transaction of this nature in respect
to our investment plans in real estate. Though I know
that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that
all will be well by the end
of the day.

Let me start by first by introducing myself properly
to you. I am  Mr. Simpson E. Okoro  a Director with
Oceanic Bank International (Nigeria) Limited.

A foreigner, Late Jonathan Branch, a Civil
Engineer/Contractor with the federal Government of
Nigeria, until his death two years ago in a ghastly
air crash, banked with us here at the Oceanic Bank
International (Nigeria) Limited He had a closing
balance of USD$31.8M (THIRTY One Million, Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) which the bank now
unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his
available foreign next of kin. Or, alternatively be
donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and
ammunitions at a military war college here in Nigeria.

Fervent valuable efforts made by the Oceanic Bank
International (Nigeria) Limited  to get in touch with
any of late Jonathan Branch's next of kin (he had no
known wife and children)has been unsuccessful. The
management under the influence of our chairman and
board of directors which i am a member, are making
arrangement for the fund to be declared "UNCLAIMABLE "
and then be subsequently donated to the trust fund for
Arms and Ammunitions which will further enhance the
course of war in Africa and the world in general.

In order to avert this negative development. Myself
and some of my trusted
 colleagues in the bank, now seek for your permission
to have you stand as late Jonathan Branch's next of
kin. So that the fund (USD$31.8M), would be
subsequently transferred and paid into your bank
account as the beneficiary next of kin . All documents
and proves to enable you get this fund have been
carefully worked out and we are assuring you a 100%
risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the
total amount. While 5% will be kept aside to
offset what ever expenses incurred in the course of
this transaction then 65% would be for me and my
colleagues for purchase of properties in your country
through you/your Company.

If this proposal is OK by you, Please kindly get to me
immediately via my mailbox furnishing me with your
most confidential telephone, fax and e-mail,
so I can forward to you the relevant details of this
transaction.  ps,alternativley you can contact me on:
seokoro@netscape.net
 Thank you in advance for your anticipated cooperation.

With my very best wishes and warmest regards.

Mr. Simpson E. Okoro (Director)
Oceanic Bank International (Nigeria) Limited

Dear Sir,

CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PLAN

I humbly wish to seek your assistance in a matter that
is very important and needs utmost trust and
confidence. I am Dr.Mike Obi, a business consultant
and close confidant of one of the ADC to Mr Laurent
Kabilla,the late president of the Democratic Republic
of Congo.

The issue is this, the wife to one of the top
government official and an oil royalist who served in
Kabilla's regime wishes to move out from Lome-Togo,
the sum of US$24.7 million. She is very willing to
invest the aforementioned sum in a viable investment
overseas.

For obvious reasons, my client does not wish to
place this fund with established financial institution
in the family^Òs name for security reasons. It is her
desire that the deal be handled as quietly as
possible without any leakage to the public or the
incumbent government as they have suffered a great
lost in the p! ast.

She has therefore empowered and instructed me to look
for a reliable foreigner who can arrange and receive
the money into his or her account oversea and assist
to invest the fund properly for the family.

If you agree to act as a fund manager for my client
and her family, I shall arrange to release the sum of
US$24.7 Million to you if you meet my requirement
and upon a favourable response from you. I shall let
you know how you will receive it.

Your commission shall be down payment of 9% of the
total sum. And annual 10% of the after tax returns
on investment for the first five years. Therefore, the
terms shall be varied.

Be informed that arrangements have been made for you
to receive the fund in London, so you must be ready
to travel to London where you will sign the necessary
documents for the release of the fund to your
choice/designated bank account.

If you are capable a! nd willing to participate in
this transaction, reach me by e-mail as stated above.
In any case, please keep it tight secret.After
confirming your acceptance we can then establish
further lines of communication by phone and fax.

Goodbye and GOD bless. As I anxiously await your
soonest positive response.

Best regards.

Dr.MIKE OBI
MD/CEO

Dr. John Efetobor.

Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation.
Fax: 234-9-2720815
efejohn@flashmail.com

Dear Sir,


BUSINESS PROPOSAL.

I am the Treasury Controller, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
[NNPC] and a close  associate of the immediate past Minister of Petroleum 
Resources.

The Minister has mandated me to transfer the sum of US$88 millions 
recovered from an  over-invoiced contracts involving the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation [NNPC] into several  private account in Europe and
United States. A total  sum of US$73,700,000.00 has been transferred 
before the emergence of this present  Civilian
Administration,leaving the balance of  US$14,300,000.00.

I have made proper arrangement/documentation to transfer the balance which 
is retained  in a coded account of the NNPC with the Central Bank of 
Nigeria. We are soliciting  that you help us to receive the fund in trust. 
We cannot complete this transaction  smoothly without the participation of 
a foreign partner who would provide an account
where the funds could be lodged. Since it is a contract payment, the funds 
must be  remitted to a foreign account. The remittance of the funds 
requires little documentation.

There is no risk involved on your part in this transaction since the 
former Minister and I have covered this transaction with adequate contract 
and external credit documents from the beginning.

What we require from you by e-mail or fax are viz:
    {i} Acceptance letter of this offer
    {ii} Your company name and confidential telephone and fax numbers
    {iii} Convincing Honesty, Trustworthiness and Willingness to abide by 
the requirements of this proposal paramount of            which is 
CONFIDENTIALITY.

We have agreed that you will retain 20% of the entire US$14,300,000.00 for 
your effort  in this transaction, 70% for us partners here in Nigeria and 
the remaining 10% will be used for defrayal of incidental cost in the 
course of this transfer.

Please reply urgently by fax or e-mail as we expect that the transaction 
will not take  more than ten working days. And please note that this 
transaction must be top  secret.

Best regard.

Dear  Sir / Madam ,

Compliments of the season.I would like to firstly send to you the best
wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly  through
my proposal ascontained in this letter.Before going into details of my
proposal to you, I must first implore  you to treat with the utmost
confidentiality
as this is required for  its success 
and to have faith in this transaction,for things like this only comes
once in a life time.My colleagues and I are senior officials of the
Federal Government  of Nigeria's Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who are
interested in diverting  some funds that are presently floating in the
accounts of the Central  Bank of Nigeria.

In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance
 to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating
 funds. The source of the funds are as follows: 
During the last military regime  in Nigeria, government officials
set up companies and awarded  themselves  contracts that were grossly
over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals.The present civilian
government set up the Contract Review Panel, which  has the mandate to
use the instruments of payments made available to  it by the
decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and  if necessary
pay those who are being owedoutstanding amounts.

My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds 
which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for
 disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our ownpurposes.
However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of
 this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names
 of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated,
as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable
 overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of 
U.S.$20,000,000.00
(Twenty million U.S.dollars).That is why I am  writing you this letter.
We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account,
if you agree with our propositionas follows:
 
(i)30% to the account owner(you).(ii)60% for us (the panel officials).
(iii)10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us) incidental
 to the actualization of this project.

We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign
 stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have
access  to them without raising any eyebrows here at home. Please note
that this transaction is 100% safe and risk-free. We intend to effect
 the transfer within 10-14 working days from the date of receipt  of
the
following information:Your company's name,address,telephone and fax 
numbers we will use your company's name to  apply for the payment
and backdate the award of the contract to your company. We are looking
forward to doing this transaction with you and  we solicit for your utmost
confidentiality in this transaction.Upon acknowledgement I will
bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when  I hear
from you.

Best regards,

Ben Tikko.

MR.CYRIL OTOO
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION
INTERNATIONAL BANK OF AFRICA.
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.
PHONE 00226 62 75 37

Dear Friend,


(TOP SECRET)

I am Cyril Otoo the director in charge of auditing and accounting section
of International Bank Of Africa(IBA) Ouagadougou Burkina-faso West Africa
with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business
transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the end of the
transaction .

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my department came
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person-Arthur
Billings who died on October 31st 1999 in a plane crash and the fund has
been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund
in our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to
this development.

The said amount was U.S $7.2M (seven million two hundred United States
dollars). As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive
information through the Burkina-faso chamber of commerce on foreign
business relations here in Ouagadougou Burkina-faso.

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the
bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and
transfer this money to a foreign account has been put in place and
directives and needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you
indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit your
self to this great business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in
this country as a civil servant(A Banker),we are not allowed to operate a
foreign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during
the time of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual
reason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward
claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and
also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be
re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification and
clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole
money will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free. On
smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the
total sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of
expenses that may arise during the time of transfer and also telephone

Dear Sir,

I am MR. TUTU, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive
Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources.
First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a
transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality
and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the
South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government
delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable
credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for
the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret
because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six
Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we 
want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable
foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are
handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code
of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your
importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which
we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the 
tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to
remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will
provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former
contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25%
of the $26,.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous
expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you 
treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this
transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above
Tel/Fax number or 
my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you
are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out
this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a
position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give
us a very strong 
Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember
to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not
comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government
Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this
business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

MR. TUTU

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.

DEAR FRIEND.

                    SEEKING FOR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.

It is my pleasure to request your assistance on this business proposal
which if pursued to its conclusion, will be of immense benefit to both of
us. This request may seem strange but I will crave your indulgence and
pray that you view it seriously.

My name is COL. ZIZO GIRAI of the Democratic Republic of Congo and one of
the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of
Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to
the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my
country, I was instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to
purchase arms and ammunition worth of Fifteen Million United States
Dollars only (US$15,000,000.00) to fight the rebel group. But when
President Kabila was killed in a bloody shootout by one of his aide a day
before I was schedule to travel out of Congo, I immediately decided to
divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo for safe
keeping.The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here
following the unwanranted arrest and seizure of properties of Col.
Rasheidi Karesava (The aide that shot Laurent Kabila) tribesmen ,where I
am from,by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo the son
of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this,I need a
reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist me to move this
money out of my country as the beneficiary. I have sufficient ''contacts''
to move the fund under Diplomatic cover to a security company in the
Netherlands in your name, this is to ensure that the diplomatic baggage is
marked ''confidential''anditwill not pass through normal
custom/airportscreeningand clearance.

My inability to move this money out of Congo all this while lies on my
lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who have
suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President
Laurent Kabila, since hisson took office. Though we have neither seen nor
met each other, I know we will be able to establish all the trust that we
need to ensure that the money will be safe with you.

Thus, if you are willing to assist me to move this fund out of Congo, you
can contact me through my email address with your telephone and fax
numbers to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share
(percentage)for assisting me. I will highly appreciate it if my request is
given utmost priority and consideration.

Best Regards,

COL. ZIZO GIRAI.(RTD)

Dear Sir,

I am Moustapha Abacha, the second surviving son of the late General Sani
Abacha.

We hereby acknowledge the receipt of your mail to my mother with thanks,

May Allah reward you greatly for your decision to assist us in this
mutually beneficial transaction;

My mother has insisted that I deal with you directly at this crucial stage
in this issue rather than the family lawyer.

As my mother has rightly informed you,we are seriously in distress as all
our saved money abroad totaling over Us$700M has been confiscated by the
Nigerian government.

If you have been following my family's profile in the news lately, you
would have read all this things up.

I wish to inform you at this time that my mother will be reaching you
Based on the fact that she would really want to establish a relationship
based on mutual trust and understanding.

So many people have disappointed us home and abroad,

even people who benefited from my fathers regime have all bitten the
finger that once fed them,

that is why we had to throw caution to the wind and trust you a stranger
who we had never met all our lives.

Dear Friend,

as much as we recognize that a lot of wonders happen these days, you do
not have to doubt the authenticity of my mothers mail to you, because we
are really oppressed, and we need the assistance of a God fearing person
and a good natured man like you to help us clear our funds from a security
company,

and bank it up for us while we make arrangements to travel and join you up
once the surveillance on us is reduced.

For security purposes, I shall be coordinating the Business transaction as
tight security is presently placed on my mother,

we cannot afford to Lose the only remaining US$40.30 Million, of all that
my fatherleft for us. At the moment,

the funds are in a security company and were deposited As African Artworks
in some luggage. As soon as we are sure that we can trust you,

we shall go ahead to send you the Certificate of deposit and the luggage
numbers and security code numbers.

For the purpose of security and confidentiality, I would require that You
and I proceed with this business with telephone and fax communication,

as I would not want to discuss this transaction on The Internet for
security reasons.

So I would suggest that we conduct this business through telephone and fax
communication, while my mother will be reaching you via e-mail as security
agents bug her telephone line.

As, as soon as I hear from you through my Satellite Telephone numbers and
email Address as above, I shall furnish you with the whole details of how
to Finalize the transaction and other information you might require or
other things you might need to know and also you should be rest assured
that this transaction is 100% risk free and success guaranteed.

There are documents backing the legitimacy of this transaction that will
convince your bank or any other bank that might doubt the authenticity of
these funds.

Also I will send you more information and other information you might
require via fax immediately I hear from you on my telephone.

I look forward to your urgent response, as my mother and the rest of the
immediate family genuinely need your help.

Truly Yours,

MOUSTAPHA ABACHA.

Subject: URGENT ASSISTANCE REQUIRED........NOT A SCAM
Date: Mon, 17 Jun 2002 03:09:03 -0700 (PDT)
From: patrick king elsworth pk_elsworth@yahoo.com
To: ...

FROM:PATRICK KING ELSWORTHWOZA 
REFUGGE CAMP.EAST NIGERIA, 
1902(B)CONCENTRATION CAMP, EAST NIGERIA.
REFUGEE NO.BRA/SA/00155/0062

MY Ref :FAMILY ASSISTANCE/INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP. 

This letter is not intended to cause you any
embarrassment in whatever form (hence not an
unsolicited mail), rather compelete contact your
esteemed self, following knowledge of your high repute
and trustworthiness,is borne out of this difficult
situation that our family has been engulfed out since
my father and bread winner of the family was forced
torelinquish his position.

However, I know that your immediate apprehensions may
be as a result of the popular scam reports you must
have told or you must have read of. I must reiterate
however that you must not swallow hook, line and
sinker all that you have been told or read.
We are aware of these reports about scam which most
African countries have been famed for such activities.

My dear, the truth is that many people remain poor in 
life today by virtue of their ignorance of certain 
privilege information. A lot of people are ignorant of
the above information and have unwittingly blown 
several privilege opportunities that have come their 
way because they choose to leave the veil over their 
face and swallow the hook, line and sinker, the 
sponsored media report sold to them, which is exactly 
what these reports aim to achieve. It^Òs really very
pathetic
I think that your problem after you would have gone
through with this mail will be that of fear, an almost
all-consuming fear of the unknown, you are not so 
sure, you are afraid that something might go wrong and
that this business arrangements might not be
consummated or something of the sort, although I
havegiven you assurances. 

In life, dreams and fears go hand in hand, 
so it is not out of place for you to be afraid. Even 
the most courageous men on earth have their own fears,
but courage means being able to perform in the midst 
of your fear. It is said that an individual cannot 
discover new ocean until he has the courage to lose
sight of the shores. 
Please I advise you to be courageous in this 
transaction and lets go ahead with this transaction. 
Everything will work out very well to our ultimate 
mutual advantage. Do not fear or despair, as our 
transaction has no bearing or any relation with scam, 
we presently have found ourselves (men of great hope 
and aspiration) in the most trying times where because
of insufficient resources, little minds tend to spite 
us, but there is a dawn of hope, we have toiled all 
night, we can not give in to human dissuasions, 
history has a place for minds of steel. 
When they first manufactured golf balls , they  made 
the cover smooth. Then it was  discovered that after a
ball had been roughened up one could get more distance
out of it. So they started  manufacturing them with
dimpled covers. 
So it is with life, it takes some rough spots in your 
life to make you go your farthest. 

My name is Mr.PATRICK  KING ELSWORTH, the son of
Mr.Henry Elsworth of Kwekwe Zimbabwe.
During the current war crisis against the farmers in
Zimbabwe from the support of President Robert Mugabe,
because on his envy and greediness to claim all the
white-owned farms for his party members and his
followers, he ordered all white farmers to surrender
all their farms(lands) to his party members and
his followers.

My father(Mr.Henry Elsworth of blessed memory) is
one of the best farmers in the country and because he
did not Support Robert Mugabe ideas, Mugabe^Òs order
his supporters to invaded my father's farm and burnt
everything in the farm in asmuch as killing my beloved
father with two of his workers who was at the farm
with him and made away with a lot of items in my
father's farm.(19 Jan 2001,firday around 3.30 pm)
Before his death, my father deposited with a Security
Company in Amsterdam,Neitherland(Europe)the sum of
US$15.5Million}{Fifteen million Five hundred thousand
United States Dollars}as family valuables. This money
is for the opening of the new 285 acares of farm land
in Shiselweni Village near Umbuluzi river in Swaziland
which my father negotiated to buy with the help of the
Swaziland Monarch King Suboza Mswati(lll) as well as
buying tractors for the newly site which my father had
made all the enquries from NEW LONDON T! RACTOR &
EQUIPMENT. ROUTE 460 WEST OF LYNCHBURG LONDON. 

After the death of my father and the bread winner of
the family,I decided to move to the Fedearal Republic
of Nigeria (as all my hopes is no longer )where my
father had deposited the Money in the Security Company
as family valuables to withdraw it and put to use. My
hopes was turn down as it is against the
constitutional human right law of Fedearal Republic of
Nigeria that asylums seeking refugee in their country
to have an account with their banks or to have an
enterprise in their country. This they showed me in
Green Paper on International Refugee(SECTION 22 ACT OF
THE REFUGEE ACT NO 13 OF 1998)prohibts it and failure
to comply on this is against the SECTION 37(B1 and B9)
of the Fedearal Republic of Nigeria laws which was in
the Agreement with United Nations High Commissionerfor
Refugees (UNHCR) in 1993.

After all this I decided to seek for an advice for on
the best way to retrieve this money(U.N.H.C.R)they
advised me that the best way is for me is to contact
an oversea person so that he can help me because as
aslyum seekers here the human right law of the country
will not allow me to move this money overseas on my
own capacity. So l decided to contact you so that you
can assist me to move this money out of Nigeria
because as asylum seekers i am not allowed to operate
any bank account within Nigeria. 
This money I have intend to use for investment in your
country. As I have two options for you.
(A)Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage
of the money for nominating your account for the
deposit when the money got claimed from Amsterdam.
(B)Or you can go into partnership with me for the
proper profitable investment of the money in your
country. Whichever the option you want, feel free
tonotify me.  

But if you do not prefer a partnership with me ,for
your rewarding kindness we shall go into negotiation.
Do remamber that you will still help me in investing
this money in your country as you can understand that
I do not have any knowledge of international business.
Would you be of kind enough to assist me.I am looking
for your reply soonest. 

Thanks and best regards

Greetings!

It is not my intention to bring to your knowledge my Family secret
information but situation has warranted the need to solicit your
assistance in order to deliver my family from this helpless situation. I
am brother to Mrs.Mariam Abacha the wife of the late head of state in
Nigeria who died while still in active service.

In order to give you a background of this "business transaction", please
check the website

http://news.ft.com/ft/gx.cgi/ftc?pagename=View&c=Article&cid=FT3PQPP45QC

Since the death of Gen. Abacha, the present Government has taken pleasure
in freezing the family Bank accounts and equally in the confiscation of
their properties for a reason that I do not know about. Right now my
sister is under house arrest and her two sons were jailed for over
embezzlement of Government funds and money laundry during the regime of
theirv father. You can imagine my sister family is now the only news you
read in every day to day publications in the whole world as our government
keep accusing GEN. Abacha as a military dictator and other sequent crimes.

Immediately her husband died my sister managed to move out and deposit a
sum of US$20M dollars in a security company before being place under house
arrest. Although the security company do not know the content in the boxes
deposited as we deposit it as personal effects and we cannot let them
know, so that they will not expose us. It is in this respect that we seek
your help to assist us in the investment of this fund before the
Government will have knowledge of this money to avoid being freeze. Please
we seriously need your assistance urgently.

On conclusion of this business, we shall compensate you with 30% of the
fund and invest the rest funds for the family, the family do not need
cash, while 5% is mapped out for any expense we should encounter during
the cause of transaction, and the remaining amount should be used to open
account for my family for investment over there with your assistance.

Please contact me on this email address belloaba@justice.com as it is more
confidential because of other security agent, look forward to hear from
you soon.

Best Regards,
BELLO ABA

Dear Sir,

I am Mr.Tambo, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive
Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources.
First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a
transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality
and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the
South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government
delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable
credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for
the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret
because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six
Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we 
want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable
foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are
handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code
of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your
importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which
we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the 
tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to
remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will
provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former
contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25%
of the $26,.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous
expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you 
treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this
transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above
Tel/Fax number or 
my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you
are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out
this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a
position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give
us a very strong 
Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember
to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not
comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government
Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this
business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

Mr. Tambo

  Dear Friend,
This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have
not yet met. The message could be strange but reel if you pay some
attention to it. I could have notified you about it at least for the sake of
your
integrity. Please accept my sincere apologies. In bringing this message
of goodwill to you, I have to say that I have no intentions of causing
you any pains.
I am Ms. Sandra savimbi, daughter of the late rebel leader Jonas savimbi
of Angola who was killed on the 22nd of febuary 2002 . I managed to get
your contact details through "The World Business Journal", a journal
of the Johannesburg Chamber of Commerce in South Africa in the time I
was desperately looking for a trustworthy person to assist me in this
confidential business.
my late father, Jonas savimbi was able to deposit a large sum of money
in differnt banks in europe My father is presently death and the movement
of his family members (including me) is restricted. We are forbidden
to either travel abroad or out of our localities. Presently, the
US$25,600,000.00 twentyfive, MILLION, six HUNDRED DOLLARS my father
transfered to
Netherlands is safe and is in a security firm.  I am therefore soliciting
your
help tohave this money transfered into your account. before my government
get
wind of this fund .You know my father was a rebel leader in Angola
before his death My reason for doing this is because it will be difficult
for the Angolan government to trace my father's money to an individual's
account, especially when such an individual has no relationship ,I decided
to keep that money for my family use. At present the money is kept in a
Security Company in nertherland.
I am currently and temporarily living in Angola with my husband.

 Moreover the political climatein Angola at the moment being so sensitive
and unstable.
When you are ready i will give you the information needed before you can get
access
to the fund you will then proceed to Netherlands where the US$25,600,000.00
twentyfive, MILLION, six HUNDRED DOLLARS will be given to you as payment.
Alternatively, you can have the fund transferred into any account that suits
you.

and for your co-operation and partnership, we have unanimously agreed that
you will
be entitled to 5.5% of the money when successfully receive it in your
account.
 The nature of your business is not relevant to the successful execution of
this
transaction.  kindly provide me with all your contacts addresses including
your personal telephone and fax number.
All correspondence is for the attention of my counsel:joseph edward.
 Kindly get back to us.

ATTN:PRESIDENT/CEO


Dear Sir,

It is with respect and confidence that I decided to
contact you for a confidential transaction, which
requires your assistance for our mutual beneficial
relationship.

I am the first son of Mr.Godwin Markson of
Sierra-Leonean former Chairman Of Distribution
And Revenue Generation of The Diamond Sector.

I have come to inherit the sum of $28.000.000.00
(Twenty Eight Million US Dollars) left for me by my
father who until his death was the chairman of Revenue
Generation and Distribution of Diamond sector before
the civil war. He died in a motor accident while
returning from Freetown our capital city after an
official conference meeting, may his soul rest in
peace.

The last WILL testament of my father is with the
executor of the WILL. But the money is deposited with
a security company in Abidjan in Ivory Coast.

At his death bed, my father advised me to seek an
assistance of an honest foreigner to help me in
transferring the money out of the country. The
foreigner will open a domiciliary account in his
favour there in Abidjan in Ivory Coast for onward
transfer to the person's designated overseas account
where the money will be properly invested with the
assistance of the person.

This is because there are no good investment
opportunities in this country now due to the political
instability, secondly I have decided to live in your
country after this fund has been transferred to your
country for investment.

I am therefore soliciting for your assistance but with
the following conditions:

1) That this transaction shall be treated with utmost
confidence, co-operation and absolute secrecy.

2) That the money will be transferred to an account
where much tax shall not take so much of it.

3) I have decided to give you 20% of the total money
towards your successful assistance to this business,
having set aside 5% to cover all local and
International expenses as may arise from this transfer
activity for which all the parties involved will
have to contribute to, while the balance of 75% will
be credited to my account.

4) An agreement of acceptance shall be written, signed
and stamped by you on your letter headed paper and
send to me to be filled with my lawyer in which you
will state that 75% of the Twenty Eight Million U.S
dollars must be released to me by you through your
bank account immediately after the transfer.

If you are interested in the proposal and decides to
assist me kindly contact me urgently on this,
email:johnson_mark2000.co.uk


Thanks in anticipation.

Yours sincerely
MR.Johnson Markson.

FOR THE KIND ATTENTION,

RE:URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP/PARTNERSHIP.

First I must solicit your utmost confidentiality in this transaction.I am
making this contact with you based on reliable information available to
us,courtesy of the internet business index,thus we are convinced that you would be
capable of providing us with a solution to a money transfer transaction of
US$16,400,000.00 (Sixteen Million,Four Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars).

Source:During the last military regimes here in Nigeria,government officials
set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were to be paid from
the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) set up by the military regime for the purpose
of financing special projects and these were grossly over-invoiced.The
present civilian government have constituted an Interim Management Committe
(IMC) with the mandate to investigate all contracts awarded as well as carry
out debt verification of all claims that have not yet been paid with a view
of settling all legitimate debts owed by the Federal Government of Nigeria
to both local and foreign contractors before the government wind up the
Trust Fund.We as members of this committee have identified a lot of inflated
contract funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of
Nigeria.In the mean- time,the government have already made a budget
allocation for the payment of these contracts,but by virtue of our position
as civil servants and members of this panel,we cannot acquire this fund in
our names.I was delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues to look for
an overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the funds
totalling(USD16,400,000.00) and you will be adequately compesated with 25%
of the entire sum, hence we are writing you this mail.

The present Civilian Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all
debt owed so as to maintain an amiable relationship with both the Foreign
Governments and Non Government Finanacial Agencies and to attract foreign
investment into our economy.We have decided to include our bills for
approval with the co-operation of some officials of the Federal Ministy of
Finance (F.M.F) and the Central Bank of Nigeria(C.B.N.). We seek your
assistance in providing us with a good company account or personal account
into which we can remit this money,you will be acting as an ORIGINAL
CONTRACTOR in this deal, the fund will be paid to you. This we can do by
SWAPPING of account information and changing of beneficiary information to
apply for payment. We prepare letters of claims and job description on your
behalf,on receiption of the following information (your banker's name and
address,account number,your telephone and fax numbers).

It is our intention therefore,while having your understanding and
co-operation to invest 70% of this funds in pulp and paper manufacturing
plant for worldwide distribution and importation of agricultural and oil
prospecting equipment to sub-western region of Africa.While the balance 5%
will cater for all local and foreign expenses incurred in facilitating the
transfer of this funds.
Please contact me immediately you recieve this mail or send me a fax at my
confidential FAX No.:234 1 7592618 thus signifying your capability and
willingness to assist us.We are building our trust on sincerity of purpose,
mutual understanding and recommendation.
The business itself is 100% safe and fail proof, provided you treat it with
utmost secrecy and confidentiality and you follow my instructions carefully
and religiously.Your line of specialization does not matter as it cannot
hinder the successful execution of this transaction.

Again we look forward to doing business with you and solicit your utmost
confidentiality in this transaction.Thank you for your co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

DR.JOHN BAKI.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT.

I am Mr, Joseph Edward a native of Cape Town in
South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with
the South Africa  DEPARTMENT OF MINERAL RESOURCES AND ENERGY 

First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to
reach you for a transaction/business of this
magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this
medium. 

I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal
described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties
and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this
transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources
where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the
cooperation of four other top officials, we have in
our possession as overdue payment bills totaling
Twenty - One Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S.
Dollars ($21,500,000.) which we want to transfer
abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a
foreign company/individual to receive the said fund
on
our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account
to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in
the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service
Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore
account hence your importance in the whole
transaction.
This amount $21.5m represents the balance of the
total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign
contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately.
Though the actual
contract cost have been paid to the original contractor,leaving the
balance in
the Tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to
remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any
foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an
application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former
contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in
the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $21.5 million, 70%
for us and 5% for taxation and
miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100%
safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this transaction. I have reposed my
confidence in you and hope that you will not
disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately my
e-mail address  whether or not you are
interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another
foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners
and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible
provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share
will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential
matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are
still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the
essence in this business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,


JOSEPH EDWARD

OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN
CONTRACT AWARDING COMMITTE
ECOWAS HEADQUARTERS
TELE:00228-949-7287
LOME,REPUBLIC OF TOGO.



Dear Sir,


          ACCOUNT PROVISION FOR USD10.Millon

Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a surprise and if
it might offend you without your prior consent and writing through this
channel.

I am Dr.Raymond Graham(JP).,The Chairman,Contract Awarding Committee of
the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES ( ECOWAS)with Headquarters
in Lome, Togo.I got your information in a business directory from the
Togolaise Chamber of Commerce and Industries when I was searching for a
reliable,honest and trustworthy person to entrust this business with.I was
simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact from the many names and
lists in the directory.

After discussing my view and your profile with my colleagues,they were
very much satisfied and decided to contact you immediately for this mutual
business relationship.We wish to transfer the sum of(TEN Million United
States Dollars only.)into your personal or company`s bank account.

This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contract bills awarded by us
for the supply of ammunitions,hard/soft wares,phamaceauticals/medical
items,light and heavy duty vehicles, apperals and other administrative
logistics etc for the ECOMOG in Sierria-Leone and Liberia during the Peace
Keeping Projects.

This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all
the attendant lope holes sealed off.As the secretary of CAC,I have the
cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director of the Organisation.We
arranged and over invoiced the contract funds supplied by different
companies from different countries during the crisis.

It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to
provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of West
Africa.This is borne out of our beleif in the non-stable and sporous
political nature of this sub-region.

The original contractors have been duely paid by the Banque Centrale Des
Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest (Central Bank of the West African
States)through our bankers-Societe Generale Banque.This balance is
suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of
our choice.We intend to pay out this fund NOW as the organisation is
winding up its activities since the aim of returning PEACE to the
countries and the coast has been achieved.

Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil servants working
under this organisation, are not allowed to operate a foreign account.This
is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account
that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment with
your comprehensive advise,assistance and partnership in your country.

It is however agreed,as the account owner in this deal to allow you 25% of
the entire sum as compensation, 65% will be held on trust for us while 10%
will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost during the course
of the transaction.

This transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days if you
accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation.You should provide the
followings:

      YOUR COMPANY`S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,TEL
      AND FAX NUMBERS.(if available)
     THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL,FAX
      AND TELEX NUMBERS.THE ACCOUNT NUMBER

THE COMPLETE MAILING ADRRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX
NUMBERS.Upon the receipt of this informations,the documents and approval
with the texts will be sent to you for confirmaton and then forwarded to
the organisation for ratification and subsequent payment.

As with the case of all organised (sensitive)and conspired DEALS,we
solicit for your unreserved confidentiality and utmost secret in this
business. We hope to retire peacefully and lead a honourable business life
afterwards.There are no risks involved.

CALL ME UP RECEIPT OF THIS MESSAGES FOR MORE DETAILS ON MY TELEPHONE
NUMBER: 00 228-949-7287 FOR MORE DETAILS.

REPLY ASAP.
With regards.
Dr.Raymond Graham(JP).

WITH THIS FAMILY HAS MADE IT NECESSARY THAT WE SEEK YOUR ASSISITANCE 
IN RECEIVING THIS MONEY AND IN INVESTING IT ON BEHALF OF THE FAMILY.


THIS MUST BE A JOINT VENTURE TRANSACTION AND WE MUST ALL WORK 
TOGETHER.  SINCE THIS MONEY IS STILL CASH, EXTRA SECURITY MEASURES 
HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO PROTECT IT FROM THEFT OR SEIZURE, PENDING WHEN 
AGREEMENT IS REACHED ON WHEN TO MOVE IT INTO ANY OF THIS COUNTRIES 
HOLLAND,LONDON, SPAIN,PENDING ON OUR AGREEMENT. I HAVE PERSONALLY

NECESSARY DETAILS AS TO HOW WE INTEND TO CARRY OUT THE WHOLE 
TRANSACTION. PLEASE, DO NOT ENTERTAIN ANY FEARS,AS ALL NECESSARY 
MODALITIES ARE IN PLACE, AND I ASSURE YOU OF ALL SUCCESS AND SAFETY IN 
THIS TRANSACTION.

PLEASE, THIS TRANSACTION REQUIRES ABSOLUTE CONFIDENTIALITY AND YOU 
WOULD BE EXPECTED TO TREAT IT AS SUCH UNTIL THE FUNDS ARE MOVED 
OUT OF THIS COUNTRY TO WHERE YOU INTEND TO RECEIVE THEM.

IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS YOU ARE TO FORWARD TO ME THE FOLLOWING 
DETAILS: YOUR COMPLETE NAMES AND ADDRRESS,CONFIDENTIAL TELEPHONE 
AND FAX NUMBERS, THIS IS TO ENABLE ME PERFECT ALL THE NECESSARY

TO YOUR COUNTRY OF CHOICE.

Dear Friend,

I would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health
and success in your pursuits this new year particularly through my
proposal as contained in this letter. Before going into details of my
proposal to you, I must first solicit you to treat with the utmost
confidentiality, as this is required for its success. Originally, i
would have sent you this proposal by mail, but i have been advised
that the internet is the fastest means of communication that is why i
am using this medium. If in the course of our transaction( should you
decide to assist) you deem it fit to use any other medium, i shall
oblige to your request.

My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of
Nigeria^Òs Contracts Review Panel who are interested in diverting some
funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank
of Nigeria. In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for
your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said
floating funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the
end of this beginning quarter of 2002. The source of the funds are as
follows: During the last military regime in Nigeria, government
officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were
grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastatals. The
present civilian government set up the Contract Review Panel, which
has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to
it by the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and
if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. My
colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds
which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for
disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own
purposes. However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and
members of this panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or
in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore
been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to
look for a reliable overseas partner into whose account we can
transfer the sum of U.S.$8,500,000.00 ( eight million, five hundred
thousand U.S. dollars).

That is why I am writing you this letter. We have agreed to share the
money to be transferred into your account, if you agree with our
proposition as follows; (i) 25% to the account owner (you).

 (ii) 65% for us (the panel officials).

(iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us )
incidental to the actualisation of this project.

We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in
foreign stock markets and other business till we are ready and able
to have access to them without raising any eyebrows here at home.
Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and risk-free. We
intend to effect the transfer within seven (7) banking days from the
date of receipt of the following information through this medium:
Your bank's name, company^Òs name, address and telephone and fax
numbers and the account number into which the funds should be paid.
The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job
description respectively. This way, we will use your company^Òs name
to apply for the payment and backdate the award of the contract to
your company. We are looking forward to doing this transaction with
you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in this
transaction. Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the
above telephone number or my other email address
(osa_osunde1@qrio.com). I will bring you into a more detailed picture
of this transaction when I hear from you.

Best regards,

Mr.Osa Osunde

Attn:President/Ceo.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL .

RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
US DOLLARS ONLY).

I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as
we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek
for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction which is of
mutual benefit.

I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and
Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC)Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in NNPC by my
Committee.

This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M. U. S.Dollars.
This was done deliberately. The over-invoicing was a deal by my committee
to benefit from the project. We now want totransfer this money which is in
a suspense Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you
to provide for us.

For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you will be
entitled to 20% of the money,70% will be for me and my partners while 10%
has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that may be
incurred by us during the course of this transfer,both locally and
international expenses.

I would require the following: -

1. Your company's name, address, telephone and fax numbers.
2. Your bank account and address where the money will be remitted.

The above informations would be used to make formal applications as a
matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to
your account.It does not matter whether or not your company does contract
projects of this nature described here. The assumption is that your
company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to othercompanies.
More often than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields
win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms for
execution of such contracts.We have strong reliable connections and
contacts at the Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as the Federal Ministry
of Finance and we have no doubt that all the money will be released and
transferred if we get the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this
deal. Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall
through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the
concerned Government Ministries for 100% security.

We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a
lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be transferred to
the overseas Accounts for us, before the present Democratic Government
starts Auditing all Federal Government owned Parastatals.Please contact me
immediately through my telephone number whether or not you are interested
in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign
partner to carry out this deal.But where you are interested,send the
required documents aforementioned herein through my above email box
address(bodethomas100@rediffmail.com),as time is of the essence in this
business.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

Mr.Bode Thomas.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL .
RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
US DOLLARS ONLY).

I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as we 
are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek for 
foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction which is of mutual 
benefit.
I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and 
Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation 
(NNPC)Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in NNPC by my 
Committee.
This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M. U. S.Dollars. This 
was done deliberately. The over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to 
benefit from the project. We now want totransfer this money which is in a 
suspense Account with NNPC into any
Overseas Account which we expect you to provide for us.

SHARE: -
For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you will be 
entitled to 20% of the money,70% will be for me and my partners while 10% 
has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that may be 
incurred by us during the course of this transfer,both locally and 
international expenses.

I would require the following: -

1. Your company's name, address, telephone and fax numbers.

The above informations would be used to make formal applications as a 
matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to 
your account.It does not matter whether or not your company does contract

THERE WERE SERIES OF CONTRACTS EXECUTED BY A

FAVOUR OF N.N.P.C. THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF THESE
CONTRACTS WERE DELIBRATELY OVER INVOICED TO THE SUM
OF USD$25,000,000.00 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATE
DOLLARS). THIS AMOUNT HAS NOW BEEN APPROVED AND IS
NOW READY TO BE TRANSFERED BEING THAT THE COMPANIES
THAT ACTUALLY EXECUTED THESE CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN FULLY
PAID AND THE PROJECTS OFFICIALLY COMMISSIONED.
CONSEQUENTLY, MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE WILLING TO
TRANSFER THE TOTAL AMOUNT TO YOUR ACCOUNT FOR
SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENT, SINCE WE AS CIVIL SERVANTS
ARE PROHIBITED BY THE CODE OF CONDUCT BUREAU (CIVIL
SERVICE LAW) FROM OPERATING AND/OR OPENING FOREIGN
ACCOUNTS IN OUR NAMES. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE TRUST
REPOSED ON YOU AT THIS JUNCTURE IS ENORMOUS, IN
RETURN, WE HAVE AGREED TO OFFER YOU 30% OF THE
TRANSFERED SUM, WHILE 10% SHALL BE SET ASIDE FOR
INCIDENTAL EXPENSES (INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL) BETWEEN
BOTH PARTIES IN THE COURSE OF THE TRANSACTION YOU WILL
BE MANDATED TO REMIT THE BALANCE TO OTHER ACCOUNTS IN
DUE COURSE.
MODALITIES HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL
OF THE MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND THE CENTRAL BANK OF
NIGERIA FOR THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THE FUNDS WITHIN
10 WORKING DAYS SUBJECT TO YOUR SATISFACTION OF THE
ABOVE STATED TERMS. OUR ASSURANCE IS THAT YOUR ROLE IS
RISK FREE.TO ACCORD THIS TRANSACTION THE LEGALITY IT
DESERVES AND FOR MUTUAL SECURITY OF THE FUNDS THE
WHOLE APPROVAL PROCEDURES WILL OFFICIALLY AND LEGALLY
PROCESSED WITH YOUR NAME OR THE NAME OF ANY COMPANY
YOU MAY NOMINATE AS THE BONEFIDE BENEFICIARY.
ONCE MORE I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT HAVING PUT IN
OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN THE CIVIL SERVICE OF MY
COUNTRY, I AM AVERSE TO HAVING MY IMAGE AND CAREER
DENTED. THIS MATTER SHOULD THEREFORE BE TREATED WITH
UTMOST SECRECY AND URGENCY IT DESERVES.

I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT THIS BUSINESS PROPOSAL IS
100% RISK FREE AS
WE
HAVE DONE OUR HOME WORK PROPERLY I QUITE BELIEVE THAT
YOU WILL PROTECT
OUR
INTEREST BY TAKING THIS DEAL STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL, AS
WE ARE
STILL IN GOVERNMENT SERVICE, WHICH WE INTEND TO RETIRE
FROM.KINDLY EXPEDITE ACTION AS WE ARE BEHIND SCHEDULE
TO ENABLE US INCLUDE THIS TRANSFER IN THE FIRST BATCH
WHICH WOULD CONSTITUTE THE FIRST QUARTER PAYMENTS FOR
THE 2002 FINANCIAL YEAR.
THANKS AND GOD BLESS.

your phone & fax
Numbers so we may

approved for payment by the concerned Ministries. The contract has
since been executed, commissioned and the contractor company, paid
off.We are left with the balance of US$20.5M which was given to us by
the company for influencing the contract in their favour amidst heavy
competition from rival companies.But under our protocol division,
civil servants are forbidden to operate or own foreign accounts. This

responsibilities of transferring this fund into your account, for all
the administrative steps needed for the transfer of this fund into
your designated bank account will be done by me. I and my colleagues
have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of
us. I and one of my colleagues involved in this deal will come to
your country to arrange for our share, upon the confirmation from you
that the money has been credited into your no!
minated bank account.Consequent upon your acceptance of this

FROM: FEDI NOKIRI
 
DEAR,
 
I KNOW THIS LETTER WILL BE SURPRISING TO YOU. 
I AM FEDI NOKIRI, 30YEARS OF AGE WITH MY YOUNGER
SISTER; NARIN COLE NOKIRI WHO IS 18 YEARS OF AGE.
WE ARE SIERRA LEONEA'S, WE ARE THE CHILDREN OF MR
NOKIRI WHO'S WIFE WAS MAILA NOKIRI. 
 
 MY FATHER WAS THE FORMER MANAGING DIRECTOR OF SIERRA
 LEONE MINING CO-OPERATION (S.L.M.CIN FREETOWN). MY
 FATHER DEPOSITED THE SUM OF ($35,000,000) MILLION
 UNITED STATE DOLLARS WITH A SECURITY COMPANY IN
 LOME-TOGO, ACCORDING TO MY FATHER, THIS MONEY WAS
 THE INCOME ACCRUED FROM MINING CO-OPERATION OVER
 DRAFT AND MINOR SALES, BEFORE THE PEAK OF THE CIVIL
 WAR BETWEEN THE REBEL FORCES OF MAJOR PAUL KOROMAH
 AND THE COMBINED FORCES OF ECOMOG PEACE KEEPING
 OPERATION THAT ALMOST DESTROYED MY COUNTRY FOLLOWING
 THE FORCEFUL REMOVAL FROM POWER OF THE CIVILIAN
 ELECTED PRESEDENT AHMED TEJAN KABBAH BY THE REBELS. 
 
 MY FATHER, DURING THE CRISIS HAS ALREADY MADE
 AGREEMENT TO MOVE HIS FAMILY MY MOTHER, MY SISTER
 AND MYSELF TO LOME-TOGO ALONG WITH SOME OF OUR
 VALUABLE PERSONAL EFFECTS. THIS CRISIS RESULTED TO
 WAR. DURING THE WAR IN MY COUNTRY AND FOLLOWING THE
 INDISCRIMINATE LOOTING OF PUBLIC AND GOVERNMENT
 PROPERTIES BY REBEL FORCES THE SIERRA LEONE MINING
 CORPORATION WAS ONE OF THE TARGETS LOOTED AND
 DESTROYED. MY FATHER INCLUDING OTHER TOP GOVERNMENT
 FUNCTIONARIES WERE ATTACKED AND KILLED BY THE REBELS
 IN NOVEMBER 1999 BECAUSE OF HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH
 THE CIVILIAN PRESIDENT AHMED TEJAN KABBA. 
 
 AS A RESULT OF MY FATHERS'DEATH WE MOVED TO
 LOME-TOGO WITH MY MOTHER, FEW DAYS AFTER OUR ARRIVAL
 TO LOME MY MOTHER DEVELOPED HEART ATTACK AND LATER
 DIED FEW MONTHS AFTER, BEFORE THE DEATH OF MY
 MOTHER, THE LAST WORD SHE SAID TO ME WAS "ANDRE,
 TAKE CARE OF YOUR SISTER MAKE SURE SHE GOES TO
 SCHOOL, THIS IS THE CERTIFICATE OF THE MONEY YOUR
 FATHER DEPOSITED WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY WHERE IN
LOME-TOGO TAKE IT, KEEP IT AND LOOK FOR SOMEONE TO
 CLAIM AND MANAGE IT FOR YOU AND YOUR SISTER SINCE
 YOUR FATHER DEPOSITED IT IN YOUR FAVOUR,LOOK FOR A
 FOREIGN FRIEND AND ASK THE PERSON TO INVEST THE
 MONEY FOR YOU".THEN SHE HANDED THE CERTIFICATE TO ME
 AND DIED. SO MY CONCERN NOW IS FOR MY SISTER TO GO
 TO SCHOOL AND CLAIM AND INVEST THIS MONEY FOR US. 
 
 I AM APPEALING TO YOU, TO ASSIST US IN CLAIMING THIS
 MONEY FROM THE  SECURITY COMPANY AND ALSO TO TAKE US
OUT OF LOME OR
 IF YOU WOULD'NT MIND, LET MY SISTER STAY WITH YOU
 WHILE YOU INVEST THE MONEY FOR US AS WE ARE HERE IN
 LOME AS REFUGEES OR ASSYLUM. 
 
 MAY I AT THIS POINT, EMPHASIS THE HIGH LEVEL OF
 CONFIDENTIALITY, WHICH
 THIS DEMANDS AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST
 AND CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. HOWEVER, YOU
 MAY NEED TO GIVE ME SUFFICIENT ASSURANCE THAT YOU
WILL NOT SEAT ON THIS FUND WHEN IT IS FINALLY IN 
YOUR CUSTODY.I AM PREPARED TO COMPENSATE YOU WITH
20% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT BASED ON YOUR
PARTICIPATION/PERFORMANCE IN THIS TRANSACTION. 
 
I AM VERY MUCH INTERESTED TO INVEST IN THE AREA OF
ELECTRONICS, ESTATE MANAGEMENT, STOCK/SHARES,
COSMETOLOGY INDUSTRY, ENGINEERING, PHARMACEUTICAL
DRUGS AND COMPUTERS. YOU CAN ALSO SUGGEST OTHER
VIABLE INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN YOUR REACH ON
THE BELLOW CONDITION:
 
 1. THAT YOU WILL ACT AS MY FUND MANAGER IN OVERSEAS
 BY PUTTING THE FUND INTO ANY REASONABLE USE.
 
 2. YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 20% UP FRONT FROM THE
 TOTAL CAPITAL OF $35MILLION USD, AND AN ANNUAL 5% (5
 PERCENT) OF AFTER TAX RETURNS ON INVESTMENT FOR THE
 FIRST 5 (FIVE) YEARS, AFTER WHICH THE TERMS CAN BE
 RE-NEGOTIATED, 
 
 PLEASE GIVE THIS MATTER A PROMPT AND QUICK ATTENTION
 FOR IMMEDIATE REPLY.  
 
 I EXPECT YOU TO GIVE THIS A QUICK AND URGENT
 ATTENTION WHILE I EXPECT YOUR RESPONSE FOR MORE
 BRIEFING FROM ME, BUT IF ON THE OTHER HAND YOU
 CONSIDER YOUR SELF NOT CAPABLE AND FIT OF HANDLING
 THIS BECAUSE OF THE VOLUME OF CASH INVOLVE, YOU CAN
 HOLD CONFIDENTIAL BY INFORMING ME, HENCE I MAY
 APPROVE YOUR CONTACT OF ANY OF YOUR TRUSTED CLOSE
 CONFIDANT YOU FEEL CAN KEEP THIS CONFIDENTIAL AND
 CAPABLE OF HANDLING SUCH BECAUSE OF HIS LEVEL OF
 KNOWLEDGE IN INVESTMENT AND CASH FLOW IN HIS
 BUSINESS.
 
IF YOUR READY TO GIVE US A FUTURE HOPE, DO NOT
HESITATE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME THROUGH MY E-MAIL
ADDRESSES
fedi10@diplomats.com,fedi_nokiri@diplomats.com and
fedi_nokiri@mailcity.com,THEN I WILL BE VERY OBLIGED
TO GIVE YOU FURTHER INFORMATION. 
 

 MAY GOD BLESS YOU.
 
 FEDI NOKIRI

              (VERY URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION)
Dear Director,

In order to transfer out (US$ 68 Million) Sixty
Eight Million United States Dollars) from African
Development Bank. I have picked-up the trust and
Courage to write you this letter with divine confidence that you
are a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this
important business transaction believing also that you will never
let me down either now or in the future.
My name is DR.J.C.EKE, a senior Auditing Officer with the African
Development bank (ADB) in South Africa. There is an account opened
in this bank in 1980 and since 1990 nobody has operated on this
account again. After going through some old files in the records,
I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it
would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr.
Fernando Carlos, a foreigner, he was a miner at Kruger gold
company, a geologist by profession, and he died since 1990. No
other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it,
the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved
to me as well that this company does not know anything about this
account and the amount involved is (US$68 Million) Sixty Eight
million United States Dollars. I want to first transfer (US$40
Million) Forty million united States Dollars from this money into
a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest. I am contacting
you based on the fact that you are a foreigner, because this money
can only be approved for payment to a foreigner, more so it can
not be approved by any local bank here, as this money is in US
Dollars hence the former owner of this account is a foreigner too.
I Know that this proposal will come to you as a surprise as we
don't know ourselves before, however i got your contact from your
Embassy's Commercial Attaché.
However, I did not disclose the purpose of my intention to anybody
in the Embassy. Although we will still have to meet possibly, sign
some agreement before the final transfer of the fund into any of
your chosen designated bank account.
I have involved a very senior official in the operational
department and we have agreed that after the transfer of the money
into your account, you shall be entitled to 15% of the total sum,
we the officials will take 80% while the remaining 5% will be for
processing cost we may incur here and there during this
transaction.
All necessary precautions have been taken to ensure a risk free
situation on the side of the both parties.
Please note that this deal can only take place on the following
conditions: -
1.you will provide the bank account and other relevant
particulars/information for easy and onward Remittance of this
money.
2.Absolute confidentiality and sincerity will be required and
guaranteed, considering our (me and my partners) positions in the
bank.
3.Assurance that our own due shares will be released to us in good
faith when this money finally gets into your account. This
transaction will last for some days as soon as we hear from you.

Please treat with utmost confidentiality.
Contact me as quickly as possible through my e-mail box or above
tell/fax.
Expecting your urgent response,
Best Regards,

Yours faithfully,

DR.J.C.EKE

NNPC LAGOS ANNEX OFFICE, VICTORIA ISLAND, LAGOS-NIGERIA. Dear
C.E.O./President May I crave your indulgence to open this business
discussion by a formalletter of this sort. It is pertinent that a business
of this magnitude should have commenced properly with a formal meeting of
you and us to enable us know ourselves, have a fore knowledge of the nature
of the business, discuss and acquaint ourselves with heresponsibilities and
functions of parties concerned, and appropriate shares ccordingly. However,
for time factor, confidentiality and personality of people nvolved here in
Nigeria, we choose this approach for the remittance of this Twenty Seven
Million U.S. Dollars (US$27M). Please bear with us for making the initial
contact through e-mail. But my partners are insisting for a meeting in order
not to fall into awrong hand again. I am Dr. John Abass, we are members of
the special committee for Budget and Planning of the Ministry Petroleum.
This committee is principally concerned with contract appraisal and the
approval of the contracts in order of priorities as regards capital projects
of the past military government of Nigeria With our ositions, we have
successfully secured for ourselves this sum of Twenty Seven Million U.S.
Dollars (US$27M). This amount was accumulated through undeclared windfall
sales of crude oil during the gulf war. Hence together with two of our top
officials at the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), we plan to
transfer this amount of money into a secure overseas account by awarding a
sort of contract from the NNPC. To this effect I have been given the mandate
by my colleagues to contact you and ask for your assistance. What we need
from you is to provide a nice account in which the funds will be
transferred. My colleagues and I have agreed to compensate you or the owner
of the account used for this transaction with 30% of the total amount
emitted. We shall have 65% and the remaining 5% reserved for taxes and other
miscellaneous expenses in your country. It may interest you to know that
last two years a similar transaction as carried out with one Mr. Patrice
Miller, the President of CraineInternational Trading Corporation at number
135 East 57th Street, 28th Floor, New York, NY 10022 with telephone number
(212)308-7788 and telex number 6731689. After the agreement between both
partners in which he was to take 20% of the money while the remaining 80%
for us. With all the required documents signed, the money was duly
transferred into this account only to be disappointed on our arrival in New
York, and we were reliably informed that Mr. Patrice Miller was no longer on
that address while his telephone and telex numbers have been reallocated to
somebody else. That was how we lost US$11 Million to Mr. Patrice Miller.
This time around we need a more reliable and trustworthy person or a
reputable company to do business with hence this letter to you. So if you
can prove yourself to be trusted and interested in this deal then we are
prepared to do business with you. What we want from you is the assurance
that you will let us have our share if this amount (US$27M) is transferred
into your account. If this proposal is okay by you, then reply through my
email urgently so that we can set the all rolling and negotiate the
modalities involved. Kindly, treat as very important and strictly
confidential, I honestly assure you that this transaction is 100% risk-free.
I look forward to your response and expected co-operation . Regards, Dr.
John Abass

to contact you for a very confidential business transaction of mutual
benefit.

During our verification exercise, we came across an over-invoiced
contract(Contract No: NNPC/PED/1473/96). This contract was awarded in
July,1996 and completed
in August, 1998, and the original contractor has since been paid his
contract sum leaving the over-invoiced sum of US$25.5m(Twenty Five
Million,Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) This amount have been left floating in
our account with the Central Bank of Nigeria, until our recent
discovery. My colleagues
and I have decided to seek for the assistance of a reliable foreign
partner into whose account the fund will be transferred into for our own
use. If this proposal is acceptable to you, a Deed of Transfer of the
above contract will be obtained on your behalf,
to empower you as the legal beneficiary of the contract and the sum to
be transferred.

All necessary and relevant documents will be procured for the release
and transfer of the fund into your nominated account. An application for
foreign exchange
allocation will be made on your behalf from my office to the federal
ministry of finance (FMF) and the Central Bank of Nigeria(CBN) for the
subsequent release and transfer of the fund into your nominated account.
Be informed that we are working in collaboration with top officials of
the federal ministry of finance and the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)who
will assist us in the transfer of the fund.
With your cooperation the success of this transaction is guaranteed.

We have agreed to compensate you with 25% of the total sum and , 70%
will befor me and my colleagues here, while the remaining 5%have been
mapped-out for
miscellaneous expensesthat might be incurred by both parties during the
course of thistransaction. Allthings being equal, this transaction will
be concluded within 14working days upon the day of receipt of your
response.You are required to fax us
your nominated bank account details and your direct telephone and fax
numbers. Please treat this transaction with top priority and remember to

To: xxxxxxxxxx
Subject: VERY URGENT

Dear Sir,

NB: Send your reply through my direct and private email:
kimos73@justice.com 

Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality in this
transaction. This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly
confidential and top secret.

My name is Kimo Savimbi. I am the immediate past director for supply and
purchases for the National Union for the total Independence of Angola.
(UNITA) The UNITA was a rebel Group that was led by my brother Mr. Jonas
Savimbi who fought for 3 decades for total democracy of Angola. 

We were in control of the Northeast region of Angola with widely
scattered alluvial diamond including some of the world finest gems
stones.

The UNITA had survived the War because of the deposit of diamond in the
area they control. The War was solely financed through proceeds from
sales of diamond to foreign countries.  

In February 2002, UNITA placed a secret order for the purchase of
Military Equipments   from a Russian Company totaling  $25.5 million US
dollars. 

Three days later the UNITA leader, Mr. Jonas Savimbi died as a result of
bullets wound he sustained from the opposition group. After his death,
other rebel factions signed a cease-fire agreement with President Dos
Santos on April 4th 2002.

Now that everything has calmed down, the Angola government has offered a
sweeping amnesty to the entire rebel soldiers who lay down their arms.
Nobody has an idea of the transaction with the Russian company except my
late brother Jonas Savimbi and myself.

I have contacted the Russian firm of the development that the purchased
Military Equipment were no longer needed as we have called for a
cease-fire. In a reply from the Russian firm, they will deduct 5% of the
funds before refunds can be made. This is part of there policy for
refunds of payment made.
 
I instructed the Russian firm to deposit the balance with a finance
company in Europe. The funds were deposited with a security pin code.
All other relevant documents are in my possession. I still have with me
diamond weighing about 700gs.  

Now that everything has calmed down and nobody nor my Government has
been able to detect the transaction. I am willing to make use of the
funds for investment purpose overseas. I am compelled to seek your
assistance to relate with the finance/security company in Europe to
claim this fund. I will give to you all relevant information and
document that will support your claim. I want us to be partners in the
claim, execution and the investment of this fund.

In recognition of the assistance you will be rendering to me, I am
willing to give 20% of this fund. Just in case there are expenses to
incur through local tax and correspondence I am also willing to set
aside 10% of this fund to handle that. The remaining 70% will be kept
for me for investment purposes.

Considering the amount of money involved and the fact that we have not
met each other, this transaction will be based on the following terms:

a.	My conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence
b.	That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy, and
confidentiality.
c.	That upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as
instructed by me after you have deducted your share of 20% and whatever
tax from the 10%

I want to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free, as this
does not have anything to do with my Government.

If this is accepted by you contact me immediately through my retune
email address.
 
Regards,  

KIMO SAVIMBI

discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files
in the records I discovered that the owner of the
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. the owner
of this account is  Mr.  Magnus leon, a foreigner, and
a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993. and  no other
person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that Magnus

million [$52,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount

United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, without valid international

license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us
dPOST
1.0ollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr.

to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before
we
fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your

Att: DIRECTOR,
Dear,

     I am Miss ANN KAMARA, a Sierra Leonean residing
 in Dakar Senegal, West Africa.

 You will be surprise to receive this mail from a
total
 stranger like me, Anyway, I got your contact through
 internet and decided to approach you for assistance.

  My father late Chief JOHNSON KAMARA  was one of the
 prominent Gold & Diamond dealers in my country
 Sierra Leone, also the traditional ruler of my home
 town before He was murdered in cold blood early
 last two years alongside with my mother by the Rebels

 of R.U.F when they invaded the town.

   When I got home from school to see the remains of
my
 late father and other family members,I discovered
 that my home had been burnt down and my parents were
 both murdered by the Rebels of R.U.F that has been
 fighting against the legitimate Government in my
 country since 1992.

   My late father deposited the sum of $12,500.000USD
 (TWELVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR) as a
 Family treasure in a trust security company here in
 Dakar Senegal, West Africa before his untimely death,
 this money was meant to be use to build an Ultral
 Mordern Medical Clinic here in Dakar Senegal for me
 and my brother after We shall have completed our
 studies but untimely death of our parents have denied
 us this good opportunity.

   Now,as the remaining body of the family also next
 of kin to benefit the money, We have made up our
 maind I and my younger brother KENNETH to foward
 claims of ownership of the box containing the money
 with the Security Company, but We need a reliable
 person through whom we could move the money abroad
 and who will subsequently help us to invest the
 money wisely while I go back to school to complete
 my education.

   Bear in mind that We would entrust this money in
 your hands if you would be willing to help us in this
 matter I have negotiated with my younger brother
 to give you 20% of the total sum if you will assist
 us.

   please get back to me promptly so that we can
 discuss the modalities of making this smoothly.

   I will equally insist that you make it a very
 private and confidentil matter please.

   I look forward to hear from you soonest.

   Kind Regard,
   MISS ANN KAMARA.

Dear Sir,

I am ENGR. ROBERT LUMBE, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am
Director of Auditing and Project Implementation with the Ministry of
Mineral & Energy. First and Foremost, I apologize for using this medium to
reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to
the confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed
that a member of the South African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who
was with the Government delegation to your Country during a trade
exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me I have decided
to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal
described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep
it as top secret because of the nature of the transaction.

Within the Ministry of Mineral and Energy where I work as a Director, and
with the co-operation of four other top officials, we have in our
possession as overdue payment bills totaling Fourteen Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$14,500,000.00) which we want to
transfer abroad with the assistance and co-operation of a foreign company
who will receive the said funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign
non-company account to receive such funds. Moreso, we are handicapped in
this circumstances as the South African Civil Service Code of Conduct does
not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in this
whole transaction.

This amount US$14,500,000.00 represents the balance of the total contract
value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm,
which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual
contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving behind the
balance in the tune of the said amount which we have by principle gotten
approval by Key Tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T.) to any foreign bank
account you will provide by filling an application through the Justice
Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and priviledges
of the former contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partner involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30%
of the $14.5M, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses.
The business itself is 100% safe on your part provided you treat it with
utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also, your area of specialization is
not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.

Endeavour to contact me immediately through my direct telephone number
0027732289020 or send a fax to 0027732289021 whether or not you are
interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for
another foreign partner to carry out this deal.

And please remember to treat this matter as very confidential because we
will not comprehend any form of exposures as we are still in active
Government service and also remember that time is of the essence in this
business. I await your response in anticipation of your fullest
co-operation.

Yours faithfully, 

Engr. Robert Lumbe

TUNDE HASSAN & ASSOCIATE
SOLICITORS & ADVOCATES
NO 47 OPEBI ROAD IKEJA
LAGOS
NIGERIA.


Dear Sir,
Before I start,I must first Apologies for this
unsolicited mail to you.I am aware that this is
certainly an unconventional approach to starting a
relationship but as time goes on you will realize the
need for my action.

My name is Tunde Hassan a Solicitor and the personal Attorney to the
Executive Director of an oil company from your country, who worked in
conjuction with an Oil company in Nigeria to execute a contract which was
awarded to them.Here in after referred to as my Client.

On the 21st of April 1999,my client,his wife and their
three children were involved in a Ghastly motor
accident along Sagamu Express road.My Client and his
entire family unfortunately lost their lives in the
accident.Since then I have made several enquiries to
your Embassy to locate any of my Client's extended
relatives which has proved abortive.After these
several unsuccessful attempts, hence the need to contact you.

My main reason for contacting you is to assist me in
repatriating the money and properties left behind by
my Client before they are confiscated or declared
unservicable by the bank where they are deposited and
lodged.Particularly the Union Bank PLC where the
deceased has a fixed sum of Nine Million United States
Dollars.The said bank has issued me a final notice to
provide the next of kin of my Client or they will be
left with no other choice than to confiscate his
funds.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating my clients
relatives for the past two years I seek your consent
to present you as the next of kin of my client,going
by the fact that you are from the same country,
that the said fund as stated above i.e the sum of Nine
million United States Dollars can be paid to you
instead of leaving for it for Union Bank Plc,we can
take part of it and leave the rest for Charity.

I have all necessary legal documents that can be used
to back up any claim we may make.All I require is your
honest co-operation to enable us see this arrangement
through.

I guarantee that this will be executed under a
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any
breach of the law.Please reply by this email address
above.

Finally kindly give me your confidential Phone and fax
numbers so that I can communicate with you easily.

Best regards,


Barrister Tunde Hassan

FROM:DR JOHN YASA THE DIRECTOR AUDIT 
AND ACCOUNTS UNIT IN I/B/A
INTERNATIONAL BANK OF AFRICA
20 REU DE COMMERCE BP 3302
LOME REPUBLIC OF TOGO.
Tel:00228-990-37-09.     (STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL) 

Dear Sir,

I am Dr.John Yasa, the director in charge of Auditing and 
Accounting unit of internatonal bank fo Africa Lome-Togo in 
west Africa with due respect and regard. I have decided to 
contact you on a business transaction that will be very 
beneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction .

During our investigation and auditing in this bank, my 
department came across a very huge sum of money belonging to a 
deceased person A japanese engineer Toshie Yamaguchi 
international business man who died on november 5th 1997 in a 
plane crash and the fund has been dormant in his account with 
this Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody either 
from his family or relation before our discovery to this 
development.

Although personally, I keep this information secret within 
myself and partners to enable the whole plans and idea be 
Profitable and successful during the time of execution.

The said amount was us$16.8M (systen million eight hundred 
thousand United State Dollars). 


As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive 
information through chamber of commerce on foreign business 
relations here in Lome- Togo.

Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund 
as the bonafide next of kin to the deceased, get the required 
approval and transfer this money to a foreign account has been 
put in place and directives and needed information will be 
relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and 
willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this 
great business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my 
position in this country as a civil servant, we are not allowed 
to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eye 
brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in 
this bank. This is the actual reason why it will require a 
second party or fellow who will forward claims as the (next of 
kin )with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank and also 
present a foreign account where he will need the money to be re-
transferred into on his request as it may be after due 
verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of 
the bank where the whole money will be remitted to your own 
designation bank account.

I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% 
risk free. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will 
be entitled to 25% of the total sum as gratification, while 5% 
will be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise 
during the time of transfer and also telephone bills, while 70% 
will be for me and my partners.

Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are 
still in service and intend to retire from service after we 
conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring the whole 
situation here in this bank until you confirm the money in your 
account. and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent 
sharing of the fund according to percentages previously 
indicated and further investment, either in your country or any 
country you may advice us to invest in.  

All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear 
from you. 

I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your 
wish in this deal. 

Yours faithfully,
Dr.John Yasa

JOHN SESE SEKO 
TOGO-LOME
 
Dear Sir,
 
I  know this proposal might come to you as a surprise.
My knowing you is an ark of God.
 
I was convinced as to solicit for your support and
assistance after reading your profile.
I am K. Sese-Seko, the son of the former
president of Zaire now Democratic Republic of Congo
former president of Zaire now Democratic Republic of
Congo(President Mobutu Sese-Seko) my father was
violently overthrown from the Office on May 13,1998 by
forces loyal to rebel leader LAURENT KABILA
 
Following the overthrown which forced my father into
exile to Morocco in North Africa where he later died.
With the overthrown and unfortunate death of my
father, the  Joseph Kabila's Government seized all my
father^Òs Bank Account and family business invested in
some African Countries and that has rendered the
family
helpless. Recently, our family house in Switzerland
was auctioned by Kabila Government and the proceed was
repatriated to the same Government. With this
development, the family has empowered me to seek for
any honest and God fearing individual who will assist
in transferring the huge amount of US$45 million to a
less tax account overseas.
 
I have deposited this money with a private Security
and Finance Trust Company in  Lome-Togo one of the
African Countries as GOLD DUST. This money is part of
the fund set aside by my father for the purchase of
arms and ammunitions worth US$60million through
independent arm dealers in Russia which some of it
(US$15m has used during the power tussle between my
father and Kabila. I was arrested and detained when
Joseph Kabila discovered that I am signatory to
President Mobutu^Òs account in switzerland.

I was smuggled out of detention with the
help of my close friends who are now serving under
President Joseph Kabila. I escaped from the Country
through the Congo river with the help of fishermen. I
am now residing temporarily in Lome-Togo. Now that
Kabila has died. He was assassinated on January 16th
2001, his son (Joseph Kabila) has taken over the
Government. The state of the Government is still in
fear.
 
All I want from you is to come to Lome-Togo, West
Africa, where we will hold a meeting and proceed to
the Security Company where you will see the money
yourself and you assist to negotiate for the transfer
of the fund into your overseas Bank Account, this
transaction will not take more than 2-3days from your
arrival date. The family has resolve that 25% will be
your share for your assistance in this purpose and
other assistance you will be given in this regard. 5%
will be mapped out to pay local and International
expenses which may be incurred in the process of
securing this money. 70% is for the family Financial
needs and for investment overseas with your
comprehenssive advice. If my proposal are Ok, you are
required to forward your reply through my email box.

Upon receipt of your favourable response, I will
advice the Security Company to change the Beneficiary
right to your name for easy transfer of the into your
Your account overseas.
 
Please, feel free to ask any question and seek for
explanations if required.
 
Best regards,
 
JOHN SESE SEKO

Dear Sir/Madam.

It is rather obvious that we have never communicated before, the story is
rather too sad and at such should be taken serious, but forgive me and
discard this email if you are not interested.

I am Mr. Daisy Ho Yuen, presently working with Mansion House Group Limited
13/A Kornhill Metro Tower Quarry Bay, Hong Kong. We are into investment
and financial service company, and listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong
Kong. Mr. Andrew Tse Chan, who is a staff of Hung Kuk Enterprises Company-
Unit B, 33/Z, Charm hill Center, No.57 Hill wood Road, Tsimshatsui,
Kowloon, Hong Kong died in a Chinese airliner Russian-built Tupolev which
came down at Ruian, about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Wenzhou airport in
eastern Zhejiang province with more than 60 people aboard crashed in
eastern China during a domestic flight on February 24, 1999.

Until his death, he left some valuable Deposits under our Security Vaults
worth $169,000.000(One hundred and Sixty Nine million Dollars) All stacked
in Boxes.

This valuable has been under our custody for over three years and nobody
has come since to claim them, due to the fact that Mr. Andrew Himself kept
it under secret code.

The Senior Executives of my Company has arranged to share this valuables
come October 1st 2002,without considering we the junior staffs, I feel
very dejected and has no other alternative of getting something out of
this than introducing a neutral person that will come and stand as the
Heir and claim the Estate of Andrew.

I will go into his personal file to get out his personal details, codes
and any relevant information that will be useful to you. I shall give you
all the photocopies of Certificate and details in his file with an
Affidavit from Hong Kong Judiciary, with all these proofs shown to them,
the Security company would not have any alternative than to release The
valuables to you, which includes four boxes of about $43,000.000. (Forty
Three Million Dollars Each).

I shall duly compensate you if assisted.

Thanks

REQUEST FOR AN IMPORT/EXPORT PARTNERSHIP.

Let me commence by first expressing my most sincere apology for infringing
on your privacy
as I am an uninvited guest to your address. I got your e-mail address from
an Internet listing,
let us immediately put your mind to rest in that regard.

We are interested in the purchase and importation of certain goods into our
country, with
funds, which are presently trapped in this same country, Nigeria. In order
to commence this
business and achieve our goal, we need your assistance in the release of the
said trapped
funds and ultimately, your receipt and custody of these funds abroad. But
before I proceed
any further, I crave your indulgence and confidence in this communication
and transaction
in the long run, this is necessitated by virtue of this proposal as being
utterly confidential
and
classified.

We are top officials of a major Government parastatal (name withheld) here
in Nigeria, and
due to our very membership of this parastatal, we are privy to the
information I am about to
vaguely reveal to you in trust and confidence as obtained in the urgent
business
relationship
we solicit for. We crave your indulgence for total confidentiality.

Explicitly, the source of this fund is as follows:
During the regime of our late head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha, the then
Military officials set
up private companies and lobbied the award of contracts to their companies,
these
contract were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries all in the bid for
self-enrichment by
these military men. Fortunately, after the mysterious death of the head of
state followed by
the collapse of the military dictatorship, the current civilian Government
set up a body to
look
into the activities of the past military regime. We hold exalted
designations/positions this
recently set up panel and we have successfully identified several inflated
contract funds,
which are presently floating in coded terms and accounts at the Central Bank
of Nigeria.

We desire to release and use for the purpose stated above a particular
contract entitlement
from the very several, but due to our position as civil servants and members
of this body, we
cannot acquire this fund in our names and without a much needed foreign
assistance. My
colleagues have therefore delegated me as a matter of trust to source for an
overseas
partner into whose account the sum of US$31,000,000.00 (Thirty-one Million
United States
Dollars),
being the contract entitlement of this particular contract will be
transferred into, hence this
written
request.

Upon the success of this transaction, which is after the receipt of the fund
into your
account and the use of the funds for the purchase of the desired goods, we
propose a
sharing
ratio as thus:

1. 70% for us (the officials)
2. 20% for the foreign partner (you)
3. 10% for the reconciliation of all expenses, including taxation and all
foreign costs
incurred by you during the course of the transaction and also for
reconciliation of all local
expenses incurred by all parties involved on the home front during the
course of this
transaction.

Please do not have the erroneous impression that the monies are going to
come to you that
easily. You will have to earn it as nothing good comes that easily. As they
say, there is no
free lunch in America. Your complete dedication and commitment to the course
will be
required
and also the need for you to personally go, as the beneficiary, to any of
the Nigerian
Government's
Foreign Payment offices in Europe to claim the contract entitilments .

Basically, what we are doing is to use you as a front to get these monies
transferred out of
this country. However, we shall equally require your assistance in advising
us on good
investment opportunities in your country as we intend to invest a
substantial part of our
share of the funds in your country. We are poor civil servants (Government
workers) who
are presented with a lifetime opportunity to secure our future and those of
our immediate
families
in particular and the suffering masses in general.

Please note that this transaction is 100% safe and hitch free, devoid of any
form of
uncertainty in its entire ramification. We hope that the funds can arrive
your account within
ten (10) banking days from the date of our receipt of some relevant details
that I shall
intimate you
with in my next correspondence. The required details will enable us write
letters of claim and
job
description respectively. This way, we will use your already existing
company name or
initiate one for
you (or as applicable) to prepare the necessary and solid documentary
foundation
necessary to re-
award the contract in your company name and prepare an application for fund
release/payments with
you as the beneficiary.

Please acknowledge receipt of this letter using either telephone/fax number
already
provided above (234 1 7742619) or respond via e-mail, so I can bring you
into the complete
picture of this
pending project as soon as possible.

We are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your
confidentiality in this
transaction.

Yours Faithfully,
Dr. David Bonoh.

ASIDE TO REFUND EXPENSES MADE IN THE COURSE OF THI
TRANSACTION. BE ASSURED
THAT THIS BUSINESS IS RISK-FREE BUT THE KEYWORD IS THE

HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS  CHIKE UBAH
TRADITIONAL RULER,
ELEME AUTHONOMOUS COMMUNITY,
ELEME,
ENUG STATE, NIGERIA

Dear Friend,

This letter might surprise you because; we have not met neither in person
nor by correspondence. But I believe it is one day that you get know
somebody either in physical or through correspondence.

I got your contact through some discreet inquiry from Chamber of commerce
and world trade journal; Eurasia and United States business guide In
Nigeria. Then I was convinced that you and your organization were quite
astute in private entrepreneurships, one has no doubt in your ability to
handle a financial business transaction.  How ever I am the first son of
his Royal Majesty Chief Daniel Ubah the traditional ruler of Eleme
Province in the Oil area of Rivers State Nigeria.

I am making this contact to you in respect of US $ 23,000,000.00
(23Million, United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late father,
this money was accumulated from royalties paid to my father as
compensation by the oil Firm located in our area as a result of oil
presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of
livelihood, My community produces 50%of the total annual crude oil
production in Nigeria and 0.5% of the dollar value of each barrel is paid
to my father as royalty by the Federal government and in his position as
the royal head and chairman of Eleme Oil Trust Fund.

Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But before his
death he called my attention and my mother and informed us that he lodged
some funds in boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary, the
Lodgments Security Code Number was also revealed to us, he then advised us
to look for a reliable business partner abroad, who will assist me in
investing the money in a lucrative business as a result of economic
instability in Nigeria. So this is the major reason why I am contacting
you for us to move this money from the security firm to any country of
your choice for investments purposes. Another vital factor is that, due to
my political ambition in order to beat the political code of Conduct
Bureau.  I do not want anybody here to know that I inherited such a big
money to avoid Disqualification by the commission on my intended political
interest. So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so That the
funds can be moved in your name and Particulars to any c ountry o f your
choice where it will be claimed and invested.

Hence my father had Intimated the security firm personnel that the
Beneficiary of the box is his foreign partner whose Particulars will be
forwarded to the firm when due.  But I will guide you accordingly. As soon
as the fund reaches you, I will then come over to meet you in person, so
that we can discuss Physically on Investment Potentials.  Based on this
Assistance my family and I have unanimously decided to give you 20% of the
total money, 2% for Charity homes abroad.  5% for expenses, which might
arise during the Transaction, fax and phone bills inclusively 73% you will
assist me in investing for my family. I here guarantee you that this money
is not government money.  It is not drug money and it is not money from
arms deals.  Please kindly maintain a high degree of confidentiality on
this matter.  I will give you more details immediately I get your swift
response.  Please note that all our communication can be through my
e-mail.  This was due to the sensitivity of this matter.  Do not send
anything to me by surface mail to avoid interception by wrong hands.

Please if you are not interested kindly contact me immediately, so that I
can look for another contact.  I am waiting for your quick response.  I
hope this is the beginning of a prosperous Relationship between my family
and your family.

Yours faithfully,
His Royal Majesty Chike Ubah (Ph.D.) 

On behalf of the family.

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 152,000.000.00 USD)
One hundred and Fifty two million United States
Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to 
quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who

can serve to receive this money, as long as you will
remain honest to me till the end for this important
business trusting in  you and believing  in God that
you  will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Dr Maris Nekeson, the Auditor General of a bank
in
Africa, during the course of our auditing  I  
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files
in the records I discovered that the owner of the
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. the owner
of this account is  Mr.  Magnus leon, a foreigner, and
a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993. and  no other
person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that Magnus
Leon until his death was the manager  Magnus
Coy.(pty). SA.  

We will start the  first transfer with fifty two
million [$52,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account.

The amount involved is (USD 152M) One hundred and
Fifty two million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $52,000.000 [fifty two million
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us
dPOST

HTTP/1.0ollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr.
Magnus Leon is a foreigner too, [and the money can
only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement,  to bind us
together   I got your contact address  from the Girl

with believe in God that you will never let me down in
this business,  you are the first and the only person
that I am contacting for this business, so please
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you 
are  capable  and will meet up with instruction of  a
key bank official who is deeply involved with me in
this business.
I need your strong assurance that you will never,
never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately

and to build confidence  you can  come immediately  to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us will
fly to your country at least two days ahead of the
money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately

this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries

during the process of transferring.

To: ...
Subject: More Details



DEAR ...,

 Infact it is the work of God because i told my
secartary to look for a person that will do the
business with me,after he told me that he have e-mail
you for the business, i said ok.
 Considering your positive responses and in my
anticipation of a strong and solid cooperation from
your side  in this business, infact I am very much
interested to know whether you will be capable to do
this business with me in full confidence trusting that
you will never let me down in future,ok (1) if you are
really serious and have the facilities for effective
communications,ability to set up a new A/C under short
notice ,even an empty A/C without any money in it
provided that the A/C can receive money is still ok.
(2) you must have a valid international passport or
traveling documents then, contact me with the
following
Nos.874-762727947,871-762727947,870-762727947fax
No.874-762727949 if you want to call my No. dial the
way you use to call other countries, do not put South
African area code, because it is a satellite phone,
this business will be completed within Seven days from
the date of the receipt of your A/C details and
subsequent approvals from the Foreign Exchange control
division.
Be rest assured that this business is risk and trouble
 free,and i assure you 100% success in this
transaction.

You should not tell your bank that money is coming
until I finish processing of all documents to show
your bank that this money is clean money from genuine
source. To avoid your bank asking you early questions
that you may not be able to answer so you should not
alert.

After the processing of all Foreign Payment documents,
and when the money is ready to be paid into your A/C,
after the final Approval in your favour by the bank
you be required to come in person or go to Foreign
Payment Office to sign the Foreign Payment vouchers
preceding telegraphic TT to you're A/C or you can
appoint a Lawyer here to represent and sign on your
behalf under special arrangement. At the Foreign
Payment Office you be required to fill the payment
Order chart specifying schedule of payments to
beneficiaries A/C. 

However it is my intention to be with  you at least
2-3days ahead of the money going into your A/C then we
will sign the binding agreement, after your bank must
have been satisfied with the original documents which
I will bring along with me to your country to show
your bank or it's correspondence bank that the money
is legal.

You should know that this opportunity can hardly come
my way again in life so I have planned everything very
well with an insider in the bank so be rest assured
that everything will work out fine fine. My secretary
only got your contact from the internet and I am sure
she doesn't know you before being that I told her to
get me a foreigners contact address because the
original operator of the A/C is a foreigner and this
money can only be approved into a foreign
beneficiaries A/C only, frankly speaking from the
bottom of my heart my fear now is the security of this
money in your custody once transferred into your A/C
because I don't know you before nor your capability
and facilities to handle this large amount, what is
your age and profession? I really want to know more of
you and I will want you to keep it very confidential
at all times and also to be maintaining constant
communications with me knowing that this business
should take precedence over any other business for the
mean time. Now I need the A/C information and your
private tele nos as a need may arise either to call
you in the day or night as occasion warrants.

Finally you have to be following instructions which I
will be getting from the "OUR' insider' in the bank
who is the main Key to the success of this
business.Pls respond without much questions until we
see face to face because 'too many questions can sink
a ship'
It's urgent you call so that I can brief you regarding
the foreign payment procedures, because you will be
required to come and sign the final fund release order
either here in South Africa, or at the Foreign Payment
Office attached to the Embassy in Holland. 
Yours,
Maris.

Dear Sir, 

I am Onome Efe, Bank Manager of Zenith Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent
and very confidential businessproposition for you. On June 6, 1997, a
Foreign Oilconsultant/contractor with the Nigerian NationalPetroleum
Corporation, Mr.Barry Kelly made a numberedtime (Fixed) Deposit for twelve
calendar months,valued at US$26,500,000.00, (Twenty-six Million,
fivehundred thousand Dollars) in my branch. Uponmaturity, I sent a routine
notification to hisforwarding address but got no reply. After a month,
Isent a reminder and finally I discovered from hiscontract employers, the
Nigerian National PetroleumCorporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from
anautomobile accident. On further investigation, I foundout that he died
without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was
fruitless. Itherefore made further investigation and ! discoveredthat Mr.
Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official
documents, includinghis Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$26,500,000.00 has carefully been moved out of mybank to a security
company for safekeeping. No onewill ever come forward to claim it.
According toNigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years,themoney
will revert to the ownership of the NigerianGovernment if nobody applies
to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you asan
Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money Ideposited it in a
security company in two trunk boxesthough the security company does not
know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to bephotographic
materials for export. I am writing you because I as a public servant
(Manager with thebank), I cannot operate a foreign account or have anac!
count that is more than $1m. I want to present youas the owner of the
boxes in the security company soyou can be able to claim them with the
help of myattorney. This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately
your full names and address so that theAttorney will prepare the necessary
documents whichwill put you in place as the owner of the boxes. The money
will be moved out for us to share in the ratioof 70% for me and 30% for
you. There is no risk atall as all the paperwork for this transaction will
be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the successful execution
of this transaction, pleasereply immediately via my email address. Upon
yourresponse, I shall then provide you with more detailsand relevant
documents that will help you understandthe transaction.

Thanks and God bless,


Onome Efe.

Attn.,  
 
First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction. This
is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and "top secret".  
We are top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel who
are interested in importation of goods into our country with funds that
are presently trapped in Nigeria. In order to commence this business, we
solicit your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the
said-trapped funds.

The source of the fund is as follows: During the regime of the last
Military transitional government of Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, government
officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts which were
grossly over invoiced in various ministries. The present democratic
government of President Olusegun Obasanjo set up the Contract Review Panel
and we have identified a lot of inflated contract funds that are presently
floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment. However, by
virtue of our position as civil servants and members of this panel, we
cannot acquire this money in our names. I have therefore been delegated as
a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for an oversea
partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of US$31,320,000.00
(Thirty-One Million, Three Hundred and Twenty thousand United States
Dollars) in which we hope to use in purchasing Agro Allied equipment, and
to enable us to own properties and invest in the stable economy of your
country. Hence, we are sending you this email message. We have agreed to
share the money thus:


1. 20% for the account owner (you) 
2. 70% for us (the officials of the CRP) 
3. 10% to be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses. 

Due to our poor Telecommunication system and for purpose of strict
confidentiality you are to respond via Fax No: 234 17590503 or e-mail:  
edbrume1452@techemail.com Please acknowledge receipt of this message for
proper briefing on the safe modality for the execution.

Yours faithfully 
Dr. Edward Brume

           (URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL)

   (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}
  ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas account($ 126,000.000.00 USD) One 
hundred and twenty six million United States Dollars) from a Prime 
Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to  quietly  look for a reliable 
and honest person who will be capable  and fit to provide either 
an existing bank account  or  to set up a new Bank a/c immediately 
to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this 
money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for 
this important business trusting in  you and believing  in God 
that you  will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr,Boniface Eze.  the Auditor General of one of the prime 
banks here South Africa, during the course of our
auditing,I discovered a floating fund  in an account
opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has
operated on this account again, after going through
some old files in the records I discovered that the
owner of the account died without a [heir]  hence  the
money is floating and  if I do not remit this money
out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The
owner of this account is  Mr.  Allan P.Seaman, a
foreigner, and an industrialist, and  he died,  since
1993. and  no other person knows about this account or
any thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that Allan P. Seaman   until his death was the manager
  Diamond Safari  [pty]. SA.

We will start the  first transfer with twenty six
million [$26,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest
amount to your account.

The amount involved is (USD 126 M) One hundred and
twenty six million United States Dollars only. I want
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty six million
United States Dollar] from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I
don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you
as a foreigner because this money can not be approved
to a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or
drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money is
in US dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr.
Allan P. Seaman is a foreigner too,and the money can
only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind
us together. I got your contact address  from the
Girl who operates my computer,  I am revealing this to
you with believe in God that you will never let me
down
in this business,  you are the first and the only
person that I am contacting for this business, so
please reply urgently so that I will inform you the
next step to take urgently. Send also your private
telephone and fax number including the full details of
the account to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence
and to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any
account of  your choice where the fund will be safe.
Before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing
and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work
fine, Because the management is ready to approve
this payment to any foreigner who has correct
information of this account, which I will give to you,
upon your positive response and once I am convinced
that you are  capable  and will meet up with
instruction of  a key bank official who is deeply
involved with me in this business. I need your strong
assurance that you will never,  never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will  destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us
will fly to your country at least two days ahead of
the
money going into the  account. I will apply for annual
leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you
are ready to act and receive this fund in your
account. I will use my position and influence to
obtain all legal approvals for  onward transfer of
this money to your account with appropriate clearance
 from  the relevant  ministries and foreign exchange
departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while
5% will be for expenses both parties might have
incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my
email address.

Yours truly

Mr,Boniface Eze.

    [ Some characters may be displayed incorrectly. ]

It is with heart felt hope that I write to seek your
co-operation and
assistance regarding our family ^Sinheritance^T which
needs to be moved
out Nigeria quickly. I am Robert Ige, the
eldest son of crowned
late Chief Ajibola James Ige (SAN), former Governor of
Oyo State (1979
^V 1983), Minister of Steel and Power (1999 ^V 2001) and
later the 
attorney
General and minister of Justice of Federation until
his death by 
assassination.

My father was gunned down on 23rd December 2001 in his
family house by
three yet to be identified gunmen gang and was rushed
to hospital where
he died five hours later. My family does not know the
motive behind the
assassination but it becoming increasingly clear that
my father fell
victim of political conspiracy with business interest.
The Federal 
Government
is investigating the killing and our family is
awaiting Government to
make its findings public. However, our family has
secured the services
of an independent attorney to conduct an independent
inquiry about the
killing of my father.

Before my father died, he told me in privacy about a
substantial amount
of money totaling $58.7,59,000.00 million dollars
(Fifty-eight million,
seven hundred and fifty-nine thousand dollars kept in
his personal safe
box and deposited with a finance and security company
which he intend
to travel abroad for investment purpose. He lamented
that he could not
finish the business he entered with some people. The
consignment was
deposited as personal belongings and labeled
^SDiplomatic Cargo^T 
earmarked
for airlifting. I have the original copy of
certificate of deposit and
receipt issued by the finance and Security Company to
my father.

My late father has therefore advised me before his
last painful moment
in the hospital to solicit the assistance of a foreign
businessman with
vest knowledge of fund and investment management
background to help our
family invest wisely the inherited fund.

It is based on his last instruction that I am
requesting your 
assistance
in helping us secure the safe box containing the
family^T inherited 
fund^T
until I am able to come over to your country for
investment discussion.
We do not know whom to trust for protection in Nigeria
anymore because
my father^Rs secretary was killed also three days after
my father^Rs 
death.


We shall discuss the modalities of moving the
consignment out of 
Nigeria
upon confirmation of your help in this regard. A
decision of your 
percentage
will be taken later by us and will be communicated to
you accordingly.

Please forward your private telephone, fax and mobile
numbers if 
available
to me. Thanks and may God bless you.

Best regards,

Robert  Ige.

ATTENTION: THE PRESIDENT/CEO
REQUEST FOR BUSINESS AND CO-OPERATION
I am MR. TOBI C. WILLIAMS, Chairman of the Petroleum Resources Committee.
Terms of Reference:

My terms of reference involves the award of contracts to Foreign
Multinational Companies and Corporations. My office is saddled with the
responsibility of contract award, screening, categorization and
prioritization of projects embarked upon by Petroleum Resources Committee
(PRC) as well as feasibility studies for selected projects and supervising
the project consultants involved. A breakdown of the fiscal expenditure by
this office as at the end of last fiscal quarter of 2001 indicates that
Petroleum Resorces Committee paid out a whooping sum of US$736M(Seven
Hundred And Thirty-Six Million, United States Dollars) to successful
Foreign contract beneficiaries. The PRC is now compiling beneficiaries to
be paid for the Second and third Quarters of the 2002 fiscal year. The
crux of this letter is that the Petroleum Resources Committee deliberately
over^Öinvoiced the contract value of the various contracts awarded. In the
course of disbursements, this department has been able to accumulate the
sum of US$38.6M (Thirty-eight Million, six hundred Thousand U.S dollars)
as the over-invoiced sum. This money is currently in a suspense account of
the FMF account with the Debt reconciliation Committee (DRC) and has
already been approved for payment in this year's supplementary budget
allocation by the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) and awaiting to be
immediately wired out of the country.

My duty as Co-ordinator of this project, is to solicit your unalloyed
co-operation and assistance to enable us pull out this funds into any
foreign account owned by your goodself and covered by a foreign company's
name to be used. Your co-operation in this business is essential, because
members of the committee involved in this business are personalities who
have attained impeccable track records of probity in the Civil Service of
Nigeria and as such are not permitted to operate Foreign Account in
discharging their functions as members of the Petroleum Resources
Committee (PRC). Hence my role as the co-ordinator of this laudable
project.

NOTE:

This business is 100% full proof, genuine and risk-free. Hence the need
for Strict and Absolute Confidentiality till the end is All Important.
Furthermore, sharing of this fund after remittance into your provided bank
account will be done as follows: 70% for us here in Nigeria, 25% for you
the Account owner and 5% to cover as re-imbursement, any expenses which
may be incurred in the course of transferring the funds into your account.
We estimate that this project will last for Two weeks only, given your
fullest co-operation.

All enquiries should be directed to the undersigned by FAX and or by
E-MAIL. Trusting in a good and long lasting business relationship with
you.

I will await your reply immediately through Fax No. 234-1-7594304 and or
by mail.

DEAR ...,

This letter may come to you as a suprise due to the
fact that we have not yet met.The message could be
strange but real if pay some attention to it.I could
have notified you about it at least for the sake of
your intergrity.Please accecpt my sincere apologies.In
brining this message of goodwill to you,I have to say
that i have no intention of causing you any pains.

I am Mr. Simon Kabila,son  of the late Laurent Kabila
president of Congo DRC who was assassinated on the
16th of January 2001 by one his millitary aides.I
manage to get your contact details through "The World
Business Journal",a journal of the johannesburg
chamber of commerce in South Africa in the time I was
desperately looking for a trustworthy person to assist
 me in this confidential business .

On the 17th of May 1997,my late  father  Laurent
Kabila took over took over the power after toppling
the preious dictator,the late president Mobutu Sese
Seko.After officially taking over as Head of State on
the 29th of may 1997,my late father, president Desire
Laurent Kabila,a former rebel leader met with some
Tutsi factions from the region of Goma,East of the
country with the assistance Rwandese,Ugandan and
Burundese forces.

My late father, president Laurent Kabila made me in
charge of purchasing armaments in the Republic of
South Africa for an amount of US$28.5MILLIONS(Twenty
Eight Millions Five Hundred Thousand United State
Dollars)in cash.that amount of money was transfered in
South Africa through diplomatic channels.After his
death,being in Johannesburg,South Africa,I decided to
keep that money for personal use.At presentthe money
is kept in a security company in johannesburg.

I am currentluy and temporarily living in Johannesburg
while waiting for thev appeal lodged by lawyer on my
behalf to the department of home affairs,for my
refugee status application.I am having difficulty
getting the money out of South Africa because the
South Africa monetary policy is not favourable to
people like myself who have no permanent resident
status.Moreover the political climate in South Africa
at the moment being so sentitive and unable ,investing
here would only limit my chances and reduce my
opportunities.

in acknowledgement  of executive powers and the
various business opportunities in your country,Iam
requesting your assistance in helping me transfer this
money in your personal or business account.After the

From: kabila dusi <kabila_552001@yahoo.com>
To: ...


ATTN: 

Re Urgent Assistance 

Kindly allow me the modesty of introducing myself. I
am KABILA DUSI, the son of the former head of state/
president of Congo-Kinshasha (then called Zaire) Mr.
Laurent Desire Kabila. 

I got your particulars through the South African
Chamber of Commerce; However, I am contacting you in
order to ask for your assistance on this confidential
Business proposal with full financial benefit for both
of us. 

Before I go into further details please be informed
that I am writing without any other person(s)
pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this
transaction. Therefore I will appreciate same attitude
to be maintained all through. 

I have the sum of USD48Million from a secret sale of
Diamond by my father before he was assassinated by one
of his body guard (Rashid) on January 16th 2001, which
I will like you to receive on my behalf due to
security reasons, as my narration below will explain.
But before I continue be well informed that your share
in this transaction has been calculated at 13% of the
total sum of USD$48M, 5% for expenses and the rest for
my family and me. 

My father as a real African traditionalist was a
polygamist thereby having married so many wives, and
my mother being the second wife of my father, My
stepbrother Joseph, who is the current president of my
country, is the son of the first wife and he does not
have any knowledge about this deal. 

Already president Joseph is using his power to
colonize all the money and private property, which my
father left behind for the whole family. Now my mother
and I are left with nothing in the inheritance of my
late father's wealth. Our situation is seriously
critical that we need your assistance to help us
receive these funds overseas for proper investment. 

Let me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this
transaction because the diamond sales are packaged
from the onset in a pattern that shows no direct trace
or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present the
money is in cash and is secured in a security company
as family treasures, as I don't want to deposit the
money in a financial institution for fear of the funds
being confiscated 

The consignment will be released within seven (7) days
of my being in receipt of your reply via my email
address above only for security reasons. 

I am waiting for your swift and favorable response,
and in case you have any question(s), do not hesitate
to contact me. 

Best Regards, 

KABILA DUSI. 

You can also contact me through this my alternative
email address kabila_6@yahoo.co.uk

                                CHIEF MARTIN OKILO.

ATTN: sir,

I am Chief Martin Okilo; a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria
Contract Award and Monitoring Committee in the Directorate of Petroleum
Resources.

Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in Directorate of
Petroleum Resources by my committee. This contract was over invoiced to
the tune of US$21.5M. This was done deliberately.The over-invoicing was a
deal by my committee to benefit from the project.We now desire to transfer
this money which is in a Suspense Account in any Overseas Account which we
expect you to provide for us.

I would require the following:
1) Bankers Name and Address
2) Telephone and Fax Number of Bankers
3) Sort/ABA/Routing Number of Bankers
4) Account Number
5) Name of Beneficiary/Company Name /Address.
6) Telephone and Fax  No. of Beneficiary

The above information would be used to make formal applications as a
matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to
your account. It does not matter whether or not your company does contract
projects of this nature described here,the assumption is that your company
won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies.

More often than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields
win major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for
execution of such contracts.

We have strong and reliable connections and contacts at the First Bank Of
Nigeria and Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no doubt that all this
money will be released and transferred if we get the necessary foreign
partner to assist us in this deal.Therefore, when the business is
successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all
documents used from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100%
security. We are civil servants and we will not want to miss this
opportunity.

Please contact me immediately through my Direct Office Tel/Fax number
234-1-320 2188, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are
not,this will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out
this deal. But where you are interested, send the required documents
aforementioned herein without delay,as time is of the essence in this
business.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.
Yours faithfully,

CHIEF MARTIN OKILO.

              LOME,REPUBLIC OF TOGO
       REFERENCE AND CONFIDENTIAL ASSISTANCE.

ATTN:

Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you asa surprise and if it
might offend you without your prior consent and writing through this
channel.

I am ENG.MARTINS DIBONGO, The Chairman, Contract Awarding Committee of the
ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST AFRICAN STATES ( ECOWAS)with Headquarters in
Lome,Togo.I got your information in a business directory from the
Togolaise Chamber of Commerce and Industries when I was searching for a
reliable,honest and trustworthy person to entrust this business with.I was
simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact from the many names and
lists in the directory.

         ACCOUNT PROVISION FOR USD4.5M

After discussing my view and your profile with my colleagues,they were
very much satisfied and decided to contact you immediately for this mutual
business relationship.We wish to transfer the sum of USD4.5,000,000.00
(Four Million F ive hundred United States Dollars only.)into your personal
or company`s bankaccount.

This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contract bills awarded by us
for the supply of
ammunitions,hard/softwares,phamaceauticals/medicalitems,light and heavy
duty vehicles, apperals and other administrative logistics etc for the
ECOMOG in Sierria-Leone and Liberia during the Peace KeepingProjects.

This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully protected with all
the attendant lope holes sealed off.As the Chairman of CAC,I have the
cooperation and mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of the
Organisation.We arranged and over invoiced the contract funds supplied by
different companies from different countries during the crisis.

It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a willing foreigner to
provide us with the facilities to transfer this money out of West
Africa.This is borne out of our beleif in the non-stable and sporous
political nature of this sub-region.  The original contractors have been
duely paid by the Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De
L`Ouest(Central Bank of the West African States)through our
bankers-Societe Generale Banque.This balance is suspended in the escrow
accounts awaiting claims by any foreign company of our choice.We intend to
pay out this fund NOW as the organisation is winding up its activities
since the aim of returning PEACE to the countries and the coast has been
achieved.

Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil servants working
under this organisation, are not allowed to operate a foreign account.This
is the more reason why we needed your assistance to provide an account
that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our future investment!
with your comprehensive advise,assistance and partnership in your country.

It is however agreed,as the account owner in this deal to allow you 30% of 
the entire sum as compensation,65% will be held on trust for us while 5% 
will be used to defray any incidental charges and cost during thecourse of 
the transaction.  This transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation.You should provide the followings;

1)YOUR COMPANY`S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,TEL AND FAX NUMBERS.(if 
available)

2)THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL,FAX AND TELEX NUMBERS.

3)THE ACCOUNT NUMBER THE COMPLETE MAILING ADRRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY WITH 
TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.

Upon the receipt of this informations,the documents and approval with the texts will be sent to you for confirmaton and then forwarded to the organisation for ratification and subsequent payment.As with the case of all!
organised (sensitive)and conspired DEALS,we solicit for your unreserved 
confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We hope to retire 
peacefully and lead a honourable business life afterwards.There are no 
risks involved.

REPLY ASAP.

Best regards.

Subject: Urgent Bussiness Transaction


Dear Sir

My name is Dr Ugo Olems, a secretary and Ghanaian national, married With a
wife and four children. I work as an Administrative Secretary to STANDARD
SECURITY & SERVICES LTD in Nigeria. I joined the services of this company in
1990 as an office assistant. I got the information concerning you and your
company from the Ghanaian Chamber of commerce

and after due consultation with my spiritual adviser, I decided to Contact
you believing that by the grace of God that you will accept to be my partner
in this mutual business.

I have been working with this company for eleven good years. Within this
period, I have watched with meticulous precision how African Heads of
States and Government functionaries have been using STANDARD SECURITIES to
move huge sums of money, US Dollar, pound sterlling, French Francs-cash to
their foreign partners oversea. They bring in these consignments of money
cash and secretly declare the contents as jewelries gold, diamond,
precious stones, family treasure, documents etc. Gen. Sani Abacha of
Nigeria(dead),Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire (dead),Foday Sankoy of Siera
Leone. Rtd Gen. Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria,Felix Houphet Buigny of Ivory
Coast (dead). Kanan Bedie of Ivory Coast etc.all these people have tens of
consignments deposited with us, STANDARD SECURITIES. Their foreign
partners are claiming most of the consignments due to the fact that they
have every information about the consignment. A lot of them are laying
here unclaimed for as much as two (2) yrs now. No body may ever come for
them because in most cases, the documents of deposit are never available
to any body except the depositors / STANDARD SECURITIES LTD.

In STANDARD SECURITIES the procedure of claims to consignments is as soon
as you are able to produce all the secret information as contained in the
secret files of any consignment, it will be released to you Upon demand.

From my record, more than 4 consignments belonging to Mobutu Sese Seko, has
been claimed in the past Six months. This is why I am soliciting for your
cooperation and assistance.

Late Gen. Sani Abacha has five consignments deposited with several cdes
and names. One has been claimed in the past 2yrs.Since he died, the family
members are under restricted arrest without communication, some ran into
exile.

I have finished every arrangement for you to claim consignment No.002101.
Containing US$45,000,000.00 (FOURTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STETES DOLLARS). My
duty is to supply you with all the information and

Documents needed to claim the consignment; you will deal with the
management directly. The procedure is very simple and easy: - Apply
officially to the director of operations of STANDARD SECURITIES for the
release of consignment No.002101.Contact the management of STANDARD
SECURITIES & SERVICES on Email Address which I will supply to you on your
request. The management will demand for some documents and secret codes of
the consignment, which I will supply, you with every detailed information
needed before you claim the consignment. As soon as they confirm it to be
correct with the information they have in their file. They will invite you
for the collection. If you do not want to come, you can arrange with them to
transfer the consignment to anywhere or your destination on agreement.
Please, Nobody or any of my colleague will ever know I am involved in the
deal except the Lawyer who will write an agreement bond for us.

I will suggest upon conclusion, we share 70% for me - 20% for you and 10%
for any expenses incurred during the course of the transfer for both
parties. I assure you that, this deal have been carefully

hatched for months now, it is very secure and risk free. You can contact
me, 24 hours for further explanations about directives on the procedure. I
bet my life that we cannot fail.

Thanks.

DR UGO OLEMS.

HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED
TO CHANGED MOST OF MY HUSBAND MILLIONS

LATE HUSBAND'S CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE
WAS CONFISCATED BY THE FRENCH GOVERNMENT,

THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND
CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM OF
 TWENTY  MLLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS
(US$20,000,000,00.) WITH A SECURITY COMPANY  IN HOLLAND
FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY
CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING
THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST
US BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF IN
EUROPE.

I WANT YOU TO
ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT
WANT MY IDENTITY REVEALED.

I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK
IN MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE
IN OTHER SAFE AND NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS.
MAY  I AT THIS POINT EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL OF
CONFIDENTIALITY, WHICH THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS,
AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND
CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU IN CONCLUSION,

IN THE EVENT YOU ARE INTRESTED TO ASSIST US I WILL

Subject: please help me and my family


ATTN;

I am Hajia Maryam Abacha, widow of the Late Gen. Sani Abacha former
Nigerian Military Head of State who died as a result of cardiac arrest.

The name of you company appeared in one of our directories as one of the
companies my late husband wanted to do businesswith before he died.

I therefore decided to contact you in confidence so that I can be able to
move out the sum of US$35,760,000.00 ( Thirty Five Million Seven hundred
and Sixty Thousand U. S. Dollars ) which was secretly defaced and seal in
big metal box for security reasons in your account.

I personally therefore appeal to you for your urgent assistance to move
this money into your country where I believe it will be safe since I
cannot leave the country due to the restriction of movement imposed on me
and members of my family by the Nigerian government.

You can contact me through . or my family lawyer . Upon the receipt of
your acceptance to assist me, my lawyer shall arrange with you for a face
to face meeting outside Nigeria in order to liaise with him towards the
effective completion of this transaction.

However, arrangement has been put in place to move this money out of the
country in batches in a secret vault through a diplomatic security company
to any of the European country as soon as you indicate your interest. I
also want you to be assured that all necessary arrangement for the
hitch-free of thistransaction has been concluded.

Conclusively, I have decided to offer you 25% of the total sum 5% will be
for whatever expenses that will be incurred, while 70% is to be used in
buying share in your company subsequent to our free movement by
theNigerian government.

Please reply urgently and treat with absoluteconfidentiality and
sincerity.

Best regards,


HAJIA M.

Dear sir,

Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I
am assuring you that everything will be well at the
end of the day. We have decided to contact you due to
the urgency of this transaction.

Let me start by introducing myself properly to you.I am 
Dr.Abraham Kazulu. an external auditor with NedBank,
Johannesburg, South Africa .

THE PROPOSITION: 
A Foreigner, a french, Late Engr.Jean claude Pierre
(Snr) a merchant formerly working in Witwatersrand
Johannesburg Gold Mine, Johannesburg South Africa,
until his death months ago in Kenya Air Bus (A310-
304)Flight KQ431, He banked with NedBank
Johannesburg and had a closing balance as at the
end of September,2000 worth $33,800.000.00 (Thirty-
Three Million eight hundred United State Dollars),
(this is aside the accrued interest so far from that
date)the bank now expects his next of kin as
beneficiary to his estate. Valuable efforts are being 
made by the Bank to get in touch with any of the
Claude's Family or Relatives but to no success.

It is because of the perceived possibility of not
being able to locate any of Late Engr. Jean Claude
Pierre(Snr.)'s next of kin as,(He had no wife nor
children that is known to us).The Management under
the influence of the Chairman and Members of the Board
of Directors of the bank,made arrangement for the
fund to be decleared "Unclaimed" and subsequentlly be
donated to the trust fund for arms and ammunition, to
further enhance the course of War in Africa and the
World in General.

In order to avert this negative development, some of
my trusted colleagues and I now seek your permission
to have you stand as next of kin to the late Engr.
Jean Claude Pierre (Snr.) so that the fund will be
released and paid into your Account as the beneficiary/
next of kin.

All documents and proves to enable you get this fund
will be carefully worked out. We have secured from
the probate registry, an order of Mandamus to locate
any of the deceased's beneficiary(ies), and more so
we are assuring you that this business is 100% Risk
Free. Your share will be 30% of the total sum while
the rest will be for myself and my colleagues for
investment purposes,according to agreement between
both parties.I hope you have a good investment knowlege.

We shall arrange to change the name of beneficiary
in your favour with the bank and also the Probate
Registry of the Government of South Africa.

Kindly indicate your interest to enable us make
arrangements to get the neccessary supporting/back
up documents that will make you eligible to claim
the fund as his next of Kin. 

Please note that for the purposes of confidentiality,
all further correspondeces would be through my
alternative email addresses:john_jeff1@lycos.com

Accept my warm regards as I await your response.

Sincerely,

Dr.Abraham Kazulu

MANAGER,
BANK OF AFRICA, ABDIJAN,
COTE D' IVOIRE.
EMAIL: alextahir2001@yahoo.com

ATTN: MD/CEO.

Sir, 

 AN URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL.

I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and 
profitable business proposal, though I don^Òt know you 
neither have I seen you before but I got your contact 
through the Ivories chamber of commerce and industries. I 
am the manager of BANK OF AFRICA, ABIDJAN, COTE D' IVOIRE.

 The intended business is thus, we had a customer, a 
Foreigner (a Turkish) resident in Abidjan, and he was a 
Contractor with one of the Government Paratatales.
He had in his Account in my branch the sum of US$35 Million 
{Thirty five Million U.S. Dollars). Unfortunately, the man 
died four years ago
until today non of his next of kin has come Forward to 
claim the money. Having noticed this, I in collaboration 
with two other top Officials of the bank have covered up 
the account all this while. 
 
Now we want you (being a foreigner) to be fronted as one of 
his next of kin and forward your account and other relevant 
documents to be advised to you by us to attest to the 
Claim. We will use our positions to get all internal 
documentations to back up the claims. The whole procedures 
will last only ten working days to get the fund retrieved 
successfully without trace even in future.

Your response is only what we are waiting for as we have 
arranged all necessary things. As soon as this message 
comes to you kindly get back to me indicating your 
interest. Then I will furnish you with the whole
procedures to ensure that the deal is successfully 
Concluded. 

For your assistance we have agreed to give you thirty 
percent (30%) of the total sum at the end of the 
transaction. It is risk free and a big fortune for both of 
us. With your maximum co-operation, this transaction is not 
expected to last for more than 10 working days.

All correspondence towards this transaction will be through 
e-mail, telephone and fax.

I await your earliest response.
 
Thanks,
Yours Sincerely,
Dr.Sesey Fofanna

From: "From Mr. Clement Obaseki" clobaski@rediffmail.com
Reply-To: clobaseki@rediffmail.com
To: ...

FROM THE DESK OF; 
     MR. CLEMENT OBASEKI
     FEDERAL MINISTRY OF WORKS & HOUSING 
     (FMW&H)FEDERAL SECRETARIAT, 
     LAGOS, NIGERIA.

Dear Sir,

            PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL 
 
I am Mr. Clement Obaseki, Director Project
Implementation with the Federal Ministry of Works &
Housing (FMWH) and a member of the Contract Tenders
Board (CTB) of the above named ministry. Your esteemed
address was reliably introduced to me at the Nigerian
Chamber of Commerce and Industry in my search for a
reliable individual / company who can handle a
strictly confidential transaction which involves the
transfer of a reasonable sum of money to a foreign
account. 

This money amount to a total sum of US$21,500,000.00
(Twenty One Million Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars Only). The money was extracted from various
contracts awarded by the Contracts Tenders Board (CTB)
as a result of over-invoicing masterminded by the
concerned officials, who were drafted to represent
final payment for a contract that has been executed
for the Federal Ministry of Works & Housing (FMWH)
some years back. The money is now floating in the Apex
Bank awaiting claim by a foreign partner which status
we now want you to assume. 

Now is the optimum period to consummate this
transaction following the Presidential Directive to
all corporations to pay off all foreign debts. I
therefore seek for your assistance to remit this money
into your personal / company's account. In my last
meeting with other officials involved, it was
unanimously agreed that 25% of the total sum will be
given to you, 70% will be for me and my colleagues,
while 5% will be used to offset the expenses that may
be incurred in the processing of the transfer. 

I assure you that the transaction is 100% risk free as
we have concluded every arrangement to protect the
interest of every one involved. Likewise, all
modalities for the successful transfer of this money
have been worked out with the Federal Ministry of
Finance and the Apex Bank to facilitate the remittance
of this money to your designated account. 

However, I would want to believe that you are honest
and trustworthy enough and will not raise any
misgiving attitude in any aspect of this transaction.
More importantly, you will keep this transaction very
confidential so as not to tarnish the confidence
reposed on these officials by the Federal Government
of Nigeria. We as civil servants are not allowed to
run a foreign account, which is against the Federal
Government Civil Service Act of 1970, that is why we
are looking for a foreign partner.  

If this business proposal interest you, kindly email
me your Personal and Banking information/details through my above email
address for the immediate commencement of the remittance and to enable
me send you further information on the transaction. May the Almighty God
bless you as we await your response.

Meanwhile, your immediate response will be highly
appreciated.

Best regards,

Mr. C. Obaseki.

Greeting


 My name is Mr.Pakwesi Oduro, 32 Years Old Ghanian National married with
two children.  I work as a Records Manager with Standard Security and
Services Ghana Limited in Accra-Ghana.  I earn salary of 1.5 million Ghana
Cedis ($200 United State
  Dollars) equivalent monthly. I joined the services of this company in
1991 as office assistance.  I got the information concerning you from the
Internet and after due consultation I decided to contact you
 believing that by the grace of GOD that you will
 accept to be my partner in this deal.

 I have been working with this company for over ten years.  Within this
period, I have watched with meticulous precision how African Heads of
  State and government functionaries have been using pro-security and
finance services gh. Ltd to move huge sums of money USD, pound terling,
French France-(Cash) to their foreign partners.  They bring in these
consignments of money cash and secretly declare the contents as
jewelleries, gold, diamond, precious stone, family treasure, documents
etc. Gen.
 Sani Abacha of Nigeria(dead), Mobutu sese seko of Zaire (dead), Foday
Sankoy of Siera-Leone, Babangida of Nigeria, Felex Houphet Buigny of Ivory
Coast (dead), Kanan Bedie of Ivory Coast etc, All these people have
hundreds of consignment deposited with my office.

 Their foreign partners, friend; and relatives, are claiming most of these
consignments.  A lot of them are lying here unclaimed for as much as 15
yrs.

 Nobody will ever come for them because in most
 cases, the documents of deposit are never available to any body except
the depositors-most of them are dead.

 Since the inception of the 2000 millennium,
 ourcompany Management changed the procure of claims of Consignments, as
soon as you are able to produce the secret information as contained in the
secret of any consignment, it will be released to you upon demand.  From
our record, more than 160 consignment belonging to Gen. Abacha /Mobutu
Sese Seko, has been
 claimed in the past six months, this is why I am
 soliciting for your co-operation and assistance,
 Gen. Abacha has 106 consignment, deposited with
 several names and codes.  64 have been claimed in the past six months.

 Since he's dead, his first son is dead in plane
 crash the second son is facing trial for murder and embezzlement, the
family members are under
 restricted arrest without communication.  I have
 finished every arrangement for you to come and claim consignment
No.SSS/AM02/1203 containing 20M USD. My duty is to supply you with all the
information and documents, by fax you will deal with the management
directly.

 The procedure is simple:- Apply officially to the director of operations
of STANDARD SECURITY AND SERVICES (GH) LTD for the release of consignment
No.SSS/AM02/1203.  They will demand some documents and secret code contact
me immediately, I'll supply you every detailed information.  And fax it to
them.  As soon as they confirm it to be correct.
 They will invite you in for the collection.

 I ' ll suggest upon conclusion, we share 50% for
 you, of this transaction while 50% after deducting any expenses we might
incur in the course. I assure you that the business have been hatched for
5 years now, it is very secure and risk free.  You can reach me on my
private email address:  pakwesioduro@alloymail.com.

Mr Kals Austin
 Standard Trust Bank Ltd
 Lagos, Nigeria.

 Dear Sir,

 I am Mr. Kals Austini. Bank Manager of Standard Trust
 Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very
 confidential business proposition for you.

 On January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the
 Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a
 numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M
 ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity I
 sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.


 After a month we sent a reminder and finally we
 discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian
 National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert
 died from an automobile accident. On further
 investigation, I found out that he died without making
 a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was
 fruitless.

 I therefore made further investigation and discovered
 that Mr. James Herbert did not declare any next of kin
 or relations in all his official documents including
 his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
 US$20M has carefully been moved out of my
 bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one
 will ever come forward to claim it. According to
 Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the
 money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
 Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

 Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a
 Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I
 deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes
 though the security company does not know the
 contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be
 photographic materials for export I am writing you
 because I as a public servant I cannot operate
 a foreign account or have an account that is more than
 $1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes
 in the security company so you can be able to claim
 them with the help of my attorney. All these are
 to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labor
 will not get into the hands of some corrupt government
 officials.

 This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately
 your full names and address so that the Attorney will
 prepare the necessary documents which will put you in
 place as the owner of the boxes. The money will
 be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you
 and 5% will take care of all expenses. There is no
 risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction
 will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee
 the successful execution of this transaction.

 If you are interested, please reply immediately via my
 private email address. or phone number 234-803-3302203

 Upon your response I shall then provide you with
 more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the
 transaction.

 Please observe with utmost confidentiality and be
 rest assured that this transaction would be most
 profitable for both of us because I shall require your
 assistance to invest my share in your country.

 Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to
 indicate your interest.

 Thanks and Regards
MR. KALS AUSTIN.

                  CONFIDENCIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL.


NKALA MERIMBE,
NEDERLAND.
Tel: 0031-629-178-943.

ATTN:!!! 
    
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know
me personally. The purpose of my introduction is that I am NKALA MERIMBE,
the first son of NKONO MERIMBE,the most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe
who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your
contact through network online hence decided to write you. Before the
death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of
US8.5 Million (Eight Million, Five Hundred United States dollars)in one of
the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe
this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage
from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new
machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in
Swaziland.

This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert Mugabe
introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affected the rich white farmers
and some few black farmers.And this resulted to the killing and mob action
by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot
of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father
was one of the victims.

It is against this background that, I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear
of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we are
seeking political asylum and moreso have decided to transfer my father^Òs
money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Netherlands
prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be
involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of
Netherlands, As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the
responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could
be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on
taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be
playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount
of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience
in future, both countries have similar political history. As a
businessman,I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust m y future
and of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction
is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family,all I want you to
do for me, is to arrangements with the security company to clear the
consignment(funds) from their afiliate office here in the Netherlands as i
have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the
Netherlands from South Africa.But before then all modalities will have to
be put in place e.g change of ownership to the consignment and This money
I intend to use for investment.

I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain
percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction.
Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable
investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want,
feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all
kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction. If you do
not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money while
the remaining 75% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me
with the above telephone and E-mail numbers while I implore you to
maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.

Thanks, GOD BLESS YOU

Yours Faithfully,

NKALA MERIMBE.

normally runs into several millions of dollars. Until

crash. I was his foreign currency denoted Bank Account
Manager with constant balance in excess of eight
digits. Ever since his death and up till this time of
writing, no next of kin or relation of his has come

Naturally, as long as late Dr.David Fang money remains
unclaimed, the bank remains richer in free funds with
his money. However, with my being in direct charge of
Bills and Exchange in the foreign Remittance
Department of my bank, I am in position to cause the
payment of this money to whosoever that present
himself as the next of kin or relation of the late

Now the game plan and the purpose of writing to you
exclusively having been highly recommended as the
right and proper person to handle this deal by a
Management Consultant friend of mine, who has traveled
widely, including your country is that I want to pull
out this unclaimed money amounting to $14,900,000:00
(Fourteen Million, Nine Hundred United States Dollars)
with your co-operation and assistance by just doing
the following:
-

(a) Act as next of kin or relation of late Dr.David
Fang

(b) Provide your bank account and location where you
want the money remitted .
(c) Provide your direct and private Telephone/Fax
numbers for effective communication
(d) Give immediate reply to this proposal using the
above Tel/Fax
number for details on how to proceed.

For your co-operation and efforts, 40% of the money
will be for you as my foreign partner,10% for
settlement of all expenses that might be incurred on
the course of this transaction, while 50% will be for
myself that will eventually visit your country for
disbursement of the fund.

Looking forward to a mutual and beneficial business
relationship.

Regards,

Chinonyere Ohaegbu.

REQUEST FOR AN IMPORT/EXPORT PARTNERSHIP. Let me commence by first
expressing my most sincere apology for infringing on your privacy as I am
an uninvited guest to your address. I got your e-mail address from an
Internet listing, let us immediately put yourmind to rest in that regard.

We are interested in the purchase and importation of certain goods into
our country, with funds, which are presently trapped in this same country,
Nigeria. In order to commence this business and achieve our goal, we need
your assistance in the release of the said trapped funds and ultimately,
your receipt and custody of these funds abroad. But before I proceed any
further, I crave your indulgence and confidence in this communication and
transaction in the long run, this is necessitated by virtue of this
proposal as being utterly confidential and classified. We are top
officials of a major Government parastatal (name withheld) here in
Nigeria, and due to our very membership of this parastatal, we are privy
to the information I am about to vaguely reveal to you in trust and
confidence as obtained in the urgent business relationship we solicit for.


We crave your indulgence for total Confidentiality. Explicitly, the source
of this fund is as follows: During the regime of our late head of state,
Gen. Sani Abacha, the thenMilitary officials set up private companies and
lobbied the award of contracts to their companies, these contract were
grossly over-invoiced in various ministries all in the bid for
self-enrichment by these military men. Fortunately, after the mysterious
death of the head of state followed by the collapse of the military
dictatorship, the current civilian Government set up a body to look into
the activities of the past military regime. We hold exalted
designations/positions this recently setup panel and we have successfully
identified several inflated contract funds, which are presently floatingin
coded terms and accounts at the Central Bank of Nigeria.

We desire to release and use for the purpose stated above a particular
contract entitlement from the very several, but due to our position as
civil servants and members of this body, we cannot acquire this fund in
our names and without a much needed foreign assistance. My colleagues have
therefore delegated me as a matter of trust to source for an overseas
partner into whose account the sum of US$31,000,000.00 (Thirty-one Million
United States Dollars), being the contract entitlement of this particular
contract will be transferred into, hence this written request. Upon the
success of this transaction, which is after the receipt of the fund into
your account and the use of the funds for the purchase of the desired
goods, we propose a sharing ratio as thus:

 1.  70% for us (the officials)
 2.  20% for the foreign partner (you)
 3.  4% for the reconciliation of all expenses, including taxation and all
foreign costs incurred by you during the course of the transaction.
 4.  6% for the reconciliation of all local expenses incurred by all parties
involved on the home front during the course of this transaction.

Please do not have the erroneous impression that the monies are going to
come to you that easily. You will have to earn it as nothing good comes
that easily. As they say, there is no free lunch in America. Your complete
dedication and commitment to the course will be required. Basically, what
we are doing is to use you as a front to get these monies transferred out
of this country.

However, we shall equally require your assistance in advising us on good
investment opportunities in your country as we intend to invest a
substantial part of our share of the funds in your country. We are poor
civil servants (Government workers) who are presented with a lifetime
opportunity to secure our future and those of our immediate families in
particular and the suffering masses in general. Please note that this
transaction is 100% safe and hitch free, devoid of any form of uncertainty
in its entire ramification. We hope that the funds can arrive your account
within ten (10) banking days from the date of our receipt of some relevant
details that I shall intimate you with in my next correspondence.

The required details will enable us write letters of claim and job
description respectively. This way, we will use your already existing
company name or initiate one for you (or as applicable) to prepare the
necessary and solid documentary foundation necessary to re- award the
contract in your company name and prepare an application for fund
release/payments with you as the beneficiary. Please acknowledge receipt
of this letter using either telephone/fax number already provided above or
respond via e-mail, so I can bring you into the complete picture of this
pending project as soon as possible.

We are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your
confidentiality in this transaction.

Yours Faithfully,

Femi Scott

Attn: President/CEO,

URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

I am Dr. Charles Scott, Director, Project Implementation with Eskom ^Ö
South Africa and a member of the Contract Tender Board (CTB) of the above
Corporation.

Your esteemed address was reliably introduced to me at the South African
Chamber of Commerce & Industry.  In my search for a reliable individual
company who can handle a strictly confidential transaction, which involves
the transfer of a reasonable sum of money to a foreign bank account.

This amount of money is a total of US$31,000,000.00 (Thirty-One Million
United States Dollars), already extracted from various contracts awarded
by my Corporation.  As a result of over-invoicing masterminded by the
concerned officials, has been drafted to represent final payment for a
contract that has been executed to the corporation some years back.  The
money is now floating in the Suspense Account of the Federal Reserve Bank
of South Africa awaiting claim by foreign partner which status we now want
you to assume.

Now is the optimum period to consummate this transaction.  Following the
presidential directive to all your personal/company's account; in my last
meeting with the officials involved, it was unanimously agreed that 15% of
the total sum will be given to you, 80% will be for me and my colleagues
while 5% will be used to reimburse the expenses that may be incurred in
the processing of the transfer.

I assure you that the transaction is 100% risk free as we have concluded
every arrangement to protect the interest of every one involved.  
Likewise, all modalities for the successful transfer of this money have
been worked out with the Federal Ministry of finance and the Federal
Reserve Bank of South Africa to facilitate the remittance of this money to
your designated account.

However, I would want to believe that you are honest enough and will not
raise any misgiving attitude in any aspect of the transaction.  More
importantly, you will keep this transaction very confidential so as not to
tarnish the confidence reposed on these officials by the government of
South Africa.

If this business proposal is of interest to you, kindly fax to me the
following:

1) Your banking information/details
2) Your Company's letterhead papers and invoice, one copy each, through
the above fax number for immediate commence of the remittance.

Meanwhile, your immediate response will be highly appreciated.  Please
treat this information as confidential.

Best regards.


DR. CHARLES SCOTT

Attn: Managing director/CEO

DEAR Sir,

I am the first son of the late Mobutu Sese Seko, the
former President of the Congo Republic.

I am presently under protective custody in Nigeria as
a political
refugee. I got your contact during my search for a
stranger that can cooperate with me in this mutual
transaction.

I want you to note that this business will benefit
both of us. However, you must confirm your ability to
handle this because it involves a large amount of
money. The money (50 million US DOLLARS is my share of
my father's estate. I boxed and shipped the money to a
security company abroad at the peak of the
war/political crisis that rocked my country few years
ago. Now the crisis has ended and I need a trustworthy
person like you to proceed to the place of the
security company in order to clear the fund and invest
on my behalf as I don^Òt want my name to be used for
now.

Note that I will send to you the relevant documents
that will enable you take possession of the fund for
onward investment for our mutual benefit. All I need
from you is as follows:

1.A letter of commitment (dully signed) that you will
keep the transaction strictly confidential.

2. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this.

3. Your international passport or driving license
number for identification to the security company.

4. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.

5. Your full permanent address.

As soon as I get the above information from you, I
will disclose to you the name and the country of the
security company. I will forward your name and
particulars to the security company to enable them
contact you accordingly. I will also send to you a
LETTER OF AUTHORITY to enable you clear the fund on my
behalf. Note that this is a very safe transaction as
this money is my share of my father's estate.

I am waiting for your response to enable us proceed.

Regards,

Moshood Seko Mobutu

FROM:DR MENARD ABURE


		BUSINESS PROPOSAL


I am making this contact with you on behalf of my
colleagues after an acceptable recommendation from an
International Business Agency.

My colleagues and I are members of the Contract Award
Committee (CAC) of the  National Electric Power
Authority (NEPA). I have been mandated by my
colleagues to look for a trustworthy company into
whose account some funds are to be transferred.We have
in our possession instrument of payment for US$22.5M
(Twenty two million five hundred thousand U.S Dollars
only) now in a dedicated account with our apex bank
The above funds arose from the over invoicing of some
Supplies and Engeenering Works contracts which have
been executed and the contractors paid in full. The
fund is therefore free to be transferred  overseas
without any risk whatsoever.

Due to the nature of accrual of this funds, it has to
be applied for by a foreign contractor/company and
payment can only be made into a foreign account hence
this contact is necessary to accomplish this deal.You
(or your company) shall be compensated with 25% of the
amount as the account owner, 5%  shall be used for the
reimbursement of all expenses that will be incurred by
both parties during the course of this financial
transaction.The remaining 70% is for us.

We shall require of you the following urgently by fax:
1.	Name,Telephone and/or fax Numbers of Beneficiary
2.	Name and full address of the Company
3.	Complete particulars of the bank account where you
wish the funds to be transferred.
	This should include the account Number,  Bank
Address, the Telephone, Fax and Telex numbers of the
bank.
My colleagues and I have had some fruitful discussions
with relevant top officials of the Federal
Ministry of Finance (FMF) and they have agreed to
cooperate in the
transfer. An application for funds transfer shall be
made at the appropriate Ministries in favour of the
beneficiary (you or your company).Thereafter, your
company shall be officially regarded as having
executed the contract for the National Electric Power
Authority (NEPA) for which payment is
being made.This process make the operation legal
according to the laws of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria.

Please treat this transaction as STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
as we are Civil Servants who would  not want any
exposure.Do not go through the International Telephone
Operator or (AT&T) when lines are busy at any time in
the course of this operation.Always dial direct.It^Òs
very difficult to get telephone access to Nigeria. So
you must persist even when the telephone says
subscriber not available or the number does not
exist.These answers are always given when there is no
access.Thanks for your anticipated cooperation.
Best Regards,

DR MENARD ABURE
Please all contact should be directed to  my
telephone, fax number and email above.

URGENT BUSINESS REQUEST
 
 
 After due deliberation with my colleagues, l decided to forward to 
 you this proposal. We want a reliable
 
 person who could assist us to transfer the sum of (US$38.5M) 
 Thirty Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars only into 
 his account.
 
 
 This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from a contract 
 awarded by us under the budget, allocated
 
 to my ministry and the bill was approved for payment by the 
 concerned ministries. The contract has been
 
 executed.Commissioned, the contractor has been paid his actual 
 cost for the contract.We are now left
 
 with the balance of US$38.5M as the over-invoiced amount,which we 
 have deliberately over estimated for
 
 our own use. But under our protocol division, civil servants are 
 forbidden to operate or own a foreign
 
 account. This is why l contacted you for an assistance. We have 
 agreed that you will be entitled to:
 
 
 30 PERCENT FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.
 
 60 PERCENT FOR ME AND MY COLLEAGUES.
 
 10 PERCENT SET ASIDE FOR ANY EXPENSES INCURRED DURING
 
 THIS BUSINESS.
 
 
 and whatever left from the 10% will be shared equally.
 
 As you may rightly want to know l got your address from our 
 Chambers of Commerce and Industry. I am a
 
 top official with the Federal Ministry of Transport and Aviation (FMTA)We
the officials involved in the
 
 deal have put in many years in services to our ministries. We have 
 been exercising patience for this
 
 opportunity for so long and to most of us, this is a life time 
 opportunity we cannot afford to miss. This
 
 transaction is very much free from all sorts of risks.
 
 
 To enable us get this fund paid into your account, we have to 
 present an international business outfit and
 
 consequent upon your agreement, we shall proceed in doing business 
 together.
 
 
 As soon as you confirm the receipt of this fund in your account. Three of
my colleagues will come to
 
 your company to arrange for our share. All these will only take us 
 10 working days to transfer this fund
 
 into your account right from the day we receive the 
 requirements.
 
 
 For confidential and security of this transaction,all we require 
  from you is your:
 
 [1]YOUR FULL NAME
 
 [2]PRIVATE TELEPHONE/FAX NUMBERS.
 
 [3]YOUR FULL POSTAL ADDRESS.
 
 [4]YOUR BANK NAME,ADDRESS,VIABLE ACCOUNT NUMBER.
 
 [5]YOUR BANK TELEPHONE/FAX NUMBER.
 
 On receipt of this informations I shall apply for approvals from various
ministries and departments
  
 
 NOTE: Your discussion regarding to this transaction should be 
 limited, because we are still in government
 
 service.
 
 Let honesty and trust be our watch word throughout this 
 transaction. And your prompt reply will be highly
 
 appreciated.
 
 
 Best Regards.

Subject: BUSINESS PROPOSAL / PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENT

Dear Sir ,




I received very encouraging information about  you and how trustworthy
you are.I am delighted with such useful  information.I am interested in
a partnership investment programme  with your self/corporation.

First permit me to introduce myself as ANIL KUMAR BACHOO of the Federal
Republic Of MORITIUS .Presently i am the minister of INFRASTRUCTURE, LAND
TRANSPORT SHIPPING under the government of Prime Minister Hamada Madi.

 Acting in my capacity , i awarded an irrigation contract to a portugese
firm worth hundreds of millions of dollars.In the execution of the project
the Portugese firm discovered a collosal amount of limestone in two of the
sites.

I collaborated with the  firm in a mutual agreement as regards the
proceeds of which  i have now received my share of exactly $35 million USD.

As a minister i cannot introduce or circulate this amount into the
maritius banking system considering my provisional duty as a minister, my
earning is less than $1000 equivalent of maritius local curency and the
strict stipulations of the Bureau of conduct guidelines and regulations
for Public/Civil servants.

The above situation prompted my decision to solicit your co-operation to
take delivery of the funds into your custody for my proposed investment as
you will be adequately compensated with $8million USD.  I will arrange all
the necessary procedures in ensuring a smooth process for the funds to get
to you.

I will also appreciate you contact me once you receive this mail via my
e-mail account to enable me give you more details on my modus opendi of
getting the funds across to you hitch free.

This matter requires your urgent attention ,confidentiality and discretion
no matter what your decision may be.

 Best Regards
ANIL KUMAR BACHOO

MARITIUS.

From the Desk of Dr. Ben Okon
Union Bank Nigeria Plc,
Lagos-Nigeria.

Dear Sir,
STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL

I am Dr. Ben Okon, The manager, Bills and Exchange at the Foreign
Remittance Department of the Union Bank Nigeria Plc, I am writing this
letter to ask for your support and cooperation to carry out this business
opportunity in my department. We discovered an abandoned sum of
$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen million United States Dollars only) in an account
that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his
entire family of a wife and two children in November 1997 in a Plane
crash.

Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to
come over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot
release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the
next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.

Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative has ever
appeared to claim the said fund. Upon this discovery, I and other
officials in my department have agreed to make business with you and
release the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since
no one came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank,
otherwise the fund will be returned to the banks treasury as unclaimed
fund.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus;

20 % for you as foreign partner,
75 % for us the officials in my department and
5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign
expenses incurred by us and you during the course of
this business.

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one of my
colleagues will come to your country and mind our share. It is from our 75
% we intend to import Agricultural Machineries into my country as a way of
recycling the fund. To commence this transaction, we require you to
immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail and enclose your
private contact telephone number, fax number full name and address and
your designated bank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the
appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be
made.

Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of
its nature.

I look forward to receiving your prompt response.

Dr.Ben Okon

  STRICTLY PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL

Dr. Sisilu Nomvete.
Pretoria, South Africa.
nomvete@email.com


Sir,

It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of my
colleagues. Your information were given to me by a member of the South
African Export Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black Economic
Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to your country
during a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign investors. I have
decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in execution of a
deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties, and hope you will keep it
confidential because of the nature of this business.

Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of
Project Implementation, with co-operation of four other top officials, we
have in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.

The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed
on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the
officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$29,600,000.00 (Twenty Nine
Million Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual
contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess
balance unclaimed.

The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private
investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are
the real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it
has continued to encouraged investment in the key growth -oriented sector
of Mining with sincere determined to pay foreign contractors all debts
owed to them, so as to continue to enjoy close relationship, and a
mutually beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and
non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we included ours bills
for approvals with the co-operation of some officials at the Department of
Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your
assistance as the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not
allowed to operate a foreign account. Details and changing of beneficiary
information and other forms of documentation upon application for claim to
reflect the payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of your
company or your good self.

I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you
be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation
will be 25% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and the balance
of 5% shall be use to reimburse or expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous
expenses so incurred.

It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of
the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the
major contract and subcontracted it to other companies. More often than
not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields wins major
contracts and subcontract same to more specialized firms for execution.

This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost
confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the
successful execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.

Kindly notify me by email for further details, upon your acceptance of
this proposal.


Regards,



Dr. Sisulu Nomvete

GREETINGS IN THE NAME OF OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST

I am Deacon David Donka a member of Spring of Life Ministries Inc. I was
formerly into the importation and sale of medical equipment in my native
country Sierra Leone.  My operational base was in Freetown the capital
city. In January 1999, when the second civil war broke out in my country,
the Revolutionary United Front Rebels, who invaded Freetown, burned my
office and warehouse. In that attack, I lost all my properties and assets.
I was left with virtually nothing, except some money I had in the Bank.

When the United Nations sent in
troops to quell the rebel's onslaught and there was a
relative peace in Freetown, I returned to business,
but this time, I invested my resources in the Mining
of Diamond through the help of a third party,
some Lebanese who were very much versed in the
industry to Antwerp in Belgium.

The returns I got from this business were quite good and my life was
gradually picking up again until early this year when the Sierra-Leonean
government banned private exportation of the Diamond at the international
market. The U.N. obliged the government and it is now illegal to sell/buy
Diamond emanating from Sierra-Leone. Following this action, the government
of my country clamped down on all businessmen who had made fortunes
selling Diamond.

Consequently, my newly acquired properties were seized again and I had no
option than to leave the country immediately to a neighboring west African
country, where I met our Lord Jesus Christ and my life was totally
transformed. But before I left I was able to first move my money out of
the country. I had $10,500,000 (Ten Million, Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars) in my domiciliary account in Freetown. I had to move the
money out of the Country through a very secret arranged channel, in a very
unconventional method this was done by my friend an official at the
Security Minting & Printing Company of my country. Presently, this money
is in an Oversea Country, under the custody of a private security firm.

My ministry is basically a prayer and deliverance ministry. Since I
received my calling and joined my ministry, I have been asking God to
purify what remains of my wealth for evangelical works and for orphanage.
On the last day of a special fasting and praying session in my ministry,
there was a divine revelation from God that I should invest in your
ministry. My God is not an author of confusion, contact me immediately for
further discussions.


Your brother in Christ,

Deacon David Donka

         STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

My Dear

I am Mrs. Munirat Abacha, the wife of Mohammed Abacha,
son of the Late head of state of Federal Republic of
Nigeria - General Sani Abacha.I am contacting you in
view of the fact that we will be of great assistance
to each other like wise developing a cordial
relationship.

My husband along with his late father and top
officials of their past administration has been
accused of looting several Billion United States
Dollars from the Nigeria Government. The current
attitude of the present government towards my family
has indeed made life quite unbearable for us.
Fortunately, Mohammed my Husband has six million and
eight hundred thousand United States Dollars(US$6.8
million) cash, which he intended to use for investment
purposes overseas.

This money was deposited for safe keeping in the
security vault of a freighting agency here by my
husband preparotry to being air lifted abroad for
investment purposes before his arrest. It is only my
husband and myself that know where the money is kept.

Due to the current situation in the country concerning
government^Rs vendettas towards my family, we seek your
assistance to transfer this money out of Nigeria for
the purpose of investment as intended by my husband.

Note that my family is currently being probed by this
present government for alleged involvement in
misappropriation of public funds during my
father-in-law's regime.Towards this effect, an embargo
restricting my family members from traveling or
carrying out financial transactions without their
express permission is in force. Right now, my husband
(Mohammed) is under arrest and is being detained in
connection to the above and other activities of his
late father.

However, I have an arrangement on how to freight this
money to you after receiving some assurances from you
of the safety our own share and that you will only
take the commission that we will offer you.

This money personally belongs to my husband and he
intends that it still be used for investment. No
record ever existed concerning this money, neither is
the money traceable by the government because there is
no documentation concerning the funds in the Federal
Treasury.

The freighting company to be used has now been
introduced to me and as soon as we recieve your
readiness to assist us recieve this fund we shall
formalize the deposit documents in your name and reach
an agreement with them to air lift the xconsignment
for your pick up.

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to
transfer this fund, we propose a commission of
15%(Fifteen Percent) of the total sum to you for the
expected services and assistance. While 5% is mapped
out for miscellaneous expenses.

On your positive consent, I shall expect you to
contact me urgently to enable us discuss about
this.Your urgent response is highly needed. I must use
this opportunity to implore you to exercise utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily
confidential, while I await your prompt response.

Best regards,

MRS. MUNIRAT ABACHA

GoodDay,
Following the sudden death of my husband General
SaniAbacha the former head of state of Nigeria in
August 1998, I Have been thrown into a state of utter
confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present
civilian administration, I have been subjected
to physical and psychological torture by the security
agents in the country. My son is still under detention
arraigned before the federal high court of
Nigeria for an offence he did not commit. As a widow
that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with
anybody within the country. You must have heard over
the media reports and the internet on the recovery of
various huge sums of money deposited by my husband in
different security firms abroad, some companies
willingly give up their secrets and disclosed our
money confidently lodged there or many outrightblackmail. In fact the
total
sum discovered by the Government so far is in the tune
of $700M. Million dollars. And they are
not relenting to make me poor for life. I got your
contacts through my personal research,and out of
desperation decided to reach you through
this medium.I will give you more information as to
this regard as soon as you reply. I repose great
confidence in you hence my approach to you due to
security network placed on my day to day affairs I
cannot afford to visit the embassy so that is why I
decided to contact you and Ihope you will not
betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the
sumof 40.3 million dollars with a security firm abroad
whose name is witheld for now until we open
communication. I shall be grateful if you could
receive this fund into your account for safe keeping.
This arrangement is known to you and my son 
Mustapha alone, so my son will deal directly with you
as security is up my whole being.
I am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a
friendly atmosphere like yours as soon
as this fund get into your account so that I can start
all over again if only you wish, but if it isimpossible,just help me
in diverting this fund intoyour account which will accrue you 30% of
this fund .
Please honesty is the watch word in this transaction.
I will require your telephone and fax numbers so that
we can commence communication immediately
and I will give you a more detailed picture of things.
In case you dont accept please do not let me out to
the security as I am giving you this informationin total trust and 
confidence
I will greatly appreciate if you accept my proposalin good faith.
Please expedite action.
Sincerely yours,

Hajia Mariam Abacha.

To: ...
Subject: URGENT ASSISTANCE


>From Tao,

This letter may come to you as a surprise especially
since we have not meet, but I am desperate.
I am Mr. Tao Sakaita, son of the late rebel leader
Jonas Savimbi of Angola who was killed on the 22nd of
Febuary 2002 . I managed to get your contact details
through the web site on your home page.
Time is of the importance and I was desperately looking 
for a person to assist me in this confidential business.

My late father, Jonas Savimbi  was able to deposit a
large sum of money in differnt banks in europe We his
family members movements(including me) is restricted. We are forbidden
to either travel abroad or out of our
localities. Presently our movement are monitored.
Right now there is a rush for all my Father's wealth
both home and Abroad by the Government who are claiming that
most of the wealth was got by Arms smuggling and therefore
illegal and by my father's extended family and relations.

You can know more about my father by checking his 
profile at the URL below:
  www.kwacha.com/edoc2.htm

His wealth has been estimated at about $500 million . I being close to
my father I happen to be in 
possesion of documents and information of some of the wealth.

Presently, the US$100,000,000.00 One Hundred Million
Dollars cash my father transfered  to Europe before his
death for some purchases he intended to make is safe and is in a
security firm. I have the passcode and the
documents to the security firm. This is where I will
need your help because at present i cant travel.
And before my government get wind of this fund.
You know my father was a rebel leader in
Angola before his death  My reason for  doing this is
because it will be difficult for the  Angolan
government to trace my father's money to an 
individual's account, especially when such an 
individual has no relationship with the family.
 
I intend to communicate with you as regards this transaction on a
satelite phone to avoid intervention by anybody.

Moreover, the political climate in Angola at the
moment being so sensitive and unstable.With this 
password and information and I will send you a 
power of attorney to the security firm, When you 
are ready I will give you the information needed 
before you can get access to the fund you will then 
proceed to the security company where the US$100,000,000.00 will be
given to you as payment
either installmentally or in cash.

PLEASE  YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS TRANSACTION IS
HIGHLY REQUIRED. 


Yours sincerely, 

TAO S. SAVIMBI.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 

Dear Sir/Ma 

It is my great pleasure to write this letter to you.

Firstly I must solicit your strictest confidence in this subject.

This is by virtue of it's being utterly confidential and top secret. A
member of the NIGERIA EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL(N.E.P.C.) who was part of
the Federal Government Delegation to your country during a Trade
Exhibition gave your particulars to me. I have decided to seek a
confidential operation with you in the execution of the deal described
hereunder for the benefit of all parties and I hope that you keep it top
secret because of the nature of the business.

Within the Department of MINES AND POWER where I now work as a Director of
Engineering and Projects and with the co-operation of four other very top
government officials, including the erstwhile chair of the Contract Review
Panel, we have under our control as overdue contract payment bills
totaling Thirty-Eight Million Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars
(US$38,600,000.00), which we want to transfer to a foreign account, with
the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company to receive the said
funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign individual account to receive
the funds.

The source of the fund is as follows: During the 
last military Government of GENERAL SANNI ABACHA here in Nigeria, the 
government set up the PETROLEUM TRUST FUND to handle the Billions of 
Dollars of oil Revenue Accruing to Nigeria, this was to 
give the government some credibility. Unfortunately, top government 
officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts from 
the Petroleum Trust Funds which were grossly over invoiced.

The present civilian government is not aware of the atrocities committed
by their predecessors and as a result we have many such over invoiced
contract payment pending and floating at the Central Bank of Nigeria. I as
the former director of Bulk PURCHASE at the petroleum trust fund before it
was handled over to the civilian government, I am aware of these funds and
I have put together, with the cooperation of my colleague the sum of
Thirty-Eight Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars(US$38,600,000.00) contract payment. However, by virtue of our
position as civil servants, we cannot acquire this money in our name. I
was therefore delegated as a matter of urgency by my colleagues to look
for an oversea partner into whose account we would transfer the funds
hence we are writing you this letter.

The present civilian Government is determined to pay foreign contractors
all the debts owed so as to maintain an amicable relationship with both
the foreign Government and the Non Government Financial Agencies. We have
decided to include our bills for approval with the cooperation of some
officials of the ACCOUNTANT GENERAL OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA.
We seek your assistance in providing us with a good company account or
personal account into which we can remit this money, you will be acting as
an ORGINAL CONTRACTOR in this deal, the funds will be paid to you. This we
can do by SWAPPING of account information and changing of the beneficiary
information to apply for payment, and prepare letters of claim and job
description on your behalf. This process would be an internal arrangement
with the departments concerned and we will handle this here, your duty is
to act as the contractor and have the contract sum paid to you. I have the
authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to
assist us in this transaction, your share as compensation will be
US$9,650,000 (25%), US$27,020,000.00(70%) for us and US$1,930,000.00
(5%)for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. We will like to invest our
share in any profitable venture in your country and we will greatly
appreciate your assistance in this direction, as we cannot bring money
into Nigeria. The business itself is 100% safe and fail proof, provided
you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality, your line of
specialization does not matter as it cannot hinder the successful
execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and I
hope you will not disappoint me. Mail to indicate your willingness to
assist us. I will bring the complete picture of the transaction to your
knowledge when I have heard from you.

Thanks for your cooperation, 

Kindest regards 
BELLO SEKO

ATTENTION:OWNER/PRESIDENT
            
               I NEED YOUR KIND ASSISTANCE. 

Dear Mr ...,

In recent times over the radio in AMERICA or even in
ASIA about my family regarding huge sums of
moneystacked in foreign banks on different names
for business .I believe is a legacy we came to meet
whenwe became the head of state .

 It does not matter whether you are small or big
butyour ability to help me sort out things is
mostly needed now .I do not justify myself but it
hashappened .so i need you to help me survive in life.
 

 Following the sudden death of my husband General
Sani Abacha the late former head of state of Nigeria
in August 1998, I have been thrown into a state of
utterconfusion, frustration and hopelessness by the
presentcivilian administration, I have been subjected
to physical and psychological torture by the
securityagents in the country.

 My son Mohammed was released yesterday from detention
arraigned before the federal high court of Nigeria for
an offernce he did not commit. As a widow that is so
traumatized,I have lost confidence with anybody within
the country.
 You must have heard over the media reports and the
internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money
deposited by my husband in different security firms
abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets
and disclosed our money confidently lodgedthere or
many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum
discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of
USD$700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting
to
make me poor for life. 

 I got your contacts through my personal research,and
out of desperation decided to reach you through this
medium.I will give you more information as to this
regard as soon as you reply. 

 I repose great confidence in you hence my approach
to you due to security network placed on my day to
day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so
that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you
will not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited
the sum of USD$40.3 million dollars with a security
firm abroad whose name is witheld for now until we
open
communication.

 I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund
into your account for safe keeping. This arrangement
is
known to you and my son Mustapha alone,so my son will
deal directly with you as security is up my whole
being.I am seriously considering to settle down abroad
in a friendly atmosphere like yours as soon as this
fund get into your account so that I can start all
over
again if only you wish, but if it is impossible,just
help me in diverting this fund into your account which
will accrue you 30% of this fund .

 Please honesty is the watch word in this
transaction.I will require your telephone and fax
numbers so that we can commence communication
immediately and I will give you a more detailed
picture of things.In case you dont accept please do
not
let me out to the security as I am giving you this
information in total trust and confidence.I will
greatly appreciate if you accept my proposal in good
faith.Please expedite action.

Sincerely yours,

Hajia Mariam Abacha.    

For The Family.

    [ The following text is in the "iso-8859-1" character set. ]

    [ Some characters may be displayed incorrectly. ]

                                SEEKING FOR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.  It is
my pleasure to request your assistance on this business proposal which if
pursued to its conclusion, will be of immense benefit to both of us.

This request may seem strange but I will crave your indulgence and pray
that you view it seriously.

My name is COL. JOHN LUMUMBA of the Democratic Republic of Congo and one
of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of
Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace.  Due
to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my
country, I was instructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to
purchase arms and ammunition worth of Fifteen Million United States
Dollars only (US$15,000,000.00) to fight the rebel group. But when
President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot out by one of his aide a day
before I was schedule to travel out of Congo, I immediately decided to
divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo for safe
keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened
here following the unwanranted arrest and seizure of properties of Col.
Rasheidi Karesava (The aide that shot Laurent Kabila) tribesmen ,where I
am from,by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo the son
of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. In view of this, I need a
reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist me to move this
money out of my country as the beneficiary. I have sufficient ''contacts''
to move the fund under Diplomatic cover to a security company in the
Netherlands in your name, this is to ensure that the diplomatic baggage is
marked ''confidential''and it will not pass through normal custom/airport
screening and clearance.

My inability to move this money out of Congo all this while lies on my
lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who have
suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President
Laurent Kabila, since his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor
met each other, I know we will be able to establish all the trust that we
need to ensure that the money will be safe with you.

Thus, if you are willing to assist me to move this fund out of Congo, you
can contact me through my email address with your telephone and fax
numbers to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share
(percentage) for assisting me.

I will highly appreciate it if my request is given utmost priority and
consideration.

Yours Sincerely,

COL.  JOHN LUMUMBA (RTD)

MINING & MINERAL RESOURCES, (SMMR)
PRETORIA, REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA

ATTENTION,

It is my pleasure to write you this letter on behalf
of my colleagues. I have decided to seek a
confidential co-operation with you in executing of a
deal hereunder for the benefit of all parties, and
hope you will keep it confidential because of the
nature of this business.

I am the Director of Mineral and Natural Resources of
the South African Ministry of Mining and Mineral
Resources (SMMR) and I have the co-operation of two
other top officials, we have in our possession an
overdue payment in US funds.

The funds represent some percentage of the contract
executed on behalf of my ministry by a foreign firm,
which we over-invoiced to the amount of
US$14,500,000.00 (Fourteen Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars.) Though the actual
contract cost has been paid to the original
contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.

Since the present Government is determined to pay
foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain
good relationship with other governments. As a result
we include our bills for approvals with the
co-operation of some officials at the Federal Ministry
of Finance.

We are seeking your assistance as the Beneficiary of
the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to
operate a foreign account.

We hereby propose that, should you be willing to
assist us in this transaction your share as
compensation will be 30% while my colleagues and I
receive 60% and 10% for miscellaneous expenses.

This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat
it with utmost confidentiality. I have reposed my
confidence in you and hope that you will not
disappoint us.

Kindly notify me by Email :j_coco2002@lycos.com
further details, upon your acceptance of this
proposal.


Best Regards,


Engr. Joseph Coco

dear sir,


My name is karlman khoroma,a Sierra Leonean
residing in Burkina-Faso,West Africa.I am 28years
old.I am an undergrauduate medical student in Fourah
Bay College.

You will be surprise to receive this mail from a total
stranger,Anyway, i got your contact through internet
and decided to approach you for assistance.

My father,the late Dr Kenneth Khoroma,was one of the
prominent Diamond dealers in my  country Sierra Leone,
he was also one of the paramont chiefs in my town
before He was murdered in cold blood early last year
alongside with my mother by the Rebels of R.U.F when
they invaded the town.

When i got home from school to see the remains of my
late father and other family members,i discovered that
my home had been burnt down and my parents were both
murdered by the Rebels of R.U.F that has been fighting
against the legitimate Government in my country since
1992.

My late father deposited the sum of(USD$18million) as
a FAMILY TREASURE IN A TRUST COMPANY here in
Burkina-Faso,West Africa before his untimely death,
this money was meant to be used to build an ultral
mordern  medical Clinic here in Burkina-Faso for me
after i shall have completed my studies as a qualified
Dorctor.

Now,as the next of kin and the only child,i have made
claims of ownership of the box containing the money
although the people at the Trust Company are not aware
of the contents of the box,But i need a reliable
person outside Africa through who could assist me to
move the money abroad and who will subsequently help
me to invest the money wisely while i go back to
school to complete my education.Bear in mind that i
shall entrust this money in your hands if you would be
willing to help me in this matter.

I am also willing to give you 25% of the total sum if
you will be willing to assist me in this matter.In
addition,i will equally deduct 5% after the transfer
to cover expenses incurred in the course of moving
this money abroad to your account.

If you can assist,please get back to me promptly
through my e-mail address so that we can discuss the
modalities of making this move. I will equally insist
that you make it a very private and confidential
matter.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

DR. FRANK BEN.

 EMAIL: frankben@mail.com


 
ATTN: MANAGER / DIRECTOR / C.E.O
 
URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 
I do recognize the surprise this urgent but
 confidential letter will bring to you especially as it
 came from a stranger, but rest assured  that it came
 with the best of intentions. First I introduce myself.
 I am DR. FRANK BEN from the diamond-ich
 district of Sierra Leone and my father was the former special adviser
to the outsted Head of State of Sierra
 Leone, Major Johnny Koroma. I got your address and
 otheer details from the International Chambers of
 Commerce here in South Africa.
 
During the war between our forces led by Ex-Head of
 state, Major Johnny Koroma and the West Africa Allied
 Force (ECOMOG). My country!   relied heavily on the
 foreign earnings generated from diamond trade. This
 money was personally kept by then President, major
 Johnny Koroma since our banking system had collapsed
 during war.
 
However, as the war progressed, it became apparent
 that we were going to loose the war to the superior
 and better armed west Africa allied force (ECOMOG). At this point, the
key officers of the administration started making frantic efforts on how
to leave Sierra
 Leone safely thereby sharing the proceeds / money from
 this diamond trade. In view of the fact that my father
 was one of the key officers of the then administration
 and an In-Law to Major Paul Koroma, he succeded in
 getting the sum of $28.3MILLION (twenty eight million
 three hundred thousand USDollars)
 
We made arangement and transferred the money through
 dipolamatic means to South Af! rica, where I am
 presently living in exile as an asylum seekeer but
 unfortunately , my father died of heart attack after
 few months exile in South Africca and automatically, I
 came in total control of the said money as the only
 surviving son , my mother and two younger sister. Upon
 my arrival in South Africa after due consideration, we
 deposited the money with a (security company ) pending
 when we see a trustworthy person who will assist us in
 transferring this money to his account outside South
 Africa, as the strict monetary laws here do not allow
 asylum seekers certain financial rights.
 
I shall be most grateful if you can assist me in
 accomplish this transaction and hoping too that you
 will remain trustworthy. For efforts and assistance, I
 have agreed to give you 20% of the total sum while 5%
 will  be set aside for all the! expenses incurred in
 the course of this transaction. The rest of the 75%
 will be for my family investment in your country.
 
Please note that I have made arrangements for a
 succesful deal. As such, the only thing I ask from you
 is total assistance to transfer this money, complete
 trust and assurance that my owwn part of the money
 will be safe when transfered to your account. I would
 also wish you kept this proposal highly confidential
 and secret considering my father's position before his
 death and the source of the money. If you are
 interested in assistindg me, please contact me through
 the above telephone or fx numbers as soon as
 posssible.
 
Thanking you in advance for your anticipating
 co-operation.
 
Yours faithfully,
 
DR. FRANK BEN.
 (For the Family)

Barrister Hafiz Judy
IKOYI-LAGOS.

DEAR SIR,

RE: REQUEST FOR MUTUALLY BENEFITTING ENDEAVOUR.

I humbly crave your indulgence in sending you this mail,if the contents
does not meet with your personal and business ethics, I appologise in
advance.
I am barrister Okoli Ayim ( attorney at law), I represent Alhaji
Ishmaila Gwarzo estates. Alhaji Gwarzo was the chief security advicer of
the then
military leader of this country(Nigeria) in the person of Late General
Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. With the advent of a new
democratic
dispensation in the country under the leadership of Gen. Olusegun
Obasanjo (Rtd), my client has come under severe persecution due to the
sensitive position he held in the last military regime, presently he is
under house arrest restricted only to the confines of his village.

The main purpose of this mail is to intimate you of a business proposal
that might be of interest to you. My client has informed me of the
existence of funds deposited with a security company abroad. This fund
came about as part of security votes that were allocated to my client's
portfolio during his tenure as chief security advicer to the then
president. What happened was that he had part of the funds transferred
from the vaults of the Central Bank Of Nigeria to this security outfit
with the aim of purchasing arms and
ammunitions for the personal security outfit of the then president. But
before the purchase could take place the president died. my client has
deceided to keep this for himself as all his properties has been
confisticated by the present regime. But due to his incarceration he
cannot travel out and effect the change of possession to his benefit.

I have been mandated by my client to source for a foreign partner that
can help him facilitate the change of possession. the deposit
certificate 
and the code needed for the execution of this endeavour are in my
possession. my client is also well disposed towards reaching an
agreement with you 
that will be at par with the help required of you.

The funds in question is USD18.6M (Eighteen Million, Six Hundred
Thousand United States dollars Only). Should this proposition be of
interest to you,
you can reach me through my e-mail address so that we can go through the
rudiments of this endeavour.

I remain most obliged.

Yours faithfully,
Hafiz Judy(JP).

From: TREVOR
(External Auditor)
Union Bank of Taiwan,
5F,No.109, Min-Sheng E. Rd.,
Sec. 3, Taipei.
Taiwan, R. O. C.
Telex: 26354 UBTWIBD
E-mail:pro132alltrev@accountant.com

I am an external auditor for Union Bank of Taiwan. I got your email
address while searching for trustworthy individual personality that can
collaborate with me in this matter of crucial mutual benefits.

In carrying out our professional etiquette report, we discovered an
abandoned sum of Thirty Six Million United States Dollars ($36USD) in the
account belonging to one of their late foreign customer who died along
with his entire family in September 2nd 1998 in a plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next
of kin to come over and claim this money because we cannot release it
unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased
as indicated in their banking guidelines. Unfortunately, we learnt that
all his supposed next of kin or relations died alongside with him in the
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this
discovery that I now decided to make this business proposal to you, and
release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased.
And subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't
want this money to go into the Bank Treasury as unclaimed asset.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained
unclaimed after Six years, the money will be transferred into the Bank
Treasury as unclaimed fund.  Regards to the professionalism we have the
mandate to decide who becomes the next of kin, (though classified). The
request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the
fact that the customer was a foreigner and a CITIZEN OF TAIWAN cannot
stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set aside for
expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me. There after
I will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages
stated above.

Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of

FROM: DR EZEOKE AWKA BANK MANAGER 
(UNION BANK OF NIGERIA PLC)MARINA LAGOS
 ATTENTION: PRESIDENT/CEO
 Dear Sir,

 REQUEST FOR YOUR UNRESERVEDASSISTANCE

 Firstly, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by
virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret. Though
I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive
and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day. We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this
transaction, as we have been reliably informed of it's swiftness and
confidentiality.

 Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am DR EZEOKE
AWKA, a Manager at the Union Bank Nigeria PLC, Lagos. I came to know of
you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a
very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum
of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence. A foreigner,
Late Engineer William Adams, an oil Merchant /contractor with the federal
Government of Nigeria, until his death three years ago in a ghastly air
crash, banked with us here at the Union Bank PLC ,Lagos, and had a closing
balance of USD$22.2M (Twenty-Two Million, Two Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars) which the bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by
any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a
discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war collage
here in Nigeria.

 Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch
with any of late Engr. William Adams's next of kin (he had no known wife
and children) that the management under the influence of our chairman,
board of directors, Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that an
arrangement for the fund to be declared "UNCLIAMABLE " and then be
subsequently donated to the trust fund for Arms and Ammunition, which will
further enhance the course of war in Africa and the world in general. In
order to avert this negative development, myself and some of my trusted
colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission to have you stand as
late Engr.WILLIAMS ADAMSs next ofkin so that the fund, USD$22.2M, would be
subsequently transferred and paid into your bank account as the
beneficiary next of kin. All documents and proves to enable you get this
fund have been carefully worked out and we are assuring you a 100% risk
free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount. 10% has
been set aside for expenses, while the rest would be for myself and my
colleagues for purposes in your country.

If this proposal is OK by you and you do not wish to take advantage of the
trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly get to me
immediately via my e-mail address furnishing me with your most
confidential telephone, fax and e-mail, so that I can forward to you the
relevant details of this transaction. Thank you in advance for your
anticipated co-operation.

Regards.
 DR EZEOKE AWKA
(MANAGER UNION BANK OF NIGERIA PLC).

From the desk of: Dr.RICHARD,
Poly clinic II plateaux
Abidjan cote d' ivoire.
West Africa.

Attention,

Dear ONE,
Permit me to acquaint you with this business
proposal which I pray should meet you in good condition and
faith.

I am Dr. RICHARD, a medical doctor in the
hospital as specified above in the city of Abidjan cote d'
ivoire, I am contacting you in respect to the request of my
patient who was admitted in my hospital whose health is
deteriorating

In accordance to what I was made to understand by my
patient who is from Philippines, her late husband was a
member cabinet in the regime of ex president Joseph Estrada
who was accused of corruption and human right abuses who
later was jailed and died in the prison.
But before the death of her husband he deposited the sum
US$13.5 million which is in a metallic iron trunk box in a
security company here Abidjan cote d' ivoire as family
valuables for security reason due to his personality in the
government of Philippines, this I have confirmed to be true
on our last visit to the security company .

Now she was diagnosed and found that she has lungs cancer
which with the equipment we have in this country, we cannot
perform any surgical operation on her unless she is fly
abroad and the money which she inherited from her late
husband is accruing more demurrage in the security company
due to the agreements of which her late husband enter with
the security company(i.e. there is need for her late
husband foreign business partner whose name and contact was
not mentioned).

With respect o this we are soliciting for your urgent
assistance as the long awaited foreign business partner of
her husband in order for her to claim this fund from the
security company and transferred abroad into your
designated bank account for safety and to enable her
undergo the operation as she has agreed to give you 15% of
this said fund for your benefit and 5% for all expenses
that you may undergo in the cause of this transaction.

Please endeavour to furnish me with your private telephone
and fax to enable me furnish you with every detailed
information's in regards to this business as I wait for
your quick response.

Thanks in advance for your quick response.

Yours sincerely,

Dr.RICHARD

ATTN:
Dear Sir,
 
I know this letter may beat your imagination, as we
have no previous correspondence.

Well i got your contact from my serious search for a
good profile foreigner and then i decided to write
you, after a very long time of indecision pondering to
see if i can confide in you. Please i will like you to
be as transparent and trustworthy to engage in this
business and assurrance that my own money must be
given to me when this money is transfered to your
country or account hence my reason for writing you. To
introduce myself, i am Prince Amanda Sese Seko one of
the sons of the late former President of Zaire Mobutu
Sese Seko Kuku Ngbendu Wa Za Bang, so now i will like
to do this transaction with you as someone who have
been into production. My father the late president
Mobutu Sese Seko made the sum of $18,000,000 USD in
cash, he tactically defaced this money and stashed
them in a security trunk box in order to enable him
move the money out of Zairien shores just as the rebel
forces close by. Because of his political power and
influence he succeeded and deposited this money in a
security company in Dakar-Senegal. But unfortunately
for him he died of cancer in Casablanca,Morroco, since
his death the present government has consficated all
his properties because of this i decided to travel to
Senegal where my last hope lies and where i am
currently living. This money in question has been in
the security company since my fathers death uptil this
moment.But my main problem now is at my age of 30
years i have never handled such huge amount of
money,iam confused on how to handle this huge amount
of money and also what to do with it as i don't have
anyone to confide in here in Dakar-Senegal. May i
therefore use this medium to request from you if you
will be disposed enough to help me keep this huge
amount of money in your country or any other place of
your choice. I intend to invest this money on any
profitable business venture. I have met with and held
discussion with the security company showed them the
depositional documents which my father left behind of
which my name appeared as the next of kin,the company
awaits my coming for the withdrawal and iam afraid of
disclosing the contents to them since my father
strictly warned me against that. Surprisingly for me
the chemist who dyed the bills for my father lives in
Dakar. He will also do the cleansing i have his
telephone number but not his address. If it appeals to
you to help me, i suggest you take a trip to Senegal
for us to see face to face and arrange with the
chemist man for him to do the cleansing before moving
the fund to where ever that may be nominated by you.
If all goes well 20% of the total amount will be for
you. For the confirmation of your willingness to
assist me.
Best Regards,
Prince Amanda Sese Seko

of NATIONAL BANK OF FUJAIRAH DUBAI .FUJAIRAH BUILDING
PO Box 2979 KHALID BIN WALEED STREET DUBAI

E-mail:kasiw5@accountant.com

Dear Sir

I am the Chief auditor for FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND REMITTANCES DEPARTMENT of
NATIONAL BANK OF FUJAIRAH DUBAI .

I got your email adress while searching for trustworthy countries and
individuals.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ (USD 26
M)

Twenty six million United States Dollars). In an account that belongs to
one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in
november 1999 in a plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next
of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it
unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased
as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that
all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this
discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make
this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of
kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement
since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the
Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained
unclamed after four years, the money will be transfered into the Bank
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in
this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner
and a CITIZEN OF DUBAI cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for
expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my
colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for
disbursement accoding to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as
arranged,you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of
the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your
private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and
location where in the money will be remitted . I will also instruct you on
how you can add in your application to our bank that you get paid through
our corresponding bank in america as this will be easier for us all

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of
fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer .

Your's faithfully.

FROM: DIAKA TSHOMBE

DEAR FRIEND,

MY GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE THIS
LETTER MEETS YOU IN GOOD HEALTH. I AM DIAKA TSHOMBE, AIDE
TO THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF
ZAIRE NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC).
I AM WRITING TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON YOUR
PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN
SOUTH AFRICA.

I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN CONFIDENCE
CONSIDERING MY PRSENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION AS A
WAR REFUGEE HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA. FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE LATE
PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER, I WAS
INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF
US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND
LODGED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING
DISCLOSED AS FAMILY VALUABLES IN MY NAME PENDING
FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16 1997,
PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE REBELS
LED BY LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM
KISINGANI AND FLED TO TOGO FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED
TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1997 LESS
THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER. HE
WAS AGED 66 YEARS. I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO SOUTH AFRICA WITH
MY SON PATRICE, AGED 17 WHERE I AM PRESENTLY RESIDING AS A
WAR REFUGEE SHORTLY AFTER THE CAPITAL CITY
KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER BY REBELS. I LOST MY WIFE
AND MY TWO CHILDREN, AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS DURING THE
REBEL ONSLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY.

THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE
AMASSED A PERSONAL FORTUNE OF US$8BILLION WITH HOUSES
IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT
PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE
SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO
FREEZE ALL HIS ASSETS AND CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES. I
THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE
SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE NOW THAT
PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON JOSEPH
KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER.

I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY ABROAD
WHERE THE MONEY IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES.
THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY
RECEIVING THE MONEY ON MY BEHALF. ACKNOWLEDGE THIS
MESSAGE SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU THE MODALITIES FOR THE
CLAIM OF THE FUNDS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE THE
HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH THIS BUSINESS
DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND
CONFIDENCE WHCH I HAVE REPOSED IN YOU.

IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST, I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE
OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE
CURRENTLY BEIGN MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER
MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. I
AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF THE
MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTION IS CONCLUDED.

FOR THIS REASON, KINDLY FURNISH ME YOUR CONTACT
INFORMATION, WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX
NUMBERS FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE
RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS.

YOURS SINCERELY,

DIAKA TSHOMBE.

DEAR FRIEND, 

MY GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE THIS LETTER MEETS YOU IN
GOOD HEALTH. I AM KESAYI NDIEFI, AIDE TO THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU
SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC). I AM
WRITING TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON YOUR PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SOUTH AFRICA. I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER
IN CONFIDENCE CONSIDERING MY PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION AS A WAR
REFUGEE HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA. FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU
SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER, I WAS INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE
AVAILABLE THE SUM OF US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND
LODGED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING DISCLOSED AS FAMILY
VALUABLES IN MY NAME PENDING FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY
16 1997, PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE REBELS LED BY
LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM KISINGANI AND FLED TO TOGO FROM
WHERE HE LATER MOVED TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1997 LESS
THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER. HE WAS AGED 66 YEARS.

I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO SOUTH AFRICA WITH MY SON PATRICE, AGED 17 WHERE I
AM PRESENTLY RESIDING AS A WAR REFUGEE SHORTLY AFTER THE CAPITAL CITY
KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER BY REBELS. I LOST MY WIFE AND MY TWO CHILDREN,
AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS DURING THE REBEL ON SLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY.
THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE AMASSED A PERSONAL
FORTUNE OF US$8 BILLION WITH HOUSES IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER,
THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE SWISS
GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL HIS ASSETS AND
CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES. I THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN SOUTH AFRICA TO
STUDY THE SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT
LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON JOSEPH KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER.

I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY ABROAD WHERE THE MONEY IS
STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES. THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT
THEM FROM KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO INDICATE YOUR
INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON MY BEHALF.
ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU THE MODALITIES FOR THE
CLAIM OF THE FUNDS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE THE HIGH LEVEL OF
CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY
THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE WHCH I HAVE REPOSED IN YOU. IF YOU WANT TO
ASSIST, I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE
FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES
INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES.

I AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY AS SOON AS
THE TRANSACTION IS CONCLUDED. FOR THIS REASON, KINDLY FURNISH ME YOUR
CONTACT INFORMATION, WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS FOR
CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE ABOVE
EMAIL ADDRESS.

YOURS SINCERELY, 
KESAYI NDIEFI.

Three Million eight hundred United State Dollars),
(this is aside the accrued interest so far from that date) the bank 
now expects his next of kin as beneficiary.Valuable efforts are being 
made by the Bank to get in touch with any of 
the Family or Relatives but to no success.
 
It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to 
locate any of his family next of kin. 

The Management under the influence of our Chairman
and Members of the Board of Directors, 
that arrangement has been made for the fund to be 
decleared "Unclaimed" and subsequentlly be
donated to the trust fund for arms and ammunition to further enhance

of kin. so that the fund will be
released and paid into your Account as the beneficiary next of kin.

carefully worked out. We have secured from
the probate registry, an order of Mandamus to locate any of the 
deceased's beneficiary(ies), and more so
we are assuring you that this business is 100% Risk Free. Your share 
will be 30% of the total sum 10 % will be set aside for
expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me.

arranged,
you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the 
deceased

text of the application.

up documents that will make you eligible to claim the fund as his

From;Mr.Daniel Kargbo and Family,
         Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to
you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my
family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not
the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the
attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's
information directory at the external affairs ministry,here in
johannesburg,during my desperate search for someone who can assist me
secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family
fortunes.

My name is Mr.Daniel Kargbo,the second son of Mr.Smith Thabo Kargbo,of
Beithbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our
country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and
ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert
G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our
country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful
death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some
white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his
life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold
from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and
crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his
followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their
wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after
winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate
all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers
assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these
white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that
are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and
younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live
without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Twelve Million
United States Dollars[$12.000.000.00]in a Trunk box with a Finance and
Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and
Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions
to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his
untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only
surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and
confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white
farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my
intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is
lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company
and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear
and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and
blocked by the present Mugabe's regime.My mother is presently with the
valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the
person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name
and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the
Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift
it out to their europe office.

2. To assist me in getting a living home/house in your country where I
will come and settle down and take care of my family and star a fresh
life.

3. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any
lucrative business in your country for at least three years.

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and
much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and
reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential
nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it
to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this
help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you
read this very request.

Best Regards, 
Mr.Daniel Kargbo and family.

Dear Friend

First i must solicit for your strictest confidence in this transaction
and I pray that my decision to contact you will be given genuine
approval considering the fact that we have not know each other before.

I wish to use this opportunity to introduce myself to you, I am Mrs Mary
Iddo Sankoh,the wife of the  former minister of Diamond Mining
Corporation in my country,My husband had a bullet shot by the rebels on
his way travelling to Lusia a city after Freetown the capital along with
my daughter, My daughter died on the spot while the U N peace keeping
force rescued my Husband, he was taken to  hospital for medical
treatment which he later died about three months now. 

Fortunately,  my Husband has Ten million, Five hundred thousand United
States Dollars(US$10.5million)cash which he intended to use for
investment purposes overseas. This money was sent out of the country via
diplomatic means to avoid traces and deposited with a security company
in Europe . It is only my son and myself that know where the money is
kept and has the documents for it.

Due to the current situation in the country concerning government^Òs
vendettas towards my family, we seek your assistance to transfer the
ownership of this fund to you so that you can asisst us to claim it and
used for the purpose of investment as intended by my husband. 

My family is currently being probed by this present government for
alleged involvement in misappropriation of public funds during his
regime.Towards this effect, an embargo restricting my family members
from traveling or carrying out financial transactions without their
express permission is in force. This has made put us in a very serious
financial problem as we can hardly eat and take care of our family
now.this is the purpose of this urgent contact for coperation.

However, I have an arrangement on how you can help us to recieve this
money  after receiving some assurances from you.The money personally
belongs to my husband and he intended that it still be used for
investment. No record ever existed concerning this money, neither is the
money traceable by the government because there is no documentation
concerning the funds in the Federal Treasury. The security company will
only require you to provide the certificate of deposite with which this
was deposted and a power of attorney from the family to you for the
claim, we have all these documents ready pending your confirmation.  

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, we
have agreed for a commission of 20%(twenty Percent) of the total sum to
you for the expected services and assistance. While 5% is mapped out for
miscellaneous expenses.On your positive consent, I shall expect you to
contact my son urgently  who just managed to travel to South Africa via
ship  to enable you discuss about this.

Your urgent response is highly needed.He just arrived South Africa and
has sought political assylum, all the relevant documents to this are
with him in south africa now where he intends to stay untill this
transaction is completed, I must use this opportunity to implore you to
exercise utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily
confidential, I shall upon the reciept of your response forward to you
the contact number and details of my son(Abdul Williams Sankoh) in south
africa so that you can open immediate correspondence with him as it is
not very safe for me to cordinate and speak regarding this transaction
from this country. 

I await your urgent response.

To: ...


FROM THE DESK OF DR. EMEKA .G.AFOR


CONTRACT REVIEW PANEL
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT COMPLEX (ANNEX)
NIGERIA
ATTN:

Sir,

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

First I must solicit your strictest condfidentiality
in this transaction.  This is by virture as being
utterly confidential and "TOP SECRET". You have been
recommended by Nigeria chamber of commerce of your
ability and reliability to transact business of great
magnitude of this kind.

We are top officials of the Federal Government of
Nigeria Contracts Review Panel who are interested in
importation of goods into our country with funds that
are presently trapped in Nigeria.  In order to
commence this business, we solicit your assistance to
enable us transfer into your account the said
trapped-funds.

The source of this funds is as follows: during the
immediate past military regime here in Nigeria,
Military Government Officials set up companies and
awarded themselves contracts which were grossly over
invoiced in various ministries.  The present civilian
government has set up this panel to look into
contracts awarded to local/foreign contractors, for
which payment has not been made.  In the course, we
have been able identified many inflated funds that are
presently floating in the Bank of Nigeria ready for
payment.  However, by virtue of our positions as civil
servants and members by my colleagues of the panel to
look for an overseas partner into whose account we
could transfer the sum of US $30,000,000.00 (Thirty
Million U.S. Dollars).  We have a complete
understanding of the workings of this form of endeavor
and as civil servants, we shall need some financial
assistance in completing the project where you decide
to assist us.

We have agreed to share the money thus:

20% for the account owner (You)
75% for us (The Officials)
5% to be set aside in setting all foreign expenses and
local expenses (by us) incidental to the actualisation
of this project.

As a token of our gratitude as soon as you confirm the
arrival of the funds in your Account, we shall arrange
for you the equivalent of 500,000 barrels of
Automobile Gasoline (AGO), for spotlifting as less
than market price.  One of my colleagues, Mr. A. Abba,
is directly in charge of Crude Oil allocation .

We wish to invest our share of the proceeds from the
project in your country.  This is where we need your
assistance most in the area of investment.

Please, note that this transaction is 100% safe, and
we intend to effect the transfer within 10 banking
days from the date of receipt of the following
information via email address and  fax numbers above,
your full names, company name and address confidential
telephone and fax numbers   The above information will
enable us write letters of claim and job description
respectably, using your company's name to apply for
the payment and re-award the contract to your company.
We are looking forward to doing this business with
you and solicit your confidentiality in this
transaction.

Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using
the above email address.  I will bring you into the
complete picture of this pending project when I have
heard from you.

Yours faithfully,

DR. EMEKA.G.AFOR

Subject: HELLO SIR


ATTN: CEO/PRESIDENT.
I am sorry for the embarrassment this my letter
might cause you as we have not had any correspondence
before this . l got your address through my lawyer who
works with Nigerian Chamber of Commerce lndustry and
Mining during my research for a reliable and trustworthy partner who l can
do business with though l did not disclose the nature of the business l
intend to do with whomever he recommends for me.
l am DR. MRS MARIAN ABACHA, wife of the late Nigerian
Head of State, General Sanni Abacha who died on
the 8th of June, 1998 while on active duty. l am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will be
of great assistance to each other . I currently have within my possession
the sum of Eighteen million five hundred thousand US Dollars(US$18.5
million) cash which l intend to use for investment, specifically in your
country although I do not know in what field yet. This money came as a
payback contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our
country's multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant.
The Russian Partners returned my husband's share
of USD$18,500,000.00 after the death of my husband
and it lodged in my husband's security company of which l am director right
now, the new Civilian Government has intensified their probe on my husband's
financial and oil company. ln view of this, l acted fast to withdraw the
US$18,500,000.00 from the company's vault and deposited it in a Security
Company.l have since declared my husband's Security Company bankrupt.No
record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government because
there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the
Russians. Due to the current situation in the country concerning
government's attitude towards my family, it has become quite impossible for
me to make use of this money within.Let me refer you to the front page of
this day newspapers of 12th May,2001. You can check it through their website
www.thisdayonline.com.
The present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all our bank
accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus l shall expect you to contact
me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction. Bearing
in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, l propose a
percentage of 30% of the total sum to you for the expected service and
assistance,5% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the course of this
transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed so as to stop further
contacts.
All correspondence must be by the email address
above.
l will give you my tel/fax numbers where you can
contact me when l hear from you. l must use this
opportunity to implore on you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this
matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision while awaiting
your prompt response.
 NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family, l
have decided that this transaction exist between you and my lawyer Barrister
Yusuf Mamman.Please do  remember to include your private tel/fax or mobile
number for easy communication.
Best Regards
DR. (MRS) MARIAN ABACHA.

Subject: Online A/C Partnership

Dear

I am Tayo Samsudin, Retired Chief Accountant of the
Kenya Central Bank. Kenya is a picturesque East
African Country widely known for its abundance of wild
game, safaris, and Tourism ; which is still a major
foreign exchange earner for the Kenyan economy.

As you are aware, the Central Bank of every Country
acts as the Bankers^Ò bank. However, a few high
networth individuals and corporations routinely
maintained A/Cs with the Kenya Central Bank.

And so, in September 1997, a multimillionaire  Oil
Magnate, Ilic Novko from Bosnia/ Hezegovina opened a
time (fixed) deposit A/C in the Kenya Central Bank,
and I was privileged to act as his A/C
supervisor/manager. The opening balance was USD54
million. Unfortunately, the Kosovo crisis claimed his
life and that of his entire family! I spent years
tracing his next of kin but it was a deadend!

A few years before my retirement, I decided to make a
perfect plan to transfer this money out abroad. Using
a complicated system of shortfall deposits, I withdrew
this money and placed it in a holding A/C. The ONLY
problem is that by law, Kenyan indigenes are NOT
allowed to transfer out this volume of money abroad!
There are legal restrictions which will stop any
attempt by me to single handedly transfer this money
abroad^Å

I therefore need your help!  It is simple! There will
be no risk and no illegality involved. All I need is a
willing foreign partner who will agree to help me.
How?

I have concluded arrangements to lodge the money into
an online Bank in Kenya, and from there, the money can
be transferred to any Bank of our  choice. But as I
mentioned earlier, I am handicapped because I am a
Kenya national. If you agree to help me, then please
send me your full name so that I can ^ÓESTABLISH^Ô the
ONLINE BANK A/C IN YOUR NAME^ÅThat way you will be able
to personally transfer the money out to any hidden A/C
of our Choice, WITHOUT YOU TRAVELLING TO ANYWHERE!
ALSO, YOU WILL NOT SIGN ANY DOCUMENTS FOR ANY ASPECT
OF THE TRANSACTION!

This is how it will work.
Step 1- I will Establish/Activate  the online A/C in
your name and lodge the money now total USD55.7million
( inclusive of interests) into the Account.
Step 2  I will give you the Account Access information
which will include :-

 (a)  Customer Name

 (b)  Customer ID

  ©  Security Code

 (d) Account Number

 (e) Amount in US$

Step 3  Once you have been given the A/C access
information as per above, you will then be in a
position to wire transfer out all the money to ANY
A/Cs of our choice! AND YOU DO NOT NEED TO GIVE ME OR
ANY ONE YOUR A/C INFORMATION BEFOREHAND; ONLY YOU WILL
KNOW AND USE YOUR CONFIDENTIAL A/Cs DETAILS TO MAKE
THE WIRE TRANSFERS YOURSELF!  The best part is that
you will do this using your personal computer, in the
comfort of your home!

I hope this will be an enduring partnership, because
I will need your help to check out investment options
for me;  The money will be shared on the ratio of
50/50
If you are interested, please contact me immediately,
giving me your FULL NAMES, TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS ,
and I will get back to you.

Regards,

Tayo Samsudin

Subject: CONFIDENTIAL TRANSACTION ASSISTANCE


CONFIDENTIAL
From: Dr. Jelingo Mobutu

Hello,

It is my pleasure to establish this communication with
you; my name is DR. JELINGO MOBUTU. The son of Mobutu
Seseseko the late president of Zaire, Republic of
Congo. I got your contact from a reliable source and I
am asking for your assistance in business that is
considered of mutual benefit.

My father, Mobutu Seseseko died of cancer shortly
after he was overthrown as the president of the
republic of Congo and he acquired a lot of wealth from
the sales of Gold, Diamond and other mineral resources
while he was in power.

The next Government that took over from my father
headed by the late General Kabila took a decision and
seized a lot of my fathers properties and some bank
account with huge amount of money were also frozen at
the World Bank in Switzerland.

Presently I have the sum of ($25,000,000,00) Twenty
five million U.S Dollars cash, which is part of the
money that I inherited from my father and I cannot
invest the money in my country because of the
political instability. I sincerely require your
assistance to secure the above amount in your account
for safekeeping and investment in your Country. I will
advice that we have to maintain absolute
confidentiality and honesty with this mutual
transaction and your assistance will be highly
appreciated and compensated.

I will also suggest that we make arrangement to have a
meeting with you and also to prepare business
agreement before the transaction is concluded.

I am willing to offer you 10% of the total amount as
commission for your assistance and 5% reserve for
general miscellaneous expenditure and I am also
prepared to invest part of my money into your
company.

Please reply as soon as possible and confirm your
interest and your capability to assist me to enable me
proceed with the necessary arrangement to conclude the
transaction with you.

Looking forward to your response and I hope that we
can establish a successful business relationship together.

Best regards,

Dr. Jelingo Mobutu

ATTN: PRESIDENT/CEO

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION 

I am contacting you based on information and esteem
recommendation I received of you from a high ranking
official in the commercial section of the Nigerian
Chambers of Commerce and Industry who guaranteed your
reliability and trustworthyness in business dealings.
This business proposal I wish to intimate you with is
of mutual benefit and it's success is entirely based
on mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of
confidentiality as regard this transaction. 

I am the Chairman of the contract Advisory Committee
(CAC) of the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Works and
Housing (FMWH). I am seeking your assistance to enable
me transfer the sum of US$16,500,000.00 (Sixteen
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)
into your private/company account. 

The fund came about as a result of a contract awarded
and executed on behalf of my Ministry the Federal
Ministry of Works and Housing. 
The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign
contractors to the tune of US$60,000,000.00 (Sixty
Million United States Dollars). 

But in the course of negotiation, the contract was
awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of
US$43,500,000.00 (Forty-Three Million, Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) to my benefit unknown
to the contractor. This contract has been
satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian
firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry,
where I am the Executive Director in-charge of all
foreign contract payment approval. 

As a civil servant still in active government service,
I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside
the shores of Nigeria. Hence this message to you
seeking your assistance so as to enable me present
your private/company account details as a beneficiary
of contractual claims alongside that of the Bulgarian
contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of
US$16,500,000.00 (Sixteen Million, Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) into your provided
account.On actualisation, the fund will be disbursed as stated
below. 
1. 30% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary. 
2. 10% for reimbursement to both parties for
incidental expenses that may be incurred during the
course of the transaction. 
3. 60% of the fund will be for me which I intend to
invest in your country with you as my partner. 
All logistics are in place and all modalities worked
out for a smooth actualisation of the transaction
within the next few working days of commencement. For
further details as to the workability of this
transaction. 
Thank you and God bless as I await your urgent
response. 

Yours Sincerely, 
Dr. Dr .ZACK EGO .

FROM:Dr.Solomon Chukwuka 
Zenith International Bank Nig.PLC.
 Marina,Branch,Lagos-Nigeria 

Dear Sir,

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this 
is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and 
TOP SECRET. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude 
will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring 
you that all will be well at the end of the day. We have decided 
to contact you by e-mail due to the urgency of this transaction, 
as we have been reliably informed of it's swiftness and confidentiality. 

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I 
am Dr.Solomon Chukwuka, a Manager at the Zenith International 
Bank Nig.PLC.Lagos. I came to know of you in my private search 
for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential 
transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money 
to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence.

 THE PROPOSITION: 

A foreigner, late Engineer John Creek, an Oil Merchant / contractor 
with the federal Govenment of Nigeria, until his death some 
years ago in a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at Zenith 
International Bank Nig.PLC.., Lagos, and had a closing balance 
of USD$40.M ( Forty Million, United States Dollars) which the 
bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his 
available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to 
a discredited trust fund for alms and ammunition at a military 
war college here in Nigeria.

 Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the ou Bank to get 
in touch with any of the Creek family or relatives but all have 
proved to no avail.It is because of the perceived possibility 
of not going to be able to locate any of late Engr. John Creek's 
next of kin (he had no known wife and children) that the management 
under the influence of our Chairman, board of directors, Retired 
Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that an arrangement for the fund 
to be declared "UNCLAIMABLE" and then be subsequently donated 
to the Trust Fund for Alms and Ammunition which will further 
enhance the course of war in Africa and the world in general. 


In order to avert this negative development, myself and some 
of my trusted colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission 
to have you stand as late Engr. Johnson Creek's next of kin 
so that the fund, USD$40 M would be subsequently transferred 
and paid into your bank account as the beneficiary next of kin. 
All documents and proves to enable you get this fund have been 
carefully worked out and we are assuring you a 100% risk free 
involvement. 

Your share would be 20% of the total amount. 10% has been set 
aside for expenses while the rest would be for myself and my 
colleagues for investment purposes in your country.

 If this proposal is OK. by you and you do not wish to take 
advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, 
then kindly get to me immediately via my e-mail furnishing me 
with your most confidential telephone, fax number and exclusive 
e-mail so that I can forward to you the relevant details of 
this transaction. 

Thank you in advance for your anticipated co-operation. 

Regards, 

Dr Solomon Chukwuka, 
Zenith International Bank Nig.PLC

FEDERAL MINISTRY OF HEALTH & SOCIAL SERVICES LAGOS -

Attn: WIRE WORLD. For your assistance please. We write
to solicit your assistance for this transaction
believing that you will treat this with utmost
confidence, and excuse me for the embarrassment this
letter might cause you as we have not met or known
each other before. I have the mandate of my colleagues
in my office to solicit for your assistance for a
business/deal we want to execute with you.

y ministry, Federal Ministry of Health and Social
Services (FMHSS) awarded a contract of (US$ 
115,800,000.00) one hundred and fifteen 
million eight hundred thousand United States Dollars

Scan Machines, x-ray machines, E.C.G. Machines, Fetus
Heart and Fasting Blood Sugar Machines for University
Teaching Hospitals all over the Federation. I and ther

senior members of my department (contract award
committee), on cause of writing the contract were able
to over-invoice the contract sum to the tone of
(143,300,000.00), one hundred and forty three million,
three hundred thousand United States Dollars. And it
might also interest you to know that the original
contractors, who executed the contract, have been paid
their contract amount on completionof the contract.
Now we are left with the over-invoiced sum of
(27,500,000.00) twenty seven million five hundred
thousand United State Dollars, for our mutual benefit.
All arrangements have been concluded on how this money
will be moved. Our constraints lie on the fact that we
required a foreign firm or individual account 
number where this money will be paid into; whose owner
will be portrayed as the beneficiary of the contract
fund. In fact this is why I am writing you this letter
seeking for your assistance.
 Note: there is no risk involved as we have taken
care,loopholes covered. As civil servants, we are
aware that some financial assistance will be required
to effect the success of this money
transfer, for this reason we have generally agreed to
reimburse you with the sum of (US$3,000,000.00) three
million United States Dollars, while the balance of
(US$24,500,000.00) twenty four million five hundred
thousand United States Dollars, have been mapped out 
for importation of telecommunication equipment, and we
suggest you help in this venture. Please, indicate
your position on this, if you are willing to assist?
We will require the following information to enable us
put claim to this money immediately. Your bank name, 
address and account number, Fax/Tele numbers of the
bank where the money will be transferred. If you are
not willing to assist we plea you keep this only to
your self and inform us back of your position. 
It is important I mention that the officials involved
in this transaction are top government functionaries
who have put in years of service to this Country
(Nigeria). For the maintenance of personal integrity
and prestige of all persons involved in this 
transaction, you are implored to exhibit utmost
secrecy throughout the duration of this deal. You are
strongly advised to avoid discussing this transaction
with a third party as that could jeopardize the
success of this transaction. You may open a separate
account in any country of your choice for this purpose

if you wish. Meanwhile all arrangements for this
transfer to be concluded in this third quarter of the
year 2002 have been properly organized and further
action awaits your response to this request. So I
oblige you to send the required information to me
immediately this will enable us to process for the
approval of this payment into your desired bank
account. 
Yours faithfully, 
MR TETE

Dear Sir/Madam


SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. 

Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. 
This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and 
trust wordy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited
but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. 

My name is COL. WILFRED TUKUR of the Democratic Republic of Congo 
and One of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic 
Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in
peace. 

Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the 
rebels in my country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed 
by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition
worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only
(US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. We were then given this money
privately by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of
other Cabinet Members. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody
shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out
of Congo, We immediately decided to put the funds into a private security
company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is
presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of
properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila)
a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the
new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late
President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 

In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner 
who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic
Cover to a security company in Europe in your name. This is to ensure that
the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it will not pass
through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. 

Our inability to move this money out of Congo all this while lies 
on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who
suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President
Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen
nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has
worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your
sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state
fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality. 

We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary 
of this fund in Europe. This is because we are under restricted 
movement and watch and hence we want to be very carefull in other 
not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for. Thus, if 
you are willing to assist us move this fund out of Congo, you can 
contact me through my email address, Tel/Fax nos. above with your 
telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss 
the modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.

Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as every 
ones Security is Gurranteed as far as we follow the required guidlines. I
will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as soon as I am
assured of your Sincere interest to assist us. 

I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise 
the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential,
Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and
God Bless.

Ghanaian Chamber of commerce and after due
consultation with my spiritual adviser, I decided to
Contact you believing that by the grace of God that
you will accept to be my partner in this mutual
business.

I have been working with this company for eleven good
years. Within this period, I have watched with
meticulous precision how African Heads of States and
Government functionaries have been using STANDARD
SECURITIES to move huge sums of money US Dollar, pound
sterlling, French Francs-cash to their foreign
partners oversea. They bring in these consignments of
money cash and secretly declare the contents as
jewelries, gold, diamond, precious stones, family
treasure, documents etc.
Gen. Sani Abacha of Nigeri(dead), Mobutu Sese Seko of
Zaire (dead), Foday Sankoy of Siera Leone. Rtd Gen.
Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria, Felix Houphet Buigny of
Ivory Coast (dead). Kanan Bedie of Ivory Coast etc.
all these people have tens of consignments deposited
with us, STANDARD SECURITIES. Their foreign partners
are claiming most of the consignments due to the fact
that they have every information about the
consignment. A lot of them are laying here unclaimed
for as much as two (2) yrs now. Nobody may ever come
for them because in most cases, the documents of
deposit are never available to any body except the
depositors / STANDARD SECURITIES LTD.

In STANDARD SECURITIES the procedure of claims to
consignments is:
As soon as you are able to produce all the secret
information as contained in the secret files of any
consignment, it will be released to you upon demand.
>From my record, more than 4 consignments belonging to
Mobutu Sese Seko, has been claimed in the past Six
months. This is why I am soliciting for your
co-operation and assistance.

Late Gen. Sani Abacha has five consignments deposited
with several Codes and names. One has been claimed in
the past 2yrs. Since he died, the family members are
under restricted arrest without communication, some
ran into exile.

I have finished every arrangement for you to claim
consignment No.002101. Containing US$45,000,000.00
(FOURTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS). My duty
is to supply you with all the information and
Documents needed to claim the consignment; you will
deal with the management directly. The procedure is
very simple and easy: - Apply officially to the
director of operations of STANDARD SECURITIES for the
release of consignment No.002101. Contact the
management of STANDARD SECURITIES & SERVICES on Email
Address which I will provide for you when you confirm
to me that you are interested.
The management will demand for some documents and
secret codes of the consignment, which I will supply,
you with every detailed information needed before you
claim the consignment. As soon as they confirm it to
be correct with the information they have in their
file. They will invite you for the collection. If you
do not want to come, you can arrange with them to
transfer the consignment to anywhere or your
destination on agreement. Please, Nobody or any of my
colleague will ever know I am involved in the deal
except the Lawyer who will write an agreement bonding
for us.

I will suggest upon conclusion, we share 70% for me -
20% for you and 10% for any expenses incurred during
the course of the transfer for both parties. I assure
you that, this deal have been carefully hatched for
months now, it is very secure and risk free.
You can contact me through my private fax number
234-1-7590424 for further explanations about
directives on the procedure. I bet my life that we
cannot fail.

God bless you.

Thanks.

Mr CINON ABIOLA.

Dear Sir,

I am the Chairman Contract Review Committee of National Electric Power
Authority (NEPA).

Although this proposal might come to you as a surprise since it is coming
from someone you do not know or has never seen before, but it was after
due deliberations with my colleagues, that I decided to contact you. We
are soliciting for your humble and confidential assistance to take custody
of Twenty Eight Million United States Dollars.{US $28,000,000.00}.

This sum (US$28M) is an over invoice contract sum which is currently in an
offshore payment account of the Central Bank of Nigeria as an unclaimed
contract entitlement which can easily be withdrawn or drafted or pay to
any recommended beneficiary by my committee. On this note, you will be
presented as a contractor to NEPA who has executed a contract to a tune of
the above sum and has not been paid.

Proposed Sharing Pattern (%):
1. 80% for me and my colleagues.
2. 15% for you as a partner(fronting for us).

3. 5% for expenses that may be incurred by both parties during the cause
of this transaction.

Our law prohibits a civil servant from operating a foreign account, hence
we are contacting you. If this proposal satisfies you, do respond as soon
as possible with the following information:

1. The name you wish to use as the beneficiary of the fund.

2. Your Confidential Phone and Fax Numbers.

Further discussion will be centered on how the fund shall be transfer and
full details on how to accomplish this great opportunity of ours.


Best regards,

Mr. Robert Ajayi.

Dear Sir,



It is with trust and confidence and based on good
recommendation from a
reliable source that I contact you to reveal this
confidential issue to
you hoping that we will keep it to yourself and give it the
kind
secrecy and thought it demands.

I know that this message might come to you as a surprise
especially
since we have not met or discussed before. Basically, the
message might
sound strange to you but it is a reality. The truth is that
I should have
notified first you through a more confidential means at
least to
respect your integrity. Please accept my sincere apology if
I have caught you
unaware as I frankly do not mean any harm in passing my
goodwill
message to you.

My name is Anthony Williams. I am the only son of late Dr.
Frederick
Williams. We are indigenes of Sierra Leone. Until the
government agents
assassinated him on April 18 last year, my father was top
member of an
opposition group in my country. It was his strong stand
against
injustice in my country that made the government to plan
and get him killed and
burnt down our resident, which made my mother ran to my
maternal home
and I myself ran away to Nigeria where I currently leave as
an illegal
immigrant, hiding in the apartment of my old school
friend.

Before he was killed, my father has in cash, the sum of
US$20million
(twenty million United States dollars), which he deposited
for me as his
only son in a security company in Nigeria. It is this money
he kept for
me in Nigeria that made me to run to Nigeria so that I will
not be
killed by government agents in my country, and at the same
time, for me to
lay claim and get the money in my possession.

It is at this point, in search of a reliable company or
individual that
will help me to move the money to a safer place like
Europe, America or
Asia for the purpose of investments that I got your contact
through a
reliable person in the Nigerian chamber of commerce and
industry. I must
at this point let you know that I did not disclose to the
person that
gave me your contact and will not disclose to anybody the
kind of
transaction I intend to carry out with you.

My purpose of contacting you is this: I want you to help me
in moving
the money to a safer place in Europe, America or Asia,
provide a good
and safe bank account where the money will be lodged and
after that, you
will take 13% of the whole money,
and give
me the balance of 87% . You
will also
help and teach me the profitable areas of business in which
I will invest
my own part money. When we finally meet for the sharing of
the money,
if we can come to an agreement, we may enter into a
partnership venture.

Please let us work together for the mutual benefit of both
of us.
Contact me as soon as you read this message so that I will
give you more
details about the transaction and for us to start. I will
assure you that
with your cooperation, we will conclude this transaction
within a space
of 10 to 12 days. Reply through e-mail and also call me of
my personal
line: +234 8023279395. While replying, add your personal
phone, fax and
mobile phone numbers for easy confidential communication.

NOTE: this transaction demands topmost confidentiality and
should be
treated as such, so do not disclose to anybody at all. If
for any reason
you do not want to work with me, still respond and let me
know.

While I await your most urgent reply and phone call, I pray
that God
will bring us together, help us in the transaction and see
us through in
other things we will do together both now and in the near
future.

Best regards,

Anthony Williams

Dear Sir, 
I am Quadri Salam I am working for EXCEL
arking/Advertising Company as their public relation
officer. Now I have resigned because Alhaji Hassan
Dagash the CEO of ENTRACO SARL whom the cattle
medicine will be supplied to has accepted my proposal
and request to be supplying him 350cartons of the
medicine every three months at the rate of $7,320 USD
pre carton. 
I resigned my job because my boss was not faithful 
to me. I met Alhaji Dagash in a seminar held in DAOLA
on 4th September 2000 and in our discussion he told me
that he spends huge amount of money annually on a
particular brand of a cattle medicine and he urged me
to help him source for the medicine at a cheaper rate.

Back in the office I discussed the issue with my 
boss and he promised me 15% of the profit if we should
succeed. Fortunately, I found a company in spain that
produces this particular medicine. And the company
sells a carton for $2,200USD.
We supplied the first 350 cartons on the 12th
February 2001 to Alhaji Dagash at the rate of
$6,500USD per carton. But, my boss never gave me my
15% AS agreed instead he bought a second handed
vehicle for me and I never heard about other
subsequent supplies again. 
A letter was directed to my boss while he was on 
tour and I was tempted to open it and to my amazement,
I discovered that my boss has been supplying Alhaji
and Alhaji was demanding for the supply of the 3rd
quarter of 2002(july to september) be done before 20th
September 2002.Then, I proposed to Alhaji that I will
supply atthe rate of $5,320USD and he promised not to
let my boss know about it and promised to make me his
sole supplier if I could supply at this price. 
I will give you the contact of the company in 
Europe, if you are capable of taking up this project
and sure of giving me my percentage. 
I await your response .
Thank you, 
Quadri Salam

Petroleum (Special) Trust Fund 
Contract Award Committee
National Secretariat 
Victoria-Island 
Lagos-Nigeria.


ATTENTION:  MANAGING DIRECTOR

The Petroleum Special Trust Fund was set up by the late Head of State 
General Sani Abacha who died on 8th June 1998, to manage the excess 
revenue accruing from the sale of petroleum and its allied products as a 
result of domestic increase in the prices of petroleum products.

The estimated annual revenue for 1999 was 45 billion US Dollars Ref. 
FMF A26 Unit 3B paragraph "D" of the Auditor General of the Federal 
Republic of Nigeria Report of NOV. 1999 on estimated revenue. 

I am the Chairman of the Contract Award committee  and my committee is 
solely responsible for awarding and payment of contracts on behalf of 
the Federal Government of Nigeria . 

My Committee awarded contracts to foreign contractors for the supply of 
Agricultural Machines and spare parts to the Ministry of Agriculture 
and Natural Resources. We overshot the contract sum by USD18 Million. We 
have paid the contractors and withholding the balance of 18 Million 
United States Dollars. 

Beceause of existing domestic laws forbidding civil servants from 
opening, operating and maintaining foreign accounts, we do not have the 
expertise to transfer this balance of funds to a foreign account.

However, this balance of 18 Million United States Dollars has been 
secured in form of credit/payment to a foreign contractor.Hence, we wish to 
transfer into your bank account as the beneficiary of the funds. 

We have also arrived at a conclusion that you will be compensated to 
the tune of 25% of the total sum transfered while 5% will be reserved for 
incidental expenses that both parties will incur in the course of 
actualizing this transaction and  the balance of 70% will be kept for the 
Committee members.

 If you know you are capable of helping us actualize our life's 
dream,You should send to me immediately the details of your bank particulars 
or open a new account where we can transfer the money(US$18M)which you 
will hold in trust for us until we come over there for our own share.

 As soon as you open the account, send by e-mail to me or through my 
partner  ABBAS BABA (babam02@mail.com ) immediately  with the 
details of the account viz: Name of bank, address, routing number, telex 
number, Account number, Tel and Fax number.You should also include the name 
of your company, your personal address, Tel and Fax numbers for further 
communication.

 Note that this transaction will be concluded within 10 working days 
from the day you give your consent.

Sincerely yours,

Dr.Samson Osage

SENIOR ADVOCATE OF NIGERIA (SAN)
BARR. WILLIAMS T. FALANA

Dear Sir,

I am Barrister Williams Falana a member of Nigeria Bar
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the World
Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to introduce
this business to you in confidence for the mutual benefit
of both of us.

The sum of USD48M (Forty eight Million United States) was
lodged into one of the leading private Banks here in the
Country by the late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) this
money was lodged in security vaults / boxes.The money was
originally meant to be used for his political
campaign.Because I was his family Attorney as such he
confided in me with the relevant document papers relating
to this Bank before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact, I have adequately agreed with some of
the key officers of the private Bank to negotiate with you
a trustworthy person to provide an account where this money
could be transferred to your country through your Bank
account, because we cannot claim the money here in Nigeria.

We have concluded all arrangement with an offshore Security
Company to move this money through diplomatic means to a
country where it could be directly transferred to your
nominated account to ensure absolute safety and risk-free
transfer of the money. After a successful transfer, 20%
will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general
expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your
Telephone and Fax numbers and Bank particulars where this
money will be lodged and your personal contact address.

Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above
requirement.This transaction will be concluded within 10
(ten)working days.I will be waiting for your urgent reply.

You can reach me on my private Telephone No: 234-80-
33055024 or my alternative E-mail: williamsfalana@www.com

ATTN:Dear Sir

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION

I am interested in your partnership in business dealing. This business
proposal I wish to intimate you with is of mutual benefit and it^Òs
success is entirely based on mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of
confidentiality as regard this transaction.

I am representing the board of the contract award and monitoring committe
of the Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources. I am seeking your
assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your
private/company account.

The fund came about as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and
on behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two
foreign contractors to the tune of US$180,000,000.00 (One hundred and
Eighty Million United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation,
the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of
US$149,500,000.00 (One hundred and Forty-nine Million, Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) to my benefit unknown to the contractor.
This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the
Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our
Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval.

As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by
law to operate an account outside the shores of Zambia. Hence this message
to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your
private/company account details as a beneficiary of contractual claims
alongside that of the Bulgarian contractor, to enable me transfer the
difference of US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars) into your provided account.

On actualisation, the fund will be disbursed as stated below.

1. 20% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary

2. 80% of the fund will be for Us.

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth
actualisation of the transaction within the next few working days of
commencement. For further details as to the workability of this
transaction, please reach me as soon as possible for further
clarification. Please, call me on receipt of this mail on TEL
0031-613-388-175.

Thank you and God bless as I await your urgent response.

Yours Sincerely,
Mr. Thomas Olembe.

I am Tayo Samsudin, Retired Chief Accountant of the
Kenya Central Bank. Kenya is a picturesque East
African Country widely known for its abundance of wild
game, safaris, and Tourism ; which is still a major
foreign exchange earner for the Kenyan economy.

As you are aware, the Central Bank of every Country
acts as the Bankers&#8217; bank. However, a few high
networth individuals and corporations routinely
maintained A/Cs with the Kenya Central Bank.

And so, in September 1997, a multimillionaire  Oil
Magnate, Ilic Novko from Bosnia/ Hezegovina opened a
time (fixed) deposit A/C in the Kenya Central Bank,
and I was privileged to act as his A/C
supervisor/manager. The opening balance was USD54
million. Unfortunately, the Kosovo crisis claimed his
life and that of his entire family! I spent years
tracing his next of kin but it was a deadend!

A few years before my retirement, I decided to make a
perfect plan to transfer this money out abroad. Using
a complicated system of shortfall deposits, I withdrew
this money and placed it in a holding A/C. The ONLY
problem is that by law, Kenyan indigenes are NOT
allowed to transfer out this volume of money abroad!
There are legal restrictions which will stop any
attempt by me to single handedly transfer this money
abroad&#8230;

I therefore need your help!  It is simple! There will
be no risk and no illegality involved. All I need is a
willing foreign partner who will agree to help me.
How?

I have concluded arrangements to lodge the money into
an online Bank in Kenya, and from there, the money can
be transferred to any Bank of our  choice. But as I
mentioned earlier, I am handicapped because I am a
Kenya national. If you agree to help me, then please
send me your full name so that I can
&#8220;ESTABLISH&#8221; the
ONLINE BANK A/C IN YOUR NAME&#8230;That way you will be
able
to personally transfer the money out to any hidden A/C
of our Choice, WITHOUT YOU TRAVELLING TO ANYWHERE!
ALSO, YOU WILL NOT SIGN ANY DOCUMENTS FOR ANY ASPECT
OF THE TRANSACTION!

This is how it will work.
Step 1- I will Establish/Activate  the online A/C in
your name and lodge the money now total USD55.7million
( inclusive of interests) into the Account.
Step 2  I will give you the Account Access information
which will include :-

 (a)  Customer Name

 (b)  Customer ID

  ©  Security Code

 (d) Account Number

 (e) Amount in US$

Step 3  Once you have been given the A/C access
information as per above, you will then be in a
position to wire transfer out all the money to ANY
A/Cs of our choice! AND YOU DO NOT NEED TO GIVE ME OR
ANY ONE YOUR A/C INFORMATION BEFOREHAND; ONLY YOU WILL
KNOW AND USE YOUR CONFIDENTIAL A/Cs DETAILS TO MAKE
THE WIRE TRANSFERS YOURSELF!  The best part is that
you will do this using your personal computer, in the
comfort of your home!

I hope this will be an enduring partnership, because
I will need your help to check out investment options
for me;  The money will be shared on the ratio of
50/50
If you are interested, please contact me immediately,
giving me your FULL NAMES, TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS ,
and I will get back to you.

Regards,

Tayo Samsudin

Attn:RENTFROW ,

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL

After due deliberation with my colleagues, I decided
to forward this proposal. We want a reliable person
who could assist us to transfer the sum of Eigtheen
Million Five hundred Thousand United States Dollars
(US$18,500,000.00) into his/her account. 

This fund resulted from an over-invoced bill from
contract awarded by us under the budget allocation to
my ministry and the bill was approved for payment by
the concerned ministries.The contract has been
executed, commissioned and the contractor was paid the
actual cost of the contract.

We are left with thebalance of US$18,500,000.00 as
part of the
over-invoiced amount, which we have deliberately over
estimated, for our own, I am contacting you to be our
custodan for this fund. 1,25% for you (Account
Owner)2, 70% for us, 3, 5% for Tax,as may required
by our Government and yours. As you may want to know
and to make you less curious, I got your address from
adverts, in business directory that protrayed your
establishment in good light. 

I am the Secretary of the Contract Awarding Committee
(CAC) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all
sorts of RISK and TROUBLE from my Government. We have
been exercising patience for this opportunity for so
long and to most of us this is a life time opportunity
we cannot affford to miss.

To get this fund paid into your account, we have to
present a Payment Invoice from a foreign establishment
like yours. With this invoice, we will seek approval
to transfer the fund within 14 banking days through
the APEX BANK (CBN) to your designatd Bank Account.
I and one of my colleague involved in this deal will
come to your country to arrange for our share upon the
confirmation from you that the money has been credited
into your nominated Bank Account.

Consequently upon your acceptance of my proposal,
kindly confirm your interest by email to me through
myE-mail:peteribori@weedmail.com , your indication by
mailing to me of your sincere and serious interest
will enable me fax you the procedure for operation.

It will surprise you why we choose you and trusted you
for this transaction. Yes, we believe that good 
friends can be discovered and business like this
cannot be realized without trust. This is why we have
decided to trust you for this transaction.we are
looking forward to doing this transaction with you.

Be further informed that everyone's interest and
security had been considered before you were
contacted. So be rest assured and fell free to go into
this transaction with us.But let honestly be our watch
word throughout this transaction and your prompt reply
will be highly appreciated.

Thank you.

FROM:  AHMED JEGAH
 FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION

ATTENTION: Sir/Madam,  

        REQUEST FOR A BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP  

I am Mr. Ahmed Jegah, a member of the Ministerial
Contracts Evaluation and Implementation  Committee
in the Federal Ministry of Aviation. My  position is
very sensitive. I am married with children  and hold
degrees in Public Adminstration and
BusinessStudies. I am due for retirement any moment
from now,after many years in service.

REASONS FOR CONTACTING YOU.  
 I require urgently your unreserved assistance
inproviding me with your company information, a safe
and reliable bank account with full details viz,
name and address of bank,telephone, telex and fax
numbers anywhere in the world where I can transfer
the sum of $21,500,000.00(Twenty-one Million,Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) only.The
purpose of transfer is to take care of our
retirement by investing in a viable business you
might deem fit to advise. 

NATURE OF BUSINESS AND SOURCE OF FUND FOR TRANSFER.
 

Since the inception of the present government,series
of contracts have been awarded by the Federal
Ministry  of Aviation based on supplies (Airport
Navigational  Electronics) Instrument Landing
Equipment (ILE) and  Radar Equipment-Vor System
Monitors, Distance  Measuring Equipment (DME) -
Secondary Surveillance  Radar (SSR), Installation of
One Unit of Instruction  Landing System and Radar
Equipment at Lagos and  Abuja International Airport)
and Supply of 24, (Twenty-four) Trainee Aircraft
Aviation Ministry Amounting to  several Millions of
U. S. Dollars. The sum of $21.5 Million as shown in
record as  surplus funds for this investment accrued
from the commissions we secured from some of the
over invoiced contracts carried out in the last
development quarter. Presently, I and my colleagues
have arranged for the money to be kept in a  Bank
Account with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) until
I am able to source for a reliable expatriate
partner whom I can present as the rightful
beneficiary of the fund. You will take the status of
 the contractor which executed the contract and I
will arrange the supporting documents for the
Transfer. 

 MODE OF SHARING: 
25% will go to you for making available to us
acompany or personal account number giving me
yourunreserved assistance and keeping strictly the
rules and confidentiality of this transaction until
transfer of the fund is effected. 5% is for any
contingencies and all miscellaneous expenses
incurred during the course of the ransaction,
procurement of vital documents, tips and all
expenses including phone/fax bills, hotel bills,
taxes and bank charges must be reconciled upon
confirmation of the payment by Central Bank of
Nigeria (CBN). 70% will be shared between me and
other colleagues of mine whose help will be highly
needed throughout this period. 

OTHER PERTINENT DETAILS:
Everything about this transaction is real. Themoney
is clean, after putting in so many years in
service,it is only normal for me to take good
measures to secure my period in retirement. I have
put inresources and time to bring this transaction
to thislevel which means that it represents a lot to
me,and hopefully with help from you, and in just a
matterof weeks, it shall come to mean a lot to you
too, as wemeet in your country to celebrate the
closing of thedeal.If you are interested in this
mutual benefit,please contact me through my e-mail
above or call 234-1-78900203 and also furnish me
with your phoneand e-mail lines both at your
residence and youroffice for me to contact you. 

Thanking you for your kind understanding
andco-operation.

 Yours sincerely,

 DR.FRANK DAKO 
 FEDERAL SECRETARIAT IKOYI,
 LAGOS-NIGERIA. 
 
 KIND ATTENTION,
 
 REQUEST FOR YOUR UNRESERVED ASSISTANCE.
 
 This mail may come to you as a surprise but it was
 borne out of my sincere desire to share a mutual
 business relationship with you. First, your
 strictest
 confidence in this transaction is highly solicited.
 This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly
 confidential and top secret. I am a top government
 official with a statutory corporation and member of
 an
 adhoc committee set up by the Federal Government of
 Nigeria to review contract awarded by past
 administration. In the course of identifying,
 scrutinising and recommending for the payment of all
 valid contract executed, we discovered a huge sum of
 money amounting to USD2.5M (Two  Million five
 Hundred
 Thousand US Dollars) on grossly over invoiced
 contract
 already awarded and executed for the Nigerian
 National
 Petroleum Corporation.
 
 Having cleaned the ^ÑAUGEAN STABLE^Ñ we intend to
 transfer the balance of USD2.5M presently floating
 in
 our aney bank of Nigeria to our own benefit and
 advantage. However, we request for your unwavering
 assistance in this regard because as civil servants
 we
 are prohibited under the civil service code of
 conduct
 bureau from operating a foreign account or running a
 foreign company unless after retirement in this vain
 we want you to front for us as partner to enable us
 lodge the funds speedily into your account. Bear in
 mind that no risk is attached to this project and
 all
 logistics are in place and modalities worked out for
 the smooth conclusion within a stipulated time. This
 is in accordance with the fact that you must never
 betray the trust already reposed on you.
 We have decided to compensate you with 25% of the
 total sum for your support, 70% for us while 5% for
 miscellaneous expenses (local and international).
 
 Please,provide your confidential phone and fax
 number,to enable me contact you for further
 discussion
 on this matter.
 
 Please advise on your return e-mail if any time is
 confidential enough to call .   Looking forward to
 hearing from you.

Best regards,
DR. FRANK DAKO

Subject: asssitance

Dear friend,

I am Mr. Timothy Ige. I am one of the sons of the Late Federal Minister of
Justice in Nigeria, Chief Bola Ige. If you have been following events in
Nigeria, you must agree with me that the death of my father has been
mostly politicized. Till now the murderers of my father are still not yet
known. Due to clear evidence that the Federal Government is involved in
the cold-blooded murder of my father in- dept investigation is being
hindered while various innocent people have been implicated in a bid to
cover up.

However, before his death, he had the ambition to become the President of
the Federal Republic of Nigeria through the 2003 General Election in
Nigeria. He tried this is 1999 and failed. I am his confidant among all
his sons because I share most of his views both political and legal. While
he was hoping to be the President of Nigeria by 2003, I was hoping to be
elected a Senator of the Federal Legislative Assembly.

Based on the above, and using his strong base as one of the leaders of
Afenifere, a socio-cultural organization that has a good influence in the
life and political decision of the people, he became very popular among
his people.

Because election in Nigeria is very expensive, a lot of money had to be
set aside to prosecute this political ambition.

Bearing this in mind, my father has to deposit with the NDIC, the sum of
US$7M pending the commencement of political campaigns. Out of this money,
I have the sum of US$500,000.00 as my own deposit for the same purpose.
Because my father was still a Federal Minister, the money was deposited in
my name and I have all the documents with me. However, it was not long
(2001) my father was killed by hired assassins in his own house. Because
the present federal government has understood the effect of his fame and
probably decided to kill him. Since then, I have suffered series of
arrests and detention either to cover up or kill all evidence I have to
give being the closest confidant of my father. As it is now, I have been
denied all privileges even rights by the so ^Ö called government. I have
also lost favour with my brothers because, apart from the instigation
being sponsored by the government against me, my brothers see me as NOT
INHERITOR of my father^Òs wealth because I was born out of wedlock. They
call an illegitimate child and by so tagged, I cannot inherit anything of
my father according to the tradition of my people.

As things are now, it is like, I have lost everything. My political
ambition is kept on hold. I now manage to make ends meet. However, the
only thing I can lean on now is this money which is only know by me and
which the documents are in my name and the documents are with me. Because
of some reasons, I would not want to withdraw the money myself. The
reasons bothers with security.

I have made some contacts and I was convinced that the only way I can
successfully get this money without problems from my brothers is to change
ownership of this money to a foreigner.

I am writing to you for you to help me get this money and help me
safeguard this for investments. From all my investigations and the advice
given by my lawyer, there is no risk attached to it because I have all the
documents and deposit is in my name. Your role is to supply the facilities
that will enable transfer of the money to your own account. I will give
you 25% of the money while you will help me re-invest the money in your
own country. If you can help me out, please quickly reply and let me
inform you of what to do without delay.

I am hoping to hear from you.
Mr. Timothy Ige.

Subject: BUSINESS PROPOSAL

NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORITY
50 MARINA,LAGOS. P.M.B. 20275,
LAGOS.TEL: 234-803-331-5929


FROM:DR EVANS EBEMEN


		BUSINESS PROPOSAL


I am making this contact with you on behalf of my
colleagues after an acceptable recommendation from an
International Business Agency.

My colleagues and I are members of the Contract Award
Committee (CAC) of the  National Electric Power
Authority (NEPA). I have been mandated by my
colleagues to look for a trustworthy company into
whose account some funds are to be transferred.We have
in our possession instrument of payment for US$22.5M
(Twenty two million five hundred thousand U.S Dollars
only) now in a dedicated account with our apex bank
The above funds arose from the over invoicing of some
Supplies and Engeenering Works contracts which have
been executed and the contractors paid in full. The
fund is therefore free to be transferred  overseas
without any risk whatsoever.

Due to the nature of accrual of this funds, it has to
be applied for by a foreign contractor/company and
payment can only be made into a foreign account hence
this contact is necessary to accomplish this deal.You
(or your company) shall be compensated with 25% of the
amount as the account owner, 5%  shall be used for the
reimbursement of all expenses that will be incurred by
both parties during the course of this financial
transaction.The remaining 70% is for us.

We shall require of you the following urgently by fax:
1.	Name,Telephone and/or fax Numbers of Beneficiary
2.	Name and full address of the Company
3.	Complete particulars of the bank account where you
wish the funds to be transferred.
	This should include the account Number,  Bank
Address, the Telephone, Fax and Telex numbers of the
bank.
My colleagues and I have had some fruitful discussions
with relevant top officials of the Federal
Ministry of Finance (FMF) and they have agreed to
cooperate in the
transfer. An application for funds transfer shall be
made at the appropriate Ministries in favour of the
beneficiary (you or your company).Thereafter, your
company shall be officially regarded as having
executed the contract for the National Electric Power
Authority (NEPA) for which payment is
being made.This process make the operation legal
according to the laws of the Federal Republic of
Nigeria.

Please treat this transaction as STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
as we are Civil Servants who would  not want any
exposure.Do not go through the International Telephone
Operator or (AT&T) when lines are busy at any time in
the course of this operation.Always dial direct.It s
very difficult to get telephone access to Nigeria. So
you must persist even when the telephone says
subscriber not available or the number does not
exist.These answers are always given when there is no
access.Thanks for your anticipated cooperation.
Best Regards,

DR EVANS EBEMEN
Please all contact should be directed to  my
telephone, fax number and email above.

FROM:Dr.Joseph Masala
DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS AND ENERGY
PRETORIA,
REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA

ATTN: PRESIDENT/ CEO

Dear Sir,

INVESTMENT REQUEST.

Greetings. It is indeed my pleasure to write to you this letter on
behalf of my colleagues, which I believe will be a big surprise as we
are both complete strangers, I work for the ministry of minerals and
energy in South Africa and by this letter I am representing and also
acting on behalf of my boss and
two other senior colleagues whose mandate I have got to contact a
trusted and reliable foreign based businessman, concerning a business
matter of mutual benefit to all.

Within the Department of Minerals and Energy where I work as a
Director of Audit and Project
Implementation, with the co-operation of three other top officials,
we have in our possession an overdue payment in US funds. The said
funds represent certain percentage of the Contract value executed on
behalf of my Department by  a foreign contracting firm, which we the
officials over-invoiced to the amount of
US$20,000,000,00 (Twenty Million United
States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost have been paid to
the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.

Since the present elected Government is determined to lay foreign
Contractor all debts owed, so as to maintain good relations with
foreign Government and non-governmental agencies, we include our
bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and the
Reserve Bank of South (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance to front
as the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed
to operate foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary
information  upon application for claim to reflect payment and
approvals will be secured on behalf of you /your company.

My colleague and I are prepared to go into an
agreement with you and also offer you a negotiable fee for the
assistance, and putting together an investment portfolio for us in
your country .

This business is completely safe and secure, provided you threat it
with utmost confidentiality. It does not matter whether or not you
own a company or you invested funds before, we shall guide you on
what to do.

The bases will be that a major company won a contract from my
ministry and subcontracted it to you. More often, big  trading
companies and firms of unrelated fields win contracts and
subcontracts to more specialized firm for execution.

We shall follow strictly all the legal procedure entailed in our laws
and international law in transferring the fund to make it legitimate
and authoritative. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that
you will not disappoint us.

Kindly notify me via my confidential Telephone +27724-815-448 /Fax
numbers:+27 724-815 449

for further details upon your acceptance of this proposal.Thank you
and God Bless, as I wait for your urgent response.

Best regards.

Dr.Joseph Masala

Attention: 

Dear Sir,
    "Quest to Invest in Real Estate Properties/Imports"

I am Dr.Vencent Chimerenma former special adviser on Petroleum matters 
to the late Head of State of Government of Nigeria Gen. Sani Abacha. 

Because of my strategic position in the former Government and also being 
a close confidant of the late Head of State, I was able to acquire 
personally the sum of $14,500,000.00 USD (Fourteen Million Five Hundred 
United States Dollars only) presently lodged in a Security Deposit in 
Europe. I made this money largely through "CONSULTANCY FEE" and Good Faith 
Fees" paid by foreign Oil companies prior to Allocation of Deep Water 
Oil Blocs and other Lifting/prospecting Right. Nigeria is the 6th 
largest Producer/Exporter of Crude Oil in the World.

As you are probably aware of the fact that Nigeria is prone to Military 
coups and the resultant Political/Economic Instability has fueled hyper 
Inflation, amongst other problems. I have therefore resolved to invest 
my money abroad, preferable in Real Estate Properties and Importation 
of Goods from your country for safety and optimum returns on Investment.

However the, present civilian administration of president Olusegun 
Obasanjo has placed a restriction of movement on every member of the 
cabinet of the past military government. This is as a result of the Justice 
Oputa panel of inquiry slated to investigate most of the atrocities 
perpetrated by the late former head of state. This means that I cannot 
travel out now till the panel conclude its investigations which only god 
knows when that would be.

Straight transfer of this money into a bank abroad will present two 
major problems one, the tax incidence will be too high, as much as 60% of 
this money will go up in Taxes, Levies, Penalties etc. as a result of 
Government deliberate restrictions on flight of capital Abroad.

However arrangement have been put in place for you to receive this 
money from a trust worthy security Deposit Company in Europe. As soon as 
you indicate your interest.  I will send to you the security 
Code number, certificate of deposit number and airway bill number of 
the Deposit that will serve as the onus of proof to enable you claim the 
Money, which is tagged, Diplomatic Luggage.

All I now need is an honest partner who can receive the money on my 
behalf and help me to invest as aforementioned.

There is absolutely no risk involved in this transaction, as the money 
will be delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills.

If you are interested in assisting me, please send to me by email 
immediately your preferred contact address where you can be reached at any 
time, upon receipt of the money, you are to lodge this money in a bank 
account and contact me for necessary arrangements for the investment of 
the funds. For your help and assistance in this deal, you will be 
entitled to 25% of this money in cash or Equity if you wish to join the 
proposed company.

Finally you are to please urgently send to me through email or fax the 
required contact address that include your telephone and fax number).

So that I can instruct the West side Deposit Company to go ahead with 
the transfer to you. 

Please contact me immediately so that I can give you further briefing.
Best regards

Dr.Vincent Chimerenma.

FROM: MEKA BAKASU TE PEMAKO

DEAR FRIEND,

MY GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE THIS LETTER 
MEETS YOU IN GOOD HEALTH. I AM MEKA BAKASU TE PEMAKO, AIDE 
TO THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE NOW KNOWN 
AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC). I AM WRITING TO YOU 
IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON YOUR PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SOUTH AFRICA.

I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN CONFIDENCE 
CONSIDERING MY PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION AS A 
REFUGEE HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA. FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE LATE 
PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER, I WAS 
INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF 
US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND LODGED 
IN MY NAME WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING 
DISCLOSED AS FAMILY VALUABLES, PENDING FURTHER 
INSTRUCTIONS. TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16 1997, PRESIDENT 
MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE REBELS LED BY 
LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM KISINGANI AND FLED 
TO TOGO FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED 
ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1997 LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS 
FORCED OUT OF POWER. HE WAS AGED 66 YEARS. I MANAGED TO 
ESCAPE TO SOUTH AFRICA WITH MY SON PATRICE, AGED 17 WHERE 
I AM PRESENTLY RESIDING AS A REFUGEE SHORTLY AFTER THE 
CAPITAL CITY KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER BY REBELS. I LOST 
MY WIFE AND TWO OF MY CHILDREN, AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS 
DURING THE REBEL ONSLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY.

THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE AMASSED 
A PERSONAL FORTUNE OF US$8BILLION WITH HOUSES IN 
SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT 
LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT 
AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL HIS ASSETS AND 
CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES. I THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN 
AFRICA TO STUDY THE SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET 
BETTER LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND 
HIS SON JOSEPH KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER. 

I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY ABROAD 
WHERE THE MONEY IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES. THE 
FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING THE 
CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO INDICATE YOUR 
INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY RECEIVING THE MONEY ON 
MY BEHALF. ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU 
THE MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE FUNDS. MAY I AT THIS 
POINT EMPHASIZE THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH 
THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE 
TRUST AND CONFIDENCE WHCH I HAVE REPOSED IN YOU. 

IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST, I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE OF 
THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEIGN 
MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING 
REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. I AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU A 
REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY AS SOON AS THE 
TRANSACTION IS CONCLUDED.

FOR THIS REASON, KINDLY FURNISH ME YOUR CONTACT 
INFORMATION, WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX 
NUMBERS FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT 
OF THIS MAIL USING THE EMAIL ADDRESS

Dear Sir,

We run an oil consultancy company that has existing
current joint venture with Nigeria National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC) for the sole purpose of
recommending to her reputable crude oil Dealers of
International repute. We were instrumental to short
listing the 16 companies lifting presently. A copy is
enclosed here for you.

One of the officials of NNPC has contracted us that
they are about short-listing another 16 International
crude Oil Marketers Globally this year 2002. 

We therefore contacted our God father-a retired
general who has instructed us to put forward two
companies for recommendations to NNPC.

Total quantity of crude oil to be lifted is 43,632,100
(forty three million, six hundred & thirty two
thousand, one hundred barrels of Bonny light crude
stream.

NNPC, has announced it as an obligation that the sum
of USD250m must sit in the foreign account of such
company before she qualifies for short listing, and
the retired General has agree to put in 100 % of the
contractual obligation regarding qualification for the
companies he has asked us to recommend. 

He will like to meet the chairmen of the two companies
before the commencement of the short listing, for a
proper agreement/understanding of their participation
/his investments.

 Please be informed that there are no more financial
obligations on your side except expenses for your trip
and minor legal and agency fees usually charged by our
company for recommending you.. (not more than USD5000)
from there the General takes over all financial
obligations. 

The envisaged proceeds or profit from the sale of any
allocated quantity out of the quantity earmarked for
lifting must run into millions of dollars. We want to
be part of the success story. 

The USD500m set aside by the retired General for
investment in this transaction is available in cash,
not bankable, which is his reasons for asking and
trusting us to contact the involvement of two foreign
firms, who will be used as a cover up to meet the
investment obligations of NNPC. If this proposal meets
your interest, you will be required as a matter of
urgency to meet the General to iron out all terms of
the transaction and for proper agreement before the
USD250m is transmitted to your account. 

The meeting with the General is scheduled for this
month. We shall connect you to the General for a brief
discussion on phone before your arrival as soon as you
indicate your interest.

Please note that prior knowledge of crude oil
marketing strategies is not very necessary, as we will
guide you in all directions with our vast knowledge in
the business  

We await your urgent reply.

Thanks
Yours faithfully,
 Dr T.Y. WILLIAMS.

  (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}
 ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS   
 
Dear sir,
 
We want to transfer to overseas account
($ 126,000.000.00 USD) one hundred and twenty six
million United States Dollars) from a Prime Bank in
Africa, I want to ask you to  quietly  look for a
reliable and honest person who will be capable  and
fit to provide either an existing bank account  or  to
set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this
money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this
money, as long as you will remain honest to me till
the end for this important business trusting in  you
and believing  in God that you  will never let me down
either now or in future.
 
I am UME UGO,the Auditor General of one of the prime
banks here South Africa, during the course of our
auditing,I discovered a floating fund  in an account
opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has
operated on this account again, after going through
some old files in the records I discovered that the
owner of the account died without a [heir]  hence  the
money is floating and  if I do not remit this money
out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The
owner of this account is  Mr.  Allan P.Seaman, a
foreigner, and an industrialist, and  he died,  since
1993. and  no other person knows about this account or
any thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that Allan P. Seaman   until his death was the manager
 Diamond Safari  [pty]. SA.  
 
We will start the  first transfer with twenty six
million [$26,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest
amount to your account. 

The amount involved is (USD 126 M) one hundred and
twenty six million United States Dollars only. I want
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty six million
United States Dollar] from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I
don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you
as a foreigner because this money can not be approved
to a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any

next step to take urgently. Send also your private
telephone and fax number including the full details of
the account to be used for the deposit.
 
I want us to meet face to face to build confidence
and to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any
account of  your choice where the fund will be safe.
Before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing
and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work
fine, Because the management is ready to approve
this payment to any foreigner who has correct
information of this account, which I will give to you,
upon your positive response and once I am convinced
that you are  capable  and will meet up with
instruction of  a key bank official who is deeply
involved with me in this business. I need your strong
assurance that you will never,  never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will  destroy all documents of transaction immediately

and to build confidence  you can  come immediately to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us

this money to your account with appropriate clearance
from  the relevant  ministries and foreign exchange
departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while
5% will be for expenses both parties might have
incurred during the process of transferring.

FROM THE DESK OF ARAM.CHARLY
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
BANQUE INTERNATIONALE DU ABIDJAN
ABIDJAN, COTE D,IVOIRE
00225 07 95 19 36


Dear sir,

With due respect and humility, I write to you this
proposal.I am the manager of bill and exchange at the
foreign remittance department of Banque Internationale
du Abidjan. I am writing following the impressive
information about you, l got your contact from
lvoirian chamber of commerce and lndustry.l assured of
your capability and reliability to champion this
businees opportunity.

In my department, we discovered an abandoned sum of
U.S$11.5M US dollars (Eleven Million Five Hundred US
dollars).In an account that belongs to one of our
foreign customer who died in the WORLD TRADE CENTRE
along with his entire family on 11 September 2001 in
New York..

Since we got information about his death, we have been
expecting his next of kin to come forward and claim
his money because we cannot release it unless somebody
applies for it as next of kin or relation to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and
policies but unfortunately we learnt that all his
supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with
him at Urgly attack at the World Trade Centre leaving
nobody behind for the claims. It is therefore upon
this discovery that I have decided to make this
businness proposal to you to transact this DEAL with
you and to act as the next of kin or relation to the
deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since
nobody is coming forth and l don^Òt want this money to
go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.

According to our Banking policies and guideline here
which stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed
after five years,the money will automatically be
transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.
My request for a foreigner to act as next of kin in
this business is by the fact that the customer was a
foreigner and a citizen of this country cannot stand
or put claims as next of kin to a foreigner.

l agreed to offer 15% of the total fund to you, for
your assistance, to act as the next of Kin to the
foreigner,to provide account, 5% will be for
reimbursement of any expenses incured during the curse
of the transaction. There after, I and my family will
visit your country for disbursement and for investment
in your country. Therefore to enable the immediate
transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must
apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of
the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank
account number, your private telephone and fax number
for easier and effective communication and location
where the money will be transfer.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax
or email the text of the application. I will not fail
to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch
free and that you should not entertain any atom of
fear as all required arrangements have been made for
the transfer. You should contact me immediately as
soon as you receive this letter.

hope to hear from you immediately

  (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000,000.00 USD}
 ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas account
($ 126,000,000.00 USD) one hundred and twenty six
million United States Dollars) from a Prime Bank in
Africa, I want to ask you to  quietly  look for a
reliable and honest person who will be capable  and
fit to provide either an existing bank account  or  to
set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this
money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive this
money, as long as you will remain honest to me till
the end of this important business trusting in  you
and believing  in God that you  will never let me down
either now or in future.

I am Mr.CESAR DAVID,the Auditor General of one of the
prime banks here South Africa, during the course of
our auditing,I discovered a floating fund  in an
account opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993
nobody has operated on this account again, after going
through some old files in the records I discovered
that the owner of the account died without a [heir]
hence  the money is floating and  if I do not remit
this money out urgently it will be forfeited for
nothing. The owner of this account is  Mr.  Allan
P.Seaman, a foreigner, and an industrialist, and  he
died,  since 1993. and  no other person knows about
this account or any thing concerning it, the account
has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved
to me as well that Allan P. Seaman   until his death
was the manager Of Diamond Safari  [pty]. SA.

We will  start the  first phase of the transfer with
twenty six
million [$26,000,000 USD] upon successful transaction
without any disappointment from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  Balance
amount to your account.

The amount involved is (USD 126 M ) One hundred and
Twenty six million United States Dollars only. I want
to first transfer $26,000,000.00 [Twenty six million
United States Dollar] from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I
don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you
as a foreigner because this money can not be approved
to a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or
drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money is
in US dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr.
Allan P. Seaman is a foreigner too,and the money can
only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind
us together. I got your contact address  from the

investment and more over,most of my fathers properties and account have
been frozen by the present government of Laurent Kabila.

united state dollars set aside for this project,

I decided to contact you to help me in setting up a business, but would
not want my name or family name to be used.

I am prepared to give you 35% of the total sum if you can assist me in
claiming this fund from a bank security volt where my father (Mobutu Sese
Seko) deposited this fund before he died.

Please, do contact me immediately for us to discuss. As soon as I hear
from you, and confirm your assistance every informations regarding to the
claiming of this fund will be revealed to you to enable fronmt as the
family's foreign partner for the collection of the funds.

DR.Mike Okon PhD (UNN), MNIM, FCA
Financial Controller & Contract Award Committee Chairman (NEPA)

Dear Sir,

REQUEST FOR URGENT/CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.

I am ,DR.Mike Okon the FinancialController and Contract Award Committee
Chairman inthe National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) in Lagos,Nigeria.  
My colleagues have assigned me to seek forassistance of a reliable
foreigner through whom we cantransfer the sum of US$38,600,000.00
(Thirty-EightMillion, Six Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) whicharose from
the deliberate over-inflated contract valuefor the General expansion of
the Kanji Dam TerminalStation on behalf of National Electric Power
Authority(NEPA) for increased energy generation to Nigeria and some other
West African countries.

The contract wasawarded in 1998 during the General Sani Abacha regimeto an
expatriate firm with the consideration of 10%commission agreement on the
total contract value ofUS$386,000,000.  The contract has been completed
andthe contractor has long been paid, we are now left with this
US$38,600,000 representing the 10% our ownshare as agreed presently in the
Federal Government account.  The Current favourable political/economic
climate in this country now presented an opportunity for this money to be
transferred out of the country.

A friend who was formally residing in your country gave me your contact
address.  He told me that you are trustworthy though he did not know my
intention.  This assurance gave me courage to link you up for
thisparticular transaction, and I hope it will be of mutual benefit to all
of us.

Our contact in the Federal Ministry of Finance have given us a go ahead
advice to begin the process of the remittance, hence we have set in motion
the machinery for the take off of this transaction and further action will
commence immediately we hear from you.  We have agreed that after the
transfer of the money into your account, you shall be entitled to 30% of
the total amount transferred, while the remaining 70% will be for us.  We
decided to give you this percentage in order to motivate you and also to
let you feel satisfied at the end of this transaction.

The nature of your business is not particularly relevant for the success
of this transaction.  All we require is your willingness to co-operate
andassurance that our own share will be given to us whenthis money is
transferred into your account.  All necessary precautions have been taken
to ensure a no risk situation on the sides of both parties and it is
believed that the conclusion of this transaction will not last more than 8
working days, However, we are going to retrieve the whole documents that
will relateto this transaction and destroy them after the transfer of the
money into your account to avoid any trace of the money. Since we have no
knowledge of business, our plan is to invest this money into Real Estate,
Stocks and we can also invest in some other profitable business in your
country based on your advice because many of our yearshas been spent as
civil servant, and we may likely resign from government service to private
business after this money is transferred into your account.

Please note that this business is strictly confidential and must not be
disclosed to a third party.  This is necessary to avoid disclosure that
may jeopardize the transaction.  Finally, if this proposal is acceptable
to you, or if you have any questions, feel free to contact me immediately
and send to me your private e-mail address, telephone number and fax
number for easy and confidential communication.  I will oblige you with
further information if so required.

Best Regards,

DR.Mike Okon

you to the project approached me through my dear Wife who works with the
Federal Ministry of Finance and requested me to assist them conclude a
money transfer deal they had with you, they requested me to assist them
by removing the original contractors name, company's name and bank
particulars from Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) vetting computer and
replacing them with your name and your bank details in order to make you
appear as the rightful beneficiary of this funds. I agreed on condition
that they will pay me $100,000 as soon as your name appears as the
beneficiary. I did as agreed and demanded to be paid but your friends
started telling me stories. They even told me that you promise to send
money to me. Do you know that up till now, I have not received a single
cent from them and have not set my eyes on any of them. 

Based on their attitude, I decided to stop the funds release movement
because I cannot be denied of my right in my own office considering the
risk as it might affect my job. Secondly, I know the source of the funds
and you did not execute any contract in Nigeria, although I am the only
person privileged to know this information and it is a fact. Why I am
making this clear to you is that I can see that you are still making
efforts spending money in order to conclude this project. Now I am ready
to forget the past, I do not need the $100,000 any longer from you but a
share of 25% of the total sum. I need your assurance that those your
colleagues will be totally keep out of this transaction, I know that
none of them is aware of this transaction after trying their best to
conclude it without my consent.  

Finally, I need your promise that no official of the Central Bank of
Nigeria will be aware of my involvement in this regard. Now re-assure me
that you will be willing to offer me the 25% of the fund, that you will
assist my wife and personal assistant to establish a foreign account in
your country where my share will be lodged. 
 
If you are ready to conclude this business with me, you can contact me
immediately on Private Mobile Tel. No. 234-80-33074819 or email:
drtomdavid@37.com so that we can have chat over this issue once and for
all so that we can move forward. But if the reverse is the case, do not
bother yourself to reach me.  

Regards,  
DR. TOM DAVID
DIRECTOR (K.T.T UNIT) C.B.N.

Subject: ASSISTANCE

Dear Sir,
I am DR. MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigeria
Head of State, General Sanni Abacha who died on the
8th of June 1998 while still on active duty. I am
contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of
great assistance to each other likeness developing a
cordial relationship.
I currently have the sum of Twenty four Million US
Dollars (US$24,000,000.00) cash in a vault of a
certain security company which l intend to use for
investment, like Real Estate Development specifically
in your country. This money came as a payback for the
Failed Debt buy back contract deal between my late
husband and some foreigners. I must inform you that
the foreigners tried what they felt was good for the
deal they had with my Late Husband and at the end of
the present government says it was scam on our
countries multi-billion debt to IMF, world bank and
Paris Clubs.

The Partners returned my husband's share of
USD$24,000,000.00 after the death of my husband and
lodged in my husband's security company of which l am
director until now, the new Civilian Government have
intensified their probe on my husband's finances and
business empire. In view of these, l acted fast to
withdraw the US$24,000,000.00 from the company's vault
and deposited it in Eurolite Services BV, Amsterdam The
Netherland.
No record ever existed concerning the money traceable
by the government because there is no documentation
showing that we received the money from the foreign
partners who did the business with abacha and the fund
was paid cash, so it has no traces from the bank.
Due to the current situation in the country concerning
government attitude towards my family, it has become
quite impossible for me to make use of this money
within. Let me refer you to the front page of this day
newspapers of 10th March 2001. You can log on to this
various websites and get more details about my family,
funds being recovered and how we are being subjected
to different treatments to the name of searching for
looted funds of my late husband.
(Www.thisdayonline.com/archives/2001,http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/story/0,3604,563533,00.html
and Newsweek international magazine of March 13-15th
2000) The present government in Nigeria had frozen and
seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and
abroad. Thus on your consent to proceed in the
business l shall expect you to contact me urgently to
enable us discuss in detail about this transaction.
Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to
transfer this fund, l proposed a Percentage of 20% of
the total sum to you for the expected service and
assistance, 10% for offsetting expenses incurred in
the course of this transaction.
Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop
further contacts. All correspondence must be by the
email address above. l will give you my tel/fax
numbers where you can contact me when l hear from you.
l must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise
the utmost indulgence to keep this matter
extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision
while await your prompt response.

NB: Because of the security being mounted on the
members of my family, l have decided
That this transaction be kept in utmost secrecy,
remember to include your private Tel/fax or mobile
number for easy communication.

Best Regards.

DR.MRS. MARIAM ABACHA.

Subject: proposition

Dear Sir

I am the manager of bills and exchange at the foreign remittance
department of the ECOBANK Nigeria. I am writing this letter to ask for
your support and co- operation to carry out this business opportunity Via
my department. We discovered an unclaimed sum of US$ 25.5
million(Twenty-five million five hundred thousand United States Dollar
only) in an account that belongs to one of our customers who died a long
with his entire family in November 1997 in Auto crash in Nigeria.

Since we got information about his death we have been expecting his next
of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release the
money unless somebody applied for it as the next of kin or relation to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.

Rightaway,neither the family member nor the relation has appeared to claim
this money, at this discovery another official and I in the department now
decide to do business with you as the next of kin or relation of the
deceased for safety and sequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it
and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasure as an unclaimed
debt.

The banking law and guidelines of the ECOBANK Nigeria stipulates that if
such money remained unclaimed for a period of four (5) years it will be
transferred into the ECOBANK treasury as unclaimed fund. The need for a
foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that
the customer was a foreigner and cannot stand as his next of kin or heir.

We agreed that 25% of the money will be for you as the foreign partner,
thereafter my colleague and I will visit your country for disbursement
according to the percentage indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate
transfer of the fund to you as indicated.You must apply to the bank as
relation or next of kin of the deceased, indicating your bank account
number and ocation where in the money will be remitted. Upon receipt of
response, I will send to you by fax the Application Form. As soon as you
receive this letter you should contact me immediately and indicate your
direct and confidential telephone and fax number for effective
communication. Trusting to hear from you immediately.


Yours faithfully,
obaro joseph

Subject: URGENT REPLY

FROM THE DESK OF DR.ISA IBRAHIM.

Dear Sir,

This is important, and requires your immediate attention! First, I must
solicit your strictest confidence in the transaction.

To intimate you further, we are top officials of the new civilian
administration Committee on Foreign and Local Contract Payment, who are
interested in the importation of goods into our country with funds which
are presently trapped in Nigeria. In order to actualize this dream, we
seek your assistance to transfer the said-trapped fund into an interest
bearing account which you have absolute control over in your country or a
third country other than Nigeria.

The new civilian administration of General Olusegun Obasanjo (rtd) set-up
this committee specifically to review all contracts/oil licenses to
determine their propriety and relevance in the light of the country's
current economic and political realities. We have identified a lot of
inflated contract fund which are currently floating in our Apex Bank. At
this moment we have worked out modalities within ourselves and some
acquaintances at the Apex Bank to divert the sum of US$33,700,000.00
(Thirty three million, seven hundred thousand United States Dollars) only,
for our personal use.

However, by virtue of our positions as Civil Servants and members of the
Contract Review Panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names,
consequently, I was delegated by my colleagues as a matter of trust to
look for an overseas partner into whose account we can transfer this sum
of money, hence this letter to you.

Furthermore, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total sum of
US$33,700,000.00 (Thirty three million, seven hundred thousand United
States Dollars) into your account for disbursement. Your areas of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this
transaction and the account required for this project can either be
PERSONAL, COMPANY or an OFFSHORE account you have total control over.
Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous. In
return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of this sum while 10% shall be set
aside for incidental expenses between the parties in the course of this
transaction. You must however note that this transaction is subject to the
following terms and conditions: -

(a) Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence

(b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and
confidentiality.

(c) That the funds would be transferred to an account where you have
absolute control over.

(d) That one of our representatives will be with you in your country to
represent our interest. This however depends on your response to
conditions A and C above.

Modalities have been worked out to the highest level for the immediate
transfer of the funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction
of the above stated terms.

Our assurance is that your role is RISK FREE. To accord this ransaction
the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the funds, the whole
approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with your
name or the name of any company you may nominates as the bonafide
beneficiary.

Once more, I want you to understand that having put over 23 years in the
civil service of my country, I am averse to having my image and career
dented.

This matter should be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency.

Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us include this
transfer in this batch as payments to foreign contractors is usually
carried out on quarterly basis.

regards

DR.ISA IBRAHIM.

          (URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL)
 
  (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}
 ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS   
 
Dear sir,
 
We want to transfer to overseas
account($126,000.000.00 USD) One hundred and twenty
six million nited States Dollars) from a Prime Bank in
Africa, I want to ask you to  quietly  look for a
reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit
to provide either an existing bank account or to set
up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money,
even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as
long as you will remain honest to me till the end for
this important business trusting in you and believing 
in God that you  will never let me down either now or
in future.
 
I am GOMEZ CHIMALU,the Auditor General of one of the
prime banks here South Africa, during the course of
our
auditing,I discovered a floating fund  in an account
opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has
operated on this account again, after going through
some old files in the records I discovered that the
owner of the account died without a [heir]  hence  the
money is floating and  if I do not remit this money
out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The
owner of this account is Mr. Gordon G. Scott, a
foreigner, and an industrialist, and  he died,  since
1993. and  no other person knows about this account or
any thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that Gordon G. Scott until his death was the manager
Diamond Safari [pty]. SA.  
 
We will start the  first transfer with twenty six
million [$26,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest
amount to your account. 

The amount involved is (USD 126 M) One hundred and
twenty six million United States Dollars only. I want
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty six million
United States Dollar] from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I
don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you
as a foreigner because this money can not be approved
to a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or
drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money is
in US dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr.
Gordon G. Scott is a foreigner too,and the money can
only be approved into a foreign a/c. 
 
However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind
us together. I got your contact address  from the
Girl who operates my computer, I am revealing this to
you with believe in God that you will never let me
down in this business,you are the first and the only
person that I am contacting for this business, so
please reply urgently so that I will inform you the
next step to take urgently. Send also your private
telephone and fax number including the full details of
the account to be used for the deposit.
 
I want us to meet face to face to build confidence
and to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together before transferring the money to any
account of your choice where the fund will be safe.
Before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing
and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work
fine, Because the management is ready to approve
this payment to any foreigner who has correct
information of this account, which I will give to you,
upon your positive response and once I am convinced
that you are capable and will meet up with
instruction of a key bank official who is deeply
involved with me in this business. I need your strong
assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us
will fly to your country at least two days ahead of
the money going into the  account. I will apply for
annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you
that you are ready to act and receive this fund in
your
account. I will use my position and influence to
obtain all legal approvals for  onward transfer of
this money to your account with appropriate clearance
from  the relevant  ministries and foreign exchange
departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while
5% will be for expenses both parties might have
incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my
email address or tele/fax numbers.

Dear ...,

I am Barrister Moses Ike, a legal Solicitor and  I
was the Personal Attorney and legal adviser to
Mr.EDWARD TREY, a national of your country, who
used to work with Mobil oil Company Nigeria Plc.

On the 21st of April 1999, my client, his wife and
their three children were involved in a car accident
along Sagamu Express Road. All occupants of the
vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. Since then I
have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate
any of my clients extended relatives, this has also
proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful
attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the
Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no
avail, hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to
assist in repatriating the money and property left
behind by my client before they get confiscated or
declared unserviceable by the BANK where these huge
deposits were lodged.

Particularly, the BANK where the deceased had a
deposit valued at about Ten Million United States
Dollars ($U.S10,000,000) has issued me a notice to
provide the next of kin or have the account
confiscated within the next ten official working days.
since I have been unsuccessful in locating the
relatives for over two years now, I seek your consent
to present you as the next of kin of the deceased
since you are from the same country so that the
proceeds of this account valued at Ten Million United
States Dollars ($U.S10,000,000) can be paid to you and
then you and me can share the money. 55% to me and 40%
to you, while 5% should be for expenses or tax as your
government may require, I have all necessary legal
documents that can be used to back up any claim we may
make.

All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us
see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be
executed under a legitimate arrangement that will
protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in
touch with me by my email to enable us discuss
further.

Best regards,

Moses Ike.

Subject: Please reply urgently


Attn: Managing Director/President 
 

Compliments of the season, 
 
You have been recommended by an associate from our Chambers of commerce
& Industry/foreign trade council who assured me in confidence of your
ability to execute a transaction of such magnitude involving a pending
business transaction, requiring maximum confidence, trust and
discretion. 
 
We are very much interested in your kind of business and willing to
invest in your country under your able  guidance. As we are interested
in Real Estates business,General supplies and importation of foreign
goods into our country with some funds, but in order to commence this
investments we solicit  for your assistance to enable us transfer into
your nominated bank account some funds pending our arrival in your
country for our investments bid. 
 
We are top officials of the Niger-Delta Development Commission Contract
Award & Review Panel, a Committee that was recently set up by the
present elected Government to review all Contracts that was awarded
under the past  dictatorial military Governments in our country starting
from 1990 in the troubled Petroleum and Mineral producing areas of the
Niger-Delta region in our country.
 
During our last review exercise, we discovered huge sums of money
amounting to Several Millions of United States Dollars reflecting as
debt owed to several foreign contractors, but the names, addresses and
receiving bank accounts of these contractors were not reflected in the
computer database, hence this made it impossible for us to recommend to
the Federal Ministry of Finance to effect payment of the funds since the
details of the beneficiaries were not encoded in the computer payment
vouchers and up till now no company has forwarded application for claims
of the funds. 
 
After a careful investigation as to the source of this floating funds in
our Apex bank, we discovered that during the past military regimes, most
of the ruling army Generals in Government at that time, set up private
Companies and awarded themselves contracts which were grossly
over-inflated in the various ministries and that these funds in question
were as a result of deals from over-invoiced contracts already awarded
and executed and the original contractors has been fully paid their
exact contractual amount to it full value, leaving the over- invoiced
amounts floating in our Apex bank unclaimed. 
 
I was therefore delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of the
panel to look for a trusted and reliable foreign partner into whose
account we would transfer the sum of US$26.4 Million (Twenty Six
Million, Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only).
 
Based on these, my colleagues and I decided to solicit for your
assistance in providing a foreign bank account where these US$26.4
Million, would be transferred into and then recommend to the Federal
Ministry of Finance and the Apex bank  to release the funds immediately
to you as the foreign beneficiary we have recommended, provided your
company is ready to assist and safeguard the money for us. 
 
The idea of transferring this money into a foreign account is not far
fetched because we have to take care of our retirements and going by the
Civil Service Law of Code & Conduct we are not allowed to own or operate
a foreign account while still in service.
 
Furthermore, after the successful transfer of the fund into an account
that you will nominate for this transaction, myself and two of my
colleagues will proceed to meet with you in your country to receive our
own share of the money. 
 
We also wish to invest our share of the funds into any other profitable
business venture in your country and willing to accept from you any
useful and viable investment proposal advice in your country.
 
Please bear in mind that all arrangements for the successful transfer of
these funds have been perfected to avoid any legal implications in the
course of the transfer of the funds as we are leaving no stone unturned
in making sure that we secure all the neccesary legal documents and
approvals from the concerned ministries to back up your claims through
the proper channels. 
 
Be assured that this transaction is absolutely risk free. Hence we
require your total support and assurance that we will not betray the
trust reposed on you by sitting on the funds when it finally gets into
your account within the next few days. 
 
Upon the receipt of your response via my direct e-mail address or by fax
as shown above indicating your interest to do this business with us, we
shall immediately contact the Federal Ministry of Finance  and the Apex
bank for speedy approvals of the payment for onward release into your
nominated bank account, which will not exceed 5-10 working days
depending on your co-operation.
 
Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed in this regards, we
propose a commission of 25% of the Total sum for nominating an account
for this purpose and any other assistance you will give in that regard,
while 10% has been slated to offset all local and international expenses
which may be incurred in the course of transfer.
 
Note: Your line of business does not matter only that you must keep this
transaction close to your heart at all times.
 
I prefer all communication in English.
 
Endeavour to include in your response your Private Telephone, Direct Fax
numbers and E-mail address for effective communication. 
 
We look forward to your favourable response by my Private  E-MAIL or FAX
as shown above so that I can furnish you with more details. 
 
Remain Blessed,

Subject: LETTER OF ASSISTANCE
Date: Sat, 10 Aug 2002 15:28:39 -0700 (PDT)
From: khalil gabr ezekhalil_gabr@yahoo.com
To: ...

I AM  MR.KHALIL IBRAHIM GABR, THE  MANAGER, MISR
EXTERIOR BANK,ZAMALEK BRANCH,CAIRO EGYPT. FOR REASONS
WHICH WILL COME TO LIGHT AS  YOU READ ON, I OBTAINED
YOUR ADDRESS PARTICULARLY FROM EGYPTIANS CHAMBER
OF COMMERCE  LISTING.
PLEASE EXERCISE SOME PATIENCE AND READ THROUGH MY
MESSAGE.

I HAVE A VERY URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS
TO PROPOSE TO YOU.  ON JUNE 6TH 1998, AN OIl
CONSULTANT/CONTRACTOR WITH THE  EGYPTIANS OIL
MINISTRY, MR. AHMED YOUSEFF MUSTAPHA, AN IRAQI
NATIONAL,MADE A NUMBERED TIME FIXED DEPOSIT FOR TWELVE
CALENDAR MONTHS,VALUE US$18MILLION DEPOSIT IN MY
BRANCH.


ON MATURITY, WE SENT  A ROUTINE NOTIFICATION TO HIS
FORWARDING
ADDRESS BUTGOT NO REPLY.AFTER A MONTH, WE SENT A
REMINDER AND FINALLY, HIS EMPLOYERS,WROTE TO INFORM US
THAT MR. MUSTAPHA DIED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT. THAT
HE DIED WITHOUT MAKING A WILL WHILE ATTEMPT TO TRACE
HIS NEXT OF KIN THROUGH THE IRAQI EMBASSY  PROVED
FRUITLESS.
AT FIRST, I WAS SURPRISED THAT I DID NOT RECEIVE  MUCH
OFFICIAL CO-OPERATION IN MY ENQUIRIES IN ORDER TO
TRACE HIS KIN IN IRAQ AND INFORM THEM ABOUT MR.
MUSTAPHA'S DEPOSIT  OF US$18 MIILLION PLUS ACCRUED
INTEREST.

FURTHER INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT MR. MUSTAPHA WAS
ACTIVELY OPPOSED TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT SADDAM
HUSSEIN OF IRAQ AS A RESULT, HE WAS DRIVEN INTO EXILE.
BEING AN OIL EXPERT,MR.MUSTAPHA SUBSEQUENTLY OBTAINED
A JOB IN EGYPT HERE, AND SETTLED  IN EGYPT.
THEREAFTER HE WALKED INTO MY OFFICE TO MAKE THE
AFFORMENTIONED DEPOSIT OF US$18 MILLION. HE DID NOT
DECLARE HIS KIN IN HIS APPLICATION PAPER WORK.  WHEN I
ASKED HIM, HE INFORMED ME THAT  HEWISHED IT SO. IN THE
CONSERVATIVE MANNER OF OUR BANK. (MY EMPLOYER), I DID
NOT TURN DOWN HIS WISH BUT RATHER HONOURED IT
ESPECIALLY GIVEN  HIS HIGH NET WORTH.

IN REALITY, NO ONE KNOWS THE SOURCE OF HIS MONEY SINCE
APPARENTLY, THE TIME FRAME OF HIS EMPLOYMENT HERE DOES
INDEED PRECLUDE SUCH  A  LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY.IT IS
THEREFORE PRESUMED THAT  HE BROUGHT IN HIS MONEY FROM
IRAQ ALTHOUGH THIS IS OPEN TO SPECULATION. THE POINT
HOWEVER IS THAT THE EMPLOYERS ARE NOT AWARE OF HIS
MONEY, THEREFORE ONE CAN SAFELY INFER THAT NO ONE WILL
EVER COME TO  THIS MONEY. THIS FUND,TOTALLING
US$18.9M(INCLUSIVE OF ACCRUED INTEREST) IS STILL
SITTING IN MY BANKS DORMANT ACCOUNT  PORTFOLIO.
ACCORDING TO EGYPTIANS BANKING LAWS AND ACT OF1993,THE
MONEY WILL AUTOMATICALLY REVERT  TO THE EGYPTIANS
GOVERNMENT TREASURY AFTER  FIVE YEARS, ESPECIALL IF
THE ACCOUNT OWNER IS A FOREIGNER  WHO HAS BEEN
CERTIFIED DEAD AND  THERE IS NO VALID CLAIM, THIS
INDEED, IS THE SITUATION.

I AM THUS LOOKING FOR A FOREIGNER WHO WILL STAND-IN AS
THE NEXT OF KIN TO MR. MUSTAPHA.IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO
BE A BLOOD RELATION TO MR.MUSTAPHA,NEITHER IS  IT
NECESSARY TO BEAR THE SAME SURNAME WITH HIM.
IT IS EVEN NOT IMPORTANT FOR THE STAND-IN NEXT OF  KIN
TO BE AN IRAQ NATIONAL.

ALREADY, I HAVE WORKED OUT MODALITIES FOR ACHIEVING MY
AIM OF APPOINTING A NEXT OF KIN AS WELL AS TRANSFER
THE  MONEY ABROAD FOR US TO SHARE. IT IS MY
INTENTIONTO ACHIEVE THIS TRANSFER IN A LEGITIMATE WAY
BY SIMPLY  USING AND ATTORNEY(REPRESENTING  YOU AS
BENEFICIARY) TO EXECUTE A SERIES OF AFFIDAVITS IN
SUPPORT OF YOUR CLAIM THIS WILL BE APPROVED.THE MONEY
TRANSFER PAPER WORK ITSELF WILL INCLUDE A CERTIFICATE
OF ORIGIN SO THAT THE RECEIVING BANK  DOES NOT ASK
QUESTION OR WORSE STILL REFUSE THE FUND ACCEPTANCE ON
GROUND OF LAUNDERING.

ALSO, THE PAPER WORK WILL INCLUDE PROPER CERTIFICATION
THAT THE FUND BEING TRANSFERRED IS FROM NON-CRIMINAL
SOURCES.IN SHORT THIS WILL BE A PROPER AND LEGAL MONEY
TRANSFER  WITH APPARENTLY NO RISK INVOLVED! THE
ATTORNEY WILL HAVE TO PROCESS THE INITIAL PAPER WORK
TO OBTAIN APPROVAL FROM THE PROBATE  REGISTRY OF THE
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE FOR THE LETTER OF ADMINISTRATION
EMPOWERING YOU AS THE SOLE TRUSTEE/EXECUTOR TO THE
ESTATE OF  MR. MUSTAPHA.

IF YOU THEREFORE AGREE TO BE THE OFFICIAL
BENEFICIARY,THEN PLEASE NOTE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE
REQUIRED TO SIGN ANY MONEY TRANSFER DOCUMENTS, AS THE
APPOINTED ATTORNEY WILL DO ALL THAT. ALSO, YOU WILL
NOT BE REQUIRED TO VISIT EGYPT BUT WOULD SIMPLY BE
REQUIRED  TO FURNISH THE ATTORNEY AT THE RIGHT TIME
WITH THE FOLLOWING:

1. A BANK ACCOUNT (AN ACCOUNT WITH ZERO CREDIT
BALANCEIS OKAY)
2. THE COMPLETE NAME AND ADDRESS OF THE BANK
3. THE RELEVANT ACCOUNT NUMBER OF THE ACCOUNT IN
(1)ABOVE
I WILL ALSO NEED THE ABOVE INFORMATION ONCE I HAVE THE
REQUIRED INFORMATION AS ABOVE, I WILL INITIATE THE
PROCESSING OF THE TRANSFER, AND IN ABOUT EIGHT
(8)WORKING DAYS, THE FUND WILL BE IN YOUR NOMINATED
BANK ACCOUNT FOR US  TO SHARE IN THE RATIO OF: 70%FOR
ME  25%  FOR YOU WHILE 5% WILL BE TAKEN CARE OF ANY
EXPENSES.
THE TRANSACTION  IS GUARANTEED TO SUCCEED WITHOUT ANY
PROBLEMS.
IF YOU SEND ME THE INFORMATION REQUESTED ABOVE, I
SHALL PROVIDE YOU WITH MY DETAILED ADDRESS PLUS ANY
FURTHER CLARIFICATION THAT YOU MAY NEED.
I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR URGENT REPLY.

DEPARTMENT OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES 
PLOT 225 KOFO ABAYOMI STREET VICTORIA ISLAND,LAGOS, NIGERIA.
DIRECT FAX: 234 1 759 0904. TEL; 234 1- 7591519
ATTENTION: THE PRESIDENT/C.E.O
RE: URGENT & CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL
Dear Sir,

I amCHIEF. BAGUDU WILLIAMS (MON)member committee of the above department

Terms of Reference

My term of reference involves the award of contracts to multinational
companies.

My office is saddled with the responsibility of contract award, screening,
categorization and prioritization of projects embarked upon by Department
of Petroleum Resources (DPR) as well as feasibility studies for selected
projects and supervising the project consultants involved. A breakdown of
the fiscal expenditure by this office as at the end of last fiscal quarter
of 2000 indicates that DPR paid out a whooping sum of US$736M(Seven
Hundred And Thirty Six Million, United States Dollars) to successful
contract beneficiaries. The DPR is now compiling beneficiaries to be paid
for the third Quarter of 2002.

The crux of this letter is that the finance/contract department of the DPR
deliberately over ^Öinvoiced the contract value of the various contracts
awarded. In the course of disbursements, this department has been able to
accumulate the sum of US$38.2M(Thirty-eight Million, two hundred Thousand
U.S Dollars) as the over-invoiced sum. This money is currently in a
suspense account of the DPR account with the Debt Reconciliation Committee
(DRC). We now seek to process the transfer of this fund officially as
contract payment to you as a foreign contractor, who will be fronting for
us as the beneficiary of the fund. In this way we can facilitate these
funds into your nominated account for possible investment abroad. We are
not allowed as a matter of government policy to operate any foreign
account to transfer this fund into.

However, for your involvement in assisting us with this transfer into your
nominated account we have evolved a sharing formula as follows:

(1) 20% for you as the foreign partner
(2) 75% for I and my colleagues

(3) 5% will be set aside to defray all incidental expenses both Locally
and Internationally during the course of this transaction.

We shall be relying on your advice as regard investment of our share in
any business in your country. Be informed that this business is genuine
and 100% safe considering the high-power government officials involved.
Send your private fax/telephone numbers. Upon your response we shall
provide you with further information on the procedures. Feel free to send
response by Fax: 234-1-7590904 / TEL: 234-1-7591519 expecting your
response urgently. All enquiries should be directed to the undersigned by
FAX OR PHONE.

Looking forward to a good business relationship with you.
Sincerely,
CHIEF. BAGUDU WILLIAMS (MON)

Subject: Help, Save My Family Fortune

From: Almendo

This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the
fact that we have not yet met. The message could be
strange but real if you pay some attention to it. I
could have notified you about it at least for the
sake of your integrity. Please accept my sincere
apologies. In bringing this message of goodwill to
you, I have to say that I have no intentions of
causing you any pains.

I am Mr. A. Savimbi, son of the late rebel leader
Jonas Savimbi of Angola who was killed on the 22nd of
February 2002 . I managed to get your contact details
through the internet myself Time is of the importance
and I was desperately looking for a person to assist
me in this confidential business.

My late father, Jonas Savimbi was able to deposit a
large sum of money in different security firms in
Armstadam The Netherlands. My father is death and
the movement of his family members (including me)
is restricted. We are forbidden to either travel
broad or out of our localities. Presently our
movement are monitored. Right now there is a rush
for all my Father's wealth but home and Abroad by
the Government who are claiming that most of the
wealth was got by Arms smuggling and therefore
illegal and by my father,s extended family and
relations.

You can know more about my father by checking his
profile at URL below: www.kwacha.com/edoc2.htm

His wealth has been estimated to be $500 million
to over $1 billion and being close to my father
I happen to be in possession of documents
and information of some of the wealth.Approx.
$250 million and only my trusted mother knows
that I have this information.

Presently, the US$100,000,000.00 (One Hundred
Million Dollars) cash and precious materials
my father moved to Europe before his death is
deposited with some security firm . Before you
can get access to it I have to give you the
some hits.

I am therefore soliciting your help to travel to
Netherlands to recieve this money and keep it
in a safe place or  into an account before my
government get wind of this fund .You know my
father was a rebel leader in Angola before his
death.My reason for doing this is because it
will be difficult for the Angolan government
to trace my father's money to an individual's
account, especially when such an individual has
no relationship,I decided to keep that money for
my family use. At present the money is kept
with a Security Companies in Armstadam

I am currently and temporarily living in Angola
and as refugee status,I intend to communication
with you as regards this transaction on a
satellite phone to avoid intervention by anybody.

Moreover, the political climate in Angola at the
moment being so sensitive and unstable.With this
password and information and I will send you a
power of attorney to the security firm, When you
are ready I will give you the information needed
before you can get access to 7,000kg of AU gold dust,
8500kg of pure Diamond and raw cash of USD100 million
America dollars. you will then proceed to Armstadam,
The Netherlands for collection.

PLEASE YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS TRANSACTION IS
HIGHLY REQUIRED.


Yours sincerely,
Almendo S. Savimbi

Subject: URGENT

BARR. AHMED M. IDRIS.
EMAIL:ahmedmidris222@mail.com

I am a Barrister and a member of Nigeria Bar Association (NBA).  I decided
to contact you believing that by the grace of God that you will accept to
be my partner in this business.

I got your contacts through my personal research and out of my
desperation, decided to reach you through this medium.

Hence, I made up my mind to introduce this business to you in confidence
for the mutual benefit of both of us.  The sum of US$48M (Forty Eight
Million United States Dollars) was lodged into one of the leading private
banks here in the country by the late Head of State (Gen. Sani Abacha).  
This money was lodged in a DEFACED FORM and in vaults / boxes.  The money
was originally meant to be used for his political campaign.  Because, I
was his family Attorney as such he confided in me with the relevant
document papers relating to this Bank before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact, I have adequately agreed with the family members to
negotiate with a trustworthy person to provide an account where this money
could be transferred to your country through your Bank account, because we
cannot claim the money here in Nigeria.  We have concluded all arrangement
with an Offshore Security Company to move this money through diplomatic
means to a country where it could be directly transferred to your
nominated account to ensure absolute safety and risk-free transfer of the
money.

After a successful transfer, 30% will be for you for your assistance and
70% for us.

You are required to send by email immediately your Telephone and fax
numbers and where this money will be logged and your personal contact
address.  Once you notify me your willingness by sending the above
requirement.  This transaction will be concluded within ten (10) working
days.

Immediately you reply and indicate your interest, I shall furnish you with
the details and how to go forward. I will be waiting for your urgent reply
through email: ahmedmidris222@mail.com You can check this out at:  
http://www.marcosbillions.com/marcos/Settlement%20Abacha%20return%20of%20monies.htm.

Please honesty is the watchword in this transaction.  And the transaction
is 100% risk free.  Also it demands absolute confidentiality.  On no
condition must you disclose this glorious project to anybody irrespective

Dear Friend,							 
With due respect, trust and humility, I write you this
proposal which I believe would be of great interest to
you. I am MRS. BLESSING KANTE, the wife of late MR.JOSEPH
KANTE of blessed memory.

Before my husband was killed by forces loyal to Major
John Paul Koromah, he was the Director-general of Gold
and Diamond Mining Corporation (G.D.M.C) of Sierra
Leone. My husband was one of the main classes of
people targeted by the rebel force in the course of
the revolution.
Two days before his death, he managed to sneak a
written message to us, explaining his condition and
concerning one trunk box of valuables containing money
which he deposited with a private Security and
Finance Company in South Africa. He instructed me to
take our two sons and move out of Sierra Leone
immediately to South Africa before the Peace Keeping
Force of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOMOG) monitoring team intervened to arrest the
situation of mass killings by the rebels, which was
the order of the day. Eventually it resulted into full
war. I became a widow overnight, helpless situation
without a partner. At that moment of calamity, every
person was running for his/her life.

In the content of the deed he signed with the Security
Company, he used the name of his Son Mr. CLEMENT KANTE
as the next of kin. The real content of the box were
not disclosed to the Security Company due to Security
reasons. Now as refugees in South Africa,we have no
financial rights here. we intend to leave this Country
immediately with the whole money for investment in
your Country because of the stable political situation
and mostly for the future benefits of my children. We
have since applied for political asylum. The cash
involved inside the box is US$18 million.

I want you to assist us to claim this box from the
Security Company and get the money deposited in a
local account in South Africa in your name and
thereafter you order the bank to transfer the money
into a private account in your Country. You shall also
source for good investment so that we can invest the
money wisely. We have in mind to establish a rewarding
investment and good relationship with you.

Concerning the money, we are prepared to give you a
reasonable percentage of 10% of the total sum
proceeds. Meanwhile 2% has been mapped out for any
expenses incurred in the course of this transaction
and 88% will be for my family. For the interest of
this business, do not hesitate to contact my son MR
CLEMENT KANTE, on the Tel: 27-73-227-9556.
immediately you receive this massage for more
information to enable us proceed in earnest towards
concluding all our arrangement. 

No other person knows about this money apart from my
two Sons and I. We wait for your most urgent response.


Thanks for your co-operation and God bless you.

Best regards

MRS.BLESSING KANTE.

CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL 
dear sir
You may be suprise to receive this letter from me since you dont know 
me personally. The purpose of my introduction is that I am JAJA 
YERIMA, the first son of DAVID YERIMA , the most popular farmer 
in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in 
mycountry. 
I got your contact through network online hence decide to write you. 
Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to 
deposit the sum of US$7,000,000.00(seven million united states of 
America dollars)in one security company as he forsaw the coming 
danger zimbabwe. 
This money was deposited in a box as gemstones in to avoid much 
demurage from the security company.This amount was meart for the 
purchase of new machines and chemicals for the new farm and 
establishment in Swiztland. 
This land problems came when Zimbawean president ROBERT 
MUGABE introduced a new land act reform who holly affected the 
rich white farmers and some few black farmers. And this resulted to the 
killing and mob action by Zimbabwe war returns and some lunatics in 
the society. 
It is against this background that I and my family fled Zimbabwe for 
fear of our lives and currently staying in The Netherlands where we 
seek political asylum and mooreso have decided to transfer my father' 
money to more reliable foreign account sinces the law of The 
netherland prohibits a refugee to open any bank account or to be 
involveed in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of 
Netherland . 
As the eldest son of my father , I am saddled to which the respobility of 
seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be 
transfered without the the knowledge of my government who are bert 
on taking everything we have got.The South Africa government seems 
to be playing along with them. I am faced with the delima of moving this 
amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same 
experience in future, both countries have similar political history. I am 
seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and family in his 
hand, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. 
If you accept to assist me and my family , all I want you to do for me , 
is to arrange with the security company to clear the consignment (funds) 
from their afiliate office here in the Netherlands as I have already given 
directives for the consignment to be brought to The Netherlands from 
South Africa. But before then all modalities will have to be put in place 
e.g change of ownership to the consignment and this money intend I 
intend to use for investment . 
I have two options for you , firstly you can choose to have certain 
percentage of the money or you can go into partnership with me for the 
proper profitable investment of the money in your country . Which ever 
the option you want , feel free to notify me. I have aslo mapped out 5% 
of the money for all kinds of expense incured in the process of this 
transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 
15% of the money while the remaining 80% will be for my investment in 
your country. 
Contact me with the above email address while i imlore you to maintain 
the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. and your phone and 
fax number will be need for the transaction. 
Thanks God bless you 
JAJA YERIMA .

ATTN:MUBETEE WAZIRI

DEAR FRIEND,

MY GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE THIS LETTER
MEETS YOU IN GOOD HEALTH. I AM MUBETEE WAZIRI, AIDE TO THE
LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU
SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF
CONGO (DRC). I AM WRITING TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON
YOUR PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN
SOUTH AFRICA. I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN
CONFIDENCE CONSIDERING MY PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND
SITUATION AS A WAR REFUGEE HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA. FEW WEEKS
BEFORE THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT
OF POWER, I WAS INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO
MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE
TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND LODGED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR
SAFEKEEPING DISCLOSED AS FAMILY
VALUABLES IN MY NAME PENDING FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO
WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16 1997, PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE
UP POWER TO THE REBELS LED BY LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE
ADVANCING FROM KISINGANI AND FLED TO TOGO
FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED ON
SEPTEMBER 7, 1997 LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED
OUT OF POWER. HE WAS AGED 66 YEARS.

I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO SOUTH AFRICA WITH MY SON PATRICE,
AGED 17 WHERE I AM PRESENTLY RESIDING AS A WAR REFUGEE
SHORTLY AFTER THE CAPITAL CITY KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER
BY REBELS. I LOST MY WIFE AND MY TWO
CHILDREN, AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS DURING THE REBEL ON
SLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY. THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO
DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE AMASSED A PERSONAL FORTUNE OF US$8
BILLION WITH HOUSES IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE
INCUMBENT PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE
ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN
COUNTRIES TO FREEZE
ALL HIS ASSETS AND CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES. I THUS
DECIDED TO LIE LOW
IN SOUTH AFRICA TO STUDY THE SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS
GET BETTER
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON
JOSEPH KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER.

I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY ABROAD WHERE
THE MONEY IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES. THE FUNDS
ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING THE
CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY RECEIVING
THE MONEY ON MY BEHALF. ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE SO THAT I
CAN GIVE YOU THE MODALITIES
FOR THE CLAIM OF THE FUNDS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE
THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH THIS BUSINESS
DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT
BETRAY THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE WHCH I HAVE REPOSED IN YOU.
IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST, I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE OF
THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU
WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEING MAINTAINED AND ALSO
DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR
SERVICES.
I AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF THE
MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTION IS CONCLUDED. FOR THIS
REASON, KINDLY FURNISH ME YOUR
CONTACT INFORMATION, WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND
FAX NUMBERS FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE
RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE
ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS.

YOURS SINCERELY,
MUBETEE WAZIRI

N/B.PLEASE, ENDEAVOUR TO RESPOND THROUGH MY CONFIDENTAIL

immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c
can serve to receive this money, as long as you will
remain honest to me till the end for this important
business trusting in  you and believing  in God that
you  will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr.John Biko, the Auditor General of a bank in
Africa, during the course of our auditing  I  
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files
in the records I discovered that the owner of the
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. the owner
of this account is  Mr.Magnus leon, a foreigner, and
a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993. and  no other
person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that Magnus
Leon until his death was the manager  Magnus
Coy.(pty). SA.  

We will start the  first transfer with fifty two
million [$52,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account.

The amount involved is (USD 152M) One hundred and
Fifty two million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $52,000.000 [fifty two million
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us
Dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr.
Magnus Leon is a foreigner too, [and the money can
only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement,  to bind us
together   I got your contact address  from the Girl
who operates computer,  I am revealing this to you
with believe in God that you will never let me down in
this business,  you are the first and the only person
that I am contacting for this business, so please
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you 
are  capable  and will meet up with instruction of  a
key bank official who is deeply involved with me in
this business.
I need your strong assurance that you will never,
never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's

ATTEN: Dear sir, I salute you in the name of the most high God. I am Mrs
Mariam Abacha, the widow of the late military head of state General Sani
Abach, former Nigeria head of state who died mysteriousely as a result of
cadiac arrest.

Since the death of my husband, my family has been under restriction of
movement and that not withstanding, we have been molested and constantly
under watch by the seemingly Agent. Above all, our bank account here and
abroad have been frozen by the Nigerian Gorvernment. Furthermore, my
eldest son is presently in detention for more interrogation about my
husband assets and some vital documents.

Following the recent discovery of my husband bank account and that of my
sons which the sum of US$700.000.000 (seven hundred million)us dollars and
450m duch mark was lodged and has been seized by the Nigerian Government,
I therefore wish to appeal to you personally for an urgent assistance to
secure the sum of US$62.8M into your bank account overseas. This money is
the only money in our possesion and has not been treased due to the fact ,
immediately my husband died, I quickly instructed my lawyer to move this
money to a country through a diplomatic baggage.

Presently, this money is in a security vault in Europe as the FAMILY
TREASURE. So you are to contact my lawyer as a matter of urgency and liase
with him after which he will give you the security deposit certificate and
a power of attorney to enable you claim the consignment.

Conclusively,we have agreed to offer you 25% of the total sum while 75% is
to be held on trust by you untill we decide on a suitable business
investment overseas subsequent to our free movement by the Nigerian
Government.

Please reply urgently and treat with absolute confidentiality and
sincerity.

God bless you and your family.

Best regards
HAJIA M. ABACHA

Midakabe Johnson,
Netherlands

 
                       SOLICITING FORASSISTANCE.
 
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know
me personally.The purpose of my introduction is that I am MIDAKABE
JOHNSON,the first son of ADUGBAM DAVID MIDAKABE,the most popular black
farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my
country.I got your contact through network online hence decided to write
you.Before the death of my father,he had taken me to Johannesburg to
deposit the sum of US8.5 million (Eight million,Five Hundred thousand
United States dollars),in one of the private security company,as he
foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box
as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company.This amount
was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and
establishment of new farms in Swaziland.

This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert Mugabe
introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers
and some few black farmers,and this resulted to the killing and mob action
by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society.In fact a lot
of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father
was one of the victims.
 
It is against this background that,I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear
of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we are
seeking political asylum and moreso have decided to transfer my father's
money to a more reliable foreign account.since the law of Netherlands
prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be
involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of
Netherlands,As the eldest son of my father,I am saddled with the
responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could
be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on
taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be
playing along with them.I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount
of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience
in future,both countries have similar political history.As a businessman,I
am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my futu re and that of my
family in his hands,I must let you know that this transaction is risk
free.If you accept to assist me and my family all I want you to do for
me,is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the
consignment(funds) from their afiliate office here in the Netherlands as i
have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the
Netherlands from South Africa.But before then all modalities will have to
be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more
importantly this money I intend to use for investment.

I have two options for you.Firstly you can choose to have certain
percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction.
Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable
investment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want,feel
free to notify me.I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of
expenses incurred in the process of this transaction.If you do not prefer
a partnership I am willing to give you 10% of the money while the
remaining 85% will be for my investment in your country.Contact me with
this E-mail address (midabe@lycos.com)or through this box,while I implore
you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction.
 
Thanks,GOD BLESS YOU
 
Yours Faithfully,

MR MIDAKABE JOHNSON.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT.

I am Mr, Joseph Edward a native of Cape Town in
South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with
the
South Africa  DEPARTMENT OF MINERAL RESOURCES AND ENERGY 
First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to
reach you for a transaction/business of this
magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this
medium. 

I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal
described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties
and
hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the
nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources
where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the
cooperation of four other top officials, we have in
our possession as overdue payment bills totaling
Twenty - One Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S.
Dollars ($21,500,000.) which we want to transfer
abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a
foreign company/individual to receive the said fund
on
our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account
to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in
the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service
Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore
account hence your importance in the whole
transaction.
This amount $21.5m represents the balance of the
total
contract value executed on behalf of my Department by
a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual
contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor,
leaving the balance in the Tune of the said amount
which we have in principles gotten approval to remit
by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any
foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an
application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of
the former contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in
the
transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the
$21.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and
miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100%
safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this transaction. I have reposed my
confidence in you and hope that you will not
disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately my
e-mail address  whether or not you are
interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout
for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want
to assure you that my partners and myself are in a
position to make the payment of this claim possible
provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secured and please
remember to treat this matter as very confidential
matter, because we will not comprehend with any form
of exposure as we are still in active Government
Service and remember once again that time is of the
essence in this business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,


JOSEPH EDWARD

Subject: Goodday


Attn: contact ,

My name is Mr. Ocita  G the manager, credit
and foreign bills of Ecobank Plc. I am writing in
respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account
number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash
[Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers
aboard on August 6, 1997.
Since the demise of this our customer, I personally
has watched with keen interest to see the next of kin
but all has proved abortive as no one has come to
claim his funds of usd.20.5 m, [twenty million five
hundred thousand united states dollars] which has been
with my branch for a very long time. 
On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name
shall be used as the next of kin as no one has come up
to be the next of kin. And the banking ethics here
does not allow such money to stay more than five
years, because money will be recalled to the bank
treasury as unclaimed after this period. In view of
this I got your contact through a trade journal after
realizing that your name and country is similar to the deceased. I will
give you 25% of the total. Upon the receipt of your response, I will
send you by fax or e-mail the application, bank's fax number and the
next step to take. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this
business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all
modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days,
after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased. When you
receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying 
Your decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers
for quick communication. 
Respectfully submitted,
Ocita G.

MR.OBINNA  JOHN
WEMA BANK PLC. 
LAGOS/NIGERIA 
Email: obinnajohn@usa.com
Dear Sir, 

REQUEST FOR CO-OPERATION ON A PRIVATE BUSINESS
RELATIONSHIP 

Every four years, Nigeria Banks transfer to it s
treasury Millions of Dollars of unclaimed Deceased
Depositors Funds, in compliance with the Banking Laws
and Guidelines. In the majority of cases, with
reference to my Bank   WEMA BANK PLC. The money
normally runs into several millions of dollars. Until
Dr.David Fang  death along with his wife, Doris, their
two children, Micheal and Ann in a private jet plane
crash. I was his foreign currency denoted Bank Account
Manager with constant balance in excess of eight
digits. Ever since his death and up till this time of
writing, no next of kin or relation of his has come
forward to claim his money with us. 

Naturally, as long as late Dr.David Fang money remains unclaimed, the
bank remains richer in free funds with his money. However, with my being
in direct charge of Bills and Exchange in the foreign Remittance
Department of my bank, I am in position to cause the payment of this
money to whosoever that present himself as the next of kin or relation
of the late Dr.David Fang' on private business deal basis. 

Now the game plan and the purpose of writing to you
exclusively having been highly recommended as the
right and proper person to handle this deal by a
Management Consultant friend of mine, who has traveled
widely, including your country is that I want to pull
out this unclaimed money amounting to $14,900,000:00
(Fourteen Million, Nine Hundred United States Dollars)
with your co-operation and assistance by just doing
the following: 
- 

(a) Act as next of kin or relation of late Dr.David
Fang 

(b) Provide your bank account and location where you
want the money remitted .
(c) Provide your direct and private Telephone/Fax
numbers for effective communication 
(d) Give immediate reply to this proposal using the
above Tel/Fax 
number for details on how to proceed. 

For your co-operation and efforts, 40% of the money
will be for you as my foreign partner,10% for
settlement of all expenses that might be incurred on
the course of this transaction, while 50% will be for
myself that will eventually visit your country for
disbursement of the fund. 

Looking forward to a mutual and beneficial business relationship. 

Regards,

MR.OBINNA  JOHN

Dear Sir,

First,I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction. This
is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential.I am the
Secretary of the Cont-ract Review Panel instituted by His Excelency
President Olusegun Obasanjo to probe/review all Contracts executed and
payments made during the regime of late General Sani Abacha. I have been
mandated by my colleagues on the Panel to seek your assistance in the
transfer of the sum ofUS$32.4Million into your Bank Account.

As you may know, the late General Abacha and members
of his government embezzled billions of dollar
sthrough spurious contracts and payments to foreigners
between 1993 - 1998 and this is now the subject of
probe by my Panel. In the course of our review, wehave discovered this
sum of $32.4Million, which the former dictator could not transfer from
the dedicatedaccount of the Central Bank of Nigeria before his sudden
death in June 1998. It is this amount that my Colleagues and I have
decided to acquire for ourselves through your assistance.

This assistance becomes crucial because we cannot
acquire the funds in our names and as government
officials we are not allowed to own or operate foreign
bank accounts. We have thus developed a fullproof,
legal and totally risk free scheme through which the
fund can be transferred to your nominated bank account
within a very short time. The scheme is to use our
position and influence on the Panel to present you as
a foreign Contractor beneficiary of the funds. We
shall arrange all documentation to support this claim
and get Approval for the transfer of the funds for
your benefit on our behalf. The scheme is perfected to
be 100% risk free and weare sure the funds can arrive
your Account within 7 -10 working days from when you
agree to assist us. 

You should acknowledge the receipt of my mail through
the above e-mail address so we can further discuss the modalities of
your cooperation and negotiate the charge for the usage of your Account.
You definitely have a lot to benefit from this transaction as we have
decided to give you 20% of the total sum as soon as you secure it in
your account,and we have also set aside 5% of the total sum for all
expenses incurred in the course of this transaction.Please, endeavor to
give me a private telephone/faxnumber through which we can communicate
with you inconfidence (in your
response) as the need for secrecy is great to this
transaction.

We expect your urgent response.

Yours faithfully,

Dr.Salisu John.

The Royal Palace of Ogoni Kingdom,
Oil Community Barri-Ogoni
River State ,
Nigeria.

Dear sir,

I am Princess Judith Akpaka, daughter of Chief Chris
Akpaka, the king of Ogoni Kingdom.  I am 25 years old
and a graduate of Mass Communication.

My father was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest
oil producing area in Nigeria.  He was in charge of
recieving royalties from the multi-national oil
companies and government on behalf of the oil
producing communities in Nigeria.  After the hanging of the
Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wiwa by the late
dictator General Sani Abacha, my father suffered
stroke and died December 27th last year.  But before
his death, he called me and told me he has Twenty
Three Million Five Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars
(USD23,560,000.00) cash in his possession, specially
deposited in a Security vault company here.

He advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who
is the last wife of the (8) eight wives that he
married.  My mother did not bear any male child for
him.  Which implies that all my father^Òs properties,
companies e.t.c., we have no share in them because my
mother has no male child according to African
Tradition.  My father therefore secretly gave me all
the relevant documents of the said money, and told me
that I should use this money with my mother and my
younger sisters because he knows that tradtionally, if
he dies we cannnot get anything, as inheritance.

He importantly advised me that I should seek foreign
assistannce and that I should not invest this money
here in Nigeria because of his other wives and male
children who happen to be my elders.  I am soliciting
for your immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for
us, where I will live with my mother and two younger
sisters and further advise me where and how I will
invest the balance money overseas, possibly on any
profitable ventures.

I believe that by the special grace of God, you will
help us move this money out of Nigeria to any country
of your choice where we can invest this money
judiciously with you.  You are entitled to a
reasonable part of this money based on our agreement,
I am aslso assuring you that this transaction is risk
free and God will bless you as you help us.
PLease reply through my e-mail Looking forward to hear
from you as soon as possible.

Remain blessed.

Princess Judith Akpaka.

Subject: [LT] THANKS

Dear sir/Madam

,


Greetings to you and your family. Although this
proposal might come to you as a surprise  since it is
coming from someone you do not know or ever seen
before, but after due deliberation with my children, I
decided to forward this business
proposal to you. We want a reliable person who could
assist us to transfer the sum  of   Ten  Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars. (US$10.5m)
Million into his/her account.

I am Mrs. Maltida Konare, widow of late Dr. Hassan
Konare, former Zairean Defense Adviser to late
President Mobutu Sese-Seko, the immediate past ruler
of my country Zaire (which has been renamed the Congo
Democratic Republic)here in Central Africa. My husband
was ambushed and killed by the Rebel Militia
Revolutionary Front on his way to collect proceeds
from sales of Diamond from the Diamond Mining Site in
Zaire that was directly under his supervision I am
looking for a trustworthy and reliable foreign partner
to help my family move out the sum of US$
10,500,000.00
( Ten Million Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars)for investment.

This fund is the total sum of money
diverted by my late husband for his benefit in the
course of carrying out his official duties a Defense
Adviser. The money is contained in 1(ONE) trunk box
and
was deposited in a Security Company, for safekeeping
as Artefacts. My late husband was directly in
charge of negotiation, payments and final purchase of
Ammunitions to fight the Rebel Militia Revolutionary
Front and made payments to the Ammunition suppliers in
cash.  Following recent developments and the
installation of President Laurent Kabila as the new
President of my country; my husband's bank account was
freezed as well as the seizure of his properties.
Because of the harsh impact of the new government's
action, my children and I decided to move to
lagos,Nigeria in west Africa for a political Asylum.


Right now I am quite ill and need urgent medical
attention because of a recurrent Fibroid growth, which
has persisted due to lack of adequate funds for proper
medical treatment.

It is based on our decision to move this money out for
investment that I am contacting you on my family's
behalf to kindly assist us in taking this money to
your country.

We are willing to compensate you with
30% of the total sum for your kind assistance and also
willing to allow you invest about 50% of our share for
us but that will be after you must have convinced us
of the best sort of investment to go into.  I want to
let you know that the future of my family depends
solely on this money and the success of this business
will depend on utmost confidentiality and the ability
to understand and keep this business secret.

Iwould want you to note that this business is 100%
risk free on your part and so there is nothing to fear
at all. However, I would want to urge and beg you to
please keep this business secret and not expose us
because our survival in Nigeria is by the special
grace of the ALMIGTY GOD and moreover, my family
cannot bear anymore pain or total loss of what
belongs to us. We will forever remain grateful and
indebted to you and sincerely hope to pay back your
kindness someday.

Best Regards.

Mrs. Maltida Konare

Dear Friend,

Firstly, I have to introduce myself to you. My name is Dr.Brown Dumbushe,
I am from Zimbabwe and I was the formal chairman of the internal contract
review panel in Zimbabwe.

Before the escalation in my country I recovered $5M U.S dollars from over
inflated contract sum by our Government officials. And I have not reported
this to my government, before the problem stated. So I seized the
opportunity to secure the funds for myself. Which I secretly, lodged in a
security company in Europe. I want you to help me in claiming this funds,
because at the moment I cannot leave my country. And I will furnish you
with all necessary information's regarding the funds. I have decided to
give you 10% of the total amount, which is $500,000(Five hundred thousand
dollars) if you are willing to assist me, As long as you assure me I will
get my money/share when you have been able to collect it from the security
company.

in retrieving the funds in Europe.

Subject: URGENT ASSISTANCE NEEDED

Dear sir,

I am Hon.Bello Osagie the manager union bank Nigeria plc.I bumped into
your mail when I was looking for a reliable partner or firm that would
help me in transacting or receiving a huge some of amount left under my
care for future investment. On febuary 20th 2000 two years ago, Mr Brain
Domo a South African citizen business man formerly based in Nigeria before
his death deposited a total sum of 70 million dollars [SEVENTY MILLION
DOLARS ]with us and since then we have not seen or heard from him.

All enquiries made to locate him provided no single lead .However the
recent developmemthas proved he was among those who died in the october
2000 plane crash that occured in kano Nigeria with the fourteen passengers
on board dieing in the process. We have waited for so long a time for a
possible claim of his deposit with us by either of his relatives or his
next of kin , but that never happened.

Hence after much investigation and waiting under the perceived beleive
that there would never be any claim after all,two of my colleagues and i
have decided on our own to look for a reliable partner that can logged
this money in his account pending our arrival in your country.

My two colleague and i have agreed together to send this money out of our
country for security reasons. All modalities concerning this transaction
have been settled without risk involved .Upon this sir we only require
your Bank account, fax and telephone numbers for the commencement of this
transaction which should come along with your company's letter headed
paper. note that 30% is for you for showing interst of partnership and
providing account for the transfer while 60% is for me and two of my
colleague while the remaining 10% kept aside to cover both local and
international expenses in cured in the course of transaction .

Futhermore, this transaction shall last for only 14 banking working days
from the day you indicate your interest for the fund to hit your account.
we shall be using our own share for investment in your country. please
treat this steps with utmost secrecy while we await to hearing from you.

LAGOS, NIGERIA.


ATTN: THE PRESIDENT.

Sir/Madam

Compliments of the season!

I am Abba Abacha, the second surviving son of the late General Sanni
Abacha, Nigeria's former Military Head of State who died on the 8th
of June, 1998 of Cardiac Arrest. Since the death of my Father both
the immediate, past and incumbent Government of my Country, Nigeria,
have been persecuting my family. The present Government of Chief
Olusegun Obasanjo have turned the klieglight of investigations into
the actvities of my family.

The Government have directed all the Banks in my
Country to freeze the accounts belonging to my family and our
numerous Business concerns of my Mother and Uncles have also been
closed down and my immediate elder brother has been arrested by the
Nigerian Government, while all our foreign Bank Accounts have been
freezed aided by a publication in the FINANCIAL TIMES OF LONDON OF
FRIDAY 23RD JULY, 1999, though my Father is not the only past Official
accused of having money in foreign Banks.

I am therefore using this medium to solicit for your assistance. Your
Business profile and name were given to me in confidence by the Nigerian
Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Foreign Trade Division). The
information regarding the viability of your Business concern gingered me
into soliciting for your help. Now, since the present Government of my
Country is hell-bent on prosecuting, disgracing the good name and image of
my entire family and possibly doing more damages to our financial base, I
am therefore desirous of handling over the remains of my Father's Money
US$36 Million (Thirty-six Million United States Dollars Only) which is
presently SAFELY and SECRETLY kept in CODED CASH in a! Security Company
outside my Country to evade confiscation by the Nigerian Government or its
Agents.

Please, if you are interested in helping my family move this money
into your private or Company Account, kindly inform me through my
E-mail addresses above. After the movement of this huge sum of money
out of its secret place into your Country, I plan to give you 20% of
the total sum and 10% would be set aside to take care of all incidental
expenses, while 30% will be plunged into your Business concern as
shares or for high profile investment purposes in your Country. Then,
the rest 40% shall be used to settle my entire family who have reached
advanced stage of emigrate to your Country for political asylum. For
your information my dear grief stricken mother has the blessing of
this Business transaction. It is pertinent to state here that this
transaction is entirely based on trust and I would also kindly
appeal that you keep this pro! posed transaction with TOP SECRET.

Your immediate response will be appreciated and all machineries
concerning this transaction will be swung into action.

Thanks.

Yours Faithfully,

Mr. Abba Abacha.

Subject: PARTNERSHIP INVESTMENT


Dear Sir,

My name is Dr Victor Turay, the manager of bill and exchange at the
foreign remittance department of Bank of Africa (BOA) Abidjan Cote d'
Ivoire.I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable
person to handle a very confidential transaction that involves the
transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5 Million ( Eight
Million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) . In a dormant account that
belongs to one of our foreign client who died along with his entire family
in a concord plane crash in the year 2000 in paris that almost took the
whole life of the pasengeres on board.

 Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next
of kin or some body with complete information about the account to come
over and claim his money. Because the money can not be released, unless
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased with
complete data of the account, as indicated in our banking guidelines. But
uptill now nobody has come up as his next of kin to claim the fund, which
means that the next of kin is among those that died with him in the crash
leaving no body behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my
department that knows about the fund,decided to make this businness
proposal to you for you to present your self as the next of kin or
relation to the deceased and apply for the transfer of the money into your
nominated foreign account for subsequent disbursement. Since nobody is
coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as
unclaimed Bill. The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such
money remained unclamed after three years, the money will be transfered
into the Bank treasury account as unclaimed fund.

The need of a foreigner as next of kin in this transaction is due to the
fact that the client involved was a foreigner and an Ivoirean can not
stand in as next of kin to a foreigner. You will be given 30% for your
assitance and effort at the end of the transfer, after removing any
expences incured by both party if any.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels for the immediate
transfer of the funds within 14 working days to your nominated account.
Subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our assurance is
that your role and the transaction is risk free, as all modalities has
been in place for the transfer.

If you can handle this project. Please get back to me through my e-mail
address for more details on what you are to do.Mind you that this
transaction requires the highest mutual trust and absolute secrecy. Please
indicate your private telephone number where I can always reach.

 Yours sincerely,

DR VICTOR TURAY

sum of USD10.500.000 (Ten Million, five hundred thousand dollars) left in
a suspense account in a local Bank here in Abidjan, that he used my name
as his first Daughter for the next of kin in deposit of the fund. He also
explained to me that it was because of this wealth and some huge amount of
money his business associates supposed to balance him from the deal they

Subject: URGENT.

FROM: Mrs. Amina Bola Ige,  
  
Dear,
  
I am making this contact to you on the fact that we may be assistance to each
other in developing a long lasting cordial business 
relationship. I was moved by recommendations made of your sincerity to handling
a business relationship that involves of money.
  
I have been constrained by the sudden death of my husband, the former Minister
of Power and steal and currently before his death, the 
Minister for Justice of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, whom did unknown men
assassinate. 

I am Mrs. Amina Ige, the second wife of the late Chief Bola Ige who died early
this month, 2002. With heart full of grief, I regret to inform you 
of the inhuman and harsh conditions which my husband's first wife and the
brother's have subjected me and my only son, Jubril Bola Ige (Jr.) 
since my husband's death, the relatives have been wicked to us because of the
following reasons: 
 
1.    I am not from the same tribe with them.

2.    My refusal to learn and speak their tribal language and dress like other
women from their tribe.

3.    My refusal to accept their religion 

4.    Because I have only one child, a male child.

5.    Because I was specially loved and favored by my late husband.
  

I am absolutely tired of all these threats from my husbands 
relatives since the death of my husband. I am no longer in there Family house.
I am now in my husband's guesthouse, with my Son, I 
seriously need your kind assistance and co-operations. 

 
Few weeks before my husband's death, he entrusted the defaced cash sum of $75
million U.S dollars to my care for safe keeping in my 
apartment. After his death I acted fast to deposit it in a security vault in
the village to avoid my husband's relations getting to see that in the 
house. This sum is secretly concealed in boxes (defaced for security reasons). 


Now I solicit your assistance to accept this sum for self-keeping. This I
cannot lodge into a local account to avoid suspicion from the 
Government, my husband^Òs brother's and wife since they have Confiscated all
left by my husband and still places eyes on me if they could 
lay hands on more including cash as they have left me and my child without any
cash.

If you can accept this, I urge you to contact us immediately for us to brief
you on arrangement of how we can possibly handle this. As a 
necessity you will also assist us in buying a good building in your city as we
are presently in the guesthouse. Since I am interested in 
investing on Estate development, Shares/stock exchange market, computers and
the shipping Industries. 

I will like you to educate me on your country's companies Income -tax policies,
as a citizen since my husband's oil allocation from Federal 

Government is still in force.
  

Considering what you will take from the total sum, we shall discuss it
face-to-face on our arrival to your place. Obviously, you will be our 
(Myself and Son) next of kin while in your country. I expect you to give this a
quick and urgent attention while I expect your response for 

more briefing from me, But if on the other hand you consider your self not
capable and fit of handling this because of the volume of cash 
involve, you can hold confidential by informing me, hence I may approve your
contact of any of your trusted close confidant you feel can 
keep this confidential and capable of handling such because of his level of
knowledge in investment and cash flow in business.

Remember the confidentiality as this is not for any third party, hence this
should remain between both of us alone. 

We await your immediate reply through the above E-Mail or this telephone number
234-803-3102176 to avoid any other member of the family 
having consent of this, all correspondences should be directed to my Son and
only him should you transact with -Mr.Jubril Ige (Jr.)   
  
Best regards,
  
Mrs. Amina Ige

Dear friend, 

I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and
Monitoring Committee in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation NNPC.
In November 2000, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in NNPC by my
committee. This contract was over invoiced to the tune of U.S.$10M(Ten
million United States Dollars only).This was done delibrately. The
over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project.

We now desire to transfer this money which is in a suspense account with
the NNPC in any overseas account which we expect you to privide for us.
For providing the account where we shall remit the money, you will be
entitled to 25% of the money, 70% will be for my partners and I while 5%
has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that may be
incurred by us during the course of this transfer including local and
international expenses. I would require the following -

1. BANK NAME AND ADDRESS
2. BANK TEL/FAX NUMBERS 
3. SORT/ABA/ROUTING NUMBERS
4. ACCOUNT NUMBER 
5. BENEFICIARY NAME 

The following information would be used to make formal applications as a
matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to
your account within one week from the receipt of the information. It does
not matter whether your company does contract projects of the nature
described here, the assumption is that your company won the contract and
subletted it out to another company.  More often than not, big trading
companies or firms of unrelated field win major contracts and sublet to
more specialized firms for execution.

We have strong and reliable connections and contacts at the Apex Bank and
Federal Ministry of Finance and we have every assurance that this money
will be released and transferred if we get the necessary and trustworthy
foreign partner to assist us in this deal. However when the business is
successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw all
documents used from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100%
security. We are civil servants and we will not want to miss this
opportunity. We want this money to be transferred to an overseas account
for us.

Please contact me immediately through Email if you are interested in this
deal. Contact me so that I can know the next action to take, may be to
scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. But where you
are interested send the required information me as time is of great
essence in this transaction. I await in anticipation of your urgent
response and full co-operation.

Thanks and God bless you as you reply, 
VICTOR JAJA

ABACHAS FAMILY 
IN CONJUNCTION WITH ATLAS OIL SERVICING COMPANY
ABUJA-NIGERIA

Assalam ^Ñaleykum!

PLEASE I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE/INVESTMENT

Accept my apologies for writing to you in this mode
for it might be of inconvenience to you considering
the fact that a lot of such proposals might have been
forwarded to you by people using my family name
thereby fronting us to a public ridicule. But due to
my quest for an honest and reliable international
assistance, I have no option but to go this length. I
am Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha (CGFR), wife to the late
Nigerian Head of State, General Sani Abacha, who died
on 8th of June 1998 of heart problems while still on
active duty.

I am writing this proposal as regards the uncultured
attitude, which the government of my country has been
displaying to my family and to procure your consent to
assist my family. The government of my country has
been displaying a lot of harassments and intimidating
tendencies towards all the members of my family
thereby making us subject to public ridicule and
negative thoughts. The government of Chief Olusegun
Obasanjo has also ensured that all my family bank
accounts are iced up, and all fiscal tangible assets
seized. As a matter of fact, just recently my first
surviving son Mohammed was proclaimed innocent after
three years of solitary confinement of murder charges
among others laid against him in the Federal High
Court. Considering all these impediments against my
family, which have really affected us thereby making
the Abachas conglomerate loose its financial
capabilities in the economic and business endeavors.
It is in view of this fact that I seek your assistance
concerning the transfer of a sum of forty-eight
million, six hundred thousand united states dollars
($48.6m), being the very last of my family fund in my
possession and control unknown to the government of my
country.

The funds originated as a result of a contract deal
between my son Mohammed and a German Civil
Construction Firm (JULIUS BERGER) in our country^Òs
recently built multi-billion dollars Federal Capital
Territory in Abuja. Mohammed could not complete the
contract as a result of his incarceration but the
German firm kept to the agreement they had and
returned Mohammed^Òs share of US$48,600,000.00 Dollars.
The whole money has been with a fellow General and top
Military official in my husband^Òs cabinet when he was
in power. Remember there is no record whatsoever
concerning the existence of the funds, because there
is no document showing that we received the money from
the German firm. In view of these facts, I need your
assistance to secure these funds, for at the moment
the General in possession of the fund has intentions
to contest for a senatorial seat during the next
political dispensation and such volume of money in his
possession will jeopardize his political ambition. I
thus wish to discretely transfer this money out of
Nigeria with your help, to be invested in your
country^Òs oil or energy sector (under your
professional guidance). I shall expect you to contact
me urgently to enable us discuss this business in
details. Posturing in mind that your assistance is
needed to transfer this money out of Nigeria, I offer
you a commission of 20% (twenty percent) of the total
money for the expected services and assistance and 5%
(five percent) have been mapped out for sundry
expenses incurred in the cause of this transaction for
I cannot take on this project alone due to my
financial incapability at the moment.

Your prompt response will be highly appreciated so as
to stop further search of assistance. All
correspondence shall be through my son Prince Abbas
who knows every arrangement and details of the
transaction. Please kindly contact him on his e-mail:
abbasabacha@email.com or you contact me directly on
the same email as stated above. Please knowing the
condition of my family and the motive of my contacting
you, I plead that you keep this matter confidential. I
also want you to send to me your reliable mailing
address so I can send my family pictures to you for
more acquaintance. Please endeavor to send your reply
to my son Prince Abbas, I shall send you more
information on my travails when I hear from you.

Thank you for your anticipated co-operation.

Best regards,


DR.(MRS) MARIAM ABACHA

ATTN: THE PRESIDENT 

Dear Sir,

I am Mr. Bode Thomas Ige the first son to the second wife of the recently
assassinated Nigeria Attorney General of the Federation and Justice Minister
CHIEF BOLA IGE.  I am moved to write you this letter in confidence
considering my present circumstance and situation. As you may rightly want
to know, I got your outfit through the Nigeria international trade board
under the Country's Chamber of Commerce and Industry, they are the country's
official agency in charge of promoting international business and
investment, though I did not disclose my intention to them which is strictly
confidential 

I know you will be surprised to receive this message but do please consider
it a request from a suffering family in serious need of your humble
assistance, my mother and me had to bring before you this proposal because
we sincerely hope you will be a reliable person to assist us. Anyway, my
name is as above stated. I am the first son to the second wife of the
recently assassinated the Attorney General of the Federation and Justice
Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria CHIEF BOLA IGE

Six months, before the assassination of my father, he had used my name to
deposit in two metal boxes the flat sum of twenty two million United States
Dollars ($22,000,000USD) in a vault of a private security company in my
Country here in Nigeria for safekeeping, and my father planned before his
death is to invest this money for me in oversea as soon he finish his tenure
as a minister, but unfortunately he met his untimely death, unidentified
assailants assassinated him at his Ibadan Oyo State residence on the early
hour of Sunday December 23rd, 2001. Again, exactly a month before his death,
and also upon his authority, the consignment that contained the money has
been airlifted to Holland by the security company over here in my Country
and the consignment has since then been kept at their affiliated sister
security company in Holland for safe keeping pending the arrival of me and
father to Holland for my onward investment. The affiliated sister security
company in Holland does not know the actual content of the box deposited
with them since my father lodged them as a diplomatic consignment and
declared the contents to be photographic materials, these funds are security
coded to prevent them from falling into wrong hands and also defaced to
avoid detection.

Immediately after my father's death, my stepmother has continued to be
extremely mean and discriminatory to us in the family scheme of things,
because his son Barrister. Muyiwa Ige is the first son of the family while
my own mother is the second wife of our father and I am the first son of my
mother.  She has even arbitrarily accused my mother of having masterminded
our father's assassination and all sorts of groundless accusations. 

Right now, I am staying in my grand mother's family hometown here in Lagos
where ASYLUM has been granted to me and my Mother, due to the intimidations
and threats from my half brother. As it is now, I have decided to use this
money for our own personal use, my mother, and me but I wILL want to get it
transferred outside the country first for onward investment purposes. We do
not want to invest here due to the turmoil and the sensitive status that the
sudden death of my father brought to my father's family house, even to the
whole of my father hometown.

However, I am now ready to invest this money over there in your Country,
this is reason why I am contacting you for the assistance to help us receive
this money in cash from the security company over there in your country, but
on condition that the nature of your job will not permit you to assist me on
this transaction, then I will appreciate and you will be rewarded handsomely
also, if you can introduce to me any reliable foreign individual, company,
church, or mosque where I can send this money through, because firstly, we
still want to sow  part of this money into the work of God to lifting up the
ministries and also into any reliable charismatic organization, while the
rest part of it will be used for me and mother's investment in your country
or anywhere you might suggest for us, this is reason why I am contacting you
if you can be of help to assist us receive this money in your country or
introduce to me any reliable foreign individual or organization stated
above. I have resolved to offer you 20% of the total money for your
assistance and every expense are out rightly subject to instant refund.

As a foreign partner, I genuinely solicit that you kindly help me and my
mother receive this money from the security company into your country
through the consignment for safekeeping pending my immediate arrival with my
mother into your Country for onward investments, which we are going to rely
on you heavily to help us actualize. The security company will deliver this
money to you in your country in cash through the consignment.
More importantly, I would wish to receive your personal assurance that you
would not sit on the money when it finally arrive your care in order not to
betray the confidence which I repose on you.

I must stress here that there are legal documents that backs the lodging of
the consignment at the security company for a very perfect and smooth-free
transfer of this money into any country in the world, and all the documents
are still very much intact with me, because it is me and my father before
his death that went together and lodged the money at the security company.

This transaction is 100% risk free because I have concluded arrangement to
save guide whoever is to assist me on this transaction, hence it requires
high level of confidential and secrecy.  So this transaction will be
concluded within a maximum of 5-6 working days upon receiving your approval.
Kindly contact me through this email address should this proposal happen to
meet your utmost considerations, then the details on how you will be able to
receive the consignment in your country will be given to you consequence
upon your response that you are ready to assist us. So do also kindly
furnish me with your private telephone / mobile number and fax numbers for
speedy communication for further discussions on this transaction.

Thanks very much in anticipation of your cooperation and hoping that you
will treat this letter with urgency and privacy it requires for security
reason already stated above.

God bless you. Please, kindly reply me through any of the alternative e-mail
supplied below.

Regards,

Mr. Bode Thomas Ige

Attn:NAUMANN.

Sir,

I am Barrister Bode Rotimi Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to Mr
NAUMANN JOHNSON a national of your country, who used to work with shell
development company in Nigeria.

On the 21st of April 1999, my client, his wife And their three children
were involved in a car accident along Sagamu/Lagos Express Road.
unfortunately they All lost their lives in the event of the accident,
Since then I have made several enquiries to your Embassy tolocate any of
my clients extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his
relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no
avail, hence I contacted you,because your name is similar. I contacted you
to assist in repartrating the money and property left behind by my client
before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where
this huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the Bank where the deceased
had an account valued at about 9 million dollars.

Conseqently, The bank issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or
have the account confiscated within the next ten official working days.
since i have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 2
years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the
deceased since you are from the same country so that the proceeds of this
account valued at $9 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and
me can share the money. 55% to me and 40% to you,while 5% should be for
expenses or taxas your government may require.

I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim
we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see
this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the
law.Please get in touch with me by my email to enable us discuss further.

PRESIDENT & C.E.O
ATTN: SIR

This business proposal to you is strictly
confidential, with due respect. Sorry at this
perceived confusion or stress you may have receiving
this letter from me, Since we have not known ourselves
or met previously. Despite that, I am constrained to
write you this letter because of the urgency of it.By way of self
introduction, I am Mrs. ALICE Kobe, the wife of late Brigadier -
Gen.Maxwell
Kobe former ECOMOG ARMY COMMANDER [West African peacekeeping force
in Sierra Leone] who died in the Sierra Leone civil disturbance
[War]. My three daughters and I are trapped in obnoxious custom and
traditional norms.

We have suffered maltreatment and untold hardship in
the hands of my late husband's family, simply because
I did not bear a male child [heir apparent] for my
late husband. By tradition, all that my late husband
had, [wealth] belongs to his brothers/family. And
myself is to be remarried by his immediate younger
brother which I vehemently refused. They have taken
all that I suffered with my husband to acquire
including treasures, houses and his bank particular
seized by them. I wanted to escape to the United State
of America [USA} with my children on exile, but again
they conspired and stole my international passport and
other traveling document to further frustrate me.

Thank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code
from a Security Company abroad, that my late husband deposited U.S
$45.5 Million cash with this company. It has therefore, become very
necessary and urgent to contact someone, a foreigner like you to
help me receive/secure these funds overseas in a reliable bank Account
(presumably an empty Bank Account, if available) and to help invest
it on our behalf as well, while we find a way of getting out to meet
with you in your country.

These funds are kept on an "OPEN BENEFICIARY MANDATE"
with the Security Company to avoid detection, seizure
or diversion. I have had several telephone discussions
with the Assistant Director of the security company,
who has express willingness to help me on meeting the
company's demands. This is why I have
contacted you to help save my children and I, receive
these funds on our behalf. But, you would need to give
me sufficient assurance that if you help me, you would
not divert the funds. My children and I have resolved
to give you 30% of the total sum. This is all my
children and I have got to live on.

Please, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope
you will not disappoint me. I look forward to your
urgent response, including your private phone / mobile
No and also your fax no for easier communication.

NB: The secret codes (e.g Pin No., Secret Access Code)
for this fund are safely kept with me which I can give
you as soon as you express desire to help me.

Stay blessed.
ALICE KOBE

Subject: Fund Transfer Assistance.


From the Desk of: MRS MARIAM ABACHA

Abacha Court, Victoria Garden City,

Lagos-Nigeria.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I NEED YOUR HELP May the blessing of God be upon you and grant you the
wisdom and sympathy to understand my situation and how much I need your
help. Late Gen. Sanni Abacha, ex-military Head of State (Federal Republic of
Nigeria) was my husband that died of heart problem. Since the death of my
husband, I have been subjected to all sorts of harassment's, intimidation's
and inhumane treatments, with negative reports emanating from the government
and the press regarding my husband's past military regime and my eldest son
Mohammed is being held. Most of our trusted Associates betrayed us because
of Ministerial Jobs and appointments.

I need your immediate help, I beg of you. I need your help to transfer what
I call "our future hope" the sum of Forty One Million United State Dollars
(US41, 000,000) from my late husband's private vault which he deposited into
a security firm before his death. The last transfer of Ten Million United
State Dollars (US$10,000,000) I made into a friend's foreign account in
Europe, after the successful transfer, my friend denied me my money because
of my restricted movement within Nigeria.

That is the main point why I need your help. I lost so much trying to make
transfer through some associates. This fund is considered as the main source
of my family's future hope. When this US$41 Million dollars is transferred,
my brother Okoh Bello who is also my close Confidant would be able to
establish an investment with your assistance on our family behalf until I
come out of my travail and torment.

For your information, my communication and movement are under strict
surveillance therefore make all your communications to me through my email
address. This is to ensure maximum confidentiality and secrecy. If you help
me receive this money into a foreign account, I will reward you with 15% of
the total sum I will also compensate you for your inconveniences and 5% for
expenses incurred. I am depending on this fund and I am counting on you for
my future happiness and that of my family.

I wait patiently for your response. Please include your contact details,
telephone and fax

Yours truly,

Mrs. Mariam Abacha.

Request for Assistance.

I am Mr. Nasel Malik (MNIM), the co-ordinator of the Federal Government of
Nigeria contract review panel of the National Gas Company (NGC).

Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a conglomerate of foreign companies
by my committee on behalf of the NGC, the contract was over-invoiced to the
tune of US$24.5 million. This was done
deliberately. The over-invoicing was a deal by members of my committee to
benfit from the project. We now desire to transfer this money which is
presently in a suspense account of the NGC in the Debt Reconciliation
Committee (DRC) into an account which we expect you to kindly provide for
us, this we believe will not be so much of a burden to you.

Benefits:
For providing the account where we shall remit the money, you will be
entitled to 25% of the money, 70% will be for me and my partners while 5%
has been mapped out from the total sum to
cover any expenses that may be incurred by us during the course of this
transaction, both local and international expenses, these also include taxes
that may arise.

I would require:
A. Name and address of company/beneficiary
B. Your bank account number, bank address and other information relevant to
the project at hand.
C. It is not necessary that the account you are providing should have money
in it, what matters is that it should had been in existence for a while
(accounts dynamics) and you should have a 100% control over it.

The above information would be used to make formal applications as a matter
of procedure for the release of the money for onward transfer to your
account. It does not matter whether or not your company or you performed
contract projects of the nature described here, the sumption is that you won
a major contract and sub-contracted it out to other companies. More ofter
than not, big trading companies or individuals of unrelated field win major
contrats and sub-contracts it out
to more specialised firms for execution of such contracts. We have strong
and reliable connections and contacts at the Debt Reconciliation Committee
(DRC) and the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) and we have no doubts that
all this money will be released and transferred if we get the necessary
foreign partner in this transaction. Therefore, when the business is
successfully concluded, we shall through our same connections withdraw all
documents used from all the concerned government ministries for 100%
security.

We want this money to be transferred to the overseas account which you are
going to kindly provide for safe keeping pending when we will determine how
we want our portion of the money, all expenses
regarding the account opening if not already in existence shall be borne by
you, all monies spent from personal purse during the course of this
transaction are however reimburseable as already stated from the 5% that had
been set aside for this purpose after the transfer of the funds have  been
effected into your account that you will be providing for the purpose of
this business.

Please, contact me immediately through fax (234 1 7590371) or e-mail to
ascertain your interest in doing us this favour, so that if you are not, it
will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this
transaction. Fortunately, if you are interested in assisting me, please send
the reqyuired information mentioned through my direct fax number: (234 1
7590371) or email at any time of the day. For more details on this
transaction, send me a fax or email me.

If you will be of assistance, I will surely appreciate and thank you for
your kindness in giving me this assistance.

Yours sincerely,

Mr. Nasel Malik (MNIM).

Subject: URGENT CONFIDENTIAL


I am DAVID MUKALELE, Bank Manager of ORIENT BANK OF NIGERIA,
Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential
business proposition for you.

On June 6 1997, an American oil consultant/contractor
with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr.
Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) deposited for
twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00
(Twenty-five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon
maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we
sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an
automobile accident. On further investigation, I found
out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to
trace his next of kin were fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin
in all his official documents, including his Bank
Deposit paperwork. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is
still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each
year. No one will come forward to claim it. According
to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five)
years, the money will revert to the ownership of the
Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry
Kelly so that the fruits of this old man^Rs labor will
not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. This
is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately
with your full names and address so that the attorney
will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits,
which will put you in place as the next of kin. We
shall employ the services of two attorneys for
drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the
necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor the transfer. A
bank account in any part of the world, which you
provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the
ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the attorney and my
position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction. If you are
interested, please reply immediately via the private
email address below. Upon your response, I shall then
provide you with more details and relevant documents
that will help you understand. Please observe utmost
confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us
because I shall require your assistance to invest my
share in your country.
Awaiting your urgent reply via email.

Thanks and regards

 DAVID MUKALELE

Strickly confidential/urgent.
Attn:My good friend,

May the peace of the Almighty God be with you.Worry not about who gave me
your contact.It was a colleague of mine who travailed with a Nigerian
trade delegation to your country late last year.He got your contact on my
request for a reliable person whom I can do business with,neither the man
in the external affairs office who gave your contact to my colleague nor
my colleague has any slightest idea of what business I want to do with
you.

I am Honorable Hon. Dr. Usmanlar Douglas the executive chairman (MAYOR) of
Egor local government council of Lagos South,Nigeria.I was elected into
office under the present democratic government of Nigeria.Happily married
with lovely children.

On my assumption of office in 1999,I discovered through my auditors,huge
sums of money left unclaimed by my predecessor in the Escrow account of
the Central Bank Of Nigeria which is the Federal Bank through which my
council recieves her annual subvention from the federal government.These
unclaimed funds run into many millions of Dollars and the essence of
seeking your assistance is to help me as a foreign account holder transfer
one of the funds which is an over invoiced sum from an original contract
awarded in 1998 for which the original contractors,Guffanti Ltd. of
Italy,Fouguerolle and Dumez of Germany have since been paid but my
predecessor was unable to claim this over invoiced value of USD25.5M as
their government was suddenly removed from office by a military coup.You
will therefore assist me in following up the procedures as well as provide
a personal or company account to which the funds can be transferee.

You must treat this letter with utmost confidentiality and trust.We cannot
afford to toy with this rare opportunity in a life time.Because I am still
serving and cannot own a foreign account for now as in accordance with the
law of my country, that^Òs why I decided to contact you,and mores the
contract was done by foreign contractors and payment were made in United
States Dollars,the more reason why I urgently need your assistance to
receive this money for me.

All modalities for the successful transfer of this fund,all legal and
administrative requirements in Nigeria as well as that of international
arbitration have been worked out.We hope to conclude this transaction
within fourteen (14) banking days once you open communication with me to
furnish me your willingness and the following needed for easy transfer of
the funds:

(1) Your company or Your full names
(2) Your company or Personal address(or both)
(3) phone/fax numbers(secured and confidential enough)

We shall agree on what percentage you will merit for your assistance when
I hear from you.But 10% of the funds must be set aside as an abstract
projection for reinbursement to both parties for incidental expenses that
may be incurred in the course of this transaction.

Yours faithfully,
Hon Dr Usmanlar Douglas.

FROM THE DESK OF:
ENGR. USMAN DAGGASH.
ATTN:
SIR/MADAM

INTRODUCTION: l am ENGR. USMAN DAGGASH. a Civil
Servant in the Ministry of Health. l know this
proposal will come to you as a surprise since we have
not met before either physically or through
correspondence. I got your contact from our chamber of
commerce here in Nigeria and have no doubt in your
ability to handle this proposal involving huge sum of
money.
 
THE SUBJECT: My father ALHAJI USMAN DAGGASH (Now Late)
was the Royal Head of my community, ELEME (an oil rich
town) in Nigeria. My community produces 5.8% of the
total crude oil production in Nigeria and 0.5% of the
Dollar value of each barrel is paid to my father as
royalty by the Federal Government.

My father was also the Chairman of ELEME Special Oil
Trust Fund. In his position as the Royal head and
Chairman of the Oil Trust Fund, he made some money
which he left for me as the only heir to inherit.The
money is Eighteen Million  Five Hundred Thousand US
Dollars($18.5m).
This Money originated from the accumulated royalties
between 1976-1998 . Due to poor banking system in
Nigeria and political instability as a result of past
Military rules (1985-1999) , he deposited this Money
in a Strong Room/"VAULTS" with an open beneficiary in
Apex Bank of Nigeria pending when he would finish
arrangement to transfer it abroad as a CONTRACT
PAYMENT. He was planning this when he died late last
year of Heart attack.

THE PROPOSAL: Just before my father died he called my
attention to the money and charged me to look for a
foreigner who would assist me in the
transfer/investment of the funds abroad. So l would
be very grateful if you could accept to help me
achieve this great objective. I promise to give you
20% of the total funds transferred to your vital bank
account as compensation for your assistance. ten
percent (10%)would be set aside to take care of all
expenses we may incure during the transaction. If you
indicate your interest, contact me urgently and
confidentially through my e-mail address above  for
more information and the roles you will play in this
business.
You are also requested to forward your personal
telephone/fax numbers to me for easy communication.

All the legal Documents concerning this Money will be
sent to you as soon as we agreed together.
May the almighty God bless you.

Yours faithfully,

ENGR.USMAN DAGGASH.

Chairman Contract Award Committee: (FMHSS)

Attn: Sir,

For your assistance please. We write to solicit for your assistance for
this transaction believing that you will treat this with utmost
confidence, and excuse me for the embarrassment this letter might cause
you, as we haven^Òt met before.

I have the mandate of my colleagues in my office to solicit for your
assistance for a business/deal we want to execute with you. My ministry,
Federal Ministry of Health and Social Services {FMHSS} awarded a contract
of (US$ 115,800,000.00) to a foreign firm. For the supply and installation
of Scan Machines, x-ray machines, E.C.G. Machines, Foetus Heart and
Fasting Blood Sugar Machines for University Teaching Hospitals all over
the Federation.

I and other members of my department (contract award committee), on cause
of writing the contract were able to over-invoice the contract sum to the
tone of (161,300,000.00). And it might also interest you to know that the
original contractors, who executed the contract, have been paid their
contract amount of (US$ 115,800,000.00) on completion of the contract.

Now we are left with the over-invoiced sum of (45,500,000.00) for our
mutual benefit.

All arrangements have been concluded on how this money will be moved. Our
constraints lie on the fact that we required a foreign firm or individual
bank account where this money will be paid into; whose owner will be
portrayed as the beneficiary of the contract fund. In fact this is why I
am writing you this letter seeking for your assistance.

Note: there is no risk involved, as I have personally inquired about the
right channels of executing this venture successfully. And as civil
servants, we are aware that some financial assistance will be required to
affect the success of this money transfer. For this reason, we have
generally agreed to compensate you with the sum of (US$8,000,000.00),
while the balance of (US$37,500,000.00) has been mapped out for investment
into a foreign capital market.

It is important I mention that the officials involved in this transaction
are top government functionaries who have put in years of service to this
Country (Nigeria). For the maintenance of personal integrity and prestige
of all persons involved in this transaction, you are implored to exhibit
utmost secrecy throughout the duration of this deal. You are strongly
advised to avoid discussing this transaction with a third party as that
could jeopardize the success of this transaction.

You may open a separate bank account in any country of your choice for
this purpose if you wish. Meanwhile all arrangements for this transfer to
be concluded have been properly organized and further action awaits your
response to this request. Kindly, contact me on telephone number 234 803
3152133 or send to my alternative email add. Sb1521@yahoo.com.

Thanks,

Sam Benjamin,

Dear Sir, 

REQUEST FOR CO-OPERATION ON A PRIVATE BUSINESS

Every four years, Nigeria Banks transfer to it s
treasury Millions of Dollars of unclaimed Deceased
Depositors Funds, in compliance with the Banking Laws
and Guidelines. In the majority of cases, with
reference to my Bank   WEMA BANK PLC. The money
normally runs into several millions of dollars. Until
Dr.David Fang  death along with his wife, Doris, their
two children, Micheal and Ann in a private jet plane
crash. I was his foreign currency denoted Bank Account
Manager with constant balance in excess of eight
digits. Ever since his death and up till this time of
writing, no next of kin or relation of his has come
forward to claim his money with us. 

Naturally, as long as late Dr.David Fang money remains unclaimed, the
bank remains richer in free funds with his money. However, with my being
in direct charge of Bills and Exchange in the foreign Remittance
Department of my bank, I am in position to cause the payment of this
money to whosoever that present himself as the next of kin or relation
of the late Dr.David Fang' on private business deal basis. 

Now the game plan and the purpose of writing to you
exclusively having been highly recommended as the
right and proper person to handle this deal by a
Management Consultant friend of mine, who has traveled
widely, including your country is that I want to pull
out this unclaimed money amounting to $14,900,000:00
(Fourteen Million, Nine Hundred United States Dollars)
with your co-operation and assistance by just doing
the following: 
- 

(a) Act as next of kin or relation of late Dr.David
Fang 

(b) Provide your bank account and location where you
want the money remitted .
(c) Provide your direct and private Telephone/Fax
numbers for effective communication 
(d) Give immediate reply to this proposal using the
above Tel/Fax 
number for details on how to proceed. 

For your co-operation and efforts, 40% of the money
will be for you as my foreign partner,10% for
settlement of all expenses that might be incurred on
the course of this transaction, while 50% will be for
myself that will eventually visit your country for
disbursement of the fund. 

Looking forward to a mutual and beneficial business relationship. 

Regards,


MR.CHIKA PAUL.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT


ATTENTION:Chairman/Ceo

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am MR FUSHAM WILLAM a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an
Executive Accountant MR.FUSHAM WILLAM( B.Sc.,M.Sc. MNIM.) DIRECTOR, PROJECT
IMPLEMENTATIONhe South Africa Department of Mining & Natural
Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you
for a saction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to fidentiality
and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the
South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government
delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable
credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for
the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because
of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling twenty four
Million, two hundred Thousand US. Dollars ($24,200,000.) which we want to
transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable
foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are
handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of
Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance
in the whole transaction.

This amount $24.2m represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we
the officials over-invoiced deliberately.

Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor,
leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in
principles gotten approval to remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer
(K.T.T) to any  foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an
application through the  Ministry of Justice here in South Africa for the
transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30%
of the $24.2 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous
expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat
it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization
is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me.
Endeavor to contact me immediately through my email address above to
confirm whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it
will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. I
want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the
payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong
assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please, remember
to treat this matter  very confidential , because we will not comprehend
with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service. Once
again, remember that time is of great essence in this transaction.

Note:please indicate your private tel/fax numbers for immediate
communication.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

FUSHAM WILLIAM

Dear Sir,

I know you will be surprised to read from me, but
please consider this letter as a request from a family
in dire need of your assistance. First I must
introduce my self, I am MR AMBROSE NKUNU  from Angola.
I am the first and only son of the late BRIGADIER Paul
NKUNU  I am presently residing in South Africa.

I got your contact from South African Information
Exchange (S.A.I.E) here in Johannesburg and on behalf
of my widowed mother MRS MONICA   NKUNU, I decided to
solicit for your assistance to transfer the sum of
US$40. 3 M (Forty million three hundred thousand
United States Dollars) inherited from my late father
into your personal or Company^Òs account. Before my
father^Òs death, he was a Brigadier in charge of arms
and ammunition purchases for the Angolan armed forces.
In his ^ÓWILL^Ô, he specifically drew my attention to
this sum of US$40. 3 M, which he deposited in a safe
box of a private Security Company in South Africa. IN
FACT MY FATHER SAID IN HIS WILL AND I QUOTE: -

^ÓMy beloved son, I wish to draw your attention to the
sum of US$40. 3 Million (Forty million three hundred
thousand United States Dollars), which I deposited in
a box with a Security Company in Johannesburg, South
Africa. During the war, I was very dedicated and
committed to winning the war against the Rebels until
I found out that the Senior army officers and top
Government functionaries were busy helping themselves
with Government funds and properties and sending them
to foreign Countries. Due to this, when I and the
former special adviser to the President were assigned
by the President (PRESIDENT EDUARDO SANTOS) to
purchase arms from South Africa, we saw this as a
Golden opportunity and diverted the money which we
divided and I got a total sum of US$40.3 million. In
case of my absence on earth caused by death only, you
should solicit for a reliable foreign partner to
assist you to transfer this money out of South Africa
for investment purposes. I deposited the money in your
name and it can be claimed by you alone with the
deposit code. Your mother has all the documents. Take
good care of your mother and two sisters,^Ô

From the above, you will understand that the lives and
future of my family depends on this money, as such I
will be very grateful if you can assist us. We are now
living in South Africa as political Asylum seekers and
the financial laws of South Africa does not allow
Asylum seekers certain financial rights to such huge
amount of money out of South Africa for investment
purposes. For your efforts, I am prepared to offer you
25% of the total fund, while 5% will be set aside for
local and international expenses and 70% will be kept
by my family and me.

Finally, modalities on how the transfer will be done
shall be conveyed to you by me once we establish trust
and confidence between ourselves. Looking forward to
your urgent reply and please treat as very
confidential.

Best Regards

MR. AMBROSE   NKUNU

Subject: Your Future & Ours (Reply Required)

Greetings. It is indeed my pleasure to write you this email. This might
come as a surprise to you, however, this is worth looking at. I am a staff
with the Ministry of Minerals and Energy in South Africa, and by this
email, I am representing and also acting on behalf of my boss and two
other senior colleagues (The Director-General and the Group General
Manager) whose mandate I have, to contact a trusted and reliable foreign
based partner, concerning an investment opportunity/funds transfer.

By this mandate given to me, we are in dire need of a foreign partner to
assist us in the transfer /investment of $10,000,000.00 (Ten million
United States Dollars.) The key issues is the transfer and the subsequent
investment of the said sum. We are ready to go into an agreement with you
and also "OFFER YOU A NEGOTIABLE FEE" IF you help us in securing the
transfer and also PUTTING TOGETHER AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO in which the
funds will be invested in your Country.

It does not matter whether or not you own a company or you invested funds
before, WE SHALL GUIDE YOU ON WHAT TO DO. The bases will be that a major
company won a contract from my ministry and subcontracted it to you. More
often, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win contract
and subcontracts to more specialised firms for execution.

We shall follow strictly all the legal procedures entailed in our laws and
international laws in transferring the funds legitimately and
authoritatively.

Please, be informed that under the South African Government monetary
policy, strategic positioned Government officials are not allowed to
operate or own bank accounts overseas, hence our need for a "Foreign
Partner to front for us".

We pray that you take the essence of this letter in strict confidence, as

Mr Maimo Johnson,
Netherlands

 
                       BUSINESS PROPOSAL
 
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know
me personally.The purpose of my introduction is that I am MAIMO
JOHNSON,the first son of ADUGBAM DAVID MAIMO, the most popular black
farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my
country.I got your contact through network online hence decided to write
you.Before the death of my father,he had taken me to Johannesburg to
deposit the sum of US8.5 million (Eight million,Five Hundred thousand
United States dollars),in one of the private security company, as he
foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box
as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company.This amount
was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and
establishment of new farms in Swaziland.

This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert Mugabe
introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers
and some few black farmers,and this resulted to the killing and mob action
by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society.In fact a lot
of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father
was one of the victims.
 
It is against this background that,I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear
of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we are
seeking political asylum and moreso have decided to transfer my father's
money to a more reliable foreign account.since the law of Netherlands
prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be
involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of
Netherlands,As the eldest son of my father,I am saddled with the
responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could
be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on
taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be
playing along with them.I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount
of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience
in future,both countries have similar political history.As a businessman,I
am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my
family in his hands,I must let you know that this transaction is risk
free.If you accept to assist me and my family all I want you to do for
me,is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the
consignment(funds) from their afiliate office here in the Netherlands as i
have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the
Netherlands from South Africa.But bef ore then all modalities will have to
be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more
importantly this money I intend to use for investment.

I have two options for you.Firstly you can choose to have certain
percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction.
Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable
investment of the money in your country.Whichever the option you want,feel
free to notify me.I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of
expenses incurred in the process of this transaction.If you do not prefer
a partnership I am willing to give you 10% of the money while the
remaining 85% will be for my investment in your country.Contact me with
this E-mail address (maimo2@lycos.com)while I implore you to maintain the
absolute secrecy required in this transaction.
 
Thanks,GOD BLESS YOU
 
Yours Faithfully,

Mr Johnson Maimo.

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

Dear Sir, 
First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in
this transaction; this is by virtue of its nature as
being utterly confidential and top secret. I am Mr.
Bimbo Daramola, Director of Projects Management in the
Federal Ministry of Water Resources. My department is
charged with the duties of implementation, execution
and monitoring of all water related projects in the
country. I came to know of your name and in my search
for a reliable and low-key person to handle a very
confidential transaction based on unflinching trust,
as we have not met before. This transaction involves
the transfer of huge sum of foreign exchange (United
States Dollars) to a foreign account. In the 2001
financial year, the Federal Government of Nigeria
allocated the sum of US$458 million to my department
as budgetary allocation. Within the year various
multinational corporations executed series of
contracts and all these contacts were duly paid for.
But in all we were not able to exhaust our budgetary
allocation. There are still some excess funds left. My
colleagues and I have decided to keep this excess
amount for ourselves. If the money is returned to
government treasury my department's future allocation
will be reduced or worse still, the money will be
embezzled by officials of our apex bank (Central Bank
of Nigeria). This money is currently lying in a
suspense account in the Central Bank of Nigeria. As
civil servants we are prohibited by the Code of
Conduct Bureau (Civil Service Laws) from opening or
operating foreign account and or dealing in foreign
exchange in our names, so we cannot directly acquire
the money. I have therefore been mandated as a matter
of trust by my colleagues to look for an overseas
partner to whom we could transfer the excess amount
to. Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to
transfer the total amount to your nominated bank
account as payment for consultancy services rendered
to my department for subsequent disbursement. In
return we have agreed to offer you 30% of the
transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for
incidental expenses (internal and external) accrued
between the parties in the course of the transaction
and 60% for us. Our share will be used to purchase
equipment and heavy machineries and I intend to have a
front that will manage this fund and invest it into
fiber-plastic and thermodynamic industres,property
development, buying of shares\ stocks in multinational
companies and engage in non-speculative investment and
other related ventures from your country as we cannot
repatriate the physical cash back to Nigeria. All
logistics are in place and all modalities worked out
for the smooth conclusion of the transaction within
ten to fourteen days of commencement. It is imperative
to bear in mind that having put 29 years in service of
the government, I am averse to having my image dented.
This matter should therefore be treated with utmost
secrecy and urgency. Kindly expedite action by
contacting me and indicating your interest in this
transaction in order for me to give you full details.
Please I am urgently waiting your response. 
Regards, 
Bimbo Daramola.

22 August 2002

To:   The President

Dear Sir,

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT.

Through some discreet inquiries from my Chambers of Commerce, you and your
organization were revealed as being quite astute in private
entrepreneurship. One has no doubt in your ability to handle a financial
business of considerable amount, which will form a bedrock of an extensive
business partnership in due course. In unfolding this proposal, I want to
count on you as a respected executive of your company to believe that you
will handle it with all maturity and confidentiality it deserves.

I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and
Monitoring Committee in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation  (NNPC).

Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm by my committee in
NNPC. This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M (Twenty One
Million, Five Hundred Thousand). This was done deliberately. The
over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project.

We now desire to transfer this money, which is in a Suspense Account with
NNPC, to any Overseas Account which we expect you to provide for us.

For providing the account where we shall remit the money, you will be
entitled to 20% of the money.   70% will be for me and my partners whilst
10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses/taxes
that may be incurred/accrued by us during the course of this transfer;
both local and international.

I would require from you, as a matter of urgency the following: (1 Name of
Beneficiary/Company Name. (2 Telephone and Fax No. of Beneficiary (3
Account No. of Beneficiary

The above information would be used to make formal applications as a
matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to
your account.

It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of
the nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the
major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. More often
than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields win major
contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.

We have strong and reliable connections and contacts at the Apex Bank
(Central Bank of Nigeria) and the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have
no doubt that all this money will be released and transferred if we get
the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when
the business is successfully concluded we shall, through our same
connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned Government
Ministries for 100% security.

We are civil servants and we will not want to miss this opportunity. We
want this money to be transferred to the overseas Account for us.

Please contact me immediately through my confidential email
"kola-adams@excite.com" whether or not you are interested in this deal. If
you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry
out this deal.

Time is of essence in this business.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest cooperation.

Yours faithfully,

Engr. Kolawole Adams (PhD.)

Subject: Your's/Our Future (Reply Required Plz)

Greetings. It is indeed my pleasure to write you this email. This might
come as a surprise to you, however, this is worth looking at. I am a staff
with the Ministry of Minerals and Energy in South Africa, and by this
email, I am representing and also acting on behalf of my boss and two
other senior colleagues (The Director-General and the Group General
Manager) whose mandate I have, to contact a trusted and reliable foreign
based partner, concerning an investment opportunity/funds transfer.

By this mandate given to me, we are in dire need of a foreign partner to
assist us in the transfer /investment of $10,000,000.00 (Ten million
United States Dollars.) The key issues is the transfer and the subsequent
investment of the said sum. We are ready to go into an agreement with you
and also "OFFER YOU A NEGOTIABLE FEE" IF you help us in securing the
transfer and also PUTTING TOGETHER AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO in which the
funds will be invested in your Country.

It does not matter whether or not you own a company or you invested funds
before, WE SHALL GUIDE YOU ON WHAT TO DO. The bases will be that a major
company won a contract from my ministry and subcontracted it to you. More
often, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win contract
and subcontracts to more specialised firms for execution.

We shall follow strictly all the legal procedures entailed in our laws and
international laws in transferring the funds legitimately and
authoritatively.

Please, be informed that under the South African Government monetary
policy, strategic positioned Government officials are not allowed to
operate or own bank accounts overseas, hence our need for a "Foreign
Partner to front for us".

We pray that you take the essence of this letter in strict confidence, as
the three officials involved would not like to be exposed on this, kindly
notify me via this email box for further details, upon your acceptance to
assist us, more details will be made available to you as soon as you
reply.

Thank you as I wait for your favourable response,

Best Regard,

Phil Fish

IN A SUSPENSE ACCOUNT WITH NNPC INTO ANY OVERSEAS ACCOUNT,WHICH WE EXPECT
YOU TO PROVIDE FOR US.
SHARE:
FOR PROVIDING THE ACCOUNT WHERE WE SHALL REMIT THE MONEY INTO, YOU WILL BE
ENTITLED TO 30% OF THE

WAS CONCLUDED AND ALL COVERING DOCUMENT WERE FORWARDED TO MR.MILLER TO
AUTHETICATE THE CLAIM.ONCE THE FUNDS WERE TRANSFERRED,MR. MILLER PRESENTED
HIS BANK WITH ALL THE LEGAL DOCUMENTS AND REMITTED THE WHOLE FUNDS TO
ANOTHER BANK ACCOUNT AND DISAPPEARED

UNRELATED FIELDS WIN MAJOR CONTRACTS AND SUBCONTRACTS TO MORE SPECIALIZED
FIRMS FOR EXECUTION OF SUCH CONTRACTS.

 WE HAVE STRONG RELIABLE CONNECTIONS AND CONTACTS AT THE CENTRAL BANK OF
NIGERIA, AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND WE HAVE NO DOUBT
THAT ALL THE MONEY WILL BE RELEASED AND TRANSFERRED IF WE GET THE

Mr. Williams Kabila 
Standard Trust Bank Ltd, 
Lagos, Nigeria. 

Dear Sir, 

I am Mr. William Kabila, Bank Manager of Standard Trust 
Bank, Lagos, Nigeria. I have urgent and very 
confidential business proposition for you. 

On January 6,1998, a Foreign Oil Consultant/contractor 
with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. 
James Herbert made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for 
twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,000,000.00 
(Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch. 
Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his 
forwarding address but got no reply. 

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we 
discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert 
died from an automobile accident. On further 
investigation, I found out that he died without making 
a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was 
fruitless. 

I therefore made further investigation and discovered 
that Mr. James Herbert did not declare any next of kin 
or relations in all his official documents, including 
his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of 
US$20,000,000.00 has carefully been moved out of my 
bank to a security company for safekeeping. No one 
will ever come forward to claim it. According to 
Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the 
money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian 
Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a 
Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I 
deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes 
though the security company does not know the 
contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be 
photographic materials for export. I am writing you 
because I as a public servant I cannot operate 
a foreign account or have an account that is more than 
$1m. I want to present you as the owner of the boxes 
in the security company so you can be able to claim 
them with the help of my attorney. All these are 
to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labor 
will not get into the hands of some corrupt government 
officials. 

This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately 
your full names and address so that the Attorney will 
prepare the necessary documents, which will put you in 
place as the owner of the boxes. The money will 
be shared in the ratio of 70% for me and 25% for you 
and 5% will take care of all expenses. There is no 
risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction 
will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee 
the successful execution of this transaction. 

If you are interested, please reply immediately via my 
private email address:willkabila_stb@bluewin.ch
Phone234-1-7757558 Fax 234-1-7594728. Upon 
your response, I shall then provide you with more 
details and relevant documents that will help you 
understand the transaction. 

Please observe with utmost confidentiality, and be 
rest assured that this transaction would be most 
profitable for both of us because I shall require your 
assistance to invest my share in your country. 

Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email to 
indicate your interest. 

Thanks and regards. 
MR.WILLIAMS KABILA

 PRESIDENT/CHAIRMAN
              STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL
I am Dr. PETER EFETOBOR,a manager in the Bills and Exchange at the
Foreign Remittance Department of the ZENITH INTERNATIONAL BANK
I am writing this letter to ask for your support and cooperation to
carry out this business opportunity in my department. We discovered
an abandoned sum of$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen million United States
Dollars only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign
customers who died along with his entire family of a wife and two
children in November 1997 in a Plane crash.Since we heard of his
death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to come over and put
claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot release the fund
from his account unless someone applies for claim as the next-of-kin
to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.Unfortunately,
neither their family member nor distant relative has everappeared to
claim the said fund. Upon this discovery, I and other officials in my
department have agreed to make business with you and release the
total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since no one
came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank,
otherwise the fund will be returned to the banks treasury as
unclaimed fund.We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as
stated thus;20 % for you as foreign partner,75 % for us the officials
in my department and 5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign
expences incurred by us and you during the course of this
business.Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one
of my colleagues will come to your country and mind our share. It is
from our 75 % we intend to import Agricultural Machineries into my
country as a way of recycling the fund. To commence this transaction,
we require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return e-
mail and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number
full name and address and your designated bank coordinates to enable
us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary
approvals before the transfer can be made.
Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
because of its nature.I look forward to receiving your prompt
response.
Dr. PETER EFETOBOR

Tenders Committee

South Africa Department of

Minerals & Energy

Pretoria, South Africa.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL AND URGENT

I am Mr. Mamabolo David,  an Executive Director with a South African
Government ministry. I am also the Secretary of the Tenders Committee
set up by the government to look into contracts under the Department of
Minerals and Energy. 

Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council
(SAEPC) who was with the government delegation to your country during a
trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to us. I was
mandated to seek your confidential co-operation in the execution of the
project I am about to describe. This project will be of great benefit to
all parties involved and hope you will keep it as a top secret because
of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Minerals and Energy, we (me and four of my
colleagues) discovered and we have in our possession as overdue payment
bills totalling Sixteen million, two hundred and fifty thousand US
dollars (US$16.25M) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance
and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable
foreign non-company account to
receive such funds.  Moreso, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as
the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to
operate offshore accounts hence your relevance in the whole
transaction.

This amount US$16.25M represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of this
Department by a foreign contracting firm, which was over-invoiced
deliberately.  Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the
original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the
said amount which we have in principle gotten approval to remit by
key-tested telegraphic transfer (K.T.T.)
to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing an application
through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former
contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners to propose that SHOULD YOU BE
WILLING to assist us in
this transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the total sum,
70% for us and the rest for taxation
and miscellaneous expenses.  The business itself is 100%-SAFE for all
involved. This is possible if on your part , you treat it with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality.  Please note that your area of
specialisation is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this
transaction. I wish reposed my confidence (which the committee vetoed)
in you and hope that you will not disappoint me.  Endeavour to contact
me immediately by email, whether or not you are interested in this deal.
If you are not, it will enable me scout
for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. I want to assure you
that my partners and myself are in
a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can
give us a very strong assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secure.  Please remember to treat this
matter as a very confidential
matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we
are still in active government
service and.

Due to the funds we borrowed to process this project to this stage, time
is of essence because of interest on borrowed funds. Also furnish me
with your contact telephone and fax number, so that I can forward to you
more information concerning the project.

I await in anticipation of your fullest cooperation.

Yours faithfully,

Mr. Mamabolo David

From Tao

I got your contact email address from a search I made on the Internet. I
cannot contact any of my erstwhile/ father's associates because of the
on-going situation in my country and the predicament facing my family. To
have a view of this, go to:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/special_report/1999/01/99/angola/newsid_264000/264094.stm

I am the son of the late leader of the Movement for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA), Jonas Savimbi, who was killed in a fierce gun battle
with government troops loyal to Edwardo Dos Santos on the 22nd of Febuary
2002.

I am Tao Aroujo Sakaita Savimbi, the eldest son of my late father (Jonas
Savimbi). I was aware of sales of diamonds and crude oil to individuals
and countries that clandestinely come and purchase these products. After
the PEACE ACCORD was broken, the United States of America government
abandoned my father and the United Nations (UN)  imposed sanctions on all
products coming out of UNITA controlled areas.is the proceeds of these
sales that were used by UNITA to purchase arms to prosecute the war.

My late father, Jonas Savimbi was able to deposit some fund in Europe with
a Security Company that he intended to make purchases with. I happen to be
in possesion of documents and information of the deposit and some others.
Only my ailing Mother and one other sibling is aware of this.
 
Our family's movements presently(including me) is restricted. We are
forbidden to either travel abroad or out of our localities.

You can know more about my father by checking his profile at the URL
below:

   www.kwacha.com/edoc2.htm 

Presently, the US$100,000,000.00(110 million Euros) One Hundred Million
Dollars cash my father transfered to Europe before his death for some
purchases he intended to make is safe and is in a Security firm. I have
the passcode and the documents to the Security firm. This is where I will
need your help because at present i cant travel. And I want to act fast
before the government finds out about the funds.
 
With this password and information and power of attorney you will be able
to proceed to the Security firm. But you will also give me a guarantee
first. I can get access to a satellite phone for communication. When you
are ready I will give you the information needed before you can get access
to the fund you will then proceed to the Security company where the funds
will be given to you as payment either installmentally or depending on the
advice of the security company.
 
YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS TRANSACTION IS REQUIRED.
  
Yours sincerely,
 
TAO A. SAVIMBI.

From: Mohammed Abdullahi [mohammed722@fastermail.com]
To: ...

FROM: ABDULLAHI MOHAMMED

Attn:PRESIDENT/CEO
Dear Sir,

It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in the
context below. I am ABDULLAHI MOHAMMED, a Close Confidant and Personal
Assistant to Mrs.Maryam Abacha,the wife of the former Nigerian Head of
State,Late General Sani Abacha, whose sudden death occurred on 8th of
June, 1998. 

I got to know of you in my private search for a reliable
Personality/Company to handle a confidential transaction. I have no
doubt about your capacity and goodwill to assist the family in receiving
into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$46.8M(forty-six million,
eight hundred thousand U.S dollars)willed
and deposited in the family's favor by the Late Head of State. 

The money is currently being kept in a Trust Deposit Account with a
Finance & Security Company here in Africa. As it is legally required,
the administration of the Late Head of State is under the authority
of the family's lawyer named(BAR.TUNDE LAWAL). 

However, the new Democratic Government has on assumption of office setup
a panel of inquiry to probe the financial activities of the Late Former
Head of State with a decision to freeze all his assets. The
investigative team has submitted their report. 

Presently, some cash and assets have been frozen and seized. But
fortunately, the family Lawyer had secretly protected the Personal Will
of the Late Head of State from the notice of the investigators and have
strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an
overseas account of a trusted foreign peronality without delay, for
security reasons. 

The Government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all the
family members, and seized all known Local and International outfits of
their business empire. 

The eldest son(MOHAMMED ABACHA) is presently in prison custody being
tried for a crime he is did not commit. 

The situation has been so terrible that the family is virtually living
on the assistance of well wishers. 

In view of this plight,therefore, I expect you to be trustworthy and
kind enough to respond to this call(S.O.S) to save the family from a
hopeless future. 

The family has hereby agreed to compensate you with 25% of the total sum
for your sincere and candid effort in this regard, when the fund is
finally received into your bank account. The Attorney has
perfected arrangements with the manners to effect complete dislodgment
of this money within a week of the receipt of your response through his
email address below. 

They have equally guaranteed 100% risk free and smooth transfer.
Please all contacts must be made through the family Lawyer TUNDE LAWAL
via the e-mail:
tundelawal234@hotmail.com

I look forward to your quick response, may God bless you. 

Note that the main assistance is after the money has been transferred in
your account. You are also going to assist the family in investing the
money in your country and supervise the total investment over
there.
For security reasons all Other information will reach you through the
family lawyer.


Best Regards. 
Mr.ABDUL MOHAMMED

AFRICAN LIQUIFIED NATURAL GAS
#127,SANUSI FAFUNWA STREET,
REPUBLIC OF BENIN.
 
 


Attn: President/Ceo

Dear Sir/Madam,

I Dr. Robert Klen, the Director of Finance 
Liquefied Natural Gas Limited (NLNG) here by solicit
for your co-operation as follows: -

South Africa L.N.G Ltd was incorporated on May 17, 1989 to harness
Republic of Benin vast Natural Gas Resources for domestic use and Export
Market.

In 1995, a Final Investment Decision (FID) was signed
by the Shareholders, African Natural Petroleum
Corporation (ANPC), Shell Gas Bv, Cleag Limited (ELF)
and AGIP international Bv to build an LNG plant in
Bonny Islands of Rivers State in Benin.

In the fourth Quarter of 1995, a consortium of
Engineering firms, Technip, Snamprogetti, M. W. Kellog
and Japan Gas Corporation (TSKJ) was awarded a
contract for the construction of the Gas Plant, The
Gas Transmission System and The Residential Quarters.
Note, in the process of the negotiations and
verification of the documents for the award of the
contract, we provided an official clause which created
the existence of a sub-contractor category for the
contract.

Furthermore, because of our interest in the faith of
the unseen sub-contractor, we used our top-management
Positions to increase the total contract sum by
US$28.4M. Meanwhile the project has been completed and Commissioned and
the plant has commenced export of Natural liquefied gas to Spain, Italy,
etc. While the Contractors have been paid leaving an outstanding sum of
US$28.4M unpaid to the sub contractor. 

Now due to our resolve to transfer the outstanding sum
to foreign account, we therefore feel obliged to
contact you for assistance in achieving our objective.
To transact this business with us you are to provide
the following: 

(a) Name of your company, address, private and
Official telephone and fax numbers. 

(b) Your bank details, account number, account name,
Swift code, etc. 

Note, the fund will be shared in the below ratios: 60%
to be released to us, 35% to be retained by you while
5% is to cover all expenses incurred by both parties
in the course of the transaction. 

Finally, be rest assured that all necessary risk have
been eliminated by us and the transaction is going to
be carried on legally. Confidentiality is very
important in this transaction. For now, all replies
must be by email. 

I expect your prompt response.

Best regards
Dr. Robert Klen
Director of Finance NLNG

Subject: PLEASE CONTACT ME


Dear Sir,

 I am Tony Ibada, Bank Manager of ORIENT BANK OF
NIGERIA, Lagos Branch. 
 I have urgent and very confidential business proposition  for you. On
June 6 1997, an American oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time
(Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months, valued at US$8,000,000.00
(Twenty-five Million ollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a
routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. 
 After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.
Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation,
I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his
next of kin were fruitless. 
I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin in all his official
documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork. This sum of
US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will
come forward to claim it.  According to the Nigerian Law, at the
expiration 
of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the
Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Consequently,
my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the
next of kin to Mr.Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor
will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials. 
 This is simple, I will like you to provide me immediately with your
full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary
documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of
kin. We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and
notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter
of probate/administration in your favor the transfer. A bank account in
any part of the  world, which you provide, will then facilitate the
transfer of this 
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into
your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.

 There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will
be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees
the 
successful execution of this transaction. 
 If you are interested, please reply immediately via the private email
address below. Upon your response, I 
shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand. Please observe utmost
confidentiality, and rest assured 
that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I
shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. 
 Awaiting your urgent reply via email.

Thanks and regards

 Tony Ibada

Business Proposal/Partnership Investment
Dear Sir,
   

    I received encouraging information about you and
how trust worhty you are. I am delighted with such a
useful information. I am interested in the partnership
investment program with your corporation. First permit
me to introduce myself as Governor John Obi of the
Western Sahara State in the Democratic Republic of
Sahara. Being the chief executive and the Governor of
my State. I awarded the contract of IRRIGATION to
Portuguese Firm worthseveral millions of dollars. In
the execution of that project the Portuguese Firm
discovered large amount of gold inone of the contract
site. I collaborated with thePortuguese Firm on a
mutualagreement on the proceed of which I have
received my share of $65.000,000 =(sixty five million
dollars).  As the Governor of the State, I cannot
introduce or circulate this funds into the Sahara
banking system considering my  provisional duty and
the considering the fact that I earn less than
$1,000US dollars monthly coupled with the Bureau of
conduct guidelinesand regulations for Public Civil
Servants.

The above situation prompted my  decision to solicit
your co-operation to take delivery of this funds into
your custody for my proposed investment as you will be
adequately compensated with $15 000,000 USdollars. I
will arrange all necessary procedures in ensuring a
smooth process for the funds to get to you. I will
appreciate you contact me once you receive this mail
via my e-mail account indicating your capability and
willingness to enable me to give you more details of
my modus operandi of getting this  money to you hitch
free. This matter requires your urgent attention and
confidentiality whatever your decision.
Best Regards,
Governor John Obi

Dear Sir,

need your help. Late Gen. 
Sanni Abacha,ex-military Head of State (Federal
Republic of Nigeria) was my 
husband that died of heart problem. Since the death of
my husband, I have been 
subjected to all sorts of harassments, intimidations
and inhumane treatments, 
with negative reports emanating from the government
and the press regarding my 
husband's past military regime and my eldest son
Mohammed is being held.
   Most of our trusted Associates betrayed us because
of Ministerial Jobs and 
appointments. I need your immediate help, I beg of
you.
 I need your help to transfer what I call "our future
 hope" the sum of Thirty Million United State
 Dollars (US30,000,000) from my late husband's
private vault which he deposited into a security firm
before his death. 
 The last transfer of Ten Million United State
 Dollars (US$10,000,000) I made into a friend'sforeign
 account at Europe, after the successful transfer, my
 friend denied me my money because of my restricted
 movement within Nigeria. That is the main point why I
 need your help. I lost so much trying to make
transfer through some associates.
 This fund is considered as the main source of my
 family's future hope. When this US$30 Million dollars
 is transferred, my family attorney BARR.GEORGE ADAMSwho is also  my

The Palace of King of Ogoni Kingdom,
Ogoni Oil producing community,
Rivers State Nigeria.

Dear Sir, 

I am Princess Vivian Onyekwere, daughter of Chief Oti Onyekwere, the king
of Ogoni Kingdom.  I am 25 years old and a graduate of Mass Communication.

My father was the king of Ogoni Kingdom the highest oil producing area in
Nigeria.  He was in charge of reviving royalties from the multi-national
oil companies and government on behalf of the oil producing communities in
Nigeria.  After the hanging of the Ogoni Nine(9) including Ken Saro Wiwa
by the late dictator General Sani Abacha, my father suffered stroke and
died in August27th last year.  But before his death, he called me and told
me he has Twenty Three Million Five Hundred and Sixty Thousand Dollars
(USD23,560,000.00) cash in his possession, specially deposited in a
Security vault company here.

He advised me not to tell anybody except my mother who is the last wife of
the (8) eight wives that he married.  My mother did not bear any male
child for him.  Which implies that all my father^Òs properties, companies
e.t.c., we have no share in them because my mother has no male child
according to African Tradition.  My father therefore secretly gave me all
the relevant documents of the said money, and told me that I should use
this money with my mother and my younger sisters because he knows that
tradtionally, if he dies we cannnot get anything, as inheritance.

He importantly advised me that I should seek foreign assistannce and that
I should not invest this money here in Nigeria because of his other wives
and male children who happen to be my elders.  I am soliciting for your
immediate assistance to get a Bungalow for us, where I will live with my
mother and two younger sisters and further advise me where and how I will
invest the balance money overseas, possibly on products of your company
and other profitable ventures.

I believe that by the special grace of God, you will help us move this
money out of Nigeria to any country of your choice where we can invest
this money judiciously with you.  You are entitled to a reasonable part of
this money based on our agreement, and God will bless you as you help us.

PLease reply through my e-mail Looking forward to hear from you as soon as
possible.

Remain blessed.

Princess Vivian Onyekwere.

to receive the said fund on our behalf into a reliable company/individual
account depending on your convenience. More so, we are handicapped in the
circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not
allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole
transaction.
]
] This amount (US$27.1m) represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we
the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost
have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune
of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by
Key Tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank account you will
provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former
contractor to you.

] I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30%
of the US$27.1 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous
expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat
it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialisation
is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.

] I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint
me. Endeavour to contact me immediately through my secured email
address:nelsonmasele@dbzmail.comcomwhether or not you are interested in this
deal. If you are not, it will enable me contact other Foreign partner with
recommendation to carry out this deal.

] I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make
the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong
assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember
to treat this matter as very confidential matter; because we will not
comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government
Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this
business.

Attn: THE PRESIDENT

Sir,

       RE: MONEY TRANSFER / INVESTMENT PROPOSAL

INTRODUCTION: l am Dr Chyke Aku a Civil Servant in
the Ministry of Health. l know this proposal will come
to you as a surprise because we have not met before
either physically or through correspondence.
I got your contact from our chamber of commerce here
in Nigeria and have no doubt in your ability to handle
this proposal involving huge sum of money.

THE SUBJECT: My father ALHAJI IDRIS AKU(Now Late)
was the Royal Head of my community, ELEME (an oil rich
town) in Nigeria. My community produces 5.8% of the
total crude oil production in Nigeria and 0.5% of the
Dollar value of each barrel is paid to my father as
royalty by the Federal Government. My father was also
the Chairman of ELEME Special Oil Trust Fund.
In his position as the Royal head and Chairman of the
Oil Trust Fund, he made some money which he left for
me as the only heir to inherit.The money is Sixty
Five Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars($65.5m).
This Money originated from the accumulated royalties
between 1976-1998 .

Due to poor banking system in Nigeria and political
instability as a result of past Military rules
(1985-1999) , he deposited this Money in a VAULTS
" with an open beneficiary to a security company
 pending when he would finish arrangement to
transfer it abroad. He was planning this when he
suddenly died late last year of Heart Attack.

THE PROPOSAL: Just before my father died he called my
attention to the money and charged me to look for a
foreigner who would assist me in the
transfer/investment of the funds abroad. So l would be
very grateful if you could accept to help me achieve
this great objective. I promise to give you 20% of the
total funds transferred to your vital bank account as
compensation for your assistance. Five percent
(5%)would be set aside to take care of all expenses we
may incure during the transaction. To indicate your
interest, contact me urgently and confidentially
for more information and the roles you will play in
this business. All the legal Documents concerning this
Money will be sent to you as soon as we agreed
together. Send your reply through this box please.
May the almighty God bless you.

Yours faithfully

FRED THAMBO

TEL: 27-7222-811-30

ATTN: 

I know you will be surprised to receive this business
proposal. First, I must introduce myself. I am fred
thambo from the Diamond-rich 
district of Kono, Sierra Leone, and my father was the
former Special adviser to the ousted Head of State of
Sierra Leone, Major Paul Koroma.

During the war between our forces led by the ex-Head
of State, Major Jonny Koroma and the West Africa
Allied Forces (ECOMOG), my country relied heavily on
the foreign earnings generated from diamond trade. 
 This money was personally kept by then President,
Major Johnny Paul Koroma since our banking system had
collapsed during the war.

However, as the war progressed, it became apparent
that we were going to looise the war to the superior
and better armed West African Allied Forces (ECOMOG).
At this point, the key officers of the administration
started making frantic efforts on how to leave Sierra 
Leone safely thereby sharing the proceeds/money from
this diamond trade. In view of the fact that my father
was one of the key officers of the administration and
a brother-in-law to Major Paul Koroma, he succeeded in
getting the sum of US$22 Million (Twenty-two Million
United States Dollars).

We made agrement and transferred the money through
diplomatic means to South Africa, where I am presently
residing in exile as asylum seeker but unfortunately,
my father died of heart attack after a 
few months of exile in South Africa and automatically,
I became in total control of the said money as the
first child. Upon our arrival in South Africa after
due consideration, we deposited the money with a
Security Company for the security reasons. The actuasl

content was not disclosed to them (Security company)
pending when we see a trustworthy person such as
yourself who will assist us in transferring this money
to his account outside South Africa, as the strict
monetary laws here do not allow asylum seekers certain
financial rights.

I shall be most grateful if you can assist
meaccomplish this transaction and hoping too that you
will remain trustworthy. For your efforts 
and assistance, I have agreed to give you 20% of the
total sum while 5% will be aside for all the expenses
incurred in the course of this transaction. The rest
of the 75% will be for my family investment in your
country.

Please note that this transaction is 100% Risk-Free,
for I have made arrangements for a successful deal. As
such, the only thing I ask from you is total
assistance to transfer this money, complete 
trust and assurance that my own part of money will be
safe when transferred to your account. I wish you
would keep this proposal highly confidential and
secret, considering my father's position 
before his death and source of the money. If you are
interested in assisting me, kindly call or send email
through those numbers above.

Thanking you in anticipation for your usual
co-operation.

Best regards.


FRED THAMBO

Attention: 

Sir,

I am MR.KOFFI  HANIS son of late General HANIS KOFFI
the Chief of Defence staff of Guinea Bissau who was
assassinated late last year in a bloody
encounter.Before the death of my father he deposited
the sum of US$16m(sixteen million u.s dollars) with
one Security-Company in Lome-Togo in a box for safe
keeping and declared it as a family jewelries and
antiques belonging to a foreign business partner to
avoid the security company raising eyebrows over
it.This fund and some more were earlier approved by
the Government of my country for the purchase of arms
from France through the son of former head of state of
France ex-President François Mitterand for executing
and controlling the rebels incursions into Guinea from
Sierra Leon and Liberian Boarders. 
It was after the hasty burial of my father under
military accolade that I discovered a Certificate of
Deposit in my father's underground safe issued to him
by the Security-Company Lome-Togo. And when I showed
it to my mother, she decided that we should
immediately sneak away to Lome-Togo to confirm the
deposits and get this money out of Africa in other not
to be exposed and loose the money.
I hereby seek for your kind assistance by acting as my
father!s foreign business partner so that I will
forward your personal informations to the security
company as the beneficiary of the consignment and you
will come down here in LOME-TOGO to sign for the
release of the consignment.
The informations i need from you are:
1.Your complete name and address.
2.Your telephone and fax number.
After the approval by the security company i will then
send the deposite certificate to you then we shall
arrange your coming .Meanwhile my mother and I have
agreed to give you a certain percentage which is
negotiable if you agree to assist us in this
transaction.
Please handle this matter with absolute secrecy as the
safety of the fund and our life depends on this. 

I wish to hear your urgent response.

Thanks, 

Best Regards 

MR.KOFFI   HANIS.

I want you to kindly take time and read this letter 
and please do not be alarmed by its content as it is 
only being communicated to you in confidence. 
 
I am Mr Ken Agu, deputy director of accounts in the
office of the Accountant General of the Federation
Federal Republic of Nigeria and it was during my
search for a trustworthy and capable foreigner whom I
will do an urgent business venture with that I went to
the commercial section of your embassy here in Nigeria
to get your contact. 
 
Now the business: at the end of every fiscal year my 
office the office of the Accountant General of the 
Federation audits the account of all the parastatals 
in my country. It was during the last audit that we 
discovered that there is this particular money that 
keeps re-appearing and it has been appearing like that

in the last two years now. So my colleagues and myself

have discovered that the money accrued from an over 
estimated contract executed in one of the government 
ministries and we have agreed to acquire this money 
for our own personal purposes and mutual benefits. 
 
This money is about fifteen million united states 
dollars (US$15M) and we cannot lay our hands on it 
without the assistance and help of a foreigner who we 
will front as the bonafide beneficiary of the money 
hence my contact. 
 
We hereby crave your indulgence and permission to 
remit this money into your company or personal bank 
account for mutual sharing because we have agreed here

to adequately compensate you with five million united

states dollars (US$5M) for your co-operation and 
assistance while the remaining ten million united 
states dollars (US$10M) goes to me and my colleagues. 
 
Note that this transaction is risk free but requires 
utmost confidentiality. Therefore, if this offer 
appeals to you, let us know urgently by sending me a 
mail to enable me tell you the necessary follow-ups. 
But if it doesn^Òt, kindly notify me immediately to 
enable us start making alternative arrangement. 
 
Meanwhile, we collectively plead with you to help us 
keep this proposal as a top secret to avoid exposure 
of any kind due to our sensitive positions. 
 
Thanking you in anticipation that this will be the 
beginning of a lasting relationship. 
 
Yours truly, 
 
Mr  Ken Agu.

From the Desk of
Mr. Kenneth Uba

Union Bank of Nigeria,

Lagos-Nigeria.


STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Dear Sir,

I am Mr. Kenneth Uba, the manager bills and exchange
at the Foreign Remittance Department of the Union Bank of
Nigeria Plc.

I am writing this letter to ask for your support and
cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my
department.

We discovered an abandoned sum of $31,000,000.00 (Thirty One
million United States Dollars only) in an account that belongs
to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire
family of a wife and two children in November 1997 in a Plane
crash.



Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his
next-of-kin to come over and put claims for his money as the
heir, because we cannot release the fund from his account unless
someone applies for claim as
the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking
guidelines.
Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative
has ever appeared to claim the said fund.

Upon this discovery, I and other officials in my department have
agreed to make business with you and release the total amount
into your account as the heir of the fund since no one came for
it or discovered he maintained account with our bank, otherwise
the fund will be returned to the bank's treasury as unclaimed
fund.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus;

20 % for you as foreign partner, 75 % for us the officials in my
department and 5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign
expenses incurred by us and you during the course of this
business.


Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one of my
colleagues will come to your country and mind our share. It is
from our 75 % we intend to import Agricultural machineries into
my country as a way of recycling the fund.

To commence this transaction, we require you to immediately
indicate your interest by a return e-mail and enclose your
private contact telephone number, fax number full name and
address and your designated
bank coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the
appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the
transfer can be made.

Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
because of its nature.

I look forward to receiving your prompt response.



Mr. Kenneth Uba

Union Bank of Nigeria.

person like you to proceed to the place of the 
security company in order to clear the fund and 
afterwards,i will come to your country for us to start 
a joint business venture as i do not have the 
intention of bringing the funds back to africa for a 
very long time. 
Note that I will send to you the relevant documents 
that will enable you take possession of the fund for 
onward investment for our mutual benefit. All I need 
from you is as follows: 

 
1. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this. 
 
2. Your word that you will keep this business as confidential as
possible 
at 
all times until we 
conclude this business. 

3. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.

will disclose to you the name and the country of the 
security company. i will also forward to you the 
contact of the diplomat that i have hired to assist us 
in this business.i will also forward your name and 
particulars to the security company to enable them 
contact you accordingly. As we make progress,i will 
also send to you a 
LETTER OF AUTHORITY and AGREEMENT LETTER to enable you 
clear the fund on my 
behalf. Note that this is a very safe transaction as

Attn:Managing  Director/CEO
    DEAR Sir/Ma,
   
I am the first son of the late Mobutu Sese Seko,the former President of
the Congo Republic. I am presently under protective custody in Nigeria as
a political refugee. I got your contact during my search for a stranger
that can cooperate with me in this mutual transaction.

I want you to note that this business will benefit both of us.However,you
must confirm your ability to handle this because it involves a large
amount of money. The money (50 million US DOLLARS is my share of my
father's estate. I boxed and shipped the money to a security company
abroad at the peak of the war/political crisis that rocked my country few
years ago. Now the crisis has ended and I need a trustworthy person like
you to proceed to the place of the security company in order to clear the
fund and invest on my behalf as I dont want my name to be used for now.

Note that I will send to you the relevant documents that will enable you
take possesion of the the fund for onward investment for our mutual
benefit. All I need from you is as follows:

 1.  A letter of committment (duely signed)   that you will keep the
 transaction strictly confidential.
 2.  Your confirmation of  your ability to handle this.
 3.  Your international passport or driving licence number for
 identification to the security company.
 4.   Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.
 5.   Your full permanent address.

 As soon as I get the above information from you, I will disclose to you
the name and the country of the security company. I will forward your name
and particulars to the security company to enable them contact you
accordingly. I will also send to you a LETTER OF AUTHORITY to enable you
clear the fund on my behalf. Note that this is a very safe transaction as
this money is my share of my father's estate.

 I am waiting for your response to enable us proceed.

 Regards,

 Nzanga Raymond Seko Mobutu

Attention: 

Dear Sir, 

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by 
the virtue of its nature as been utterly CONFIDENTIAL AND TOP SECRET. 
Though, I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one 
very apprehensive, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the 
end of the day since there is no security implications attached to 
same. 

I am john henry, a Branch Manager with the Standard Bank 
Braamfontein 
Branch, Johannesburg; I came to know of you in my private search for 
a reliable and reputable person who could handle this 
transaction which involves the transfer and holding of a huge sum of 
money into a foreign bank account requiring maximum confidence. 

The Proposition: A foreigner, Late Engineer Johnson G. Fletcher; a Gold 
merchant/Contractor with the Government of South Africa,until his death 
four years ago in an air crash, banked with us at Standard Bank, and 
had a closing balance of USD25,352,249.00 (Twenty five Million, Three 
Hundred and Fifty Two Thousand, Two Hundred and Forty-Nine U.S. 
Dollars)

available 
next-of-kin of the late beneficiary or alternatively to be donated to 
the discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at the Military War 
College and as per the monetary policies, rules and regulations of the 
South Africa Government. 

All the efforts so far made by my bank with regards to locating any of 
the Engr. Fletcher^Òs next-of-kin (he has no known wife or children) 
have 
proved abortive. To this effect therefore, I and my trusted colleagues 
now seek your permission to have your stand as the next-of-kin to the 
late Engr. M.G. Fletcher so that the fund would be released and paid 
into your nominated bank account. 

All the documents and proves to the realization of this objective will 
be carefully and assiduously worked out and moreso we are assuring you 
of hundred percent risk free involvement. 

We have unanimously agreed that you should have 15% of the total sum 
for your involvement and 5% will be set aside for reimbursement to both 
parties for any incidental expenses that may be incurred in the course 
of the transfer while the remaining 80% will be for I and my colleagues 
investment purposes in your country or any other viable alternative. 

If this proposal is acceptable to you and you do not wish to take undue 
advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on, kindly get back to me as 
a matter of urgency via . 

Further details as per the due processes, procedures and contractual 
agreement will be made know to you on hearing from you.

Good Day,

I hope this mail meets you in good time. My proposal to you will be very
surprising, as we have not had any Personal contact. However, I sincerely
seek your confidence in this transaction, which I propose to you as a man
of intergrity.

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is
Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Jonas
Malheiro Savimbi, the leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola). I got your email address from a directory, in my
search for a partner for this transaction, hence this letter.

You may know that my Uncle was recently killed in a battle with the
government troops of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd
February 2002. After my Uncle's death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his
second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, and UNITA was in a
state of turmoil. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbyed to depose
him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who
saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill
me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrlable when Mr. Dembo
died 10days after my Uncle died. Being a young man who desires a peaceful
life, I am no more interested in conflicts and wars, this is why I
secretly left Angola and came here (The Netherlands) to seek political
asylum.

I am sincerely seeking for your highly needed assistance in respect to
safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales.
This money (US$18.5million), was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss
Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad,
and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in
Amsterdam, Netherlands when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death
occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment
containing the money pending on further instrutions from me.

As a matter of fact, this is the reason I chose to come to The Netherlands
to seek for political asylum. It is very clear with the way things are
now, that President Dos Santos will lobby the International Community to
freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, since he
has already done this in Angola.

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that
you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you
is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to
lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated
with utmost secrecy.

The help I need from you is clearing the box containing the money which is
deposited in my name, from the security company, after which, the money
will transfered to your account preferably a new account you should open
for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when
my asylum application is granted, and I have permission to do business and
open an account here.

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of
the money. We shall use 5%($925,000) to carry out every expenses that we
come across at any time. The remainder of the 5% shall be given to a
Charity Organisation.

I have with me, the Certificate of Depositfor the consignment, which will
be used for claim from the security company. Also, everything will be
legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction
should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me
achieve this goal.

Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This
will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on
your part.

Sincerely,
O.C.Savimbi.

Subject: TOP OF THE DAY TO YOU.

Dear Friend,

First I will like you to take your time to go over this
mail carefully and with patience. Please, this is a matter
of urgency, this is because I need your help and I need it
very quickly too.

At this stage I will like to introduce my self. I am
Dr.Ivan Idodo. I am 52 years old, a Nigerian.Today I am
formally retired as the personal accountant to the late
head of state of this country Late General. Sani Abacha.
Since his demise things have never been the same for us
who served under his regime. I cannot leave the country for
now because the present government is still investigating
huge amounts of funds embezzled by the Late Head of State
and remains hostile to his family and properties.

Shortly before his death the General gave me a very huge
amount of money to be transfered to an off-shore Security
company abroad and this I did with the help of his eldest
son who is presently being held in detention for human
rights violations. You can check the internet to confirm
these facts. In any case the funds was successfully
transfered and it is currently in a safe deposit abroad.
All the papers to legally claim the funds is with my
attorney for security porposes and the amount involved in
this transfer is US$21,320,000.00 (Twenty One Million,
Three Hundred and Twenty Thousand U.S. Dollars).

The present government of my country has so far recovered
most of the funds transfered by the Late General but they
do not and will not have access to
this one. This is because the funds is not in a bank like
the others already recovered but rather, in a security
company and all documents relating to it's
existence completely unknown except by me.

I have thought about this and I have decided to invest this
funds abroad, preferably in your beautiful country and
later settle with my family there when all this is over.
However, for now I sincerly want your help in the area of
investment opportunities in your country in Research, Real
estate and properties, computers and other things that
will bring real returns for my investment worth.

Please, can you help me by recieving the funds as the
beneficiary?. There is no risk involved as the funds is
already out of Nigeria. All you need is just the papers to
put forward before the Security company and the funds will
be released to you promptly. These papers I am ready to
send to you as soon as I hear from you with personal
information about your self.

Please, be informed that you will be compensated with
US$1,300,000.00 (One Million, Three Hundred Thousand U.S
dollars) of the funds upon collection if you agree to help
me, and the rest we can put into business.

I await your urgent response. I will fill you in with more
information when I have heard from you. Please do furnish
me with your phone and fax numbers when responding.

Thanks and God bless as I look forward to your favourable
reply.

Yours sincerly,

DR.IVAN IDODO.

Dear Sir,

RE:URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP/PARTNERSHIP.


It is my great pleasure to write this letter to you.Firstly I must
solicit your utmost confidentiality in this transaction.This is by it's
virtue being utterly confidential and top secret.A member of the
NIGERIAN EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL (N.E.P.C) who was part of the Federal
Government Delegation to your country during a Trade Exhibition gave
your particulars to me.I have decided to seek a confidential operation
with you in the excecution of the business transaction described here
under for the benefit of all parties and hope that you keep it top
secret because of the nature of the business.We need your assistance to
provide us with a solution to a money transfer transaction of
US$26,400,000.00.

Source:During the last military regimes here in Nigeria,government
officials set up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were to
be paid from the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) set up by the military
regime for the purpose of financing special projects and these were
grossly over-invoiced.The present civilian government have constituted
an Interim Management Committe (IMC) with the mandate to investigate all
contracts awarded as well as carry out debt verification of all claims
that have not yet been paid with a view of settling all legitimate debts
owed by the Federal Government of Nigeria to both local and foreign
contractors before the government wind up the Trust Fund. 
We as members of this committee have identified a lot of inflated
contract funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of
Nigeria.In the meantime,the government have already made a budget
allocation for the payment of these contracts,but by virtue of our
position as civil servants and members of this panel,we cannot acquire
this fund in our names.I was delegated as a matter of trust by my
colleagues to look for an overseas partner into whose account we would
transfer the funds totalling (USD26,400,000.00) and you will be
adequately compesated with 25% of the entire sum, hence we are writing
you this mail.

The present Civilian Government is determined to pay foreign contractors
all debt owed so as to maintain an amiable relationship with both the
Foreign Governments and Non Government Finanacial Agencies and to
attract foreign investment into our economy.We have decided to include
our bills for approval with the co-operation of some officials of the
Federal Ministy of Finance (F.M.F) and the Central Bank of Nigeria
(C.B.N.).We seek your assistance in providing us with a good company
account or personal account into which we can remit this money,you will
be acting as an ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR in this deal, the fund will be paid
to you.This we can do by SWAPPING of account information and changing of
beneficiary information to apply for payment.We prepare letters of
claims and job description on your behalf,on receiption of the following
information (your banker's name and address,account number,your
telephone and fax numbers)

It is our intention therefore,while having your understanding and
co-operation to invest 70% of this funds in pulp and paper manufacturing
plant for worldwide distribution and importation of agricultural and oil
prospecting equipment to sub-western region of Africa.While the balance
5% will cater for all local and foreign expenses incurred in
facilitating the transfer of this funds.

Please contact me immediately you recieve this mail by sending me a fax
at my confidential FAX No.:234 1 7592618 or responding to this mail thus
signifying your capability and willingness to assist us.We are building
our trust on sincerity of purpose,mutual understanding and
recommendation.The business itself is 100% safe and fail proof, provided
you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality and you follow my
instructions carefully and religiously.Your line of specialization does
not matter as it cannot hinder the successful execution of this
transaction. 

Again we look forward to doing business with you and solicit your utmost
confidentiality in this transaction.Thank you for your co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

DR.OLUFEMI PIHNEIRO.

N.B. The telecommunication system in my country is very poor, please do
not be discouraged if you have difficulty in contacting me, your efforts
will be appreciated.(PLEASE,DO QUOTE REFERENCE NUMBER (OP/01) IN YOUR
RESPONSE.)

] Good day, I am Edward Mulete JR. the son of Mr. 
] STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail
] will surprise you, though we do not know, my mother Mrs. Clara
] got your contact through the International Chamber of Commerce.
] Due to the current war against white farmers in
] Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
] claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
] favor for re-election.
] 
] All white farmers were asked to
] surrender their farms to the government for
] re-distribution and infact to his political party
] members and my father though black was the treasury
] of the farmers association and a strong member of an
] opposition party that did not support the president
] idea. He then ordered his party members and the police
] under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
] down everything in the farm. They killed my
] father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
] After the death of my father, our local pastor and a
] close friend of my father handed us over will
] documents with instructions from my father that we
] should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will 

] documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
] kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
] to the company that the content is money hence it was
deposited as 
] personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as
we could

] US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for
] your assistance to help us move the fund out of
] Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
] reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban
of
] International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of
the 
] Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer
] clearance above US$1M is just a few of the
] unthinkable things he is committing in my Country.
] I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

May I briefly introduce myself. I am DANGO SAKUSHI of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (formerly Zaire) and the former aide de camp of the Late
President Laurel Kabila of blessed memory.

I am presently living in Nigeria on asylum. In case you are wondering how
I got your contact, I got your contact from a source at my country Embassy
in Nigeria.

The events of the past two to three years in my country has been very
unfortunate. The Late president Kabila successfully toppled the very
corrupt government of the Late Dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and ruled justly
and peacefully for a few months. Unfortunately, the Tutsi from Goma, the
Northern part of the country rebelled against his government and since
then my country has been at war.

I am very dedicated and committed to winning the war against the rebels
until recently when to my shock I found out that Senior Army Officers and
Government officials were stealing public funds and looting government
treasury and sending them to foreign countries. They have exploited the
war situation to bring back the lawlessness and corruption of the Mobutu
days.

After the late President Kabila was assainated in very questionable
circumstances, I knew I was in danger of losing from both ends. Due to
this development and as a way of survival, I have joined the train. I have
in my possession funds amounting to US$15.5million. In the usual manner of
conveying such funds, the money is in defaced form in a trunk box for
security reasons. It is now in the safe custody of a security company. The
company is however not aware of the real contents of the trunk box.

My problem is that the financial Law of Nigeria does not give assylum
seekers any financial rights. And because of the economic instability and
religious crisis, I have decided that it will be unwise to attempt
investing the funds here. The climate here is very unfavourable and as a
result, I have not disclosed even to my hosts anything about this fund.

Now I am seeking foreign assistance to transfer the funds overseas. If you
can assist, I am willing to give you 20% of the funds, that is
US$3.1Million. You will understand that my entire life and future depend
on this money and I shall be very grateful if you can assist me. The major
thing I demand from you is the absolute assurance that the money will be
safe and you will not sit on it when it is transfered to your account.

If you are ready to be of assistance, please contact me immediately by
e-mail, so that I can furnish you with the modalities for the transaction
and what is expected of you. I shall be most grateful if you maintain
utmost confidentiality and keep this message entirely to yourself.

Please send your response to sakushi@lycos.com. My mobile line is
234-803-3297612 we are 1hr ahead GMT (London) time.


Best Regards,

DR. DANGO SAKUSHI.

Dear Sir,

I am DR OKON PAUL  member committee of the above department

Terms of Reference

My term of reference involves the award of contracts to multinational
companies.

My office is saddled with the responsibility of contract award, screening,
categorization and prioritization of projects embarked upon by Department
of Petroleum Resources (DPR) as well as feasibility studies for selected
projects and supervising the project consultants involved. A breakdown of
the fiscal expenditure by this office as at the end of last fiscal quarter
of 2000 indicates that DPR paid out a whooping sum of US$736M(Seven
Hundred And Thirty Six Million, United States Dollars) to successful
contract beneficiaries. The DPR is now compiling beneficiaries to be paid
for the third Quarter of 2002.

The crux of this letter is that the finance/contract department of the DPR
deliberately over ^Öinvoiced the contract value of the various contracts
awarded. In the course of disbursements, this department has been able to
accumulate the sum of US$38.2M(Thirty-eight Million, two hundred Thousand
U.S Dollars) as the over-invoiced sum. This money is currently in a
suspense account of the DPR account with the Debt Reconciliation Committee
(DRC). We now seek to process the transfer of this fund officially as
contract payment to you as a foreign contractor, who will be fronting for
us as the beneficiary of the fund. In this way we can facilitate these
funds into your nominated account for possible investment abroad. We are
not allowed as a matter of government policy to operate any foreign
account to transfer this fund into.

However, for your involvement in assisting us with this transfer into your
nominated account we have evolved a sharing formula as follows:

(1) 20% for you as the foreign partner

(2) 75% for I and my colleagues

(3) 5% will be set aside to defray all incidental expenses both Locally
and Internationally during the course of this transaction.

We shall be relying on your advice as regard investment of our share in
any business in your country. Be informed that this business is genuine
and 100% safe considering the high-power government officials involved.
Send your private fax/telephone numbers. Upon your response we shall
provide you with further information on the procedures. Feel free to send
response by Fax: 234-1-7590904 / TEL: 234-1-7591519 expecting your
response urgently. All enquiries should be directed to the undersigned by
FAX OR PHONE.

Looking forward to a good business relationship with you.

Subject: IMMEDIATE CO-OPERATION REQUIRED

From the Desk of DR.ADAMU M.MODIBBO
First Bank Nig,plc
Lagos-Nigeria.

Dear Sir,
STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Although,i have not prior to this letter had any formal contact or
communication with you, however, your business contact was personally
sourced by me in my quest for a reliable Foreign Company, Investor,
Businessman, or partner to assist with an urgent business deal requiring
utmost trust and confidentiality.

I am DR.ADAMU MODIBBO, The manager, Corperate Banking(Bills and
Exchange)at the Foreign Remittance Department of the First Bank of Nigeria
Plc. I am writing this Letter to ask for your support and cooperation to
carry out this business Opportunity in my department. We discovered an
abandoned sum of $15,000,000.00 (Fifteen million United States Dollars
only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died
along with his entire Family of a wife and two children in November 1997
in a Plane crash.

Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to
come over and put claims for his money as the heir, because we cannot
release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the
next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.
Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative has ever
appeared to claim the said fund. Upon this discovery, I and other
officials in my department have agreed to make business with you and
release the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since
no one came for it or discovered he maintained account with our bank,
otherwise the fund will be returned to the banks treasury as unclaimed
fund.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus;
20 % for you as foreign partner,
75 % for us the officials in my department and
5 % for the settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred by 
us and you during the course of this business.

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one of my
colleagues will come to your country and mind our share. It is from our 75
% we intend to import Agricultural Machineries into my country as a way of
recycling the fund. To commence this transaction, we require you to
immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail and enclose your
private contact telephone number, fax number full name and address and
your designated bank Coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the
appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be
made.

Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because of
its nature.

I look forward to receiving your prompt response.

Best Regards,

DR.ADAMU M.MODIBBO

Subject: CHARITY SUPPORT PROGRAMMES


From: Mrs. Nora W. Setia
Address: # 28A Idhrisaghf Road
Kabul, Afghanistan

Dear Sir,

Greetings. I am Mrs. Nora W. Setia, a widow of Late Sheik Mohammed Setia.
My age is 48 years and I have been suffering from a protracted breast cancer
for the past 12 years. According to my doctors, I have less than six months
to live due to my deteriorating health condition, as the cancer stage is now
very critical.

My late husband was killed during the US raid against terrorism in
Afghanistan and within the period of our marriage, we couldn't produce any
child, which warranted my inheriting all his business and wealth, as he was
very wealthy before his death.

Following the doctors advise that I have a short period of time to live, I
decided to 'will' (donate) all my inherited wealth to the charity support
programmes such as contributing to the development of the less privileged
ones, war affected victims by supplying relief, food, medications, building
schools and hospitals.

The amount involved for these programmes is US$19,000,000.00 (Nineteen
Million United States Dollars Only).

Please, I want you to note that my late husband deposited these funds in
the trustee suspense account in one of the leading international Banks in
West Africa and upon my instruction, the appointed attorney, who is
presently in Africa will file in an application for the transfer of the
money from the trustee suspense account to your designated bank account to
achieve this purpose after initiating a certificate of change of ownership
in your name as the accredited beneficiary.

Lastly, my interest is to receive grace and favour for my spirit to be
accepted in the bossom of God.

Meanwhile, this is a matter of conscience before you and God as I am no
longer there to monitor the project.

Awaiting your urgent response to enable me give you the particulars of the
attorney and the related documents of the deposited funds for your immediate
contact before things get out of hand, including your phone and fax numbers.

Best regards,

Mrs. Nora W. Setia

                  CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know
me personally. The purpose of my introduction is that I am Johnson Mowete
the first son of Frank Mowete ,a farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently
murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through
network online hence decided to write you.

Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit
the sum of US8.5 million (Eight million, Five Hundred thousand United
States dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the
looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones
to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for
the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment
of new farms in Swaziland.

This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert Mugabe
introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers
and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob
action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In
fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which
my father was one of the victims.

It is against this background that, I and my family fled Zimbabwe for fear
of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands where we are
seeking political asylum and moreso have decided to transfer my father^Òs
money to a more reliable foreign account. since the law of Netherlands
prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be
involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of
Netherlands, As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the
responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could
be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on
taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be
playing along with them.

I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South
Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future, both
countries have similar political history. As a businessman,I am seeking
for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his
hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you
accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make
an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment(funds)
from their afiliate office here in the Netherlands as i have already given
directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South
Africa.But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like
change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money I
intend to use for investment.

I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain
percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction.
Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable
investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want,
feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all
kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction.If you do
not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 10% of the money while
the remaining 85% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me
with the above telephone number and through my private E-mail address
(mjohnson121@lycos.com), while I implore you to maintain the absolute
secrecy required in this transaction.

Thanks, GOD BLESS YOU

Yours Faithfully
Johnson Mowete

  (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}
 ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas
account($126,000.000.00 USD) One hundred and twenty
six million United States Dollars) from a Prime Bank
in Africa, I want to ask you to  quietly  look for a
reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit
to provide either an existing bank account or to set
up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money,

I am MR.JAMES BONS NZEH,the Auditor General of one of
the prime banks here in South Africa, during the
course of our auditing,I discovered a floating fund
in an account opened in the bank in 1990 and since
1993 nobody has operated on this account again, after
going through some old files in the records I
discovered that the owner of the account died without
a [heir]  hence  the money is floating and  if I do
not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited
for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Gordon
G. Scott, a foreigner, and an industrialist, and  he
died,  since 1993. and  no other person knows about
this account or any thing concerning it, the account
has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved
to me as well that Gordon G. Scott until his death was
the manager Diamond Safari [pty]. SA.

without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest
amount to your account.

The amount involved is (USD 126 M) One hundred and
twenty six million United States Dollars only. I want
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty six million
United States Dollar] from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I
don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you
as a foreigner because this money can not be approved
to a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or
drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money is
in US dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr.
Gordon G. Scott is a foreigner too,and the money can
only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind
us together. I got your contact address  from the

the account to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence
and to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together before transferring the money to any account
of your choice where the fund will be safe.Before we
fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine,
Because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you are
capable and will meet up with instruction of a key
bank official who is deeply involved with me in this
business. I need your strong assurance that you will
never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's

money going into the account. I will apply for annual
leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you
are ready to act and receive this fund in your
account. I will use my position and influence to
obtain all legal approvals for  onward transfer of
this money to your account with appropriate clearance
from  the relevant  ministries and foreign exchange
departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while

Dear Sir,

I am Giwa Amu, Manager of Zenith Bank,Lagos, Nigeria.

On June 6, 1997, a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation, Mr.Barry Kelly made a numbered time
(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$26,500,000.00,
(Twenty-six Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my branch.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but
got no reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further
investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all
attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly
did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$26,500,000.00 has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security
company for safe keeping.

No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at
the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership
of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand
in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two
trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the
boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export. I am
writing you because I as a public servant (Manager with the bank), i
cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.

I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so
you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. This is
simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address
so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put
you in place as the as the owner of the boxes.

The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and
30% for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction.

If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email address Upon
your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that is needed in this transaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.(Buying of
properties like houses, hotels etc)

Please do send me your private/mobile telephone fax number
so that we can have a smooth communication.

Awaiting your urgent reply.

Thanks and regards.


Dr. Giwa Amu,
Bank Manager,
Zenith Bank International Plc.

2. 20% for you as a partner/fronting for us.

3. 10% for expenses that may be incurred by both parties during the cause

This message contains confidential information and is intended only for
the individual email addressee named. If you are not the named
addressee, you should not disseminate, distribute or copy this-mail.

                              ***************************************
From Tao

I got your contact email address from a search I made on the Internet.
 I cannot contact any of my erstwhile/ father's associates because of
the on-going situation in my country and the predicament facing my family.
To have a view of this, go
to:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/special_report/1999/01/99/angola/newsid_264
000/264094.stm

I am the son of the late leader of the Movement for the Total Independence
of Angola (UNITA), Jonas Savimbi, who was killed in a fierce gun battle
with government troops loyal to Edwardo Dos Santos on the
22nd of Febuary 2002.

I am Tao Aroujo Sakaita Savimbi, the eldest son of my late father
(Jonas Savimbi). I was aware of sales of diamonds and crude oil to
 individuals and countries that clandestinely come and purchase these
products. After the PEACE ACCORD was broken, the United States of
America government abandoned my father and the United Nations (UN)
imposed sanctions on all products coming out of UNITA controlled areas.is
 the proceeds of these sales that were used by UNITA to purchase arms to
prosecute the war.


My late father, Jonas Savimbi  was able to deposit some fund in Europe
 with a Security Company that he intended to  make purchases with. I
 happen to be in possesion of documents and information of the deposit
and some others. Only my ailing Mother and one other sibling is aware of
this.

Our family's movements presently(including me) is restricted.
We are forbidden to either travel abroad or out of our localities.


You can know more about my father by checking his
profile at the URL below:

   www.kwacha.com/edoc2.htm

Presently, the US$50,000,000.00(52 million Euros)  cash my father
 transfered  to Europe before his death for some purchases he intended
to make is safe and is in a Security firm. I have the passcode and the
documents to the Security firm.
This is where I will need your help because at present i cant travel.
And I want to act fast before the government finds out
about the funds.

With this password and information and power of attorney you will be able to
proceed to
the Security firm.
But you will also  give me a guarantee first. I can get access to a
 satellite phone for communication. When you are ready I will give you the
information
needed before you can get access to the fund you will then  proceed to the
Security
company where the
funds will be given to you as payment
either installmentally or depending on the
advice of the security company.

YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS TRANSACTION IS REQUIRED.

Yours sincerely,

TAO A. SAVIMBI.

Subject: urgent assistance needed
Date: Thu, 29 Aug 2002 06:20:56 +0000
From: "Mr. Alex Dickson." [dicksonlex@consultant.com]
To: ...

Dear Sir,

Iam a consultant operating in West Africa. I represent a client who
wishes to invest US$20 million overseas. This money was made by his late
father, a politician, in his capacity as a member of a defunct contract
award commitee of the Ecowas(Economic community of west African states)
oil industry.

For this reason he cannot move the money in his name through normal
banking channels. I think the only way to succeed is to seek help from a
foreigner. I have enough diplomatic contacts to fly the money in a
diplomatic box to europe because the box will be moved under diplomatic
cover. There will be no problems with customs at the Airport.

If you agree to assist me, we would send the box to that destination in
your name, marked for your collection. A security company will clear the
box through customs and take it to their office awaiting collection. All
you have to do would be to claim the box and deposit the money in an
International Bank and then instruct the bank to wire the money to your
account in your country.My client cannot do this on his own as any bank
would suspect a Black man of owning such huge some of money.

YOUR DUTY:

1.	You shall fly down to the country where the money is to be deposited
and you shall proceed with my client to the security 	company to collect
the money.

2.	You shall pay for your flight ticket to the country and also hotel
accomodation. My client will not send you any money for 	this
expenditure.

3.	When you collect the box from the security company you and my client
shall proceed to a bank, there you will deposit the 	money in your name
and ask the bank to wire it to your account 	in your country or
elsewhere. Note that although this account 	shall be opened in your
name, my client will have to be a 	co-signatory to the account,
therefore you cannot operate this 	account without his consent.

4.	You shall assist my client in investing his money.


YOUR COMMISSION:

1.	Your commission shall be a down payment of 10% of the total sum ie
US$2 million. you shall deduct this sum before investing the 	balance
for my client.

2.	For the first two years of the investment you shall be entitled to
10% of the after tax returns on investments. Thereafter the 	terms will
be reviewed.

We shall commence this transaction immediately we receive the following
information by my E-mail: dicksonlex@africamail.com

1.	Your banker's name, address. telephone and fax numbers.

2.	The account number and name of would be beneficiary.

Reply me immediately if you want to handle this assignment. We want to
round up this business fast so the sooner you reply the better.

I await your positive response.

Regards,

Mr. Alex Dickson.

To: ...

Dear Friend
I am Mrs Adaeze Rimi, an in-law and personal
assistant to Ex-Nigerian Head of State Late Gen. Sanni
Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998. 

Sometime in 1998 beforehis death, he entrusted to me 
the sum of US$20.5M (Twenty Million, Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars) which we deposited 
with a security company which I will disclose to you 
later as a diplomatic consignment. These money was
meant for campaign for his self-succession bid. 

Unfortunately he died before actualization of his 
aspiration. This amount of $20.5M entrusted to me by 
my boss due to the trust and confidence he had on me 
is known to me and his first Son Mohammed Abacha who 
is currently under detention by the present Nigerian 
Government for excesses of his father during his 
tenure alone. 

In agreement with Mohammed Abacha, I write to solicit 
your assistance to transfer this sum of $20.5M to your

bank account for subsequent disbursement between you 
and us. We are soliciting for your assistance because 
the present Nigerian Government are freezing any bank 
account traceable to the Late ex-Head of State's 
familyand relatives. 

For your assistance, we have agreed to compensate you 
with 20% of the total sum (US$20.5M) while 80% is for 
us. The major part of our share of 80% shall be used 
for investment overseas in areas you may direct us 
after we have secured the freedom of Mr. Mohammed. 
Note that this transaction is 100% risk free as we 
have mapped out strategies for a successful 
transaction with the security company, which I will 
disclose to you later. 

Endeavor to keep this transaction absolutely secret. 
This transaction is expected to be concluded within 14
working days. If you are interested, I would want you 
to contact me immediately through my E- mail address:adezyrim@myself.com
 
Thank you for your anticipated kind understanding 
and urgent positive response. 

Best Regards, 
Mrs Adaeze Rimi

From: DAVID PEARSE(JNR) [davidpearses@ecplaza.net]
Date: Fri 8/30/2002 1:14 AM

Dear Friend

My name is DAVID PEARSE (JNR), the first son of MR GREGORY R.
PEARSE, a white farmer from Zimbabwe.My father is one of the
numerous farmers who are incarcerated/jailed for daring to
resist the forceful occupation and aquisation of our farm land
which have been farming on for four (4) decades. Due to my
fathers' resistance to this inhuman treatment by PRESIDENT
ROBERT MUGABE, our properties have been confiscated and my
mother's life and I are being threatened which prompted our
sneaking out of the country. I am presently under protective
custody in SOUTH AFRICA as a political refugee.

I got your contact over the internet during my search for a
stranger that can cooperate with me in this mutual transaction.I
took this option because my family friends and associates could
not be trusted any more since they contributed to my present
predicament by deserting us at our time of need.

I want you to note that this business will benefit both of us.
However, you must confirm your ability to handle this because it
involves a large amount of money. The money (6.1Million US
DOLLARS is my father's estate which we boxed and shipped through
a security company at the peak of the political crisis that
rocked our country earlier in the year. Now the crisis has taken
a worse dimension with the Government renewed effort at making
sure that we lose everything my father had laboured all through
his life. Also due to the sanction already imposed on MUGABE'S
GOVERNMENT by Western countries, there has been a harder drive
by Government official's to block and seize all our hard earn
funds.

Therefore, I need a trustworthy person like you to proceed to
the security company affiliate center in order to clear the fund
and invest on my behalf as I am restricted and do not have
enough fund to support my family for now.

Note that I will send to you the relevant documents that will
enable you take possesion of the the fund for onward investment
for our mutual benefit.  All I need from you is as follows:

1. A letter of committment from you.
2. Your confirmation of your ability to handle this.
3. Your telephone and fax numbers for communication.
4. Your full permanent address.

As soon as I get the above information from you, I will disclose
to you the name and the country of the security company.
I will forward your name and particulars to the security company
to enable them contact you accordingly. I will also send to you
a LETTER OF AUTHORITY to enable you clear the fund on my behalf.
Note that this is a very safe transaction as this money is
legitimate earnings of my family. 

If you are interested and willing to assist me, please contact
me on my direct tel #: 0027835191532. 

Regards,
DAVID PEARSE (JNR)

Subject: seeking for assistance

Dear,

I wish this my proposal will not come to you as a
surprise.I am Eugo Frank , a Regional Director with a
SOUTH TRUST ATLANTIC SECURITY COMPANY LIMITED with
regional Office in Lome - Togo.

We had a foreign client (name withheld) who deposited
a huge sum of money (US$25.5 million) with our company.
Eventually, this client was among the victims of EGYPT
AIR BOEING 767 FLIGHT NO.990 that crashed on the
31-10-1999 in U.S.A but, since then we have not had
anybody coming for the claims as the next of kin.

A sitaution I have monitored closely with my position
in the company. Now, having monitored this deposit and
managed it over the years before his death, and hence
nobody has shown up as the next of kin for the past
three years plus, I have removed the file to my
private volt. I now solicit for your assistance to
present you as the next of kin as every other
arrangement has been concluded by me and I am only
waiting for a foreign partner to enable me move the
fund to his account.

This does not have any risk attached to it as all the
internal documentations will be handled by me. I
therefore request you to confirm your interest by a
return message and I will furnish you with details.
Your interest will be negotiable before we commence
the operation.
My tel-no- is +228-911-8749.
I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards

Eugo Frank

Subject: Proposal:
Date: Fri, 30 Aug 2002 04:47:00 +0800
From: htukur [htukur@hknetmail.com]
To: undisclosed-recipients: ;

Dear Sir,

This letter may spring surprise to you, however the contents and the 
underlying intentions are very genuine.

I am Mr Hassan Tukur from the Republic of
Zimbabwe.
I got your contact details from the trade centre in sidney,Australia,in
my
quest for a reputable and honest partner outside.

I am the son of late Michael Tukur of Republic of
Zimbabwe,my father was one of the wealthy black
farmers, whose farms were confiscated by the
government of President Robert Mugabe.

If you are conversant with public issues,you will know that Zimbabwe has
been 
passing through a prolonged period of civil and political strife.
My father who was a frontline opposition politician was one of the
people 
killed by president Robert Mugabe because he opposed the acqusition of
white 
owned farm lands by the president.

In his life time,he was the chairman of the bulawayo farmers
association.Prior 
to his death,there was a certain sum of money $8.5millionUS Dollars to
be 
precise, which was earmarked for the purchase of arms to wage war
against the 
government forces by the
farmers.

This money was taken to a security company in Europe deposited there as
gold 
and emeralds,pending when the negotiations regarding the purchase of the
arms 
will be finalised.
Unfortunately this negotiations did not come through before my father
died.

Right now,i am the only person who has knowledge of where this money
is,and i 
am also in posession of the relevant documents relating to this deposit.

I am now in Australia as an asylum seeker with the help of some party
members 
from my place, the government of Robert Mugabe is unleashing
terror attacks on our opposition party members.
The asylum laws here do not allow asylum seekers to engage in any

Subject: Proposal:
Date: Wed, 11 Sep 2002 13:36:38 +0800
From: tuk [tuk@hknetmail.com]
To: undisclosed-recipients: ;

Dear Sir,

This letter may spring surprise to you ,however,the contents and the 
underlying intentions are very genuine.
I am Mr Hassan Tukur from the Republic of
Zimbabwe.

I got your contact from an information center,here in Australia.

I am the son of late Michael Tukur of Republic of
Zimbabwe,my father was one of the wealthy black
farmers, whose farms were confiscated by the
government of President Robert Mugabe.

If you are conversant with public issues,you will know
that Zimbabwe has been passing through a prolonged
period of civil and political strife.
My father who was a frontline opposition politician
was one of the people killed by president Robert
Mugabe because he opposed the acqusition of white
owned farm lands by the president.

In his life time,he was the chairman of the bulawayo
farmers association.Prior to his death,there was a
certain sum of money $8.5millionUS Dollars to be
precise, which was earmarked for the purchase of arms
to wage war against the government forces by the
farmers.

This money was taken to a security company in Europe deposited there as
gold 
and
emeralds,pending when the negotiations regarding the
purchase of the arms will be finalised.Unfortunately
this negotiations did not come through before my
father died.

Right now,i am the only person who has knowledge of
where this money is,and i am also in posession of the
relevant documents relating to this deposit.

I am now in Australia as an asylum seeker with the help of some

party members from my place, the government of Robert Mugabe is
unleashing
terror attacks on our opposition party members.
The asylum laws here do not allow asylum seekers to
engage in any business to the magnitude of the money i
have mentioned here.

I am asking for your assistance to help me transfer
this money in any overseas account of yours,where it
can be invested in any viable business,and part of it

sent to me so that i can leave this country.

I promise to give you 20% of this money for your
assistance ,while we will set aside 5% of the total
sum to defray costs arising from this transaction.

Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk
free.If you are in the scope to help me carry out this
transaction,kindly contact me via my email.

I look forward to your response.
Best Regards, 
Hassan Tukur.

I am BulawaMulete JR. the son of Mr. 

STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail
Will surprise you, though we do not know, my mother Mrs. Clara 
Got your contact through the International Chamber of Commerce.
Due to the current war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
Favor for re-election.

All white farmers were asked to
Surrender their farms to the government for
Re-distribution and infact to his political party
Members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
Opposition party that did not support the president
Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police
Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
Down everything in the farm. They killed my
Father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a
Close friend of my father handed us over will
Documents with instructions from my father that we
Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will 
Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is
US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for
Your assistance to help us move the fund out of
Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of
International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer
Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the
Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country.
I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.
John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was
Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family
Late last year following this ugly development to no
Avail.
Should you be interested to help us, contact me
Immediately via email for easy communication and I

the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of 
Caring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that 
This transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will 
Not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%
Of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any
Account of your choice were the incident of taxation

Share and settle there. I will a private
Phone so that our conversation can be

Dear friend,

I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu
Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this
letter. This was in confidence considering my present
circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my
husband and two of our sons Alfred and Basher out of
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Cote
d'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later
moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later
died of cancer disease.

However, due to this situation we decided to change
most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in
Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of
money coded for safe purpose because the new head of
state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement
with the Swiss government and other European countries
to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in
some european countries. Hence, my children and I
decided laying low in Africa to study the situation
till when things gets better. Like now that
president Kabila is dead and the son taking over
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in
Southern France was confiscated by the french
government, and as such I had to change my identity so
that my investment will not be traced and confiscated.

I have deposited the sum Eighteen Million United State
Dollars (US$18,000,000,00.) With a security company
for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate
your interest that you can assist us in receiving the
money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my
son (Alfred) who has the out modalities for the claim
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing
this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.
I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in
other safe and non-speculative investments as advise
by your good self.

May I at this point emphasize the high level of
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands,
and hope you will not betray the trust and
confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if
you want to assist us, my son (Alfred) shall divulge
to
you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where
the funds are currently being maintained and also
discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason
kindly furnish us your contact information,that is
your personal telephone and fax number for validation
purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the
above email address.

Yours sincerely,

Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.

Subject: Mutual Understanding




Tenders Committee

South Africa Department of

Minerals & Energy

Pretoria, South Africa.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL AND URGENT

I am Mr. John Kpama, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an
Executive Director with a South African Government ministry. I am also the
Secretary of the Tenders Committee set up by the government to look into
contracts under the Department of Minerals and Energy.

Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council
(SAEPC) who was with the government delegation to your country during a
trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to us. I was
mandated to seek your confidential co-operation in the execution of the
project I am about to describe. This project will be of great benefit to all
parties involved and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the
nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Minerals and Energy, we (me and four of my
colleagues) discovered and we have in our possession as overdue payment
bills totalling Sixteen million, two hundred and fifty thousand US dollars
(US$16.25M) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and
cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable
foreign non-company account to
receive such funds.  Moreso, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the
South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate
offshore accounts hence your relevance in the whole
transaction.

This amount US$16.25M represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of this
Department by a foreign contracting firm, which was over-invoiced
deliberately.  Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the
original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the
said amount which we have in principle gotten approval to remit by
key-tested telegraphic transfer (K.T.T.)
to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing an application
through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former
contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners to propose that SHOULD YOU BE WILLING to
assist us in
this transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the total sum, 70%
for us and the rest for taxation
and miscellaneous expenses.  The business itself is 100%-SAFE for all
involved. This is possible if on your part , you treat it with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality.  Please note that your area of specialisation
is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I wish
reposed my confidence (which the committee vetoed) in you and hope that you
will not disappoint me.  Endeavour to contact me immediately by email,
whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will
enable me scout
for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. I want to assure you
that my partners and myself are in
a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give
us a very strong assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secure.  Please remember to treat this
matter as a very confidential
matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are
still in active government
service and.

Due to the funds we borrowed to process this project to this stage, time is
of essence because of interest on borrowed funds. Also furnish me with your
contact telephone and fax number, so that I can forward to you more
information concerning the project.

I await in anticipation of your fullest cooperation.

Yours faithfully,

Mr. John Kpama

NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORITY

BUSINESS PROPOSAL


TO:THE PRESIDENT/CEO
FROM OSAS WALTER


I am making this contact with you on behalf of my
colleagues after an acceptable recommendation from an
International Business Agency.

My colleagues and I are members of the Contract Award
Committee (CAC) of the  National Electric Power
Authority (NEPA). I have been mandated by my
colleagues to look for a trustworthy company into
whose account some funds can be transferred into.We
have
in our possession instrument of payment for US$22.5M
(Twenty two million five hundred thousand U.S Dollars
only) now in a dedicated account with our apex bank
The above funds arose from the over invoicing of some
Supplies and Engeenering Works contracts which have
been executed and the contractors paid in full. The
fund is therefore free to be transferred  overseas
without any risk whatsoever.

Due to the nature of accrual of these funds, it has to
be applied for by a foreign contractor/company and   
payment can only be made into a foreign account hence
this contact is necessary to accomplish this deal.You
(or your company) shall be compensated with 25% of the
amount as the account owner, 5%  shall be used for the
reimbursement of all expenses that will be incurred by
both parties during the course of this financial
transaction.The remaining 70% is for us.

We shall require of you the following urgently by fax:
1. Name,Telephone and/or fax Numbers of Beneficiary
2. Name and full address of the Company
3. Complete particulars of the bank account where you
wish the funds to be transferred.
 This should include the account Number,  Bank
Address, the Telephone, Fax and Telex numbers of the
bank.
My colleagues and I have had some fruitful discussions
with relevant top officials of the Federal
Ministry of Finance (FMF) and they have agreed to
cooperate in the
transfer. An application for funds transfer shall be
made at the appropriate Ministries in favour of the
beneficiary (you or your company).Thereafter, your
company shall be officially regarded as having
executed the contract for the National Electric Power
Authority (NEPA) for which payment is
being made.This process make the operation legal
according to the laws of the Federal Republic of 
Nigeria.

Please treat this transaction as STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
as we are Civil Servants who would  not want any
exposure.Do not go through the International Telephone
Operator or (AT&T) when lines are busy at any time in
the course of this operation.Always dial direct.It^Òs
very difficult to get telephone access to Nigeria. So
you must persist even when the telephone says
subscriber not available or the number does not
exist.These answers are always given when there is no
access.Thanks for your anticipated cooperation.
Best Regards,

DR OSAS WALTER
Please all contact should be directed to  my
telephone, fax number and private email
osaswalter100@yahoo.com

Dear friend,

 

My proposal to you will be very surprising, as we have not had any 
personal contact. However, I sincerely seek your confidence in this 
transaction, which I propose to you as a person of transparency and caliber.
 
Let me first start by introducing myself properly to you. My name 
is Joseph Savimbi cousin and Personal Assistant of Jonas Malheiro 
Savimbi, the leader UNITA (National Union for the Total ndependence 
of Angola). I got your email address from network directory. I apologize 
if I infringed  on your privacy.

You may know that my Uncle was recently killed in a battle with 
the government troops of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on
friday 22nd February, 2002. 
 
Now Mr. Antonio Dembo who was my Uncle's second in command, has 
assumed office as leader of UNITA. In spite of this, UNITA is like 
a herd of cattle without shepherd. Prominent members like Carlos 
Morgado are still lobbying to oust him and assume office as leader 
to enrich themselves and some of them who see me as a threat to 
their ambitions, including Mr. Dembo, are planning to kill me. For 
more information check www.angola.org. 

However, I am a young man who has ambitions and I am not in any 
way interested in wars, this is why I secretly left Angola and come 
here (Netherlands) to seek political asylum

 I am sincerely seeking for your urgent help in respect to safekeeping 
of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This 
money (US$18.5million), was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss 
Bank account. It was on transit with a safe deposit company here 
in Netherlands, when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. 

As a matter of fact, this is the reason I chose to come to Netherlands 
to seek political asylum. It is very clear with the way things are 
now, that President Dos Santos will lobby the International Community 

to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, 
since he has already done this in Angola.

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential 
that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want 
to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my 
part, in order not to lose this money. Please, treat this contact 
with utmost secrecy and confidentiality for security and safety reasons.

The help I need from you is clearing the box containing the money 
from the security company, after which, it will be deposited in 
an account in your name, with my name as next of kin. The money 
shall remain in your custody till my asylum application is granted, 
and I have the permit to conduct business, then you will transfer 
the account to me. Meanwhile, the money can be invested into risk-free 
profitable ventures, and there will an agreement to protect my interest. 

I have all the documents that will enable you claim the consignment from
the security company.

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15% the money, 
and we shall use 5% to carry out every expenses that we come across, 
and the investment process. The remainder of the 5%, shall be given to
a charity of your choice.

I thank you in advance in anticipation for your assistance in enabling 
me achieve this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested 
in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in 
the event of non-interest on your part.
 

Sincerely,

J.Savimbi.

Subject: URGENT

FROM: BARRISTER MIKE OKOYE.
LAGOS - NIGERIA.
PHONE:234-80-23449381

          MY URGENT PROPOSAL/ASSISTANCE.
     I am BARRISTER MIKE OKOYE the Lawyer to MRS.
MARIAM ABACHA, the wife of the late Nigerian Head of
State General Sani Abacha who died of heart - attack
on
Monday, the 8th of June, 1998.Upon the sudden and
tragic death of her husband (General Abacha) there has
been an intensive but secret exercise by the present
civilian government to close/freeze all his bank
accounts both home and abroad as he was confirmed to
have directed a certain percentage of oil proceeds
totaling over US$ 500M(FIVE HUNDRED MILLION U. S.
DOLLARS) into private bank accounts scattered in
several countries of the world; accumulated during
his41/2years of military rule. An issue that was
already on press before his sudden death. My client,
Mrs. Mariam Abacha the mother of Mohammed Abacha (son
of the late  head of state) who is stillinconfinement!
She has been in a very serious agony and mental stress
as the entire family have virtually lost everything
including landed properties and major investments both
home and aborad. She, Mrs. Abacha, confided in me
recently that she has a special security account which
she deposited a sum of US$ 51,375,000. 00 (FIFTY ONE
MILLION, THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND
U.SDOLLARS).
This fund is lodged in a Company Security Account
Deposits (CSAD). Her fears is that my
client is one of the directors and invariably a major
shareholder in the company, there exists a possible
trace of this fund when once they finish with the
accounts/assets principally owned by her husband, the
Late Head of State himself. It is therefore on this
note that my client secretly delegated me to quickly
source a trustworthy and reliable foreigner who will
kindly help us to accommodate and safeguard this fund
into his/her account to save us from the calamities of
the present clamp down on her husband (the ex
president) bank accounts/assets all over the world.
Note that we have concluded arrangements for the
release of the aforementioned sum to your bank account
within the shortest possible time as soon as we
concluded talks. As a result of this and other higher
levels of financial transaction which I would want to
enter with you as made possible by the death of my
client husband, I am suggesting that we schedule a
meeting immediately, if possible or start the
arrangement on how to get this fund credited
intoyouraccount.
 At this juncture your account detail (fresh or old)
where the fund could be lodged should be furnished to
me urgently including your safest fax and
telephone numbers. Please include the name of
beneficiary/account number. This fund can be devisible
or delivered to any european country by the security
company, where they have offices, as an ordinary cargo
awaiting to be claimed by the beneficiary/consignee.
At the end of it all your share is 20% as service
charge but after all expenditures incurred by anybody
in the course of the transaction is deducted.
this is because we earmarked 10% to take care of such
an expenditures while the bulk remaining balancewillgo
to Mrs. Mariam Abacha.
Please endeavour to contact me immediately, whether or
not this offer is acceptable to you, so as to enable
me make other alternative contacts, on thecontrary.
I await your urgent reply while believing you do
understand the confidential nature of thistransaction.
Simply keep this to yourself for security reasons.

Sincerely yours.
BARRISTER MIKE OKOYE.

MR.UCHE, 
3/5 RIDER HAGGARD 
CLOSE, JO, BORG 
SOUTH AFRICA. 
Tel:874 - 762864167 
Fax:874 - 762864168 
(URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL) 
(RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD} 
ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS 
Dear sir, 
We want to transfer to overseas 
account($126,000.000.00 USD) One hundred and twenty 
six million nited States Dollars) from a Prime Bank in 
Africa, I want to ask you to quietly look for a 
reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit 
to provide either an existing bank account or to set 
up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, 
even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as 
long as you will remain honest to me till the end for 
this important business trusting in you and believing 
in God that you will never let me down either now or 
in future. 
I am UCHE OLI,the Auditor General of one of the prime 
banks here South Africa, during the course of our 
auditing,I discovered a floating fund in an account 
opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has 
operated on this account again, after going through 
some old files in the records I discovered that the 
owner of the account died without a [heir] hence the 
money is floating and if I do not remit this money 
out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The 
owner of this account is Mr. Gordon G. Scott, a 
foreigner, and an industrialist, and he died, since 
1993. and no other person knows about this account or 
any thing concerning it, the account has no other 
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well 
that Gordon G. Scott until his death was the manager 
Diamond Safari [pty]. SA. 
We will start the first transfer with twenty six 
million [$26,000.000] upon successful transaction 
without any disappoint from your side, we shall 
re-apply for the payment of the remaining rest 
amount to your account. 
The amount involved is (USD 126 M) One hundred and 
twenty six million United States Dollars only. I want 
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty six million 
United States Dollar] from this money into a safe 
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I 
don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you 
as a foreigner because this money can not be approved 
to a local person here, without valid international 
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any 
foreigner with valid international passport or 
drivers license and foreign a/c because the money is 
in US dollars and the former owner of the a/c Mr. 
Gordon G. Scott is a foreigner too,and the money can 
only be approved into a foreign a/c. 
However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind 
us together. I got your contact address from the 
Girl who operates my computer, I am revealing this to 
you with believe in God that you will never let me 
down in this business,you are the first and the only 
person that I am contacting for this business, so 
please reply urgently so that I will inform you the 
next step to take urgently. Send also your private 
telephone and fax number including the full details of 
the account to be used for the deposit. 
I want us to meet face to face to build confidence 
and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us 
together before transferring the money to any 
account of your choice where the fund will be safe. 
Before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing 
and investments. 
I need your full co-operation to make this work 
fine, Because the management is ready to approve 
this payment to any foreigner who has correct 
information of this account, which I 
will give to you, 
upon your positive response and once I am convinced 
that you are capable and will meet up with 
instruction of a key bank official who is deeply 
involved with me in this business. I need your strong 
assurance that you will never, never let me down. 
With my influence and the position of the bank 
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's 
reliable account which you can provide with assurance 
that this money will be intact pending our physical 
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official 
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately 
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place 
and to build confidence you can come immediately to 
discuss with me face to face after which I will make 
this remittance in your presence and three of us 
will fly to your country at least two days ahead of 
the money going into the account. I will apply for 
annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you 
that you are ready to act and receive this fund in 
your 
account. I will use my position and influence to 
obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of 
this money to your account with appropriate clearance 
from the relevant ministries and foreign exchange 
departments. 
At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 
5% will be for expenses both parties might have 
incurred during the process of transferring. 
I look forward to your earliest reply through my 
email address or tele/fax numbers. 
Yours truly 
UCHE OLI

UNION BANK OF NIGERIA. PLC 
Headquarters: 136 Marina, Lagos 

URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL 

Sir, 

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction; this is by
virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at
the end of the day. We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of
this transaction ,as we have been reliably informed of your discreetness
and ability in transaction of this nature. 

Let me start by introducing myself properly to you. I am COKER BANKOLE,
Credit Officer with Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Lagos. I came to know you
in my Private Sarch for a Reliable and Reputable Person to handle this
Confidential Transaction, which involves the transfer of huge sum of
money to a Foreign Account requiring Maximum confidence. 
THE PROPOSITION 

A foreigner, an American, Late Eng. John Creek (Snr.) An Oil Merchant
with the Federal Government of Nigeria until his death last year in
Kenya Air Bus (A310 - 300) Flight Kq430, Banked with us at Union Bank of
Nigeria Plc, Lagos and had a closing balance as at the end of September,
2000 worth US$30,000,000.00 (Thirty Million United States Dollars), the
bank now expects a next of kin as beneficiary. Valuable efforts are
being made by the Union Bank of Nigeria to get in touch with any of the
Creek's Family or Relatives but to no avail. It is because of perceived
possibility of not being able to locate any of Late Eng. John Creek
(Snr.)'s next of kin (he had no wife or children that is known to us). 

The Management under the influence of our Chairman and subsequently be
donated charity organization. In order to avert this development, some

US$30 Million will be released and paid into your account as the
beneficiary. All documents and proofs to enable you get this fund will
be carefully worked out. We have secured from the probate an order of
mandamus to locate any of the deceased beneficiaries, and more, so we
are assuring you that this business is 100% risk free involvement. Your
share stays while the rest will be for myself and my colleagues for

Sir, 
Compliments of the day, I am contacting you because of the great need
to
work with someone, who is not from this country, as regards to my
client's
present situation and specifically because you have a fixed address
or let
me say fixed responsibilities, which stands as a better form of
trust. I am
Mr.james onuoha . I am a lawyer and a very close confidant to my
client. I
have been my client's family lawyer since 1987.
 In 1994, my client's husband and his military colleagues took over
the seat
of power [government] in Nigeria from the then interim president
Chief.
Ernest Shonekan through a peaceful coup, but unfortunately most of the
African head of states did not welcome the overthrow. They were asked
to
vacate the seat of power and return it to democracy, which they
refused,
until September 1998, when their leader and then military president of
Nigeria died of some mysteriously ailments. This led them to handover
power,
to this present civilian regime who later arrested my client's
husband and
some other past and retired militay officers, and since then they
have been
on illegal detention for some year.  
Ever since my client's arrest, live has never been the same again for
his
entire family. My client's family has suffered so much political
torture in
different ways, all their properties which I helped in managing since
my
client's detention, have been sealed up and are still non functional
till
this present day. From all indications the present President of
Nigeria is
out to ruin the families of these military officers because of his
personal
vendettas which he had with them in the past. It is very clear that
President Obasanjo wants to take advantage of his seat in power to
settle
old scores. More evidence could be shown to you by referring you to
web
pages of our national dailies, later. I contacted you because; my
client's
wife, insists that I look for a reputable foreigner who she can do
business
with. Madam insist and believes that she can only trust a foreigner
with her
live, because of various disappointments, betrayals that she has
expirienced
from close friends and people she trusted, who have sabotage and
leaked out
secrets concerning their family's accounts and assets. 
 This business that I am about to discuss with you requires a very
good
sense of judgment. I have in my possession some huge amount of money
in cash
[ forex ] approximately $67.3 million in USA dollars ]which belongs to
client's family, but due to some circumstances beyond our control, it
is
completely impossible for the family to keep, or make use of this
money here
in this country. She wishes to entrust this sum of money with you or
company
for safekeeping. Madam wants you to receive and keep on her behalf,
since
she, her children and their family workers are placed under! traveling
restrictions. All of her husband's asset, bank accounts and
properties have
been confiscated. Madam needs your help to safe guard these funds in
questions until she is able to get over her present predicament. The
existence of this particular money is not known to any body else, but
we are
afraid that the government will soon find out about it and confiscate
it.
 Having in mind that the future and fate of a good number of some
innocent
people both member of the family and some family workers lie in the
safety
of these funds.As a lawyer, I have done a perfect home work, and very
concrete arrangements on how this cash [money] could be moved out of
our
this country safely and risk free. All that is needed from you is to
help to
receive and keep this money safely, since we are restricted from
leaving the
country at the moment. After that, if the family agrees, we may then
discuss
further on possible investments plans, but my client is more
concerned about
is the safety of the money first, which is their future. Complete
details of
the family and this transaction, will be revealed to you when we must
have
built up trust and opened up negotiations. This family has really
suffered
so much political torture in different ways, which is the reason why
I have
withheld these information until i gain your trust, on your
acceptance to
cooperate and assist my client, I will give you the A to Z details on
your
request. We will then discuss and negotiate on a certain percentage
share of
the money that my client wishes to pay to you for your expected
services.
Please do inform me on your stance immediately, so as to stop further
contacts. I await your immediate response. NOTE -
 Best regards,
 Mr.james onuoha . ESQ

Dear Friend,
Pardon the abruptness and the liberty of this
letter; It is due to its exigency.

I am a government functionary in my country. I write to ask for your help.

My colleagues and I are in need of a foreign partner to assist in the
transfer of a considerable amount of money. My colleagues and I have
deliberated much on the issue at hand. What we require is someone who is
reliable and trustworthy, who has a vision and who will be able to manage
whatever business in which we shall inject venture capital. We need
someone who can share our dreams and ideals.

I have the legal title to the sum and we shall go through the legal
procedures entailed in both our laws and international laws in
transferring the funds to you in trust.

Please do not at this point misunderstand my intention, because
understandably, we are not acqainted. I do not even know if you will be
reliable and trustworthy, but I believe that everything starts with a
first step. I know that I need to explain everything clearly to you before
you can come to a decision as to whether you can assist me or not, and I
will do this as soon as I get a response from you.

I am sure that with the insider information I can provide, we will with
your help, conclude the transaction within 21 working days. In
consideration for your assistance, we have agreed to give you the normal
transaction commission obtainable of 10% of the total sum, and another 5%
if you can successfully put together an investment portfolio for us, as we
will like to invest some of this money in your country, rather than leave
it idle in a bank account.

If you can be of assistance, please send a fax to 234 1 7594298 for more
information or email to:viktorojo@hotvoice.com, otherwise, I thank you for
your patience.

Thank you for your courtesies.

Best regards,
victor ojo.

FROM: ADE BENZER

ATTENTION: THE PRESIDENT/CEO 

MY GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE THIS 
LETTER MEETS YOU IN GOOD HEALTH. I AM ADE BENZER,
AIDE TO THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF 
ZAIRE NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO 
(DRC). 
I AM WRITING TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON YOUR 
PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN 
GHANA. 

I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN CONFIDENCE 
CONSIDERING MY PRSENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION AS A 
WAR REFUGEE HERE IN GHANA. FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE LATE 
PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER, I 
WAS INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF 
US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND 
LODGED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING 
DISCLOSED AS FAMILY VALUABLES IN MY NAME PENDING 
FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16 1997, 
PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE REBELS 
LED BY LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM 
KISINGANI AND FLED TO TOGO FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED 
TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1997 LESS 
THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER. HE 
WAS AGED 66 YEARS. I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO GHANA WITH 
MY SON PATRICE, AGED 17 WHERE I AM PRESENTLY RESIDING 
AS A WAR REFUGEE SHORTLY AFTER THE CAPITAL CITY 
KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER BY REBELS. I LOST MY WIFE 
AND MY TWO CHILDREN, AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS DURING THE 
REBEL ONSLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY. 

THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE 
AMASSED A PERSONAL FORTUNE OF US$8BILLION WITH HOUSES 
IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT 
PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE 
SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO 
FREEZE ALL HIS ASSETS AND CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES. I 
THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE 
SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE NOW THAT 
PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON JOSEPH 
KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER. 

I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY ABROAD 
WHERE THE MONEY IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES. 
THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM 
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO 
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY 
RECEIVING THE MONEY ON MY BEHALF. ACKNOWLEDGE THIS 
MESSAGE SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU THE MODALITIES FOR THE 
CLAIM OF THE FUNDS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE THE 
HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH THIS BUSINESS 
DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND 
CONFIDENCE WHCH I HAVE REPOSED IN YOU. 

IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST, I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE 
OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE 
CURRENTLY BEIGN MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER 
MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. I 
AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF THE 
MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTION IS CONCLUDED. 

FOR THIS REASON, KINDLY FURNISH ME YOUR CONTACT 
INFORMATION, WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX 
NUMBERS FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE 
RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS. 

YOURS SINCERELY, 

ADE BENZER

          (URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL)
 
  (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}
 ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS   
 
Dear sir,
 
We want to transfer to overseas
account($126,000.000.00 USD) One hundred and twenty
six million nited States Dollars) from a Prime Bank in
Africa, I want to ask you to  quietly  look for a
reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit
to provide either an existing bank account or to set
up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money,
even an empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as
long as you will remain honest to me till the end for
this important business trusting in you and believing 
in God that you  will never let me down either now or
in future.
 
I am MR.Kingsley Chumas,the Auditor General of one of
the prime banks here South Africa, during the course
of our
auditing,I discovered a floating fund  in an account
opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has
operated on this account again, after going through
some old files in the records I discovered that the
owner of the account died without a [heir]  hence  the
money is floating and  if I do not remit this money
out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The
owner of this account is Mr. Gordon G. Scott, a
foreigner, and an industrialist, and  he died,  since
1993. and  no other person knows about this account or
any thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that Gordon G. Scott until his death was the manager
Diamond Safari [pty]. SA.  
 
We will start the  first transfer with twenty six
million [$26,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest
amount to your account. 

The amount involved is (USD 126 M) One hundred and
twenty six million United States Dollars only. I want
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty six million
United States Dollar] from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I
don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you
as a foreigner because this money can not be approved
to a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or
drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money is
in US dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr.
Gordon G. Scott is a foreigner too,and the money can
only be approved into a foreign a/c. 
 
However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind
us together. I got your contact address  from the
Girl who operates my computer, I am revealing this to
you with believe in God that you will never let me
down in this business,you are the first and the only
person that I am contacting for this business, so
please reply urgently so that I will inform you the
next step to take urgently. Send also your private
telephone and fax number including the full details of
the account to be used for the deposit.
 
I want us to meet face to face to build confidence
and to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together before transferring the money to any
account of your choice where the fund will be safe.
Before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing
and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work
fine, Because the management is ready to approve
this payment to any foreigner who has correct
information of this account, which I 
will give to you,
upon your positive response and once I am convinced
that you are capable and will meet up with
instruction of a key bank official who is deeply
involved with me in this business. I need your strong
assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us
will fly to your country at least two days ahead of
the money going into the  account. I will apply for
annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you
that you are ready to act and receive this fund in
your
account. I will use my position and influence to
obtain all legal approvals for  onward transfer of
this money to your account with appropriate clearance
from  the relevant  ministries and foreign exchange
departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while
5% will be for expenses both parties might have
incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my
email address or tele/fax numbers.     
 
Yours truly

MR.Kingsley Chumas

Subject: REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP


From:Mr.James Ajah
Tel:234-80-23144221
Lagos-Nigeria.

Attn:President/Ceo.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL .
RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED
THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY).

I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as
we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek
for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction which is of
mutual benefit. I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria
Contract Award and Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a
foreign firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to
the tune of US$21.5M. U. S.Dollars. This was done deliberately. The
over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project.
We now want totransfer this money which is in a suspense Account with
NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to provide for us.

SHARE: -
For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you will
be entitled to 20% of the money,70% will be for me and my partners while
10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that
may be incurred by us during the course of this transfer,both locally
and international expenses. 

I would require the following: -

1. Your company's name, address, telephone and fax numbers.

The above informations would be used to make formal applications as a
matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to
your account.It does not matter whether or not your company does
contract projects of this nature described here. The assumption is that
your company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to
othercompanies. More often than not, big trading companies or firms of
unrelated fields win major contracts and subcontracts to more
specialized firms for execution of such contracts.We have strong
reliable connections and contacts at the Central Bank of Nigeria, as
well as the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no doubt that all
the money will be released and transferred if we get the necessary
foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when the business
is successfully concluded we shall through our same connections withdraw
all documents used from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100%
security.

We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in
a lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be transferred
to the overseas Accounts for us, before the present Democratic
Government starts Auditing all Federal Government owned
Parastatals.Please contact me immediately through my telephone number
whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will
enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal.But
where you are interested,send the required documents aforementioned
herein through my above email box address(jamesajah@rediffmail.com),as
time is of the essence in this business. I wait in anticipation of your
fullest co-operation.

Yours Faithfully,

Mr.James Ajah.

       VERY URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL.  

We want to transfer to overseas the sum of One hundredand Forty Two
Million United States Dollars (U.S.$142,000,000.00) from a in Africa.

I want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will
be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up
a new bank account immediately to receive this money,though an empty bank
account could serve this purposeas long as you will remain honest to me
till the end of this important business trusting in you andbelieving in
God that you will never let me down either now or in time to come.

I am Atakata,the external auditor of a Bank.During the course of our
auditing,I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in
1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account again.After going
through some old files in the records, I discovered that the owner of the
account died without a ^ÓHeir apparent to the throne^Ô hence the money is
floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be
forfeited for nothing.

The owner of this account who is Mr.Eshed.B.Willey,a foreigner and
an industrialist died, since1990,until now no other person(s) knows
about thisaccount or could give any documentary evidenceconcerning
this account. As such this account has noother beneficiary and my
investigation proved to me aswell that Eshed.B.Willey until his death

    (non-spam)

From:Mr.Alex Danbaba
Tel:234-80-23144221
Lagos-Nigeria.

Attn:President/Ceo.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL .

RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
US DOLLARS ONLY).

I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as
we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek
for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction which is of
mutual benefit.

I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and
Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC)Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in NNPC by my
Committee.

This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M. U. S.Dollars.
This was done deliberately. The over-invoicing was a deal by my committee
to benefit from the project. We now want totransfer this money which is in
a suspense Account with NNPC into any

Overseas Account which we expect you to provide for us.

SHARE: -

For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you will be
entitled to 20% of the money,70% will be for me and my partners while 10%
has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that may be
incurred by us during the course of this transfer,both locally and
international expenses.

I would require the following: -

1. Your company's name, address, telephone and fax numbers.
2. Your banker's name,address,account and routing numbers.

The above informations would be used to make formal applications as a
matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to
your account.It does not matter whether or not your company does contract
projects of this nature described here. The assumption is that your
company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to othercompanies.
More often than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields
win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms for
execution of such contracts.We have strong reliable connections and
contacts at the Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as the Federal Ministry
of Finance and we have no doubt that all the money will be released and
transferred if we get the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this
deal. Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall
through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the
concerned Government Ministries for 100% security.

We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a
lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be transferred to
the overseas Accounts for us, before the present Democratic Government
starts Auditing all Federal Government owned Parastatals.Please contact me
immediately through my telephone number whether or not you are interested
in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign
partner to carry out this deal.But where you are interested,send the
required documents aforementioned herein through my above email box
address(alexdanbaba@rediffmail.com),as time is of the essence in this
business.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours Faithfully,

Mr. Alex Danbaba.

BUSINESS ASSISTANCE

Dear Sir,

It is my humble pleasure to write you this letter,
irrespective of the fact that you do not know me.
However, I got your contact through Nigeria chamber of
commerce and industries. My name is Mr.James Okocha
Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and a close
family lawyer to our former late military ruler,
General Sani Abacha who died suddenly in power two
years ago.

Since his untimely demise the family has suffered a
lot of harassment from the regime of General
Abdulsalaam Abubakar and even this present civilian
government.  Recently, the wife was placed under house
arrest in furtherance of the policy of Vendetta being
visited on the family.  Although a lot of money has
been recovered from Mrs. Abacha since the death of her
husband by the present government, there are still
huge sums of money in foreign currencies saved with
some outside security company in Amsterdam Holland and
Mrs. Abacha has showed me documents of where the
husband deposited US$20m (twenty Million United States
Dollars) in a security vault for safe keeping.  This
money has been defaced for security reasons and also
to avoid it been spent by unauthorized persons.

Since, we have been deliberating on how to invest this
fund abroad in a confidential manner until we came to
a conclusion to use it to buy houses and part of it
will be used for safe and non-speculative investments
in your country or Lebanon. But I have chosen your
country for the investments and would also rely on
your professional advice for any safe and conducive
country to invest in.  Therefore, you are to fax me
immediately the prices of houses in cities of
(highbrow area) in your country for us to know how to
put our budget.

This money US$20Million can only be processed and
received in Europe since it has already been defaced
for security reasons.  If your conditions are good we
will prepare you as the beneficiary of the total fund
because we have the documents already with us.  The
Security Company has called me and Mrs. Abacha to do
something about claiming this consignment because of
the demurrage it is incurring and we told them we
would come and claim it very soon.

You have twenty five percent, while ten percent will
be for the expenses  incurred on both sides and sixty
five percent will be for us, if you accept to help us
with this project.  I want you to please understand
that I am involved in this issue because I am Madam
Abacha's confidant.  You are therefore to contact me
on my private email Please remember to include your
current private telephone and fax numbers.
If you keep this project secret, we will be prepared
to do more business with you.
Expecting your urgent response.

Yours faithfully,
Mr.James Okocha(Senior Advocate of Nigeria)

            REQUEST FOR AN URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

After due deliberation with my colleagues, I have decided to forward to
you this business proposal. We want a reliable person who could assist us
to transfer the sum of Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars ($20,500,000) into his / her account.

This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from contracts awarded by us
under the budget allocation to my Ministry and this bill has been approved
for payment by the concerned authorities. The contract has since been
executed, commissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the
contract. We are left with the balance US$20.5M as part of the
over-invoiced amount which we have deliberately over estimated for our own
use. But under our protocol division, civil servants are forbidden to
operate or own foreign accounts.This is why I am contacting you to be our
custodian for this fund.

As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your address
from a site in the internet that portrayed you (your establishment) in
good light. I am the Chief Accountant/Internal Auditor of the Contract
Award Committee (C.A.C.) of the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation(NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all sorts of
RISKS and TROUBLE from my Government. We the N.N.P.C. Officials involved
in this deal have put in many years in service to this Ministry. We have
been exercising patience for this opportunity for so long and to us, this
is a life time opportunity we cannot afford to miss. You need not to worry
about the responsibilities of transferring this fund into your account,
because all the administrative step needed for the transfer of this fund
into your designated bank account will be done by me. We have agreed to
COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of us.

My colleague and I will come to your country to arrange for our share,
upon the confirmation from you that the money has been credited into your
nominated bank account. Consequent upon your acceptance of this proposal,
kindly confirm your interest by sending me a revert email via the email
accounts below ( rexchukwu2@maktoob.com).  Your indication by revert email
to me of your sincere and serious interest will enable me send you the
PROCEDURE FOR OPERATION.

NOTE: In the event of your inability to handle this transaction please
inform us so that we can look for another reliable person who can assist
in this respect.

It might surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for this
transaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be discovered and
business like this can not be executed without trust. This is why we have
decided to trust you for this transaction. We are looking forward to doing
this transaction with you. Be further informed that everybody interest and
security had been considered before you were contacted, so be rest assured
and feel free to go into this transaction with us. But let Honesty and
Trust be our watchword throughout this transaction and your prompt reply
will be highly appreciated.

Thank you and God bless.

Best Regards,

DR. REX CHUKWU.

want to make sure that everything have be in other before contacting you. He 
found out about one of my current account which containeda deposite of $60M

From;Mr.Desmond Ngoyah and Family,
         Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to
you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my
family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not
the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the
attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's
information directory during my desperate search for someone who can
assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some
family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Desmond Ngoyah, the second son of Mr.Smith Ngoyah, of
Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our
country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and
ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert
G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our
country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful
death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some
white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his
life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold
from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and
crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his
followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their
wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after
winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and confiscate
all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers
assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these
white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that
are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and
younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live
without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million
and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00]in a Trunk
box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash
and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers,
awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never
completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of
this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp
down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render
support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to
inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure
that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the
finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance
to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is
dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's regime.My mother is

From: THE DESK OF DR.MRS.MARIAM  ABACHA.
 ATTENTION:
 
 Good day and compliments. This letter will definitely 
 come to you as a huge surprise but I implore you to
 take the time to go through it carefully as the
 decision you make will go off a long way to determine
 the future and continued existence of the entire members of my Family.
 Please allow me to introduce myself. My name is Dr.(Mrs) HAJIA Abacha,
the wife of the late Head of State and Commander- in- Chief of the Armed
Forces of
 the Federal Repulic of Nigeria, Gen. Sanni Abacha,whom died of heart attack.
 My ordeal started immediately after my husband's death
 and the subsequent take over of government by the last
 administration. The present democratic government is
 determined to portray all the good works of my late
 husband in a bad light and have gone as far as
 confiscating all my late husband's assets, properties,
 freezen our accounts both within and outside Nigeria.
 I am writing this letter to you, my son Mohammed
 Abacha  is undergoing questioning with the government.
 All these measures taking by the past/present
government is just to gain international recognition.
 Me and the entire members of my family have been held
 incommunicado since the death of my husband, hence I
 seek your indulgence to assist us in securing some
 funds. We are not allowed to see or discuss with
 anybody. Few occassions I have tried travelling abroad
 through alternative means, all failed.
 My late husband has FORTY million US DOLLARS
 ($40,000,000.00) specially preserved and well packed
 in trunk boxes of which only my husband and I knew
 about it. These packages are been deposited with a
 security company without anybody knowing the contents
 of the packages, because it was declared as photo
 materials and other personal effects. It is packed in
 such a way to forestall just anybody having access to
 it. It is this sum that I seek your assistance to get
 out of Nigeria as soon as possible before the present
 civilian regime finds out about it and confiscate it
 just the way they have done to all our assests.
 On your consent, e-mail via the under listed contact
 immediately for further discussions and clarification.
 Bearing in mind that you may assist me, I have decided
 to part with 15% of the total sum.Your URGENT response is highly Needed. 

All corespondence must be forwarded to my Family confidant and
representative Mr.GEORGE ADAMS on his e-mail address:
 (georgeadamsng@lycos.co.uk)for security and confidential reasons.
 May Allah show you mercy as you do so,
 Yours Truly,
 Dr.(Mrs) MARIAM Abacha.

Nationality,
but I work here in Nigeria as a Specialist Medical Doctor to the Governor
of Lagos State, Nigeria. I am the Senior Doctor to (G.S.H.O.N) the

Before he died I discovered a small box with him, I opened the box and
found out so many Documents in it, I then realize that he is a German Man
who only came into Nigeria for business, but unfortunately he died. The
other documents inside his box are documents with which he used in making
transfer of the sum of US$18Million Dollars to a Country Abroad,including
the picture of the money in the box with which it was used to be
deposited with the Diplomatic Courier Company. but unfortunately he died
and left all these.

I have tried all I could to reach any of his family members, but i
couldn't get any one from his family,he is single and not married,so his
status really made it difficult for me to get any of his relatives.

With my position as the Specialist Doctor to the Governor, and as the
Senior Doctor in the (G.S.H.O.N).Government Specialist Hospital Of
Nigeria. I wont be able to travel Abroad to clear this Consignment (THE
FUND).

trustworthy individual, into whose  account we intend
to transfer some  funds.

Presently, we have in our possession, instrument of
payment for US$21.5m (Twenty One Million, Five Hundred
Thousand U.S.  Dollars), This amount arose  from
over-invoicing of some supplies and engineering works
contracts which had been financed by the Petroleum
Trust Fund. The Contractors have been paid in full for
contracts executed. The fund are therefore free to be
transferred overseas without any risk whatsoever.

Due to the nature of Accrual of these funds, It has to
be applied for by a foreign individual or
organisation, and payment can only be made into a
foreign account: Hence this contacts is necessary to
accomplish this deal. We are willing to compensate you
with 20% of the amount for providing the account and
all other relevant assistance to enable us accomplish
this, 10% will be used for the reimbursement of all
expenses that will be incurred by both parties during
the course of this financial transaction; the
remaining are for my associate and I.

We shall require from you the following urgently, by
fax: 
	1.	your name, telephone and fax numbers
	2.	the name and full address of your organisation or
company
	3.	the complete particulars of the bank account where
you wish  the funds to be transferred. This should
include the account number, bank address, telephone 
fax numbers of the bank.

My colleagues and I have had fruitful discussions with
relevant top officials of both the federal ministry of
finance (FMF) and the debt reconciliation committee
(DRC). and they have agreed to co-operate in the
transfer. an application for funds transfer will be
made at the appropriate ministries in favour of you,
the beneficiary. Thereafter you will be officially
regarded as having executed the contract for the
(P.T.F) for which payments is being made. this process
makes the operation legal according to the laws of the
Federal Republic of Nigeria.

Please, treat this transaction as strictly
confidential, we are civil servants who would not want
our names tarnished, bearing in mind our positions.
Thanks for your anticipated co-operation, while I
await your timely response.

Yours faithfully,

Mike Akinde(Esq)

  Dear Sir,


 RE: URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL
I know that this will come to you as a surprise.
I am Dr. Ali  Kaloma  the Director and Funds Co-ordinator of the
Finance/Contract Department of the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM
RESOURCES.

Terms of Reference.
My term of reference involves the financial management and
disbursement of proceeds from petroleum products and also the
award of contracts to multinational companies.

My office is also saddled with responsibility of screening
categorization and prioritization of projects embarked upon by
this Ministry as well
as feasibility study for selected projects and supervising the
project consultants involved. A breakdown of the fiscal
expenditure by this office
as at the end of the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001 indicates
that this Ministry paid out a whooping sum of US$736M (Seven
hundred and Thirty Six Million United States Dollars) to
successful contract beneficiaries.

The Ministry is now compiling beneficiaries to be paid this
third quarter of 2002. The crux of this letter is that the
finance/contract department of this
Ministry deliberately over-inflated the contract value of the
various contracts awarded. In the cause of disbursements, this
department has been able to track down the sum of US$20.5M
Twenty Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars) as the over-invoiced sum. This
money is now lying and floating in the Ministry's domiciliary
account with the Apex Bank, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). 

My colleagues and I now want to quickly transfer these funds to
a safe nominated account for possible investment abroad. We are
not allowed as a matter of Government policy to operate any
foreign account because of our status as Civil/public servants.
Hence the need to solicit for your account to transfer this
fund into.

We have also evolved a sharing formula as follows:
(1) 25% for the foreign account owner
(2) 70% for I and my colleagues
(3) 5% will be set aside to defray all expenses both locally and
internationally during the course of this transaction.
Furthermore, we shall be relying on your advice as regards
investments of part of our share in any blue-chip Company in
your country. Be informed
that this business is genuinely and 100% safe considering the
high-powered government official involved. Send your private
fax, telephone numbers
and your mobile telephone if any and same of your Bank and
Account number.

This is to facilitate easy communication with you. Contact me
strictly 
by email.

Looking forward to healthy business relationship with you.

Sincerely,
Dr. Ali Kaloma.

Dear sir,

I am Mr D. Arlett Johnson of the zimbabwe farmers
trust fund.This trust fund was established to cater for white farmers that are 
internally displaced due to the obnoxious land reform
programme of the regime of Mr Robert mugabe,the president of zimbabwe.Just 
last week,as the 
farm land of one of our members Mr Smithson was 
forcefully taken over by the government officials,the family of Mr Smithson 
was brutally attacked and his farm house burnt down,the fire inferno killed 
him and his wife,this was reported in the new York times.He died along side 
his wife leaving behind his 11 year old son, Mike,who managed to escape the 
attack and came to our office for refuge.

On discussion with Mike,he told me the whole story of what happened and also a 
classified file that his father gave him with a written note to the trust fund 
to assist his son in getting a new life outside the country.

On close study of the documents in the boys
possession,we discovered that the family was in the process of transferring 
large volume of their funds from the account at African Development 
Bank to an offshore account.The instructions has
already being issued and the instruction would be carried out by the bank once 
all necessary 
documents are signed here by mike for the remittance of the funds abroad.

what we  are requesting from you is your ability and commitment in investing 
this funds properly on mike behalf.if you can convince us of this,we 
would proceed to give the instructions to the bank
here to release the funds to the offshore bank account where you would then 
make withdrawal 
for the investment options.

This trust fund has being helping white Africa farmers and black Africa's for 
a very long period and we would want to hear from you if you are in a position 
to properly invest the funds on mike s behalf.

i expect your prompt response.please reply only to
this mail address

ATTN:

I am Bulawa Mulete JR. the son of Mr. 

STEVE MBEKI MULETE from Zimbabwe. I am sorry this mail
Will surprise you, though we do not know, my mother Mrs. Clara 
Got your contact through her private search.
Due to the current war against white farmers in
Zimbabwe and the support of President Robert Mugabe to
Claim all white owned farms in our country to gain
Favor for re-election.

All white farmers were asked to
Surrender their farms to the government for
Re-distribution and infact to his political party
Members and my father though black was the treasury
of the farmers association and a strong member of an
Opposition party that did not support the president
Idea. He then ordered his party members and the police
Under his pay row to invade my father's farm and burn
Down everything in the farm. They killed my
Father and took away a lot of items from his farm.
After the death of my father, our local pastor and a
Close friend of my father handed us over will
Documents with instructions from my father that we
Should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will 
Documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a deposit
Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown
To the company that the content is money hence it was deposited as 
Personal belongings and ensure that we do not remain here as we could
Easily be found by his enemies. The total amount is
US$21.5M.We are therefore soliciting for
Your assistance to help us move the fund out of
Zimbabwe, as our fate and future is far from
reality, hence this mail to you. The president's present ban of
International Press into Zimbabwe and the drop from office of the 
Finance Minister to avoid giving white farmers fund Transfer
Clearance above US$1M is just a few of the
Unthinkable things he is committing in my Country.
I have tried to reach my father's close friend Mr.
John Casahans from Australia also a farmer who was
Leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family
Late last year following this ugly development to no
Avail.
Should you be interested to help us, contact me
Immediately via email for easy communication and I
Will furnish you with the time frame and modalities of
the transaction. We have concluded a wonderful plan of 
Caring out the transfer within two weeks. Please note that 
This transaction is100% confidential and risk free and will 
Not endanger you or us in any way. We have resolved to give you 20%
Of the total sum upon confirmation of the fund in any
Account of your choice were the incident of taxation
will not take much tool on the money and we look
Forward to coming over to your country to invest our
Share and settle there. I will a private
Phone so that our conversation can be
100% confidential.

Please do not use the reply button, reply only to 

bulawa2000@netscape.net

God bless you indeed as you help yourself and us.

Subject: STRICTLY  URGENT  AND  CONFIDENTIAL

NO 13 VS 2 CETHSWAYO ESTATE
GENERATION- SOUTH AFRICA



             {URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL)

   (RE:  TRANSFER OF ($ 152,000.000.00 USD ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO
MILLION DOLLARS )

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 152,000.000.00 USD) One hundred
and
Fifty two million United States Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I
want
to ask you to quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who will
be capable  and fit to provide either an existing bank account  or
to
set up a new  Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an
empty
a/c can serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain
honest
to me till the end for this important business trusting in  you and
believing  in God that you  will never let me down either now or in
future.

I am Dr. Nicholas.b.okoye, the Auditor General of a bank in Africa,
during
the course of our auditing I discovered a floating fund  in an
account
opened in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this
account again, after going through some old files in the records I
discovered that the owner of the account died without a [heir] hence
the
money is floating and if I do not remit this money out urgently it
will be
forfeited for nothing. the owner of this account is Mr. Duncan
Harkinson, a foreigner, and a sailor, and he died, since 1993. and no
other
person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the
account
has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that
Mr. Duncan Harkinson until his death was the manager of Duncan
Harkinson
Coy.(pty). SA.

We will start the first transfer with fifty two million [$52,000.000]
upon successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we
shall re-apply for the payment of the remaining rest amount to your
account.

The amount involved is (USD 152M) One hundred and Fifty two million
United States Dollars, only I want to first transfer $52,000.000
[fifty
two million United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners
account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I am
only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be
approved
to a local person here, without valid international foreign passport,
but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international
passport or drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money is in
us
Dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Duncan Harkinson, is a
foreigner too, [and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together I got
your contact address from the Girl who operates computer, I am
revealing
this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down in
this
business,  you are the first and the only person that I am contacting
for this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you
the next step to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax
number including the full details of the account to be used for the
deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a
binding agreement that will  bind us together  before transferring
the money
to any account of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before
we
fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine, because the
management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has
correct
information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and
will meet
up with instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved
with
me in this business.
I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank official we can
transfer
this money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide
with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official will destroy
all
documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no
trace
to any place and to build confidence  you can  come immediately  to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance
in
your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two
days
ahead of the
money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you
that you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. I
will
use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for
onward
transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance
from
the relevant  ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the
total
amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both
parties
might have incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email address:
Nicholas_55@hotvoice.com

You can also rech me on telephone nos. 8821646651141 or
8821646685262,
when dialing you don't need to add South African cose just add your
Coutry's dial out code and dial straight because it's a satellight
phone.

Yours,
nicholas.b.okoye

Subject: I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE

FROM:LAUREN PATRICK MUKEMBE.

DEAR FRIEND,

MY GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE THIS LETTER
MEETS YOU IN GOOD HEALTH. I AM LAUREN PATRICK MUKEMBE, AIDE
TO THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE NOW KNOWN
AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC). I AM WRITING TO YOU
IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON YOUR
PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN SOUTH
AFRICA.

I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN CONFIDENCE
CONSIDERING MY PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION AS A WAR
REFUGEE HERE IN SOUTH AFRICA. FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE LATE
PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER, I WAS
INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF US$22MILLION
WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND LODGED WITH A
SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING DISCLOSED AS FAMILY
VALUABLES IN MY NAME PENDING FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO
WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16 1997,
PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE REBELS LED
BY LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM KISINGANI AND
FLED TO TOGO FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED TO MOROCCO WHERE HE
DIED ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1997
LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER. HE
WAS AGED 66 YEARS. I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO SOUTH AFRICA WITH
MY SON PATRICE, AGED 17 WHERE I AM PRESENTLY RESIDING AS A
WAR REFUGEE SHORTLY AFTER THE
CAPITAL CITY KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER BY REBELS. I LOST
MY WIFE AND MY TWO CHILDREN, AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS DURING
THE REBEL ONSLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY.

THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE AMASSED A
PERSONAL FORTUNE OF US$8BILLION WITH HOUSES IN SWITZERLAND
AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA
MADE ARRANGEMENTS
WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO
FREEZE ALL HIS ASSETS AND CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES. I THUS
DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE SITUATION, UNTIL
WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE
NOW THAT PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON
JOSEPH KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER.

I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY ABROAD WHERE
THE MONEY IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES. THE FUNDS
ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING THE
CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY RECEIVING
THE MONEY ON MY BEHALF. ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE SO THAT I
CAN GIVE YOU THE MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE FUNDS. MAY
I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE
THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH THIS BUSINESS
DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND
CONFIDENCE WHCH I HAVE REPOSED IN YOU.

IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST, I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE OF
THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE CURRENTLY BEIGN
MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER MODALITIES INCLUDING
REMUNERATION FOR YOUR
SERVICES. I AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE
OF THE MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTION IS CONCLUDED.

FOR THIS REASON, KINDLY FURNISH ME YOUR CONTACT
INFORMATION, WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX
NUMBERS FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF
THIS MAIL USING MY PERSONAL BOX:mukembe1@epatra.com

YOURS SINCERELY,

LAUREN PATRICK MUKEMBE.

end of the day. We have decided to contact  you due to the urgency of
this Transaction, as we have been reliably informed of your

and a reputable person to handle this confidential transaction which
involves 
maximum confidence. 

PROPOSITION:

closing balance as at the end of march, 2002 worth USD$23.5 million
(Twenty three million, Five Hundred Thounsand United State dollars)
Which the bank now expect a next of kin to claim as beneficiary.
Valuable  effort are being made by the Regent BANK Plc to get in
touch with any of the Monroe`s family or relatives but there has been
no success. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being
able to locate any of the late Engr. Jacques Monroe next of kin (he
had no children that is known to us.) The management under the
influence of our chairman and member of the board of Director,
that an arrangement has been made for the funds to be declared

and the world in general.

In order to avert this negative development, some of my trusted 
colleagues and I now seek your permission have you stand as a next of
kin to the late Engr Jacques Monroe so that the fund USD$23.5million
would be released and paid into your account as the beneficiary next
of kin. All document and proves to enable you get this fund will be
carefully worked out. We have secure from the probate an order to
locate any af the deceased beneficiaries, and more so we are assuring

We agreed that funds would be shared thus, after it has be transferred into
your account. If this proposal is accepted by
you. Do not take advantage of the trust   we  have bestowed on you
and your company, then	kindly forward to me immediately your most
confidential telephone, fax number,particulars so that I can use this
information,

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT.

I am Mr, NELSON MESQUITA a native of Cape Town in
South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with
the South Africa DEPARTMENT OF MINERAL RESOURCES AND ENERGY 
First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to
reach you for a transaction/business of this
magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this
medium. 

I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal
described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties
and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the
nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources
where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the
cooperation of four other top officials, we have in
our possession as overdue payment bills totaling
Twenty -! One Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S.
Dollars ($16,500,000.) which we want to transfer
abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a
foreign company/individual to receive the said fund
on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account
to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in
the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service
Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore
account hence your importance in the whole
transaction.
This amount $16.5m represents the balance of the
total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by
a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual
contract cost have been paid to the original contractor,
leaving the balance in the Tune of the said amount
which we have in principles gotten approval to remit
by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any
foreign bank account you will provide by fili! ng in an
application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of
the former contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in
the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the
$16.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and
miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100%
safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this transaction. I have reposed my
confidence in you and hope that you will not
disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately my
e-mail address whether or not you are

From: Mrs Mariam Abacha 
Abacha Housing Estate 
Gidado Road, 
Kano-Nigeria 
I salute you in the name of the lord. I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha, the 
widow of the late Gen. Sani Abacha former military Head of State who 
died mysteriously as a result of cardiac arrest. Since my husband's death, 
my family has been under restriction of movement and that notwithstanding, 
we are being molested and constantly under watch by the seemingly agent, 
above all, our banks account here and abroad have been frozen by the 
Nigerian civilian government. Furthermore, my eldest son is in detention 
by the Nigerian Government for more interrogation about my husband's 
asset and some vital documents. 


Following the recent discovery of my husband's bank account by the Nigerian 
government with my son's bank in which a huge sum of US$700 million and 
450 million Dutch Mark was lodged and ?.6 billion belonging to my late 
husband was seized by the government of Nigeria. I therefore wish to 
personally appeal to you seriously and religiously for your urgent 
assistance 
to transfer the sum of $25.5 million United States Dollars into your 
account in your country which has already been lodged in a security company 
by my Late Husband and I have a prove of the Certificate of Deposit with the 


telephone and fax number of the security company in Amsterdam-Holland, the 
name of the head of 
operation including the telephone and fax number of the agency whom help 
in packaging the consignment. since we can not leave the country due 
to the restriction of movement imposed on the members of my family by 
the Nigerian Government and my International pass 
port impounded at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos in 
August 1998 and presently the consignment is incurring more demurrage 
and if the government discovered they might seize the fund (consignment) 
that was the reason I was advise by our Family lawyer for the safety 
of the fund, to look for an honest and reliable foreigner who is willing 
to be of assistant to enable the fund to be transfer to his account while 
you are entitled to 25% of the fund while 5% is for any expenses which 
might include your phone calls , stationary which must be deducted before 
sharing. 


Also, if you accept this proposal, I shall give you the telephone and 
fax number of the security company in Amsterdam where the consignment 
is lodge including agency for verification and you shall as well forward 
your data including your telephone and fax number to our Family Lawyer 
who shall help in the legal documentation to make you the legal owner 
of the fund by a prove of an affidavit from the Federal High Court for 
a change of fund ownership by me which my lawyer shall forward with an 
application to the Court to enable the court to issue an legal clearance 
certificate as a prove that the fund is no longer belong to ABACHA FAMILY 
but you as the new beneficiary which will now empowered the Security 
company to release the consignment (fund) to you. 
Please I will appreciate your quick response weather you accept this 
proposal or not to enable me to know the next step of action and please 
you can as well use your name or your company name as the beneficiary 
of the fund (consignment ) 


Yours Sincerely

CONFIDENTIAL 
From: Mr Vicky Savimbi 
Abidjan, Cote'd Ivoire 
Dear Sir, 
Permit me to inform you of my desire of going into business 
relationship and with you. I am Vicky Savimbi the son of 
late Mr Jonas Savimbi former Unita Rebel movement leader in 
Angola, who was assassinated on 23rd February 2002 by the 
Angolan Government Forces who are against his campaign for 
a united Angola Two days before my father assassination, he 
instructed me to move out of Angola immediately. I
therefore managed to escape from Angola to Abidjan, Cote 
d'Ivoire through the help of my father's friend who is a 
diplomat. I came into Abidjan with some valuables,
properties titles including a deposit certificate for a 
cash sum of US$32,000,000.00 (Thirty Two million United 
States Dollars) being money realized from the sales of 
Diamonds and Petroleum products in two trunk metallic box 
which he deposited with a private Security Company here in 
Abidjan. On getting here in Abidjan, I made inquiries with 
the company and discovered that the consignment is still 
intact. For your information, the real content of the box 
was not disclosed to the Security Company. 
These boxes were deposited as family valuables for security 
reasons and not as cash and as God may have it with a 
foreign factious name as my Father also them that his 
foreigner partner may come for it, so I am asking you to 
assist me claim this fund as my Fathers foreign partner for 
onward investment in your country because of the unstable 
political situation here in Africa and mostly for my 
future. I will be willing to compensate you with 25% of the 
total sum and 5% for any expenses on both sides for your 
noble assistance upon the term of agreement that will be 
reached between both us and if possible I am interested to 
go into a life partner with you because I do not know 
anything about investment and international transaction. I 
have equally informed the Security Company of my 
intention to come and claim the metallic boxes with my 
father^Òs foreign partner by letter and that means you, in 
less than one month. 
For the safety of my live, treat this matter with utmost 
confidentiality. Please kindly contact me as soon as you 
receive this mail on this telephone number 225 07 77 98 92 
for more details. 
Stays blessed and best regards.

Mrs. Maryam Abacha

Dear, lawrence

STRICTLY URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL 

I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha, widow to the Former Military
Head of State, 
Late General Sanni Abacha, who died suddenly as a
result of Cardiac 
Arrest on 8th of June 1998. 

One early morning, I was called by my Late Husband
General Sanni 
Abacha, who at that time was the Chief In Commander of
the Army and the 
President of Nigeria. He conducted me round the
apartment and showed me 
three metals boxes of money all in Foreign Exchange, my 
husband told me he was to use the money for the
settlement of his 
Personal Royal Guards on his self Succession Bid and
campaigns. 

Upon his tragic and unexpected death, the new civilian 
Government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, has insisted on
probing my 
familys financial resources and has gazetted all our
properties, also. They 
recently seized all the known familys fund abroad with
the assistance 
of the British Government. It is only this money
$48,000,000.00 (Fourty 
Eight million US Dollars Only) that he deposited with a
security 
company vault , that they can not trace 
because the funds were deposited as (ANTIQUITY) African
Art Work from 
the National Commission for Museum and Monuments (N. C.
M. M.) Nigeria, 
the family intend to use this money for investment
purpose to enable 
the family start life all over again. 

Therefore, the family is urgently in need of a Very
competent and 
investor participant that we could entrust with the
certificate of Deposit 
and (PIN) Personal Identification Number Code to help
us remove the 
funds from the security company. Since no names were
used 
in securing the vault. 

I got your contact address and name from our Chamber of 
Commerce, Agriculture and Industry Office in Lagos -
Nigeria, if the 
proposal is acceptable to you, after getting the money
out from the 
security company vault to your country, my family have
agreed to offer to 
you 
25% of the total sum for the kind assistance you
rendered to us. And in 
addition bank the familys own part of the funds and
assist us in 
investing (with my approval on project) as a front for
us until the 
situation becomes more favorable for us to now meet and
discuss the way 
forward, most especially now that my elder son,
Mohammed Abacha and I 
are under pressure from the Government, despite the
fact that my family 
had already returned the sum of US$3 Billion my Late 
husbands Account in the U.S.A, Europe and other
countries. 

Please kindly state your early response immediately on
this email: 
ibrabacha44@justice.com for more details on the
logistics and modalities. 

NOTE: I do not need to remind you of the absolute
secrecy and 
confidentiality that this transaction demands. You are
free to speak directly 
either with me or my son Mallam Ibrahim Abacha on the
phone. 
Communication is strictly on the above Tel/Email only.
If you are not 
interested, please kindly reply me immediately to
enable me search for 
another interested partner. 

I await your kind reply. 

Thanks and accept my regards. 
MRS. MARYAM ABACHA 
c/o Ibrahim Abacha

Subject: Urgent, From ANGOLA
Date: Thu, 12 Sep 2002 10:16:00 -0700

Reply-To: tasa94@37.c0m
To: ...

 This message contains confidential information and is intended only 
for the individual email addressee named. If you are not the named 
addressee, you should not disseminate, distribute or copy this-mail. 


From Tao,

This message may come as a surprise as we have not met, but I am 
desperately in need of help. I got your contact email address from 
a search I made on the Internet. I cannot contact any of my known 
father's associates because of the on-going situation in my country
 and the predicament facing my family. 
I am the son of the late leader of the Movement for the Total 
Independence of Angola (UNITA), Jonas Savimbi, who was killed in 
a fierce gun battle with government troops loyal to Edwardo Dos Santos
on the 22nd of Febuary 2002.

I am Tao Aroujo Sakaita Savimbi, the eldest son of my late father 
(Jonas Savimbi). I was aware of sales of diamonds and crude oil to 
individuals and countries that clandestinely come and purchase these
products. After the PEACE ACCORD was broken, the United States of
America government abandoned my father and the United Nations (UN)
imposed sanctions on all products coming out of UNITA controlled areas.
It is the proceeds of these sales that were used by UNITA to purchase 
arms to prosecute the war. 

To learn more of the injustice and situation my father faced, check 
the website:

http://www.the-idler.com/IDLER-02/3-16.html 


My late father, Jonas Savimbi  was able to deposit some fund in Europe 
with a Security Company that he intended to  make purchases with. I
happen to be in possesion of documents and information of the deposit 
and some others.
 
Our movements presently(including me) is restricted.
We are forbidden to either travel abroad or out of our localities. 

Presently, the US$35 Million Dollars cash(37 Million Euros) my father
transfered  to Europe before his death for some purchases he intended 
to make is safe and is in the Security firm. I have the passcode and 
the documents to the Security firm. This is where I will need your help
because at present i cant travel. And I want to act fast before the 
government finds out about the funds.
 
With this password and information and power of attorney you will be 
able to proceed to the Security firm. I can get access to a satellite
 phone for communication. When you are ready I will give you the 
information needed before you can get access to the fund you will then 
 proceed to the Security company where the funds will be given to you 
as payment either installmentally or depending on the advice of the 
security company.
 
YOUR CONFIDENTIALITY IN THIS TRANSACTION IS REQUIRED.
  
Yours sincerely,
 
TAO A. SAVIMBI.

Dear Sir/Madam

SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.

Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This
is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust worthy
foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I will
crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously.

My name is COL BANGI HAMA of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of
the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of
Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace. Due to
the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my
country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President
Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only
(US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. We were then given this money
privately by the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of
other Cabinet Members.

But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his
aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately
decided to put the funds into a private security company here in Congo for
safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being
threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col.
Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and
some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of
the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent
Kabila, Joseph Kabila.

In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who
can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary. WE
have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover
to a security company in Europe in your name. This is to ensure that the
Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it will not pass through
normal custom/airport screening and clearance. Our inability to move this
money out of Congo all this while lies on our lack of trust on our
supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to
those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after
his son took office.

Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We
gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has encouraged
and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will
be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two
weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total
confidentiality. We would please need you to stand on our behalf as the
beneficiary of this fund in Europe. This is because we are under
restricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very carefull in
other not to lose this fund which we have worked so hard for.

Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of Congo, you can
contact me through my email address, Tel/Fax nos. above with your
telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.
Please note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as every ones
Security is Gurranteed as far as we follow the required guidlines. I will
hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as soon as I am
assured of your Sincere interest to assist us.

I must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the
utmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential,
Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.

Thank you and God Bless.

Best Regards 

Col Bangi Hama

Subject:   URGENT ASSISTANCE (GOD BLESS YOU). 

Beloved in Christ,



It is a priviledge to write to you and to relate my testimony.

I was a Moslem and a retired military top officer in Nigerian
Army that served under the past military regime. I was the
financial secretary to the Armed Force Ruling Council (AFRC).
With my position as a financial secretary, I was able to divert
up to us US$45,000,000.00 (Forty Five million U.S Dollars), into
my personal Bank Account, hoping to invest the money when I^Òm
retired. Immediately I got retired, I was converted from Moslem
to Christian when I was preached the words of God through my
cousin Pastor Paul Osakwe.I then gave my life to Christ and
became a born again Christain.

Since I gave my life to Christ, I had no rest of mind.Some times
I think of the souls I killed when I was a soldier and the
dubious ways I diverted my country^Òs money into my Personal Bank
Account. I then decided to seek the face of God for forgiveness,
and after fasting and prayer through Divine Revelation, the
Almighty God revealed to me that the only way I could have rest
of mind is when I used all my money to do the work of God.I
immediately disclosed my revelation to my Pastor and he was
happy with me.


I have been thinking of the particular thing to do for my God
before this present civilian president of my country set up a
panel(Honourable Oputa Panel) to probe the Bank Account of the
past Military officers like me.Instead of loosing this money to
my government, I quickly withdrew my money out of my Account and
deposited the money in a finance and security company for
safety.

My Pastor has adviced me to sneak out of the country with the
money to sow it into a ministry abroad. I have decided to sow
this money into your ministry. I am making arrangement to come
over to your country but you need to receive this money from the
finance and security company in cash before I come over.

The cash has been packaged by the security company in
consignments and ready for shipment but the security company
requires the address of the receiver. Please send to me your
names, address and your telefax number where I can fax the
Airway Bill to you for claim of the consignment over there.

I look forward to your response

God bless you.

secretly been deposited into a confidential Security Company, where it
can easily be withdrawn or paid to a recommended beneficiary. The funds
will be released to you by the Security Company based on my
recommendations, on that note, you will be presented as my partner who
will be fronting for me and my family in any subsequent ventures. To show
my preparedness and the appreciation to conduct this business with you, I
shall give you and your family 20% of the funds and 20% commission on any
profit realizable in the process of investment of this funds. For your

Dear Sir,

I am Prince Johnson Garuba (Jnr.) eldest son to Dr. William C. Garuba, the
former financial controller of the Revolutionary United Front (R.U.F.) of
Sierra Leone. My father was assasinated by people elieved to be members of
Tejan Kabbah's government since he was first accused by the government for
supporting RUF. Before my father's death, he made me know that he had
deposited a consignment (Box) with a ecurity company in Dakar-Senegal
containing US$18,000,000 and that I should go to our country home to get
all the necessary documents. He also told me that he registered the box as
African art works that is, the management of the Security Company are not
aware of the real contents of this box. Presently, my brother and myself
are in N.P.S Refugee Camp in Dakar-Senegal, I have been able to make
arrangements with the Security Company's Manager to help re-transfer this
box to Europe or Asia, so I want you to help me ! to stand as a
beneficiary to this consignment when it arrives. Moreover, all other
details of this transaction will be kept secret for now, pending your
response but all necessary documents will be sent down to you if requested
for. At the end of this transaction, I will be able to give you 20%(twenty
percent) of the total amount.

Hope to hear from you soon. You can reach me on this mobil nos.

Yours Truly

Prince Johnson Garuba [jnr]

From: "MR.IKE MARTINS" [ikemartins@weedmail.com]
Reply-To: ikemartins@epatra.com
To: ...

Attn.:  The President/CEO


After due deliberation with my colleagues decided to forward to you this
proposal. We want a reliable person who could assist us to transfer the
sum of (US$39.5M) Thirty Nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars
only into his account.

This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from a contract awarded by
us under the budget, allocated to my ministry and the bill was approved
for payment by the concerned ministries. The contract has been executed,
commissioned and the contractor has been paid his actual cost for the
contract. We are now left with the balance of US$39.5M as the
over-invoiced amount, which we have deliberately over estimated for our
own use.  

But under our protocol division, civil servants are forbidden to Operate
or own a foreign account. This is why l contacted you for assistance. We
have agreed that you will be entitled to 30% of the total sum, 60% for
us while 10% for any expenses incurred while transacting the business
and whatever left from the 10% will be shared equally.

I got your business outfit from our Chambers of Commerce and Industry.
I am IKE MARTINS, a top official with the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC). We the officials involved in the deal have put in
many years in services to our ministries. We have been exercising
patience for this opportunity for so long and to most of us, this is a
lifetime opportunity we cannot afford to miss.  My number is FAX:
234-1-7593607, TEL: 234-1-4705964.

To enable us get this fund paid into your account, we have to present an
international business outfit and consequent upon your agreement, we
shall proceed in doing business together. You may be required to sign
the fund release authority in our Apex Bank. All these will only take us
10 working days to transfer this fund into your account right from the
day we receive the REQUIREMENTS.

NOTE: Your discussion regarding to this transaction should be limited,
because we are still in government service and your type of BUSINESS
those not matter.

Let honest and trust be our watchwords throughout this transaction. And
your prompt reply will be highly appreciated. Please reply for more
Details.
Best regards

IKE MARTINS

Subject: Next of kin

Mr Koffi Kanjo,
Banque Internationale Afrique,
Lome,Togo.
Private Tel:+228-911-8366.

Bonsoir ,

I am Koffi Kanjo,the director in charge of auditing and accounting
section of Banque internationale De l'Afrique(BIA) Togo- Lome West
Africa with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you
on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of
us at the end of the transaction .

During our investigation and auditing (First Quarter 2002) in this
bank, my department came across a very huge sum of money belonging
to a deceased person,a German Mr.Wolfgang Schinister who died on
25th July,2000 in a plane crash.Mr Wolfgang Schinister,66 years of
age and a prosperous farmer had in our Bank the sum of US$3.2m in
a domiciliary account. He named his wife, Mrs.Helga Schinister as
the next of kin.Unfortunately, two of them were killed in the
recent plane crash involving concord AF4590 in Gonesse, France.I
have made a personal reveiw with the German Embassy in Lome-Togo
and found out that the couple had no children. Owing to the
skeletal information available to the Bank, it has so far been
impossible to reach any of the relatives. The option left for the
Bank management is to declare the deceased account dormant and
revert the funds to trading on behalf of and in the interest of
the Bank.In order to avoid this development, my Colleagues and I
now seek your permission to have you stand as a distant relative
to Mr.and Mrs.Wolfgang Schinister,so that the funds would be
released to you.We will prepare a document to show that you are
a relative to Mr.Wolfgang. All documents and proofs to enable you
get the funds will be carefully worked out on our receiving your
consent to this proposal, we would immediately obtain for an order
of mandamus from the Federal High Court of Justice on your behalf
recognizing you as a bona-fide relative to the deceased and
subsequent application for the release of the funds to you as the
beneficiary,through the Banque Centrale Des Etats De L'Afrique
De L'ouest

May I assured you that this Transaction is 100% risk-free, as we
have taken care of all necessary modalities to ensure a hitch-free
transaction.To this effect my colleagues and I have agreed to
compensate you with 25% of the total sum US$3.2m for your kind
assistance i.e provision of a nominated foreign account to
accommodate the fund for us. Please, you have been adviced to keep
 "top secret" as we are still in service and intend to retire from
service after we conclude this deal with you. I will be monitoring
the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm the money
in your account and ask me to come down to your country for
subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously
indicated. All other necessary vital information will be sent to
you when I hear from you.

I look forward to receive your mail or your telephone call.

Yours faithfully,
Mr Koffi Kanjo.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL .

RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
US DOLLARS ONLY).

I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry as
we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to seek
for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction which is of
mutual benefit.

I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and
Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC)Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in NNPC by my
Committee.

This contract was over invoiced to the tune of US$21.5M. U. S.Dollars.
This was done deliberately. The over-invoicing was a deal by my committee
to benefit from the project. We now want totransfer this money which is in
a suspense Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you
to provide for us.

SHARE: -

For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you will be
entitled to 20% of the money,70% will be for me and my partners while 10%
has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that may be
incurred by us during the course of this transfer,both locally and
international expenses.

I would require the following: -

1. Your company's name, address, telephone and fax numbers.
2.Your bank name,address,account and routing numbers

The above informations would be used to make formal applications as a
matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to
your account.It does not matter whether or not your company does contract
projects of this nature described here. The assumption is that your
company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to othercompanies.
More often than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields
win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms for
execution of such contracts.We have strong reliable connections and
contacts at the Central Bank of Nigeria, as well as the Federal Ministry
of Finance and we have no doubt that all the money will be released and
transferred if we get the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this
deal. Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall
through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the
concerned Government Ministries for 100% security.

We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once in a
lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be transferred to
the overseas Accounts for us, before the present Democratic Government
starts Auditing all Federal Government owned Parastatals.Please contact me
immediately through my telephone number whether or not you are interested
in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign
partner to carry out this deal.But where you are interested,send the
required documents aforementioned herein through my above email box
address(tomogaga@rediffmail.com),as time is of the essence in this
business.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours Faithfully,

Mr.Tom Ogaga.

FROM THE DESK OF DR YUSUF AHMED
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER 
FOREIGN REMMITTANCE DEPT. 
ZENITH INTERNATIONAL BANK OF NIGERIA
LAGOS- NIGERIA



Dear Sir

I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign
remittance department of ZENITH INTERNATIONAL BANK OF NIGERIA
I am writing following the impressive
information about you on business enquiry on the internet.
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of
U.S$35.5m US dollars (Thirty-five million, five hundred
thousand US dollars) in an account that belongs to one
of our foreign customer who died along with his entire
family in november 1998 in a plane crash. 
Since we got information about his death, we have been
expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his
money because we cannot release it unless somebody
applies for it as next of kin or relation to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and
laws but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed
next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is
therefore upon this discovery that I and other
officials in my department now decided to make this
business proposal to you and release the money to you
as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is
coming for it and we don't want this money to go into
the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. 
The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if
such money remained unclaimed after four years, the
money will be transfered into the bank treasury as
unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of
kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that
the customer was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot
stand as next of kin to a foreigner. 
We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as
foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a
foreign account, 10% will be set aside for expenses
incured during the business and 60% would be for me
and my colleagues. There after I and my colleagues
will visit your country for disbursement according to
the percentages indicated. 
Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of this
fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the
bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased
indicating your bank name, your bank account number,
your private telephone and fax number for easy and
effective communication and location where in the
money will be remitted. 
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax
or email the text of the application. I will not fail
to bring to your notice that this transaction is
hitch-free and that you should not entertain any atom
of fear as all required arrangements have been made
for the transfer. 
Your should contact me immediately as soon as you
receive this letter. 
Trusting to hear from you immediately. 

Yours faithfully, 

DR YUSUF AHMED
Manager, 
Bill and Exchange

Dr Efe Osagie
First Atlantic Bank PLC

P. O. Box 75369
Victoria Island, Lagos-Nigeria
website: www.firstatlanticbank.com

Dear friend,

This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that
we have not yet met. The 
message could be strange but real if you pay some attention to
it. I could have notified you 
about it at least for the sake of your integrity. Please accept
my sincere apologies. In 
bringing this message of goodwill to you, I have to say that I
have no intentions of causing 
you any pains. 
 
I am Dr Efe Osagie, Branch Manager, First Atlantic of Nigeria. I
managed to get your 
contact details through the Internet myself. Time is of the
importance and I am desperately 
looking for a person to assist me in this confidential business.
A British oil 
consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation, Mr. Claude Brian 
Best made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit on June 6, 1998,
valued at US$25,000,000.00 
(Twenty- five Million Dollars), for twelve (12) calender months
in my branch. Upon maturity, I 
sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no
reply.	After a month, we sent 
a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract
employers, the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Claude Brian Best died from an
automobile accident. On 
further nvestigation, I found out that he died without making a
WILL, and all attempts to 
trace his next of kin was fruitless.
 
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.
Claude Brain Best did not 
declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,
including his Bank Deposit 
paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still
sitting in my Bank and the 
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end
of each year.  No one will ever 
come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the
expiration of 5 (five) years, the 
money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if
nobody applies to claim 
the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner
to stand in as the next of kin 
to Mr. Claude Brian Best so that the fruits of this old man's
labor will not get into the hands 
of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will
like you to provide immediately 
your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare
the necessary documents and 
affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.  We
shall employ the service of two 
lawyers for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain
the necessary documents 
and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the
transfer.  A bank account in any 
part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the
transfer of this money to you as 
the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your
account for us to share in the 
ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the attorney 
and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful
execution of this 
transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via
the private email address 
below;


efe5350@mail.com
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details
and relevant documents that 
will help you understand the transaction. 

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that
this transaction would be most 
profitable for both of us because I shall require your
assistance to invest my share in your 
country.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email address.

Thanks and regards.

Dr Efe Osagie.

ATTN: PRESIDENT/THE MANAGING DIRECTOR.

Dear Sir,

Following the sudden death of my husband, I have been thrown into a state
of utter Confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present Civilian
administration. I have been subjected to physical and psychological
torture by the security Agents in the country. My son is still under
detention arraigned before the federal high court in Sierra Leon for
Offences he did not commit.

As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody
within my country and many out rightly have blackmailed us during my
course for a reputable friend and partner, either by saying that my mail
is a scam but let me tell you that I am real and not faking, and all that
is just propaganda to further frustrate my efforts. No thanks to dubious
Nigerians that have used that as an opportunity to defraud people.
I came across your contact in my period of desperation to seek for any
available person who even without knowing me might consider giving me an
attention to express myself.

I therefore wish to solicit for your assistance in this most urgent
situation of mine, which will be of benefit to you too.
I am Mrs. Maria Malatu, the wife of the late former chairman of Sierra
Leon National Gold Mining Corporation, who was assassinated in march 1999
in the height of one of the conflicts between rebels and the then
government forces to overthrow the resin staled democratic president of
Alhaji Tejan Kabba which resulted into a tribal war which forced most
citizens to run out of the country to neighboring countries as refugees.

As I was getting our remaining family belongings together in preparation
to flee the country following my husbands death and the continuous threat
on my son's and my life for the past two years, by the rebel soldiers of
Mr. Fodeh Sankoh in order to claim my husband's assets which I have no
full control over. I discovered the keys to my husband's valuable vault.
Upon the opening of this vault, I discovered two metallic boxes that my
husband kept, but never told me about because of the constant protection
and instruction given the boxes. My son and I opened these boxes and
discovered their contents to be the sum of US$25,500,000.00 cash (Twenty
Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) as stated in
the covering note inside the boxes. Following this discovery, my son
Prince John Malatu and I entered an arrangement with a close friend of my
husband a Ghanaian who works in the embassy who helped us smuggled the
boxes to Republic of Benin, Cotonuo. He introduced us to this reputable
finance and security firm "Global Security and Finance Company Limited"
where we deposited the boxes. I, however, made them to understand that the
contents are valuable African artworks, which they noted, that we would be
coming soon to claim them for export.

At the moment, I have decided with my son to seek refuge in Johannesburg,
with the help of my father's friend who also helped us in acquiring a
phone and fax for this transaction. Hence I am trying to solicit for a
trust-worthy partner. Now we are ready to claim the deposit but the
security company will require the presence of the beneficiary or for us to
come up with the name of the owner to enable them make out the original
certificate of deposit in his name. In view of this, I am soliciting for
your direct assistance to help us present yourself as the beneficiary of
the deposit and help us put in for claim and also guide us for viable
investment to sustain my son's future.

We have agreed that a substantial percentage will be offered to you (20%)
on the conclusion of this. You will also be expected to play a very vital
role in the procurement and entirely bearing in mind that, you might incur
some personal expenses like your travel ticket and sundries. But do bear
in mind that this transaction is risk free and full refund would be given
to you with your percentage. The money is legitimate money fully owned by
my husband, again you would also introduce us on any business venture. I
am very certain that the movement of these assets away from the shores of
Benin Republic will be successful. Everything has been working out
miraculously for us. And I do not foresee any changes in our faith. If you
are interested to assist us in good faith, do please get back to us
urgently on the above E-mail addresses and or E-fax number, so that I can
as
well furnish you with my private telephone and fax numbers.

I wait seriously to hearing or reading from you very soon.

Thanks for your anticipated co-operation.

Yours faithfully,
Mrs. Mariam Malatu

Dear Sir, 

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction. This is by
virtue of its nature as a confidential and top secret transaction. Let me
start by introducing myself, my name is MR ANTHONY ALUGA, I am the chief
accountant, treasury department in First Bank Plc. I am writing to you
based on prevailing information I have of you, to solicit your assistance
in helping to receive large sum of money overseas. It was resolved at the
last Management Board Meeting of First Bank Plc., to disburse all probate
accounts(accounts owned by deceased, awaiting claims) that have not been
claimed. The beneficiary of this particular account was a victim of the
Lagos bound ill-fated Kenyan Airways flight KQ-430 plane that crashed off
the Atlantic Coast of Abidjan capital of Cote d^ÒIvoire in West Africa on
January 30, 2000.

Based on this resolution, the bank decided to search for the next of kin
(beneficiary) to this account to no avail, all relevant and necessary
attempts to reach or identify either relatives or friends of the deceased
failed; the attention of his beneficiary/nextof kin was also sought
through several international gazette with no positive result. The
management has decided to declare this money as UNCLAIMED and subsequently
disburse the money amongst the directors. In order to avert this negative
development, my trusted colleagues and I have therefore decided to contact
you to stand as next of kin to this fund. All documents to enable you
claim this money will be legally and perfectly worked out in your name as
the beneficiary to this fund. We have secured from the PROBATE order of
MADAMUS to locate any of the deceased beneficiary. So we are assuring you
that this business is safe and 100% Risk free provided you are willing to
work on instructions. This Account had a credit balance as at the end of
November 2001 worth Twenty Five Million United States Dollars
(US$25,000,000). The other necessary information will be given to you
after indication ofyour interest.

I must say at this point that your area or field of specialization will
not be a hindrance to this arrangement. As soon as we receive
acknowledgement to receive this fund on our behalf, we shall furnish you
with the relevant information that will facilitate the remittance of this
money to you.


NB: please send your telephone and fax number and the bank account you
wish to lodge this fund to.

Thanks ,I await your urgent respones via my private email:anthony0@usa.com
only.

Yours truly.

Dear Sir,

REQUEST FOR AN URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP

After due deliberation with my colleagues, we have decided to forward to
you this business proposal. We want a reliable person who could assists in
the transfer the sum of Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars ($20,500,000). Via International Bank Draft Cashable in any
First World Countries.

This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from contracts awarded by us
under the budget allocation to our Ministry. This bill has been approved
for payment by the other concerned Ministries. The contract has since been
executed, commissioned and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the
contract. We are left with the balance US$20.5M as part of the
over-invoiced amount which we have deliberated over estimated for our own
use. But under our protocol division, we as civil servants are forbidden
to operate or own foreign accounts. This is why we are soliciting your
assistance in this manner and regard. As you may want to know and to make
you less curious, I got your address from adverts in the business
directory.

I am the Chief Accountant/Internal Auditor of the Contract Award Committee
(CAC) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). This
transaction is very much free from all sorts of RISKS and TROUBLE from my
Government. We the N.N.P.C. Officials involved in this deal have put in
many years in service to this Ministry. We have been exercising patience
for this opportunity for so long and to most of us this is a lifetime
opportunity we cannot afford to miss.

We have agreed to COMPENSATE you duly if agreement is reached by both of
us and I and one of my colleagues involved in this deal will come to your
country to arrange for our share, upon the confirmation from you that the

] Dear Sir/Madam,
] REF: URGENT REQUEST
] 
] My name is PRINCE JOHNSON MOYO (Jnr) the elder son of
] PRINCE DENNIS MOYO, of the republic of Zimbabwe. This
] might be a surprise to you as to how I obtained your
] contacts. I obtained your contact from the chamber of
] commerce and trade of South Africa in Johannesburg.
] 
] During the current war against the farmers in
] Zimbabwe, supported by President, Robert Mugabe in his
] effort to expel the white farmers of the country. He
] has ordered the white farmers to give their farms to
] his members of the party and his followers. My father
] was one of the most successful farmers in our country,
] and had been the Minister of Finance in Robert
] Mugabe's administration, but he did not like the idea
] of dispossessing the white farmers of their land. For
] this, his farm was invaded and was burned by the
] supporters of the government. In the course of the
] assault, my father was killed, and the invaders made
] away with many articles of the farm of my father. Our
] family house was totally destroyed.
] 
] Before the death of my father, he called me to the
] attention of the sum of US$18.2 Million United States
] Dollars, which he had deposited with a Security
] Company here in South Africa, during his tenure as
] minister of finance. I decided to get in touch with
] your company, so that you will help me in the transfer
] of this money from South Africa. This has become
] necessary after I have been denied any right to own
] Bank account or any other form of financial
] transaction here, for I am a political asylum seeker
] here in South Africa.
] 
] We (my sister and I) proposed that you should receive
] 20% of the entire amount for your help in the transfer
] of the fund, then 75% of this money shall go to us (my
] sister and I), 5% remaining will be used to cover any
] cost or expenses incurred by the both parties in the
] process of this transaction.
] Would you immediately confirm your interest in this
] transaction through my Mobil line; +27-73-232-7570
] then
] 
] I will give you more details as to how we shall
] conclude this transaction. Incase you may have no
] interest in this transaction; I kindly request your
] utmost confidentiality and secrecy in this matter for
] security reasons.
] Thank you for your co-operation.
] 
] Best regards,

] 
] You may be surprise to receive my letter on the grounds that we have not met

] of contacting you as you read further. Before the assassination of President
] Kabila, I have as I had always done for him through the assistance of a
] Security Company moved the sum of USD$20,000.000 (Twenty Million United
] States Dollars) out of the Democratic Republic of Congo for safe keeping in
] Africa. This Security Company also has affiliates in Europe,Asia and North

] 
] With his death and his inability to inform his business partner in Europe of
] this last arrangement, there is no other person who knows about this money
] expect me. I have contacted the Security Company and they are ready to
] negotiate with who ever I recommend as the beneficiary for onward transfer. I
] have in the past made similar arrangements and substantial amount of money
] made from sales of Diamond moved to different destinations and lodged in
] banks in Switzerland, Belgium, France and Hong Kong for my late boss.
] 
] I am contacting you to solicit for your urgent assistance to help me move
] this money to your account in multiple transfers since from all indication
] the present government headed by his son, Joseph Kabila, is watching our
] movement as former aids, since his assassination is still under
] investigation. 
] 
] There is no risk involved in this and I assure you of a smooth transaction. I
] got your contact from the Foreign Investment Office in Kinshasa on my search
] for a reputable individual or company that can assist me. You are pleased to
] maintain absolute confidentiality in this matter. Apart from the joint
] business participation, I will be very willing to give you a 25% share of the
] total money. I am not ready to contact any other person until I get a reply

Dear Sir,

Firstly, I must solicit your strictest confidentiality
in this transaction. This is by virtue of its nature
as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL. 

Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am
assuring you that all will be well at the end of the
day. We have decided to contact you first by your
email due to the urgency of this transaction, as we
have been reliably informed that it will take at least
two to three weeks for a normal post to reach you. So
we decided it is best using the email. 

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to
you. I am Engr.Sadiq Musa, a director general in the 
Federal Ministry Of Works & Housing (FMWH)and I
head a Six-man tender board in charge of Contracts
Awards and payment Approvals. I came to know of you in
my search for a reliable and reputable person to
handle a very Confidential Business Transaction which
involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a
foreign account requiring maximum confidence. 

However, i and my colleagues are top officials of the
Federal Government Contract Review Panel; our duties
include evaluation,vetting, approval for payment of
contract jobs done for the Housing Ministry, etc. In
order to commence this business, we solicit for your
assistance to enable us transfer into your account the
said funds.

The source of this funds were gotten from an
Over-Invoiced Government Contract during the last
military regime here in Nigeria. The excess of the
funds, Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars (US$12.5Million) is what my colleagues
and i have decided to transfer into a safe and
reliable account for disbursement amongst all. 

Reasons, being due to the fact that as Civil Servants,
the laws of my country, prohibits us "Civil Servants"
from owning foreign accounts and moreso, as members of
this panel, we cannot do this by ourselves.

In the light of this, my colleagues and i have agreed
that if you/your company can act as the beneficiary of
this funds on our behalf, you or your company will
retain 20% of the total amount of US$12,500,000 00).


Please, note that this transaction is 100% risk free,
as all documentation for success will be duly
procured, and we hope to conclude the business in
Seven (7) Bank working days from the date of receipt
of the necessary information and requirement from you
which will enable us commence this transaction fully. 

I will bring you into the complete picture of the
transaction when I have heard from you. 

Thank you and God bless.

Yours faithfully,
Engr.Sadiq Musa

Dear Sir

My name is LOI C.ESTRADA,The wife of Mr. JOSEPH
ESTRADA, the former President of Philippines located
in the South East Asia.

My husband was recently impeached from office by a
backed uprising of mass demonstrators and the Senate.

My husband is presently in jail and facing trial on
charges of corruption, embezzlement, and the
mysterious charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence.
The present government is forcing my husband out of
Manila to avoid demonstration by his supporter.

During my husband's regime as president of Philippine,

I realized some reasonable amount of money from
various deals that I successfully executed. I have
plans to invest this money for my children's future on real
estate and industrial production. My husband is not
aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for
now.

before my husband was impeached, I secretly siphoned
the sum of $30,000,000 million USD (Thirty million United
states dollars) out of Philippines and deposited the money
with a security firm that transports valuable goods and consignments
through diplomatic means.

I am contacting you because I want you to go to the
security company and claim the money on my behalf
since I have declared that the consignment belong to
my foreign business partner. You shall also be
required to assist me in investment in your country.

I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will
not sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me
properly, I expect you to declare what percentage of
the total money you will take for your assistance.

When I receive your positive response I will let you
know where the security company is
and the payment pin code to claim the money which is
very important.

For now, let all our communication is by e-mail
because my line are right now connected to the
Philippines Telecommunication Network services. Please
also send me your telephone and fax number.

I will ask my son contact you to give you more details on
after i have received a responce from you.

Thank you and God bless you and family.

MRS LOI C ESTRADA

Tel:+31-619-934-109

                                    CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know
me personally. The purpose of my introduction is that I am Tapio Makele
the first son of Teti Makele , a farmer in Zimbabwe who was recently
murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through
network online hence decided to write you.Before the death of my father,
he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US8.5 million (Eight
million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars), in one of the
private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe
this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage
from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new
machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in
Swaziland.

This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert Mugabe
introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers
and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob
action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In
fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which
my father was one of the victims.It is against this background that, I and
my family fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in
the Netherlands where we are seeking political asylum and moreso have
decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account.
since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open
any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout
the territorial zone of Netherlands, As the eldest son of my father, I am
saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine partner that could
assist me without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking
everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing
along with them.

I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South
Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future, both
countries have similar political history. As a businessman,I am seeking
for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his
hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you
accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make
an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment(funds)
from their afiliate office here in the Netherlands as i have already given
directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South
Africa.But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like
change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money I
intend to use for investment.

I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain
percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction.
Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable
investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want,
feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all
kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction.If you do
not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 10% of the money while
the remaining 85% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me
with the above email address, while I implore you to maintain the absolute
secrecy required in this transaction.

Thanks, GOD BLESS YOU

Yours Faithfully

Tapio Makele.

From: Mr Bashir Manu 
36 Marina,P.M.B. 2027, 
Lagos, Nigeria. 
Tel : 234-1-776-2187 
Fax : 234-1-759-0801 


Hello. 

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by
virtue of its nature as being utterly, CONFIDENTIAL. Though I know that a
transaction of this magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried,
but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.  I have
decided to contact you because of the urgency of this transaction.

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am Mr Bashir
Manu, an executive Director at the union bank of Nigeria Plc, Marina,
Lagos. To find out more about me and my bank, please visit our bank web
site. http://www.unionbankng.com/

The Proposal. 

A foreigner, Late Mr Martin N. Sommers, an oil merchant/contractor with
the Federal Government of Nigeria who died along with his family on the
8th of November 1996 in an ADC Boeing 727 plane crash at Egirin River (all
141 passengers on board were feared dead), had with us in his current
domiciliary account a closing balance of $US38.5 million Dollars. Ever
since the management got the information of his death we have been
expecting any of his relation to come forward and claim this money.  
Unfortunately from the day of his demise till the time of this letter none
of his relation or friends has come up for the claim and the banking and
financial law of Union bank of Nigeria Plc stipulates that if such fund
remained unclaimed after a period of five (5) years it will be declared UN
CLAIMABLE.


Fervent efforts made by the Union Bank to get in touch with any of the
Sommers family or relatives all have proven abortive. As a result of this,
our Chairman, Mr Kalu U. Kalu and some executive Directors are in the
process of declaring the funds "UN CLAIMABLE".

As an insider and the actual manager of the account and balance, my
colleagues and I have decided to contact you to act as Late Martin
Sommers's next of kin and receive this funds as inheritance claim for the
benefit of both parties.  All documentation required to perfect this will
be in place once you indicate your acceptance. For your role in the
transaction, you will keep 30% for yourself, 10% for taxation and preserve
60% for us.

If this proposal is OK and you wish to take advantage of the trust we
bestow on you .  Kindly give me a call immediately so for further
discussion.

Please note that your positive or negative response will be appreciated to
enable us know the way forward. Also treat as urgent and very
confidential.

Thank you and God bless. 

Regards, 

Bashir Manu

  CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP SOLICITED. 
  
  ENGR:KUMALO DILIZA 
  DIRECTOR PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION (MEMR) 
  DIRECT TEL NO: 0027 731 522 629 
  16-04-2003 
  
  Dear Sir/Madam 
  
   I am an Engineer with the South African Ministry of Energy and Mineral 
Resources and I am also a member of the Republic of South Africa Contract 
Award and Monitoring Commitee in the Ministry of Energy and Mineral 
Resources. It is a pleasure involving you in this project. Although, this 
may sound strange but I seek your indulgence and pray you view it seriously. 
 
Two years ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in the Ministry of 
Energy and Mineral Resources by my committee. This contract was over 
invoiced to the tune of US$14.3Million. This was done delibrately. The over 
invoicing was a deal by my commitee to benefit from the project. We now 
desire to transfer this money which is in a suspense account with the MEMR 
into any oversea account which we expect you to provide for us. 
  
 For providing the account where we shall remit the money, you will be 
entitled to 30% of the money, 10%  will be set aside for expenses incurred 
by both parties during course of transfer, while the remaining 60%will be 
for my partners and myself. 
  
  I would require the following: 
  1)Bank details ( Name and address / Account no/Beneficiary name ) 
  2)Private Telephone and Fax number of Beneficiary 
  
  The above information would be used to make formal application as a matter 
of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer to your 
account. It does not matter whether or not your company does contract 
projects of this of this nature described here, the assumption is that your 
company won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. 
  More often than not, big trading companies or firms of unrelated fields 
win major contracts and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution 
of such contracts. We have strong and reliable connections, top government 
contacts at the South Africa Reserve Bank and Ministry of Finance and we 
have no doubt that all this money will be released and transferred if we get 
the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when the 
business is successfully concluded we shall through our connection withdraw 
all documents used from all the concerned Government Ministries for 100% 
security. We are civil servants and we will not want to miss this 
opportunity. 
  
Please contact me immediately through my above Telephone or email contact, 
whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will 
enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. But 
where you are interested, send the required informations aforementioned 
herein without delay as time is of essence in this business. 
I want to assure you once again that this transaction is 100% risk free 
both now and in the future. 
I await in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. 
  
  Yours faithfully, 
  
  Engr. Kumalo Diliza

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT.

I am MR.MATHEW LAPPEMAN an Executive Accountant with
the Department of finance of mineral resources and energy South Africa.

First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to
reach you for a transaction/business of this
magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed 
on this medium. 

I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal
described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties
and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the
nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of finance where I work as an Executive 
Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in
our possession as overdue payment bills totaling
Twenty - One Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S.
Dollars ($21,500,000.) which we want to transfer
abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a
foreign company/individual to receive the said fund
on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account
to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in
the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service
Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore
account hence your importance in the whole
transaction.
This amount $21.5m represents the balance of the
total revenue collections from income tax, mining lease and export 
duties in respect of diamond mines, expressed as a percentage of total tax 
revenues (net collections, National Revenue Account .

from this projects we have been able to secure this reasonable 
ammount.$21.5m as commission resulting from over invoice ,hench all the 
necessary approvals has been completed.

This amount $21.5m represents the balance of the Estimated revenue 
total value executed on behalf of my Department by
a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual
Estimated revenue cost have been paid to the original contractor,
leaving the balance in the Tune of the said amount
which we have in principles gotten approval to remit
by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any
foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an
application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of
the former contractor to you.
I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in
the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the
$21.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and
miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100%

FROM: AMSTERDAM-NETHERLANDS

Dear friend,

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since 
you do not know me personally. I am the first son of the 
most popular black farmer in Zimbabwe who was 
murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your 
contact through network online hence decided to write 
you. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to 
Johannesburg to deposit the sum of USD5.Million (Five 
million United States dollars), in one of the private 
security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in 
Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as gem 
stones to avoid much demurrage from Security Company.

This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines 
and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new 
farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when 
Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe when he 
introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the 
rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this 
resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean 
war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot 
of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for 
which my father was one of the victims. it is against this 
background that I and my family fled Zimbabwe to South 
Africa for fear of our lives.

After which I traveled to the Netherlands and I am 
currently staying in the Netherlands where i am seeking 
political asylum and more so have decided to transfer my  
father's money to a more reliable foreign account. Since 
the law of Europe prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to 
open any bank account or to be involved in any financial 
transaction throughout the territorial zone of European 
Union. As the eldest child of my father, I am saddled with 
the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account 
where this money could be transferred without the 
knowledge of my government who are bent on taking 
everything we have got. 

The South African government seems to be playing along 
with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this 
amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going 
through the same experience in future. Both countries 
have similar political history. I am seeking for a partner 
who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in 
his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk 
free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want 
 you to do for me, is to make arrangements with the 
security company to clear the Consignment (funds) from 
their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as i have 
already given directives for the consignment to be brought 
to the Netherlands from South Africa.

But before then all modalities will have to be put in place 
like change of ownership to the consignment. I have two 
options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain 
percentage of the money for nominating your account for 
this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me 
for the proper profitable investment of the money in your 
country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to 
notify me. I have also mapped out 2% of this money for 
all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this 
transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing 
to give you 10% of the money while the remaining 88% 
will be for my investment in your country. Contact with 
me immediately while I implore you to maintain the 
absolute secrecy required in this transaction. 

Thanks, GOD BLESS YOU 

Best regards,
 

NOTE: 
ON YOUR INABILITY TO HANDLE THIS 
TRANSACTION RESPOND TO ME AND INFORM 
ME SO I CAN LOOK FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

Dear Sir;


REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP.

I solicit your utmost confidence in this transaction.
It is confidential and ^ÓTop Secret^Ô. I represent
officials of the Nigerian Federal Government Contract
Review Panel (FGCRP) who are interested in
investments, to buy and manage fish trawlers or go
into crude oil exploration/marketing with funds, which
are presently trapped in Nigeria. In order to commence
this business we solicit your assistance to enable us
transfer into your account the said trapped funds.

The source of this funds is as follows: During past
military regimes in Nigeria, government officials set
up companies and awarded themselves contracts which
were grossly over-invoiced. The present Government set
up a Contract Review Panel of which we are members. We
have identified a lot of inflated contract funds,
which are presently floating in the Apex Bank of
Nigeria ready for payment. Unfortunately, as civil
servants and members of this panel, we cannot acquire
this money in our names. I have been mandated by my
colleagues of the panel to look for a foreign partner
into whose account we would transfer the sum of the
USD$1000M (One Hundred Million United States Dollars). Hence,
I write requesting your unreserved assistance.

We plan to share the money with 30% going to the
Account Owner, 60% for my partners and myself and the
remaining 10% used in settling all expenses.

If you accept this proposal, be kind enough to send to
me by fax

1.     Your company's name, address, telephone and fax
numbers
2.     Your bank name, address, as well as your Bank
account number.

With this information, we are going to put in
applications for the release of these funds into your
account for us all. So far, much has been said, and
due to our sensitive position we can not afford a slip
in this transaction so contact me immediately through
the above email address for further information on the
requirements and procedures for this transaction.

Please treat with the strictest confidentiality and
utmost urgency.

Best regards

DR. AFAM FRANCIS

Respond to: ast3@hknetmail.com

Dear friend,

My name is Astinoos Hermann an official of a finance house (which would be
disclosed later). I am looking for a foreign investor to assist me in a
transaction that involves Wealth. My mode of contacting you might not be
the most appropriate considering the sensitivity of the transaction but I
feel the internet is the best way to get a partner in this transaction. I
need assistance to transfer an investment fund which would soon run into
the wrong hands if I do not act fast. The total sum of valuables runs into
millinos of Euros from the finance trust house. The money was part of the
funds used by the finance house on an investment that went bad during the
conversion to Euro. What happened was that I did not use all the amount
that was budgeted for the investment. The auditors have already made a
report that the fund for the purported investment is lost. But I know that
all is not lost as I did not disclose all information regarding the
investment to them neither did I submit some relevant documents. Part of
the funds for the failed investment is still within the system of the
finance house though the management is not aware of it. I would want you
to assist me in moving the said assets out of the finance house. Do
indicate your interest in assisting me move the said funds, to the email
address: ast3@hknetmail.com so that I could send you the complete details.
when you respond I shall let you know the answers to all your questions. I
await your response.

Regards,
Astinoos Hermann.
Do respond to: ast3@hknetmail.com

58, Marina street 

Lagos Nigeria 

Business Assistance 

My name is Jonson Phil Okemadu a senior accountant with the Federal
Ministry of Finance. I shall like to seek your partnership in receiving
balance of payment for a project well executed here in my country. This I
cannot be able to do due to that I am still in government service and my
government is such that does not allow government officials to own private
foreign accounts.

SOURCE OF FUNDS: This amount Emanated from a contract executed at the
Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in 1985. The foreign Contractor Mr.
George Albatini of Albatini Engineering Corporation with whom this project
was arranged had been paid the real value of the executed contract amount
which is US$30,000,000.00 leaving the balance of US$10,000,000.00 (Ten
Million US dollars) which the contractor (Mr. George Albatini) added for
our benefit yet to be paid, but with the death of Mr. George Albatini who
died in a local plane crash, we have been unable to receive this balance
of payment due to that Mr. George did not file in anybody's name as the
next of kin which he was supposed to do as a foreign contractor.

A new allocation has been given for payment and we shall like to present
you as the beneficiary of payment due to Mr. George Albatini (it doesn't
really matter where you come from) we can make the underground arrangement
here and have your name filed in as the beneficiary and as well give it a
proper legal backing so that we can use our position to approve this
amount and have the funds received for our mutual benefit.

This project is 100% risk free from your side as I am very familiar with
the sequence and in control of the situation here. This project was well
executed and a contract completion certificate was issued for a successful
completion of the said contract which is present in the contract file.

You shall get 20% of the total sum while 70% will go to us. 10% will be
used to reinburse any expenses incured during the course of the project.

It is my believe that this transaction shall mark the beginning of a
fruitful business relationship between us.

I await your immediate response by E-mail. 

Regards, 

Phil Okemadu

HELLO,

I WISH TO BEGIN BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION.

I AM WILLIAMS GUMBEZE ,THE FIRST SON OF LATE NKOSASANA GUMBEZE,ONE OF THE
FORMOST BLACK FARMERS IN ZIMBABWE RECENTLY MURDERED IN THE LAND DISPUTE IN
MY COUNTRY.

BEFORE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER,HE HAD TAKEN ME TO JOHANNESBURG- SOUTH
AFRICA,TO DEPOSIT THE SUM OF US$15MILLION (FIFTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES
DOLLARS) IN ONE OF THE PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES,AS FAMILY VALUABLES,WHEN
HE REALISED THE LOOMING DANGER IN ZIMBABWE.

THIS AMOUNT WAS MEANT FOR THE PURCHASE OF NEW MACHINERIES AND CHEMICALS
FOR THE FARMS AND ALSO FOE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FARMS IN SWAZILAND.

THIS LAND DISPUTE STARTED WHEN PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE INTRODUCED A NEW
LAND REFORM WHICH HAS PARTICULARLY TARGETED AT THE RICH,WHITE FARMERS AND
A FEW BLACK FARMERS WITH MY FATHER INCLUDED.

THIS RESULTED IN THE GRUESOME KILLING OF RICH FARMERS (MAINLY WHITES AND
FEW BLACKS) AND THE UNLAWFULL POSSESION OF THEIR PROPERTIES BY MUGABE'S
WAR VETERANS,UNDER THE DISGUISE OF FIGHTING FOR THE INTEREST OF THE
COUNTRY.

IT IS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND I FLED THE COUNTRY WITH MY FAMILY,TO THE
GERMANY WHERE WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEKING POLITICAL ASYLUM(REFUGEE).

I HAVE DECIDED TO SEEK FOREIGN ASSISTANCE,AS THE GERMAN LAWS PROHITBITS
ASYLUM SEEKERS FROM OPERATING BANK ACCOUNTS OR INVOLVE IN FINANCIAL
TRANSACTIONS OF ANY KIND.HENCE THIS LETTER TO YOU.

ALL I NEED IS A TRUST WORTHY PERSON IN WHOSE CUSTODY I SHALL ENTRUST THE
ABOVE SAID AMOUNT AND HELP ME WITH INVESTMENT OPPORTUNTIES.

THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS,FIRSTLY,YOU CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE A PERCENTAGE OF THE
TOTAL AMOUNT FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE OR GO INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH ME FOR PROPER
INVESTMENT OF THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY.

WE SHALL DISCUSS IN DETAILS WHEN YOU REPLY.

I AWAIT YOUR REPLY,WHILE I IMPLORE YOU TO MAINTAIN THE ABSOLUTE SECRECY
REQUIRED TO ENSURE A SAFE AND HITCH FREE TRASACTION.

I SHALL FURNISH YOU WITH MORE DETAILS ON REQUEST.

I WISH YOU THE BEST IN LIFE (GENERALLY) AS I AWAIT FOR YOUR POSITIVE
RESPONSE.

YOURS TRULY,
WILLIAMS GUMBEZE.

MR. LARRY MAMBA
LAGOS-NIGERIA
TEL: +234-1-7753154
PRIVATE EMAIL: l_mamba2@yahoo.com

Dear [surname],

I am MR. LARRY MAMBA of ACCESS BANK OF NIGERIA LIMITED, I am
the personel account manager of MR. Patrick [surname],  a
national of your country, who used to work with Shell
Development Company here in Nigeria. On the 21st April 2001,
our customer, his wife and their three children were
involved in a car accident along sagbama express road. All
occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost there lives.
Since then I have made several enquiries to  your embassy to
locate any of his extended relatives, this has also proved
unsuccessful.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to
track his last name over the Internet, to locate any member
of his family hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to
assist in repartrating the money and  property left behind
by our customer before they get confisicated or declared
unserviceable by our bank  (ACCESS BANK OF NIGERIA LIMITED)
where he deposited sum off US$9.5 Million (Nine million five
hundred thousand U.S.Dollars only)  and the banking
guidelines of ACCESS BANK stipulates that if such money
remained unclaimed for over a period of time 2 years and 6 
months, with the account unservicable, the money will be
confisicated, and this will happen if nobody comes for the
money since we have not seen any body for the money and his
property for the last two years and our bank has been
notifying the Rotary club for the past one year.

In order to avert this negative development, I now seek your
permission to have  you stand as a next-of-kin of the
deceased  since you have the same name so that the proceeds
of this account valued at US$9.5 million Dollars will be
paid to you and then you and me will share the money.

I am assuring you that this transaction will be executed
under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any
breach of the law.

Pease note, indicate your interest through my most
confidential e-mail address above and call me with the
cellphone number above to acknowledge your interest.

Best regards,

MR. LARRY MAMBA

ECO INTERNATIONAL BANK PLC
PLOT 84 AJOSE ADEOGUN STREET
VICTORIA ISLAND LAGOS

ATTN:PRESIDENT/CHAIRMAN

STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL

I am Dr Thomas Musa,a manager in the Bills and Exchange at the
Foreign Remittance Department of the ECO INTERNATIONAL BANK I am
writing this letter to ask for your support and cooperation to carry
out this business opportunity in my department.

We discovered an abandoned sum of$15,000,000.00 (Fifteen million United
States Dollars only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign
customers who died along with his entire family a wife and two children in
November 1997 in a Plane crash.

Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting his next-of-kin to
come over and put claims for his money as the heir,because we cannot
release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim as the
next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking
guidelines.Unfortunately, neither their family member nor distant relative
has everappeared to claim the said fund.

Upon this discovery, I and other officials in my department have agreed to
make business with you and release the total amount into your account as
the heir of the fund since no one came for it or discovered he maintained
account with our bank,otherwise the fund will be returned to the banks
treasury as unclaimed fund.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as stated thus;20 % for
you as foreign partner,75 % for us the officials in my department and 5 %
for the settlement of all local and foreign expences incurred by us and
you during the course of this business.

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and one of my
colleagues will come to your country and mind our share. It is from our 75
% we intend to import Agricultural Machineries into my country as a way of
recycling the fund.

To commence this transaction,we require you to immediately indicate your
interest by a return e-mail and enclose your private contact telephone
number, fax number full name and address and your designated bank
coordinates to enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate
departments for necessary approvals before the transfer can be made.

Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
because of its nature.I look forward to receiving your prompt
response. FAX NUMBER234-1-7592911

Best Regards

Dr Thomas Musa

ATTN: THE PRESIDENT/CEO, 

SOLICITING FOR BUSINESS VENTURE AND PARTNERSHIP. 

My name is Mr.Gilbert Gamal, a member of the contract award and monitoring
committee of ministry of urban and rural development, my duty as empowered
by the Mauritius Government is to provide the basic amenities, social
recreational activities in urban and rural areas, this programs include
assistance to deprived local communities and to co-ordinate project and
development at the national levels, further more from this projects we
have been able to secure some reasonable amount of US$20M (Twenty Million
United States Dollars) as commission from various contractors resulting
from over invoicing, hence all the necessary approvals has been completed.
This approved funds is now packaged and dispatched through a security
company for onward delivery to it's destination here in Europe. This funds
were first deposited into a vault security company before we arranged for
it's movement to Europe through diplomatic channel using decoy purporting
that the funds belongs to a foreign expert rate/company as we are
Government officials we are not allowed to operate or open a foreign bank
account hence you need to stand as the beneficiary and claim this funds on
our behalf from the security company. Presently I'm now in Europe to
search for a reliable person/company with high integrity/dignity one with
conscience who will claim this funds on our behalf as the beneficiary, and

FROM:DR  MARK  AJEGBO


		BUSINESS PROPOSAL


I am making this contact with you on behalf of my colleagues after an
acceptable recommendation from an International Business Agency.

My colleagues and I are members of the Contract Award Committee (CAC) of
the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA). I have been mandated by my
colleagues to look for a trustworthy company into whose account some funds
are to be transferred.We have in our possession instrument of payment for
US$22.5M (Twenty two million five hundred thousand U.S Dollars only) now
in a dedicated account with our apex bank The above funds arose from the
over invoicing of some Supplies and Engeenering Works contracts which have
been executed and the contractors paid in full. The fund is therefore free
to be transferred overseas without any risk whatsoever.

Due to the nature of accrual of this funds, it has to be applied for by a
foreign contractor/company and payment can only be made into a foreign
account hence this contact is necessary to accomplish this deal. You (or
your company) shall be compensated with 25% of the amount as the account
owner, 5% shall be used for the reimbursement of all expenses that will be
incurred by both parties during the course of this financial
transaction.The remaining 70% is for us.

We shall require of you the following urgently by fax:
1.	Name,Telephone and/or fax Numbers of Beneficiary
2.	Name and full address of the Company
3.	Complete particulars of the bank account where you
        wish the funds to be transferred.
	This should include the account Number, Bank
Address, the Telephone, Fax and Telex numbers of the bank.

My colleagues and I have had some fruitful discussions with relevant top
officials of the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) and they have agreed to
cooperate in the transfer. An application for funds transfer shall be made
at the appropriate Ministries in favour of the beneficiary (you or your
company).Thereafter, your company shall be officially regarded as having
executed the contract for the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) for
which payment is being made.This process make the operation legal
according to the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

Please treat this transaction as STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL as we are Civil
Servants who would not want any exposure.Do not go through the
International Telephone Operator or (AT&T) when lines are busy at any time
in the course of this operation.Always dial direct.It's very difficult to
get telephone access to Nigeria. So you must persist even when the
telephone says subscriber not available or the number does not exist.
These answers are always given when there is no access. Thanks for your
anticipated cooperation.

Best Regards,

DR MARK AJEGBO
Please all contact should be directed to  my
telephone, fax number and email above.

Subject: Assistance/Investment

Dear Sir, 

Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise since we have not
met, permit me however, I am MR. DOMINIC DUKAS, a Zimbabwean Farmer. I am
contacting you as the need for me to have a foreign partner in your
country has become necessary due to my plans to relocate and establish a
private company in that region, as the present political instability in my
country (Zimbabwe), does not encourage financial investment as the
environment is not conducive for investment and most of all security is
not guaranteed, just as reported by the International media. This problem
started when the Zimbabwean government under the leadership of President
Robert Mugabe announced a decree on May 31st 2001 to seize more than 6000
white-owned farms. So far, more than 5,400 white owned farms have been
invaded, properties confiscated and farm lands seized. During these
periods, as reported by the international media and C.N.N, more than 500
white farmers were ki lled, the government di

Therefore, I decided to contact you through my local Zimbabwean associate
(Mr. Dennis Udongo) for your assistance so that I can establish a company
in your country and relocate there. Also, I must re-iterate the importance
of having a citizen of your country to front as the owner of the
enterprise, due to the fact that I will be a foreigner in your country.
For this purpose, I have deposited in a Security company based in
Amsterdam (the Netherlands) all the funds realised from the sales of my
farmland and other farming equipment which amounted to USD18,500,000.00
(Eighteen million, five hundred United States Dollars). These funds was
packaged in two metal boxes and declared as personal effects and
photographic materials so as to avoid detection by immigration/security
officials. For now, I stay in Johannesburg (South Africa) because Zimbabwe
is highly unsafe for me and my family. You can reach me on Tel. No.
0027-83-9469684 for fur ther talks or you can als

Upon your immediate response, I will immediately arrange and send to you
all the documentation that will empower your good self in finalizing the
transaction with the security company in the Netherlands.

Let me use this opportunity to also inform you that this transaction is
100% risk free and genuine and should also be handled in the most
confidential manner. This proposal is NOT and must NOT be linked to all
the numerous SCAM letters flying around. The money (USD18.5m) already
stashed in the two boxes could be termed as consignment and I will not
hesitate to link you to my safe contact in the security company for
further discussion.

Lest I forget, you should be entitled to 30% of the total funds for your
support and cooperation in the transaction. Its also your duty to assist
me in investing my own share of the money in your company or in your
country. I shall be counting on your unalloyed trust and immediate
response.

Cheers and God bless. 

Best Regards 

MR.DOMINIC DUKAS

CONFIDENTIAL

Dear Friend,

I am JOHN LAMINE the only son of late former
Director of finance,Chief WILFRED LAMINE,the former Sierra- Leonian diamond
and mining corporation.
I must confess my agitation is real, and my words is
my bond, in this proposal. My late father diverted this money meant for
purchase of ammunition, for my country, during the peak of disastrous civil
war in my country, now he has deposited the money with the ROYAL TRUST
BANK/SECURITIES LIMITED in Abidjan, where I am
residing under political assylum with my younger sister.
Now the war in my country is over with the help of
ECOMOG soldiers, the present government of Sierra
Leone has revoked the passport of all officers who
served under the former regime and now ask countries
to expel such person at the same time freeze their
account and confiscate their asset, it is on this note
that I am contacting you, all I needed from you is to
furnish me with your bank particulars:
1) Account name
2) Account number
3) Bank address, telephone and fax number
For you to assist me transfer this money in your
private bank account, the said amount is (Ten
Million Dollars) $10 Million.
I am compensating you with 15% of the total money
amount, now all my hope is banked on you and I really
wants to invest this money in your country, were their
is stability of Government, political and economic
welfare.
Honestly I want you to believe that this transaction
is real and never a joke. My late father Chief LAMINE
gave me the photocopies of the certificate of deposit
issued to him by the BANK on the date of deposit, for
you to be clarify because, I do not expose myself to
anybody I see, I believe that you are able to keep
this transaction secret for me because this money is
the hope of my life, it is important.
Please get to me immediately after you must have gone
through my message fill free and make it urgent. That
is the reason why I offered you 15 % of the total
money amount, and 5% in case of any other necessary
expenses you might incure during this transaction.

 Try and negotiate for me some profitable blue chip
investment opportunities which is risky free which I
can invest with this money when it is transferred to
your account, personally I am interested in estate
management and hotel business, please advise me.
Get to me back immediately you receive this message for more
explanation.And promise me, my younger sister, to be a father considering
our situation
and not to betray us.


Thanks and God bless
Best regards

JOHN LAMINE

NB: my late father used me the only son as the
beneficiary / next of kin on the day of deposit and
also told me I need a foreign assistance of a
foreigner with a legitimate bank Account abroad who
will stand as co-beneficiary and partner abroad.

Dear Friend,
 
If I may crave your indulgence, I am moved to write you this letter; this
is in confidence considering our present circumstance and situation which
boils on political and fiscal. But I will not bore you with details of
these troubles, rather I will tell you how you will earn US$3.5 Million by
assisting me in this mutually beneficial and risk free transaction which I
hope you will give your urgent attention.
 
Due to the aforementioned political and fiscal situation I escaped from
Monrovia with my immediate family to Europe where we are presently
residing on temporary political asylum. I decided to change all my wealth
deposited in Swiss banks into other forms of money coded for safe purpose
because attempts were being made to freeze these treasures in European
countries. We also had to change our identity so that our investments will
not be traced and confiscated. This monies totalling Fifteen Million Eight
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$15.8M) I have deposited with a
Diplomatic Courier Company for safekeeping.
 
What I want you to do now is to indicate your interest that you will
assist us by receiving the money on our behalf. Your area of daily
specialisation will not be a hindrance to the successful execution of this
transaction and the account required for this project can either be
personal, company or an offshore account that you have total control over.
After the money is in your possession I will later want you to buy
properties, stocks in multi-national companies and engage in other safe
non-speculative investments.
 
I shall inform you about the next line of action as soon as I receive your
positive response. Please kindly furnish me immediately by e-mail your
telephone and fax numbers to enhance the confidentiality which this
transaction requires. Please reply to my confidential email below.
 
Regards,
Sipho

money meant for campainning for president robert Mugabe's re-election into
office under Zanu PF Party. Presently I have been able to move the funds
from Africa diplomatically to a security company in Netherlands where I
now reside as a refugee.

MY REQUEST: As a result of my present situation as a refugee who cannot
have access to own an account or accounts,I am looking for a trustworthy
individual /firm to advice me in making the rightful investment as wellas
to provide account(s)where the funds will be lodge into,more also we are
at the interim interested in buying properties for residence as my family
will be residing there and in the near future.

immediate family have decided to offer you 25% of the total sum and also
set aside 5% for all your expenses (i.e) telephone bills,travelling
expenses, hotel bills and other miscellaneous expenses.

NOTE:  I shall commit half of my own share of the total sum into a joint
venture project preferably in the purchase of real estate or other
profitable business venture.Be assured that you stand no risk of any kind
as the funds in question belong to me alone. As soon as I get your consent
, I will furnish you with the details and contact of the security company
and a face to face meeting will be arrange in order to know each other

long lasting business association. if you have any question, do not
hesitate to contact me with the above telephone number and e-mail address.

 Dear Sir/Madam

  Expedient Interest.

 It is my great pleasure to communicate with you on
 behalf of my colleague, I would have contacted you via
  normal post but it will take about two to three weeks
 to get to you, hence I decided getting across to you
  via email. I have decided to seek a joint
 co-operation with you in execution of a private
 business project hereunder for the benefit of all
 parties, and hope you will give us your firm support
 considering the fact that we have not met each other
 before. I am an official working for the petroleum
  refinery Banjul-Gambia.

 My office - the refine product's center - is in charge
 of managing and supervising the Refinery on behalf of
 the Gambian government. My colleague and I are
 currently in need of a foreign partner who can
 nominate a new offshore bank account we are ready to
]discuss with you, were we shall transfer the sum of
 Five Million U.S dollars for a joint partnership
 venture . This Funds came about as a result of a
 contract executed on behalf of the Refinery, This
 contract was officially assigned to be awarded and
 executed by two foreign contractors at the tune of
 Sixty million USD but in the course of my negotiation,
 I bargained with only one foreign contractor, a
  Bulgarian firm who then executed the contract at the
 cost of Fifty five million USD.Thus leaving the
 remaining Five Million to my benefits.


 This contract has been satisfactorily executed and
inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing
 his payment through my office. It is however to this
 effect that I seek your maximum assistance and
 approval to present your company name alongside with
 the Bulgarian contractor as the second foreign
 contractor to enable me transfer the difference into
 any offshore account nominated by you for further
 investment & joint partnership venture.

 The fund is presently waiting to be transferred by our
 offshore fund managers to the beneficiary submitted to
 us as the funds receiver. We shall be transferring
 the proceed to your account as an investment we are
 making with your company. we propose to exchange a
 silent partnership agreement with you once all the
 necessary funds release approvals and documents has
 been secured in favor of this deal, as our assurance
 that you will hold the proceed in trust for us. for
  your support and partnership, please reply me to
 negotiate the percentage you wish to be paid when the
 funds arrive your bank account for us.

 In terms of disbursement it is after your ratio and
 expenses have been deducted from the proceed that the
 balance could be dealt with, according to our
  instruction. You must however note that this deal with
 regards to our disposition to continue with you, is
 subject to these terms. Firstly, our conviction of
 your transparency. Secondly, that you treat this
 business as our private business.My
  share of the proceed will be used for the importation
 of goods from your Country when I arrive to meet with
 you.

 conclusively, that you will provide a bank info that
  you have absolute control over and in a location
  accessible to us because we will be there with you to
 await the arrival of the funds in your nominated bank
 for us. This transaction, although a private deal has
 no legal disadvantages either to yourself, your
company or ourselves. the proceed of this deal will be
 wired to your nominated account for us within fourteen
 working days as soon as we are convinced of your
 sincere partnership and you furnish me with a suitable
 and newly nominated banking details for the business.


 I am looking forward to doing business with you and do
 seek your confidence in this business,
 Thank you,

    mr.yesuf Jatto.

Sir,
                                                  BUSINESS INVESTMENT

I have a business proposal which I know might interest you, I got your
address through an international search directory in my bid to find a
foreign partner who Could be of assistance to me.

In brief introduction, I am Prince Abdul Bundu,a citizen of sierra-leone,
and the Eldest son of the late Chief Bundu Koroma, Our country had in the
past been involved in a very horrible and hostile war in which
Revolutionary United Front (R.U.F.) led by foday sankoh committed so many
atrocities against humanity, My father who was a collaborator to the
rebels was killed during the war because of his inability to produce over
Thirty Million United States Dollars (US$30.m) given to him by the
Revolutionary United Front (R.U.F.) rebel for the procurement of arms and
ammunition.

However, truth and evidence has unfolded matters that we saw his death as
a sacrifice

And restoration of peace in our dear country, but before my father's death
during one of our visits to him while in detention, he disclosed to us of
an existence of two sealed trunk boxes, which he kept in the underground
vault in Free-Town, which he said contained the sum of Thirty Million
United States Dollars (US$30.000.000.00.).

We immediately went back home and found the boxes intact, we took to my
father's advice and fled out of the country through the costal river,
after days of sea travelling with the trunk boxes intact and arrived in
Abidjan where we hurriedly deposited it in a security company that took
the boxes to Netherlands as family valuables, withholding truth of the
real content of the boxes, this we have done for security reason and kept
down the deposit cost. Even as I am writing you, the security company is
not aware that the boxes contain money, although the war has ended but we
have considered it safe to remain outside the country and to return back
to our country, since we have lost our breadwinner and all our properties
confiscated by the new government of president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

I have a limited knowledge in the business world, hence the reason for
soliciting your assistance to please make a residence arrangement for us
in your country and to guide us invest this money in company, I have the
consent of my mother and we have resolved to give you 30% of the cash for
assisting us in this transaction. Every arrangement to withdraw out the
consignment from the security company and subseguent movement into your
country is guaranteed and it is hitch-free and risk-free.

I await your guick response through the above phone or fax to enable me
give you further detail.

Thanks and God bless,
PRINCE ABDUL BUNDU.

Private email addresses: mbomamza@rediffmail.com or

 My Dear Partner,

I am Dr.Francis S. Mboma, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am
an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &
Natural Resources affiliated (created ) to the Department of Minerals and
Energy. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you
for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that
a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at
the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave
your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I plea to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for
the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret
because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of two other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Forty - Five
Million, Five Hundred And Sixty Thousand U. S. Dollars ($45,560,000.)
which we 
want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable
foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are
handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code
of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your
importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $45.560m represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which
we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the 
tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to
remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will
provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former
contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that, should you
be willing to assist us in this transaction that is 100% hitch free, your
share of the sum will be 25% of the $45.560 million, 70% for us and 5% for
taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on
your part provided you 
treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this
transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel
number or 
my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you
are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out
this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a
position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give
us a very strong 
Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember
to treat this as very confidential because, we will not comprehend with
any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and
remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.
I await in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.And you can also
reach me with this private email address:dr_sontombomam1@excite.com

Yours faithfully,

DR Francis Sonto Mbomam

DEAR SIR / MADAM,

Compliments of the season. I do foresee the surprise this letter will
bring to you as it comes from a stranger, but be rest assured as it comes
with a good-will intentions.

However, your address was courtesy of a business center at the World Trade
Center/Chambers of Commerce here in the Netherlands. And after due
consideration, I became aware and assured of your credibility of handling
this trust/transaction.  Thus, I took a humble decision to solicit your
assistances, understanding and co-operation in this transaction, as it
will be beneficial to us.

My name is Mr. Daniel Lima, one of the former advisers on arms control and
acquisition to the current President of Liberia, His Excellency Charles
Taylor.

Following the current rebel attack in my country, the President delegate
me to arrange for arms purchase from Netherlands through independent arms
dealers. I was directed for arms worth of Twenty Five million United
states Dollars [US$25 million] .On my arrival in Netherlands, I defected
to the rebels side and declined to go back to Liberia and seek for asylum
particularly based on the International World pressure on the President to
leave the throne now. I decided to divert this fund which was brought
through diplomatic means and deposited in a security and Finance company
here in Netherlands and declared it to be an official consignment
belonging to my foreign affiliate.

Currently, this proposal is to inform you that I want to transfer this
fund into any of your personal account or company's account within the
shortest possible time for save keeping.

Please note that this transaction demands the highest degree of trust and
confidentiality between us, moreover, it's a risk free in sense that I
have taken proper care of all formalities regarding it.

In appreciation of your assistance, I have worked out the sharing ratio
for this transaction as follows: 70% for my investment in your country
under your close supervision and directions, 25% for your effort [help and
assistance] and shall set aside 5% for all incidental expenses. Please
reply on the above email as to give me your private telephone and fax
number for confidential communication.

As I wait to hear from you, be informed that all communication on this
transaction shall be confidential.

Thanks and Best regards,

MR DANIEL LIMA.

I am Mr. Lewis Kanzinza, the Auditor General of a bank

Africa, during the course of our auditing  I  
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files
in the records I discovered that the owner of the
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. the owner
of this account is  Mr.  Magnus leon, a foreigner, and
a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993. and  no other
person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that Magnus
Leon until his death was the manager  Magnus
Coy.(pty). SA.  

We will start the  first transfer with fifty two
million [$52,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account.

The amount involved is (USD 152M) One hundred and
Fifty two million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $52,000.000 [fifty two million
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us

to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your

fly to your country at least two days ahead of the
money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries
and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply. You can also
reach me through this email address: 

kanzinza@rediffmail.com .

Yours,
Lewis Kanzinza.

Attn.
I feel compelled to write and request your assistance.
Please, kindly excuse my intrusion into your private
business. I got your contact through a Business
Directory in my effort to get a foreign partner whom
I can entrust with my family investment,while i was
in the recreational centre at the refugee camp in
the Netherlands.
My name is Kabungo M.Paul Jnr. the eldest son of Hon.
Kabungo Makinde Paul,former minister of finance in
Liberia. The junta Chales Taylor assassinated my father
when he dethrone President,  Samuel Doe, which
subsequently led to outbreak of war in my country.
The perennial war in the country forced me and my
Family into exile in various countries. After the
Death of my father, we discovered among my father?s
Documents that he deposited some funds totaling Twenty
-fivemillion Five hundred Thousand United State Dollars
(US$25. 500.000.00) with a private security company in
Netherlands. I am now under political asylum in the
Netherlands while my mother and my siblings are in
Hideout in Dakar Senegal.
My mother advised me to search for a reliable business
oriented person who can help us invest these funds. We
have proposed 20% to you for your assistance while 5%
is set aside for any possible contigencies. Modality
has been work out to the highest level to move these
Funds out of Africa as soon as you signify your
interest to help us invest the balance 75% into a
viable business in your country.
The assistance we are soliciting from you is to help
us receive and invest the money why my family will
join you in your Country as soon as we achieved our
desired goal. I will appreciate it if you could write
me to enable us discuss further on the whole issue
raised herein. These burdens appeared enormous for me
due to my ignorance in the business industry and
coupled with my present social status.
Sir, I am eagerly anticipating your swift response.
Regards,
Kabungo M.Paul Jnr.

NAME  :  ENGR. NKONO MASEKELA
TEL :      +0027-731-522-629
                   Pretoria, South Africa.
  Dear Sir,
  On behalf of my colleagues and I, I write this
 letter with great pleasure. Your information were
  given to me by a member of the South African Export
  Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black
 Economic Empowerment Commission (Government)
  delegation on a trip to the Europen Union during a
  bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign
  investors. I have decided to seek a confidential
 co-operation with you in execution of a business
  transaction hereunder for the benefit of all
  parties.
 Within the Department of Mining Resources where I
  work as the Director of Project Implementation, with
 co-operation of two other top officials, we have in
  our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.
  The said funds represent certain percentage of the
  contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by
 a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
  over-invoiced to the amount of US$14,300,000.00
 (Fourteen  Million, Three Hundred Thousand United
  States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has
  been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
 excess balance unclaimed.
  The Government of the Republic of South Africa
  believe that private investment in general, and
 foreign direct investment in particular, are the
  real engines for sustainable economic development,
  for which reason it has continued to encourage
 investment in the key growth-oriented sector of
  Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign
  contractors all debts owed to them, so as to
  continue to enjoy close relationship, and a mutually
 beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and
  non-governmental financial agencies. As a result we
  included our bills for approvals with the
 co-operation of some officials at the Department of
  Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa (RBSA).
  We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary
  of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to
 operate a foreign account. The changing of
  beneficiary's information/details and other forms of
  documentation upon application for claim to reflect
  the contract money and its approvals will be secured
  on behalf of your company or your good self.
  I have the authority of my colleagues involved to
  propose that, should you be willing to assist us in
  this transaction your share as compensation will be
  30% while my colleagues and I shall receive 60%, and
  the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all
  expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses so
  incurred.
  It does not matter whether or not your company does
  contract projects of the nature described here. The
  assumption is that your company won the major
  contract and subcontracted it to other companies.
  More often than not, big trading companies and firms
  of unrelated fields win major contracts, and
  subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.
  This business itself is 100% safe, provided you
  treat it with utmost confidentiality. Also your
  pecialization is not a hindrance to the successful
  execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I
  have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
  will not disappoint us.
  Kindly notify me by email for further details, upon
  your acceptance of this proposal.

  Your Sincerely,
  Engr. Nkono Masekela

Good Day, 

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail
meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might
seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past,
I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense
benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact
is not acceptable to you, for I make this proposal to you as a person of
integrity.

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is
Nelumba Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas
Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email
address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this
email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a
general overview of my situation. My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle
with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday
22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second
in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma
my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle
for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose
him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves.
 
The tension and confusion in UNITA became uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo
died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle
that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle
interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then
desired a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars.
For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek
for political asylum.

I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance
in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from
Diamonds sales. This money (US$9.5million), which was already on its way
to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to
move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security
and Finance company here in Amsterdam-Holland .In February last year when
the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the
company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further
instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons,
and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of
fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is
the safe deposit with the Security Company.

President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community
to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has
already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name.
Also I did not declare the funds to the security company.

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that
you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you
is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to
lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated
with utmost secrecy. Your role in this project, is clearing the safety
deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the
Security company, after which, the money will be lodged into an account
preferably a new account you should open for this transaction. My share of
the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this
country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an
account here.

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 20%($1,900,000) of
the money. I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment
containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security
company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be
legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction
should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me
achieve this goal.

Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This
will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on
your part.

Please contact me through this email address: nelumba3@rediffmail.com for
more informations .Positive response should be accompanied with your
tel/fax No:

Sincerely, 

NELUMBA SAVIMBI

                                    STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT.

I am sure you will be surprise to read this from me having not met me
before. I decided to contact you via e-mail after concluding that there is
no other way to reach you as I got your contact through an international
internet business directory in Abuja-Nigeria. I am the Deputy Director of
Approvals and Appraisals OF THE FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION. I have been
priviledged to head the Contract Awarding Committee of THE FEDERAL
MINISTRY OF AVIATION (FMA) for the past Six(6) years now.

I am on a five months course here in Holland. Myself and my other
colleagues have carefully mapped out the sum of Thirteen Million, Two
Hundred And Sixty Thousand United States Dollars(US$13,260,000) only which
was received from contracts and commissions we awarded to some foreign
firms for supply and installation of Airport Equipment. With our position
as Directors, we were able to ask the foreign firms to over invoice the
contract by 10% to enable us get our money on request from the Central
Bank of Nigeria. This idea came as a result of the fact that as Civil
Servants here in Nigeria, we are not allowed to operate an offshore
account. Therefore, we decided to look for a reliable and trustworthy
partner to whom we can remit these funds into his private or company's
account, hence my contacting you.

For the numerous assistance you are going to provide, you will be entitled
to 35% of the total amount,60% will be for us while 5% has been set aside
for expenses that will be incurred in the course of this transaction. To
effectively and officially get these funds transferred into your personal
or Company's account, would require the following;

1.Bank name and Address
2.Name of Beneficiary
3 Company Name and Address
4. Account Number.
5. Confidential Telephone and Fax number of Beneficiary.

In order to avoid delay, please get in touch with me immediately via my
e-mail address for immediate action to commence and hopefully, we must get
these funds into your account within a few working days. Please contact me
immediately as we cannot afford to waste much time in this strictly risk
free transaction.

We need to comply with the present democratic government in Nigeria that
has instructed us to pay immediately all debts and outstanding payments of
all foreign firms. While thanking you for your anticipated cooperation, I
await your immediate response.

Regards,
Engr. William Okokobioko

Good Day,

 With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings,
and I hope  this letter meets you in good time. It will
be surprising  to you to receive  this proposal from me
since you do not know me personally.
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in
this transaction,  which I propose with my free mind
and as a person of integrity.  My name is Owen Weah,
the first son of Phillip Weah Personal assistant to
the president Charles Taylor

Liberia,a country in West Africa is presently torn
apart by strife and armed rebellion.These upheavals
have led to the intervention of the American
government which has insisted that the incumbent
president Charles Taylor,vacate his position and allow
an international peacekeeping force to act as a
transitional government.

The embattled president Charles Taylor,has been
offered political asylum by the Government of the
Federal Republic of  Nigeria, and he intends to grasp
this lifeline that has been provided.
The Government of the United States of America have
clearly stated their intentions to investigate the
finances and financial dealings of  president Charles
Taylor and have also threatened to freeze his personal
accounts.


In the light of these circumstances,My father
has instructed me, to source for a foreigner who can
take possesion and control of a large portion of his personal fortune
which he has amassed over the period of his regime,
which is stashed away in a financial institution in
Europe.

I was continually threatened to  abandon my inheritance from
my father. I  resited for a while, but when the danger became
unbearable, and I  survived two murder attempts,
I fled Liberia.  I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am
seeking  political asylum.

These monies amount to approximately (16. 500.000 million Euros)
Adequate remuneration will be provided for services
rendered by you.

It is important that you expedite action in this
transaction if you are interested, because time is of
the essence.Confidentiality is also of great
importance.

Thank you

Owen Weah

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am extremely sorry for intruding into your privacy by way of this
communication to you but please be patient to peruse and digest my
proposal as it will be of matual benefit for both of us.It gives me great
trust,confidentiality and ethusiasm to make this proposal soliciting your
noble assistance in the execution of this business opportunity.

My name is Aisha Mbane, a South African and one of the concubines of the
late senior Iraqi official in Basra and also a cousin to former President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq.He is popularly called Chemical Ali because of his
usage of chemical weapons against the Kurdish uprising during the past
Gulf War.He was killed by the British/American coalition troop in this war
of regime change in Iraq.

Few weeks before the war,as it was already crystal clear to the regime
that the coalition troop must attack Iraq,Ali Transferred (US$12.5
Million) Twelve million, five hundred thousand dollars to a security and
finance company in The Netherlands for safe keeping through their
corresponding office in Syria where the money was deposited.This funds was
dposited in Syria with my name as co-beneficiary and what made things more
interesting is that,I was given custody of all the documents hence it is
only both of us that knows about this transaction.It was two days to our
departure from Iraq through Syria before his death and I decided coming to
the Netherlands alone so as to effect the release of this funds from the
security and finance company especially as the hunt for all Iraqi senior
officials and some of their families in top gear by the coalition forces.

I arrived The Netherlands few days back with all the documents relating to
this funds and i have solicited for political asylum immediately.I never
disclosed this transaction to the Netherlands authority because I have
been advised by my lawyer that the goverment will confiscate it.I
contacted the security and finance company here in the Netherlands and
they cofirmed being in possession of the funds but insisted that they
cannot approve the funds for me because of my political status. They
claimed that political refugees are not entitled to operate a bank
accountthat takes more(1.000 euro.) Due to this circumstances,I was asked
to introduce a reputable,truswhorty and reliable foreign investor with
good religious,political and economic position as beneficiary so as to
claim this funds on my behalf and push it into his or her nominated bank
account from there,my share will be invested wisely in your country by you
or sent to Africa for me.

For rendering this assistance,your share will be 35% of the total sum
while I will be entitled to 60%.The balance 5% will be for any unforseen
lawyer expenses so as to secure the power of arttoney to change the
documents,flight and hotels bills during your visit to release the funds
with the security and finance company.The balace will be donated to
charity homes in Africa and your country.

I will refrain from giving out more operational details untill I receive
your response. Since time is of great essence to me,reply this letter
quickly so as to know what to do,even if this letter does not meet your
approval,please inform me.There is no risk involved as I have done my
homework with my lawyer who is prepard to help as soon as you respond
positively.After response,I will forward the lawyer's telephone number to
you so that he can explain the release procedure legally in detail.

Looking forward to hearing from you and may God continue to protect and
bless us....AMEN.

Yours Sincerely,
Aisha Mbane.

Foreign contactors before the end of the financial year.

I am writing this letter to solicit your co-operation in order to
redeem an amount currently held under trust with the Ministry of
Energy and Mineral Resources of Liberia as result of over payment
by the Ministry. The said Amount at USD$21.5m (Twenty-one million,
five hundred thousand United States Dollars), was originally debt
that owned to contractor which was as result of over payment so this
Money is now in Floating Account in the&nbsp;Ministry , we are looking
for Realiable partner who will can transfer this funds into Account as
one of our contactor who the funds will pay to because as civil Servant ,
we cannot laid claim to this money own

My partner who is the Account's Director in the same Ministry, and
two other colleagues, have initiated the process of filing a claim
for this money, with the hope of having funds transferred Overseas
Account. Since Funds is surppose to a debt own to contractor, my
partners will file a claim for this money from the Ministry of
Energy and Mineral Resources, indicating that you were one of our
contractor and beneficiary of this fund. When the claim is approved,
you as the beneficiary will be paid the sum of $21.5m USD (twenty 
one million, five hundred thousand united states dollars

The money will be paid directly to your nominated account, you have
the responsibility to ensure that my partners can have share and I
receive 70% of the money while you keep the remaining 25% for your
assistance, the remaining 5% will be for any incidental expenses

I want to assure you that my partners are in a position to make the
payment of this claim possible, provided you can give us very strong
guarantee that our share will be well secured, and that you will not
take advantage of our position.

Be assured that there is absolutely nothing to worry about in view
of this claim. It is perfectly safe with no risk involved, and it
is not subject to any inquiry, since my partners will be handling
the claim directly in Liberia on your behalf.

I do hope my proposal is acceptable to you. Please acknowledge the receipt
of this letter, so that I can provide you with more clarification about
the claim and how we intend to make this deal beneficial to everyone
involved. Please reach me at this confidential fax number

Good Day Friend,

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope
this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising  to you to
receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.

However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which
I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity and from a family
with high moral respect . My name is Dickson Mubane, the first son of
Mapele Mubane, of the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered in
the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict, My motherand
Idecided to contact you through email, after searching for contacts via
the internet,as it is the only means I can contact anybody since I am
cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons.  However,
I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.

The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a
business venture. Due to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, as a
result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform
wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers,
and his desire to hold on to power for life, my father for saw the danger
that came in Zimbabwe. Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our
business foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in major
companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit the sum of
US$50.million (Fifty million, US dollars),in a private security company.
This money was deposited with this Private Security company for safety and
security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase of land, new
machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in Europe.

President Mugabe's support for the violent  Zimbabwean war veterans  and
some lunatics in the society, led to the murder of my beloved  father
and other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to  abandon my
inheritance from my father after he was murdered. I  resited for a
while, but when the danger became unbearable, and I  survived two murder
attempts, I fled Zimbabwe.  I am currently staying in the Netherlands
where I am seeking  political asylum. In fact my decision to come here
to seek asylum, is  because the security company from South Africa, has
a branch here,  and they have moved the deposit from their office in
Johannesburg down  here. I need you to assist in receiving this
consignment from the security  compamy. Since the law of Netherlands
prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to be involved in such transactions and my
mother advised that  it will be better for our foreign partner to help receive
this fund to avoid any eye brown being raised by Robert Mugabe, this is why  I am
seeking a genuine  and reliable  partner,who will  assist in receiving the funds
and also investing  it wisely in a profitable venture.You have to understand that
 this decision taken by me  entrusts my future and in your hands, as a result 
of the safe keeping of this money. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do
for  me, is to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the  security company
 from their office here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transfered
from Johannesburg,South Africa to their branch in The Netherlands. The
company will be legally informed of you representing my family.

For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to
have 10% of the money for your assistance, and helping my family investing
this funds, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper
profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option
you want, please to notify me in your reply.  I have also set aside 1% of
this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of
this transaction, and 4% of the total sum for Charity donation.

If you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting in representing my family
to receive this funds, then 85%will  be left for my family.

Please, I want you to maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose  of
this transaction.  I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I
thank you in  advance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me
on my  private line which is  or via email

dickson010@netscape.net

Sincerely,
Dickson Mubane.

Dear Sir,

I am Mr. John Bouneb.I was instructed by my late father to give charity 
from the sum of $28 million USD he deposited on my behalf. He told me that 
10% of the money should go to charity organization and 5% for building 
churches. But before he died he made agreement with the Financial Security 
Vault where he deposited the funds that I can not have access to the funds 
until I attain the age of 30, or a trusted organization or friend could 
come to my aid when I have not attained the required age as agreed with the 
trusted firm.

Now I am 26 and I need to do something with the funds and also start 
financing organization and donate charitably to the needy as instructed by 
my late father who was a true Christian. In this case I am calling your 
interest whether you could stand by me as a trusted firm or a good 
Christian friend who has the love of Christ in him, to receive these funds
for me.

Upon our agreement I will give you copies of the necessary documents and 
how to go about it. After successful procurement of the funds you will 
retain 20% of the total sum, as a matter of your effort and good will. And 
I will also admire if you could assist me to invest my own part in a viable 
projects for fruitful income. Please indicate your phone and fax number for 
oral communication and fast processing of the funds.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
John Bouned

RE:  TRANSFER OF ($26,000.000.00 USD} TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

Dear Sir,

We want to transfer ($26,000.000.00 USD) Twenty six million United States
Dollars from a Prime Bank here in South Africa to oversea account. First,
I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction. This is by
virtue of it's nature as being utterly confidential. I am sure and have
confidence of your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of
this great magnitude. I solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the
said amount into your safe account for unward investment. You can either
provide us with an existing account or to set up a new Bank account
immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive
this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for this
important business trusting in you and believing that you will never let
me down either now or in future.

I am the Auditor general and the personal account officer to a great late
INDUSTRIALIST who has an account in one of the prime banks here in South
Africa. The account was opened in 1996 and he died in 1998 without a
written or oral WILL and since 1998 nobody has operated on this account
again hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing since the bank has been sold on
Wed, 19 Mar 2003 to another bank and the management of the bank is now
ready to release the fund to any foreigner who has the correct information
of the account before fully handing over the management to the new bank. [
Search; http://business.iafrica.com/news/220677.htm].

The owner of this account is a foreigner and no other person knows about
this account or anything concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of the company. My
investigation through the National immigration department proved to me as
well that he was single as at the point of his entry into the Republic of
South Africa.

We will start the first transfer with Six million [$6,000.000]. Upon
successful transfer without any disappointment from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining balance of 20 million to your
account.

The total amount involved is Twenty six million United States Dollars only
[$26,000.000.00]. I want to first transfer $6,000.000.00 [Six million
United States Dollar] from this money into a safe foreigners account
abroad before the rest. But I don't know any foreigner, I am only
contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a
local person here, but can only be approved to any foreigner who has the
correct information of the account which I will provide to you.

On confirmation of your willingness to receive this fund in your account,
I will involve my confidant lawyer who is a government accredited attorney
to the bank to represent you in various offices here to secure all the
relevant documents in your name required to make the transfer a success. I
therefore assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble free
to both parties.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together when we
meet face to face after the first transfer of $6 Million before
transferring the second part of $20 Million. I am revealing this to you
with believe that you will never let me down in this business. You are the
first and the only person that I am contacting for this business, so
please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take
urgently.

Send me full details of the account to be used for this transfer,
including your direct telephone and fax numbers so that we can have a
heart to heart discussion. I want us to meet face to face to build
confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together
immediately after the first transfer before we fly to your country for
withdrawal, sharing and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the
management is ready to approve this Payment to any foreigner who has
correct information of this account, which I will give to you upon your
Positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will
meet up with instruction of a key Bank official who is deeply involved
with me in this business. I need your strong assurance that you will
Never, never let me down.

With my position and influence in the bank, the money can be transferred
to any foreigner's reliable account that you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your
country for sharing. The bank official Will destroy all documents of
transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any
place and to build confidence.

You can call me for heart to heart discussion through my private satellite
phone which I secured for the security and safety of this business as you
know that this business is confidential.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total
amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties
might have incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my private email
address:{hartmannormark@yahoo.com}

Regards,
Hartman Normark.

Dr Shamsudeen  Pius Patrick,
Plot 22, First Land Drive,
CBN  Estate, Tinubu Square, Lagos.

Dear Friend,

After  a  serious thought ,I find it pertinent to reach you directly 
and personally through this medium.
I'm the Deputy Governor of  the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). As the 
Apex Bank, I'm responsible for all wire transfers within the Central 
Bank of Nigeria and all affiliated Commercial Banks in the Country.

For justice and fair play, I'm compelled to contact you directly 
considering the pressure, threat, and blackmail directed to my person  by  a

now suspended attorney here in Nigeria over my refusal to grant a 
remittance authority  to  his  client and the African Development Bank in 
Particular where an indigene of your Country that lost his life with the 
entire family in a ghastly motor accident  has a credit balance of 
USD$35Million  with the above mentioned Bank.

It was detected after the deceased Attorney who collaborated with a 
foreigner presenting him as a relative (next of kin) to the deceased was 
neither  a business partner, relative or the rightful  benefactor of the 
said funds .Further more, I learnt that the deceased have no surviving 
benefactor of his estate and the foreigner is not even a  national of 
same Country.

Following the irregularities, I refused signing the remittance 
authority and hence recall the Money  which is floating as now in the CBN as
a 
suspense account. All bureaucratic procedure for the transfer of this 
credit balance of  the late Engineer  to the rightful benefactor is in 
place as soon as the claim is being made thereupon.

I'm contacting you this moment because I have already mapped out a laid 
down strategy to get the money claimed by you as a relative to the 
deceased as he is a National of your Country.

Following the fight and intensive effort of the present civilian 
administration, which is staging a fight against corruption from all fronts 
makes it impossible for me to authorize this payment without following 
the laid down procedures and backing it up with the claims which I will 
advise` you on .On this directives,after authorizing the payment ,I 
will personally supervise  and  monitor the the successful transfer of the 
funds into your Account. Note that this transaction is risk free but 
confidential as I cherish my work a lot and will not allow a situation 
where this confidentiality and trust is betrayed.  

Everything will be over within 7 working days. For reasons best known 
to me, as it also affect my office, I have decided to reach you through 
the internet until I get your interest indicated. I will give you a 
confidential phone and fax numbers for easy communication on the 
directives.

Sharing modalities: You will part with 35% of this sum including any 
other amount you may spend. Your prompt response is needed.

Reply through this e-mail: 

Thanks ,

Yours faithfully,
Shamsudeen Pius Patrick

BUBA MOHA & ASSOCIATES
SOLICITORS & ADVOCATES
NO 47 WESTERN AVENUE
LAGOS
NIGERIA.

Dear Friend,
Before I start,I must first Apologies for this unsolicited mail to you.I am
aware that this is certainly an unconventional approach to starting a
relationship but as time goes on you will realize the need for my action.

My name is Barrister Buba Moha a Solicitor and the personal Attorney to Mr
John Steiner,an American who worked with an Oil company in Nigeria.Here in
after referred to as my Client.On the 21st of April 1999,my client,his wife
and their three children were involved in a Ghastly motor accident along
Sagamu Express road.My Client and his entire family unfortunately lost their
lives in the accident.Since then I have made several enquiries to your
Embassy to locate any of my Client's extended relatives which has proved
abortive.

My main reason for contacting you is to assist me in repatriating the money
and properties left behind by my Client before they are confiscated or
declared unservicable by the bank where they are deposited and
lodged.Particularly the Union Bank PLC where the deceased has a fixed sum of
Four Million United States Dollars.The said bank has issued me a final
notice to provide the next of kin of my Client or they will be left with no
other choice than to confiscate his funds.Since I have been unsuccessful in
locating my clients relatives for the past two years I seek your consent to
present you as the next of kin of my client, so that the said fund as stated
above i.e the sum of Four million United States Dollars can be paid to you
instead of leaving for it for Union Bank
Plc,we can take part of it and leave the rest for Charity.


I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim
we may make.All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this
arrangement through.I guarantee that this will be executed under a
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the
law.Please reply by this email address above.

Finally kindly give me your confidential Phone and fax numbers so that I can
communicate with you easily.

Best regards,


Barrister Buba Moha.

HELLO,

I WISH TO BEGIN BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION,

I AM JAMES UGOMA, THE FIRST SON OF THE LATE EGOH UGOMA, ONE OF THE FORMOST
BLACK FARMERS IN ZIMBABWE RECENTLY MURDERED IN THE LAND DISPUTE IN MY
COUNTRY.

BEFORE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER, HE HAD TAKEN ME TO JOHANNESBURG IN SOUTH
AFRICA, TO DEPOSIT THE SUM OF US$ 14.5MILLION (FOURTEEN POINT FIVE UNITED
STATES DOLLARS) IN ONE OF THE PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES, AS FAMILY
VALUABLES, WHEN HE REALISED THE LOOMING DANGER IN ZIMBABWE.

THIS AMOUNT WAS MEANT FOR THE PURCHASE OF NEW MACHINERIES AND CHEMICALS
FOR THE FARMS AND ALSO FOE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FARMS IN SWAZILAND.

THIS LAND DISPUTE STARTED WHEN PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE INTRODUCED A NEW
LAND REFORM WHICH HAS PARTICULARLY TARGETED AT THE RICH, WHITE FARMERS AND
A FEW BLACK FARMERS WITH MY FATHER INCLUDED.

THIS RESULTED IN THE GRUESOME KILLING OF RICH FARMERS (MAINLY WHITES AND
FEW BLACKS) AND THE UNLAWFULL POSSESION OF THEIR PROPERTIES BY MUGABE'S
WAR VETERANS,UNDER THE DISGUISE OF FIGHTING FOR THE INTEREST OF THE
COUNTRY.

IT IS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND I FLED THE COUNTRY WITH MY FAMILY, TO THE
EAST OF GERMANY WHERE WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEKING POLITICAL ASYLUM (REFUGEE).

I HAVE DECIDED TO SEEK FOREIGN ASSISTANCE, AS THE GERMAN LAWS PROHITBITS
ASYLUM SEEKERS FROM OPARATING BANK ACCOUNTS OR INVOLVE IN FINANCIAL
TRANSACTIONS OF ANY KIND.HENCE THIS LETTER TO YOU.

ALL I NEED IS A TRUST WORTHY PERSON IN WHOSE CUSTODY I SHALL ENTRUST THE
ABOVE SAID AMOUNT AND HELP ME WITH INVESTMENT OPPORTUNTIES.

THERE ARE TWO OPTIONS, FIRSTLY, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE A PERCENTAGE OF THE
TOTAL AMOUNT FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE OR GO INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH ME FOR PROPER
INVESTMENT OF THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY.

WE SHALL DISCUSS IN DETAILS WHEN YOU REPLY. I AWAIT YOUR REPLY, WHILE I
IMPLORE YOU TO MAINTAIN THE ABSOLUTE SECRECY REQUIRED TO ENSURE A SAFE AND
HITCH FREE TRANSACTION.I SHALL FURNISH YOU WITH MORE DETAILS ON REQUEST.I
WISH YOU THE BEST IN LIFE (GENERALLY) AS I AWAIT FOR YOUR POSITIVE
RESPONSE.YOU CAN REACH ME ON MY E-MAIL ADDRESS:jamesugoma@netscape.net

YOURS TRULY,

JAMES UGOMA.

STRICTLY A PRIVATE BUSINESS PROPOSAL.

 I am Mr.Charles Ela,The manager, Bills and Exchange
at the Foreign Remittance Department of the Allstates Trust  Bank 
Plc.
 I am writing this letter to ask for your support and
co-operation to carryout this business oportunity in my department. 
We discovered an abandoned sum of US$ 37,500,000.00(Thirty seven 
Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars
Only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign
customers who died along with his entire Family of a
wife and a child in November 1997 in a plane crash. 
Since we heard of  his death, we have been expecting
his next-of-kin to come over and files for claims of
his money as the heir, because we cannot  release the
fund from his account unless someone applies for claim
as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our
banking guidelines.

Unfortunately, neither their family members nor distant relatives have
Ever appeared to claim the said fund.  Upon this discovery, I and other
officials in my department have agreed to do business with you and
release the total amount into your account as the heir of the fund since
no one came for it or discovered he maintained account with our
bank,otherwise the fund will be returned to the bank's treasury as
unclaimed fund.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be
stated thus:
20% for you as foreign partner,
80% for us the officials in my department

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, I and
one of my colleagues will come to your country for the
disbursement of the    funds.  It is from 80% we
intend to import Agricultural Machineries into my
country as a way of recycling the fund.  To commence
this transaction, we require you to immediately
indicate your interest by enclosing your private
contact telephone and fax numbers, full name and
address to enable us file a letter of claim to the
appropriate departments for necessary approvals before
the transfer can be made.

Note also, this transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because
of its nature. The above number is a private number as I cannot use a
regular office line.

Sincerely Yours,
Mr.Charles Ela

FROM THE DESK OF PAUL OKOYE
STANDARD TRUST BANK PLC
Tel: 234-1-7760497  
Fax: 234-1-7599947
Private Email:okpaul@gawab.com

I hope this letter will not embarrass you since we have not had any
previous communication.  I got your reference from your country`s trade
department under private enquiry that is not related to my aim of
writing you this letter and went further to have it confirmed by the
Nigeria Exports Promotion Council(NEPC). 

I am Mr. Peter Okoye, a Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank Plc, Lagos
Balogun Branch.  I have urgent and very confidential business
proposition for you. On June 6, 2000, an American Oil
Consultant/Contractor with the National Oil Nigeria Ltd. Mr. Robert Noel
made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months. Valued
at US$48,000,000.00 (Forty-Eight Million United States Dollars only) in
my branch upon maturity.

I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no
reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from
his contract employers the National Oil Nigeria LTD that Mr. Robert Noel
died on air crash in ADC Airline going to Abuja our Federal Capital
Territory. On further investigation, I found out that he died without
making ^ÓWILL^Ô, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was
fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Robert
Noel did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official
documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$48,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will
ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigeria Law, at the
expiration of 5 (Five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of
the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to act as the next kin
to Mr. Robert Noel so that the fruits of this old man^Òs labour will not
get into the hands of some corrupt government officials here.

This transaction is very simple and 100% risk free, therefore I will
like you to provide immediately your full name and address so that an
Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will
put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an
Attorney for drafting and notarization of the ^ÓWILL^Ô and to obtain the
necessary documents and letter of probate and realization in your favour
for the transfer.

A Bank Account in any part of the world, which you will provide will
then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the
beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your Account for us
to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10% will be for
expences both parties might have incured during the process of
transfering the money.Try and call me on my private number immediately
you recieve this email on 234-1-7760497 or write me back on my private
email address(okpaul@gawab.com) for further explanations.

I look forward to your earlist response to my proposal.

Yours Truly.
Mr Peter Okoye
Branch Manager.

DESERVES AND FOR MUTUAL SECURITY OF THE FUNDS THE 
WHOLE APPROVAL PROCEDURES WILL OFFICIALLY AND LEGALLY

ONCE MORE I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT HAVING PUT IN 
OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS IN THE CIVIL SERVICE OF MY 
COUNTRY, I AM AVERSE TO HAVING MY IMAGE AND CAREER 
DENTED. THIS MATTER SHOULD THEREFORE BE TREATED WITH 
UTMOST SECRECY AND URGENCY IT DESERVES.AND I WILL LIKE
YOU TO SEND ME YOUR MAIL TO MY PRAIVTE BOX

100% RISK FREE AS WE HAVE DONE OUR HOME WORK PROPERLY

Dear Friend,
Greeting in the name of the lord.I am delighted to
write this letter to you
hoping that you will understand my predicament and
respond. I am Dr (Mrs.)
Mariam Abacha, wife of the late Nigerian head of
state, General Sani Abacha. I
am in possession of US$50.5 Million, which I want to
invest in your country. For
clarification purpose, this money, enclosed in three
boxes; is deposited with a
security company disguised as a family treasure. It is
not an ill-gotten wealth
rather; it was generated from my organization - family
support program (F.S.P.)
This money ($50.5M) was deposited in a private
security firm Overseas. This
transaction is 100% risk free so long as I am involved
and I have all necessary
documents to back this up.My entire family has lost
all we had as our bank
accounts were frozen and assets siezed even my
Internation Passport but was
just released to me two months ago.
For your acceptance of this offer to help; I will give
you 20% of the total money, another 5% will be used to offset any
costs to both parties in the course of
the transaction.I and my children wish to use our part of
the money to buy a living house for ourselves in your country, and
the balance will be kept for investment  package also in your
country.If we must do this business successfully, we must  keep it
away from the public. At this Jucture I want to forwarn you of the
many scams that go on in my name and names of other dignitries in
the country as I have
even recieved emails
bearing my name.
Looking forward to your quick response.
Yours sincerely,
Mrs. Mariam Abacha

Sincere greetings to you and your family. I know that You may be
surprised to receive this message from me Since you don't know me in
person but for the purpose Of introduction, I am themba funzani the son
of the late Mr. Harrison funzani who was murdered in a land dispute in
ZIMBABWE. I got your contact through the world trade journal. As I feel,
you should be a reliable and trustworthy person to deal with hence I
have decided to write this to you.

My late father was among the few black Zimbabwean rich farmers murdered
in cold blood by the agent of the ruling government of President Robert
Mugabe for his alleged support and Sympathy for Zimbabwean opposition
party. Before the death of my father, he took me to South Africa to
deposit the sum of ten million US Dollars (US$10,000,000.00) with a
security and finance company, as if he knew the looming danger In
Zimbabwe. The money was deposited as Artifact and valuable personal
effects. This money was earmarked for the Purchase of new machinery and
chemicals for the farms and the establishment of new farms in Lesotho
and Swaziland.

This land problem arose when President Robert Mugabe introduced a new
land act Which wholly affects the White rich farmers just because some
few blacks like my dad condemned this new racist move adopted by the
Government, the result was a rampant killing and mob actions against us
all both white and some few black farmers like my father. After the
death of my Dad, I and my Mother fled Zimbabwe and we are currently
staying in Holland(Amsterdam) as refugees/asylum seekers. The funds is
presently in the custody of a security Company here in Holland.  We are
unable to lay claims to this funds because of our political status as
refugees here in the Netherlands. For this reason, we need a foreigner
who will come forward as the next of kin to my father and lay claims to
this funds. We shall need you to come to Holland to lay claims to this
funds to enable this funds to be transferred into your nominated
account. We have all the modalities to see that this funds is
transferred to you within the shortest possible time as soon as you
agree to assist us in this transaction. I must let you know that this
business is 100% risk Free, timely and the nature of your business does
not Necessarily matter. So if you are willing to assist us, I and my
mother have agreed to give you 25% of the Total money, while 70% will be
for us which we shall also invest in your Country with your advice and
the remaining 5% will be mapped out for any incidental expenses which we
may incur during the transaction.

Therefore, if you are willing and interested to render the needed
assistance, endeavor to reply through this my Email Address. Remember
that this is highly confidential and the Success of this business
depends on how secret it is Kept. Please where you are not interested,
do not discuss this matter with anybody. I shall bring you into a more
detailed picture of this transaction when you reply me.

Best Regards,
themba funzani.

From:Mariam Abacha
Lagos-Nigeria.

Dear Sir,

Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani
Abacha the late former head of state of Nigeria in
june 1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter
confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the present
civilian administration, I have been subjected to
physical and psychological torture by the security
agents in the country. My son was just released from
detention few months ago by the Nigerian Government
for an offence he did not commit. As a widow that is
so traumatized, I have lost confidence with anybody
within the country.

You must have heard over the media reports and the
internet on the recovery of various huge sums of money
deposited by my husband in different security firms
abroad, some companies willingly give up their secrets
and disclosed our money confidently lodged there or
many outright blackmail. In fact the total sum
discovered by the Government so far is in the tune of
$700. Million dollars. And they are not relenting to
make me poor for life. I got your contacts through my
personal research, and out of desperation decided to
reach you through this medium.I will give you more
information as to this regard as soon as you reply.
I repose great confidence in you hence my approach to
you due to security network placed on my day to day
affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so that
is why I decided to contact you and I hope you will
not betray my confidence in you. I have deposited the
sum of 30.000.000 million dollars with a security firm
abroad whose name is witheld for now until we open
communication.I shall be grateful if you could receive
this fund into your account for safe keeping. This
arrangement is known to you and my son Ahmed alone, so
my son will deal directly with you as security is up
my whole being.I am seriously considering to settle
down abroad in a friendly atmosphere like yours as
soon as this fund get into your account so that I can
start all over again if only you wish, but if it is
impossible,just help me in diverting this fund into
your account which will accrue you 30% of this fund.
Please honesty is the watch word in this transaction.I
will require your telephone and fax numbers so that we
can commence communication immediately and I will give
you a more detailed picture of things. In case you
dont accept please do not let me out to the security
as I am giving you this information in total trust and
confidence .I will greatly appreciate if you accept my
proposal in good faith. Please expedite action by
sending your reply to my son email address below.

Sincerely Yours,

HAJIA MARIAM ABACHA.

        REPLY TO: masheba100@netscape.net

             ATTN.THE M/DIRECTOR

SIR,
   My name is Masheba Stevens, the eldest son of Dr. Dennis Stevens from
Zimbabwe. This letter might come as a surprise to you about where I got
your contact address and how I knew you. I got your address from the
World Private Label and your name was choosen at of many. 

 During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the
supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned
farms for his party members and his followers, he ordered all white
farmers to surrender all their farms to his party members and his
followers. My father was one of the biggest farmers in our country and
because he strongly opposed Mugabe's ideas, Mugabe's supporters invaded
my father's farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing my father and
made away with a lot of items in my father's farm.

 Before his death, my father had deposited with one Security Company in
SOUTH AFRICA, the sum of US$17.5 (Seventeen Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars). This was money he planned to use in
buying new machinery and to set up a new farm in Swaziland. After the
death of my father, I decided to flee my country because any member of
my familiy caught in the country is to face political procecution.

 I decided to contact a reputable/individual that will assist us to move
this money out of NETHERLANDS into the regular banking system. For your
role in this transaction, I have agreed to offer you 10% of the total
sum for your assistance, 5% will be mapped out for any expenses that may
be incurred in the course of this transaction and 85% will be for me and
my family to invest in your country.

 All I want you to do is to help us finish this transaction and the same
time help us to invest the money into a lucractive business in your
Country .Please get ack to me so that we discuse more concerning this
business proposal. Note that this transaction is 100% risk free. You
should however treat this transaction with absolute confidentiality.

 Mugabe may have succeeded in driving us outside,I forgive him as a
Child of God But future will judge him.

Please to feed your eyes GO TO CNN.COM/ZIMBABWE OR BBC.COM 
 N/B: REPLY TO masheba100@netscape.net

     Thanks and God bless.
     Regards,
     Masheba.Steves.

Mr. Ben Manu
Union Bank of Nig. Plc

ATTN:
Perhaps, this proposal might come to you as a surprise, since you have 
neither met or known me before. I will tell you at once what it is all 
about. My name is Mr. Ben Manu , staff of Union Bank of Nigeria; some 
times in 1999, one of our esteemed customers MR. ADII BANTAM, died in an
 air crash, off the Coast of Lagos, before his sudden death he was the 
Chief Executive and Managing Director of Cross Atlantic Oil Company and 
he maintained personal account; both current and savings with us. As at 
the time of his death, he has about US$35 Million in both accounts. 

After his death, our Bank made several efforts to contact his Next of 
Kin without success. We also contacted his Country^Òs Embassy in Nigeria 
(As he is not from Nigeria), who after about three months got back to us,
 saying they could not locate MR. BANTAM^ÒS family or relatives. It was 
at this point we notified the Nigerian Government through the Central 
Bank and the Federal Finance Ministry about Mr.Bantam^Òs Account and my 
Bank was directed to place Mr. Bantam^Òs money in a special account. 

The Government, last week sent us a letter asking us to locate Mr. 
Bantam^Òs relatives and pay them the money or contribute the money to the
 Government to buy arms and ammunitions Government needed to assist the 
civil war presently going on in Liberia one of West African Countries. 
Considering this directives, an extra ordinary meeting of the Board was 
called, and it was resolved that our Bank should not support the plans 
of the Government. I was mandated to as a matter of urgency contact 
anybody I can trust abroad to assist us take the money abroad in the 
name of Mr. Bantam^Òs relative; hence I am sending you this letter even 
though we have neither known or met ourselves. 

My Bank want to present you as the next of kin (relative to Mr. Bantam) 
to the Bank. Your nationality does not matter as you could be his Uncle,
 Cousin, etc from either the mother^Òs side or his father^Òs side. Should 
you accept this proposal, we shall send to you, additional information (Bio
 data) on Mr. Bantam. I am mandated to get the money by all means to any
 account abroad. When you have received the money, it will be shared in 
a manner that will be satisfactory to both yourself and my Bank. 

Our shares can be invested for us for Two years as the case may be under
 your direct control until we give you instructions on what ever to do 
with it. Should you be interested, kindly get back to me through the 
above e-mail clearly stating your private fax and phone numbers, For me 
to provide you with additional information before we begin the fund 
transfer. 

While I urge you to get back to me without much delay; the code should 
be OMEGA. Any communication without this code should be disregarded. 

Kind regards, 
Mr. Ben Manu

Dear Kind hearted friend,

Please pardon me if I have intruded on your privacy. Though it may be
surprising to you to have received this mail encompassing an investment
proposal from me since you do not know me personally, however, I plead
that you should give my case a hearing.

I am the first son of a late rich black farmer from Zimbabwe. My late
father, Mr. Marcus Tekere was murdered as a result of his opposition to
the much heralded politically motivated land dispute between white
farmers and the Zimbabwean government headed by the much dreaded
President Robert Mugabe. As led by my instinct, I decided to contact you
through the usefulness of the internet via e-mail as it is the only
means I can contact somebody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe
for security and safety reasons. However, I apologize if this is not
acceptable to you.

The purpose of this letter like I did mention above is to seek your most
needed assistance in a business venture as a partner in receiving the
deposited consignment containing US$18.5 million made by my late father
as a consignment to an exclusively managed private security company
based in the Netherlands. The total funds were proceeds from our
business foreign accounts in banks, landed properties and selling of our
shares in major companies. These funds when retrieved was to be used to
start off a new business, purchase of lands, new machines and chemicals
for establishment of new farms in Botswana or anywhere of my choice.

After the death of my father, I was continually threatened to abandon my
inheritance and surrender everything to the government of Zimbabwe. I
resisted for awhile, but when the danger became unbearable and I
survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe to the Netherlands where I
am seeking political asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek
asylum was based on the fact that the securities company is located here
in the Netherlands.

I need to transfer this money to a foreign account and invest part of it
in any other good business besides farmlands since the law of the
Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account
or to be involved in any financial transaction. This is why I am seeking
a genuine and reliable partner whose account this money can be
transferred, hence this proposal to you. You have to understand that
this is a genuine proposal which will mutually benefit us both. My
future is based on the success of transaction between my party and the
company and so, I urge you to take it very serious if you are
interested. If you accept to assist me, the company will be legally
informed of you representing me and all documentation procedure will
commence with the assistance of my contact person in the Security
Company.

For your assistance, a princely percentage of 25% of the funds have been
mapped out as your commission. 70% of it is going to be the share coming
to me and the rest of my family while the remaining 5% shall be set
aside to take care of all expenses that might be incurred along the line
by our two parties. I am ready to give a little more percentage on the
condition that this transaction will be concluded in no distance time.
As a sign of my open mindedness, I am ready also to entrust you with the
investment of our own share in your country.

Please, kindly maintain absolute confidentiality in the course of the
transaction for security reasons as I am still been haunted. I do not
expect to hear from you if you are not interested, but if you are,
kindly send your response with your phone number inclusive for further
verbal communication with you. I hope the proposal is self explanatory
and understandable. You can contact me directly through this email
address first.

I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you in
advance as I anticipate your cooperation.

Yours sincerely,

Austin Tekere

INTERNET FAX NO: +1-206-350-5145

EMAIL ADDRESS:INFOMARKTAYLOR@HIGHVELDMAIL.CO.ZA

Greetings,

     I am Mr. Mark Taylor, the Son to the Ex-PRESIDENT CHARLES TAYLOR OF
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA. First, I must solicit your strictest
confidence in this transaction; this is by virtue of its nature as being
utterly confidential and top secret. 

     I must apologize for taking some of your valuable time to explain a
proposal that I believe will be of utmost benefit to both of us. I am
consulting you on behalf of my father Ex-PRESIDENT CHARLES TAYLOR OF
LIBERIA. Who deposited huge sum of money amounting to USD
$255,000,000.00 (Two hundred and fifty five million United States
Dollars) with a security company in EUROPE which was intended for the
purchase of war equipment, but due to the fact that we are currently in
ASYLUM in NIGERIA he requested that I urgently look for a foreign
partner, who could help us immediately claim and invest this funds, as
the western world most especially the united states of America is
demanding that my Father should be tried at the international war crime
tribunal in HAGUES. 

    And looking back to what happened to PRESIDENT SLOBODAN MILOSEVIC OF
YUGOSLAVIA, who has been facing charges in war crime tribunal in HAGUE
over years. These facts you can confirm from the LIBERIAN EMBASSY in
your country or you can request for BBC, CNN, and SKYNEWS, publications
for further proof. 

    I am soliciting your assistance in taking over the ownership of the
fund in your name and invest it on behalf of my family who shall be a
partner (UNDER ANONMITY) in whatever business venture you intend
investing, because of the hunt by international community to freeze my
father^Òs bank accounts and confiscate his assets all over the world. We
are willing to compensate you with a satisfactory percentage of the
money for your cooperation and assistance in this regard.

     This money was kept and lodged in a security vault in a crate
marked ARTIFACTS. For the time being, it is safe and undisclosed.
Therefore, contact me immediately, only if you are able and interested
in assisting my father. Kindly contact me preferably using my personal
email address (infomarketing@indiatimes.com) as soon as possible. 

Thanks for your co-operation; I apologize for encroaching into your
privacy with this e-mail.

Yours sincerely, 

Mr. Mark Taylor.

E-mail: infomark_taylor@tiscali.co.uk

Date:02 - 01 - 04.

ATTN:

     REQUEST FOR YOUR KIND CO-OPERATION/ ASSISTANCE.

This letter might come to you as a surprise because we have not met
before either in person nor by correspondence. I got your contact
through a discreet inquiry you appealed to me, as being quite astute in
private entrepreneurship there is no room for doubt in your ability to
render your solicited assistance involving no risk but your trust and
confidentiality.

I am Mr. Mark Taylor, the son of the deposed president of Liberia,
former African colony of the United States of America. I am making this
contact to you based on the fact that I need your aid to relocate to a
safe haven where my father's personal funds US$55.600.000 only (Fifty
Five Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States dollars Only) all
deposited in Four safety galvanized boxes in a financial institution
which shall be later disclosed to you upon your offer of acceptance.

We have been granted safety by the united states government and that of
the Nigerian government by a meeting held with both presidents on the
10th of July, 2003 at the just concluded Leon Sullivan summit held in
Nigeria, based on their resolution we have been offered political asylum
which will confine us to it's shores for the rest of our lives in the
federal republic of Nigeria by it's president.

What you may hear of my father should you decide to verify may not be of
a good report but he has learnt his lessons the hard way, all I am doing
now is for the sake of my mother and my two sisters of which I pray that
God will not let us suffer the sins of my father. Based on your
solicited assistance my mother and I are prepared to and willing to
consider the percentage you'll want to have from the money for aiding us
in this matter and will welcome your abilities. Upon my arrival in
Nigeria I will provide you with a phone line in which I can easily be
reached, as it is not often convenient for me to make or take calls from
my place of confinement.

More informations will be communicated to you as soon as you indicate
your readiness and the modalities for the movement of the funds are
perfected, then I will be coming over for a short time brake to meet
with you for a detailed discussion on what and how to invest the funds
upon your confirmation on the receipt of the funds.

I anticipate your prompt and committed response through my personal
email as stated above. I urge you to establish cordial contact/
relationship with me; you will understand that I am not a stranger as
such to you but some one designated to fly the colours of life together
with you.

Sincere wishes and best regards,

MR. MARK TAYLOR.

From: MRS LIZZY GALEANO.

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.

I am the above named person from VENEZULA. I married to Dr. ANGEL
GALEANO who worked with VENEZULA embassy in TOGO for nine years before
he died in the year 2000.

We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief
illness that lasted for only Four days. Before his death we were both
born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get
a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against because
of the love I had for him. When my late husband was alive he deposited
the sum of$12Million (Twelve Million U.S. Dollars) with one
finance/security company in Amsterdam Holland.

Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. Recently, my
Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three months due to
cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.
Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church or
better still a Christian individual that will utilize this money the way
I am going to instruct him or her for the children of God.

I want a church that will use these fund to fund churches, orphanages
and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of
God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the
hand that giveth for he can inherit the kingdom of God

I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit
this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don^Òt want
my husband^Òs hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don^Òt
want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death
hence I know where I am going.

I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14
says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I
don^Òt need any telephone communication in this regards because of my
health and because of the presence of my husband^Òs relatives around me
always. I don^Òt want them to know about this development. With God all
things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you
the contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterdam, Holland. I
will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the new
original-Beneficiary of this fund through my lawyer in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands. I want you and the church to always pray for me because the
lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy
Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in truth
and in spirit. Please always be prayerful all through your life.

Please note that any delay in your reply will give me room in searching
for another church or Christian individual for this same purpose because
you are the only person i have contacted for now. Please assure me that
you will act accordingly as I stated here.  Hoping to hearing from you
as soon as possible.

NOTE BELOW:
PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO FORWARD YOUR TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS AND
YOUR FULL NAMES TO ME IMMEDIATELY THROUGH MY EMAIL ADDRESS AND ALSO GIVE
THE LAWYER IN CHARGE A PHONE CALL IN HOLLAND IMMEDIATELY. HE DOES
EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE VERY UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL
LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS NAME, AMEN.

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours in Christ,
MRS. LIZZY GALEANO.

note; you will be presented as our partner who will be fronting for me
and my family in any subsequent ventures.

I and my mother have decided to give 25% to you for your assistance if
you are able to help us claim this consignment, 5% for any expenses that
may be incured during this transaction, and the remaining 70% for my
family.

Please, I need your entire support and co-operation for the success of

I intend to leave the asylum procedure once the consignment is in your
possession.

Dear Sir,

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue
of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though I know
that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and
worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.
i have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you, I am barrister
SENATOR BELLO (ESQ), attorney to Late Engineer Johnson Creek. I came to
know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to
handle this confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence.

MY PROPOSITION

A foreigner, Late Engineer Johnson Creek, an Oil Merchant/Contractor with
the Federal Government of Nigeria, until his death three years ago in a
ghastly air crash, banked with the Union Bank Plc. Lagos, my client had a
balance of US$9.5M (Nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars only) which the bank now unquestionably expects it to be claimed by
any available foreign next-of-kin of the Late beneficiary. Fervent valuable
efforts are being made by the Union Bank to locate his next-of-kin without
success and since I am his attorney, a letter was sent to me to provide his
next of kin or relatives, which I tried but proved to no avail.

It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any
of Late Engr. Johnson Creek's next-of-kin (he had no wife and children) that
the management under the influence of the chairman and member of the board
of directors, Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that the fund should be
declared "UNCLAIMABLE" until the next-of-kin of late Engr. Johnson Creek
comes to claim the fund.

So my confident in the bank and I now seek your permission to have you stand
as a next-of-kin to Late Engr. Johnson Creek so that the funds would be
released and paid into your bank account as the beneficiary next-of-kin, all
documents and proves to enable you get this fund US$9.5m will be carefully
worked out by me and more so we are assuring you of a 100% risk free
involvement. Your share stays while the rest would be for my confident and
myself. I will meet with you in your country to get what belong to my
confident and I upon the completion of this transaction.

My partners and I have agreed that upon the successful conclusion of
this transaction the three parties will meet for the final disbursement
of this US$9.5m. If this proposal is OK by you and you do not wish to
take undue advantage of the trust, we hope to bestow on you and your
company, then kindly get back to me immediately via all the above
contacts for security reason, Furnish me with your most confidential
telephone, fax number and exclusive bank particulars so that we can use
these information to apply for the release and subsequent transfer of
the funds in your favour.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated co-operation.

Yours faithfully
SENATOR BELLO (ESQ)

              STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT.

I am MR, ROY ZONDEKI a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an
Executive Accountant with the South Africa DEPARTMENT OF MINERAL
RESOURCES AND ENERGY. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium
to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is
due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.

I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the
execution of the deal described Here under for the benefit of all
parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature
of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top
officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling
Twenty - One Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($21,500,000.)
which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of
a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a
reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we
are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service
Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your
importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $21.5m represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which
we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in
the Tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval
to remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any foreign bank
account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice
Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges
of the former contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you
be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will
be 25% of the $21.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and
miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part
provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your
area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of
this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately by e-mail
address whether or not you are interested in this deal.

If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to
carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are
in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you
can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be

SAVE  A   SOUL
Dear Sir ,

You may be surprise to receive this Email from me since you do not know
me personally.

However, I would like to introduce myself. I am MR PITTSON ANDERSON Jr,
the son of DR WILLIAMS ANDERSON who was murdered few months ago in
Zimbabwe as a result of land dispute. Before the death of my father, he
had taken me to AMSTERDAM to deposit the sum of Twenty Million United
States dollars (US$20,000,000) in a security company, as he foresaw the
looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money in question was deposited in a box
as Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company.

The proposed amount was meant for  the purchase of new machines and
chemicals for the farms and establishment of  new farms on Swaziland. As
you may be aware this land problem came into force when Zimbabwe president
Mr. Robert Mugabe Introduced the Land Reformed Act of which my father rich
farmers and some black farmers where affected. This resulted to the
killing and Mob action by Zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the
society,infact, a lot of people were killed because of this Land Reformed act of
which my dad was one of the victims. It is against this  background that
my family and I who are currently staying in Amsterdam, I decided to
transfer my father money to a foreign account. Since the Dutch  law prohibit a
refugee (asylum seeker) to open any account or be involved in any
financial transaction. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with  the
responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where the money
could be transferred . I am faced with the dilemma of investing this amount of
money in Holland for the fear of going through the same experience in
future since both countries have similar history. Moreover, The Netherlands
foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment from asylum seekers. As a
businessman, whom I have entrusted my future and my family in his hands

I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to
assist me and my family, all I need you to do for me is to make
arrangement and come to AMSTERDAM ,THE NETHERLANDS, so that we can open
the non-resident account which will aid us in transferring the money
into any account you will nominate overseas. This money I intend using
for investment. I have options to offer you, first you can choose to
have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for the
transaction, or you can go into partnership for a proper profitable
investment of the money in your country. Which ever option you choose,
feel free to notify me. I have mapped out 5% of this money for all
expenses incurred in processing the transaction.

If for some reasons you do not prefer a partnership, I am willing to
give you 25% of the money while the remaining 70% that is meant for me,
will be for the investment in your country. Please, contact me on the
Email so we can discuss further and a chance for you to ask me any
question you may have in mind, while you maintain the absolute secrecy
required in the transaction.

I wait to hear from you as soon as possible.

Best Regards


MR PITTSON ANDERSON

ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF REAL ESTATES.

Dear sir,

I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed
properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and
Finance Allocation of the Federal Ministry of works and Housing in
Nigeria.

Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would want
the transaction to be as strictly confidential as possible. He further
requires his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, until the
completion of the transaction. Hence our desire to have an overseas
agent.

I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as
our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction.

The deal in brief is that the funds with which to carry out our proposed
investments in your country is presently in a coded/ secured account
with the Nigerian Apex Bank and we need your assistance to transfer the
funds to your country or any safe account outside your country in a
convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put
the funds into use. For this you shall be considered to have executed a
contract for the Ministry.

The contract sum of which shall run into US$15.5Million of which your
share shall be 30%, if you agree to be our overseas agent. Your area of
specialisation does not matter in this transaction, all that is required
of you is a safe account and your willingness to assist us acquire real
estates in your country.

As soon as payment is effected and the amount mentioned above is
successfully transferred into your account, we intend to use our own
share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too, you shall serve as
our agent .

It might interest you to note that last year, a similar transaction was
carried out with one MR. CHIENCHEN YU of Taiwan, but after securing the
payment approvals, and payment effected, MR.CHIENCHEN YU changed his
numbers and addresses, and was no where to be found on our getting to
Taiwan. That was how we lost US$7.5Million. So this time around , I will
be with you before the remmittance is made into your provided account to
avoid a re-occurrence and allow trust to play a very minimal role until
performance is achieved.

You are requested to communicate your acceptance or otherwise of this
proposal, through my private e-mail account as it appears, after which
we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction
through.

If however, you are not disposed to assist, kindly delete/detroy this
letter in view of the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and
interest of personalities involved.


Thank you in anticipation of your co-operation.

Your's sincerely,

Chief Oyinbolowo Eko.

Dear Sir,

I am well confident of your capability to assist me in a transaction for
 mutual benefit of both parties,(me and you) I am also believing that 
you will not expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about
to establish with you. I have decided to contact you with greatest 
delight and personal respect.

Well, I am GABRIEL KAMARA SANKOH , Son to FODAY SANKOH who was arrested 
by the ECOMAOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE months ago in my country Sierra Leone.

Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided in me and ordered 
me to go to his underground safe and move out immediately, with a 
Deposit Agreement and Cash Receipt he made with a security Company in
COTONOU where he deposited two Iron Box containing USD$ 35 million 
dollars cash and 500kgs of Gold dust . This money was made from the sell
of Gold and Diamond by my father and he have already decided to use 
this money for future investment of the family.

Thereafter, I rushed down to cotonou with these two documents and 
confirmed the deposit of the box by my father.

Also, I have been granted political stay as a Refugee by the Government 
of COTONOU. Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for
a trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this money from 
COTONOU immediately for investment.

Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to transfer this fund into
your Account, but I will demand for the following requirement:
(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where this fund will be
transferred to in your country or another neaarby country where 
taxation will nottakegreat toll on the money?

(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my travelling papers after 
this transfer to enable me come over to meet you in your country for
the investment of this money?

(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable business venture 
that would not requiremuch technical expertise in your country where 
part of this fund will be invested?

Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as it will enable me 
to establish a stronger business relationship with you hence I will like
you to be the general overseer of the investment thereafter. Iam
a Christian and I will please, want you to handle this transaction based
on the trust I have established on you.

For your assistance in this transaction, I have decided to offer you 30%
percent commission of the total amount at the end of this business. The
security of this business is very important to me and as such, I would 
like you to keep this transaction very confidential.

I shall expect your contact through this email box com).

Thank you and God bless you

Gabril Kamara Sankoh

Dear Friend,

I am Mr. yank domas makabo and my sister is Miss Rose domas makabo, we
are the children of late Chief domas makabo Kotobe from Sierra Leone.

I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your
assistance to transfer our cash of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000.000.00)
now in the custody of a private Security trust firm in Europe the money
is in trunk boxes deposited and declared as family valuables by my late
father as a matter of fact the company does not know the content as
money, although my father made them to under stand that the boxes
belongs to his foreign partner.

Source of the money:

My late father Chief Domas makabo a native of Konol District in the
Northerh province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra
Leone Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father,
this money was the income accrued from Mining Co-operation's over draft
and minor sales.

Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of Major Paul
Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that
almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power
of the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My
father had already made arrangement for us that is my mother, my little
sister and myself to be evacuated to Abidjan Cote d' Ivoire with the
CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT issued to him by a security firm in South Africa
with a sister security firm in Europe.

During the war in my country,and following the indiscriminate looting of
Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone
mining coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed.

My father including other top Government functionaries were attaked and
killed by the rebels in November 2000 because of his relationship with
the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

As a result of my father's death, and with the news of my uncle's
involvement in the air crash in January it dashed our hope of survival.

The untimely deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related
complications of which she later died in the hospital after we must have
spent a lot of money on her early this year. Now my 18 years old sister
and myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care
or help. Without any relation, we are now like refugees and orphans.

Our only hope now is in you and the boxes deposited in the Security
Firm. To this effect,I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings
ways.

1. To assist me claim this boxes from the security Firm as our
beneficiary.

2. To transfer this money (USD$10.M) in your name to your country.

3. To make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on our
behalf in your country and you, our Adviser/ Manager For your
assistance,

I have agreed with my younger sister that 20% of the total amount will
be for your effort and another 10 % to cover all the expenses that may
incur during the business transaction.

Last,I urge you to keep this transaction strictly confidential as no one
knows our where about.

Please as you show your willingness, Forward to us your full name,
address and Tel/Fax numbers, to me via my private e-mail address as
indicated below,this is for security reasons as I will only be accessing
my private e-mail earnestly awaiting your response.

Thanks.
May God bless you as you assist us.
Mr.   yank domas makabo

  Greetings,

I crave your indulgence as I contact you in such a surprising manner.

But I respectfully insist you read this email carefully as I am
optimistic it will open doors for unimaginable financial reward for both
of us.

This business transaction might not fall within the wide spectrum of
your business activities, but I plead for your assistance, as your flair
for profitable business is needed.

permit me to introduce myself, I am Mr Lexi A Kosoko Manager, Access
Bank of South Africa ,I am sending this email to ask for your support
and co-operation to carry out this business opportunity in my
department.

Every five years, South Africa banks transfer to its treasury millions
of dollars of unclaimed deceased depositors funds in compliance with the
banking laws and guidelines, in majority of cases with reference to my
bank-Access Bank of south Africa.Plc, the money normally runs into
several millions of dollars.

A foreigner, Late Engineer James Wayne, an Oil machant/Contractor in
Nigeria,until his death four years ago in a ghastly air crash has a
closing balance of US20,500,000.00(twenty Million,Five Hundred Thousand
Dollars)Ever since his death and up till this time of writing, no
next-of-kin or relation of his has come forward to claim his money with
us.all efforts have been made by Access Bank to get in touch with any of
the Wayne's family or relatives but proved to no avail.

Naturally, as long as James money remains unclaimed, the bank remains
richer in free funds with his money. However, with my position, I can
present you to claim the fund as a relative/next of kin if you agree
with me on private basis. Yes, I can present you.

The request for you as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the
fact that the customer was a foreigner and a South African cannot stand
as next of kin to a foreigner,Hence, I plead for your assistance with
the intention of getting this unclaimed money amounting to
US20,500,000.00 (twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars Only)
transferred into a mpany/private bank account that you will present.

You stand to gain 20% percentage of the fund and 5% for any exspencies
that is likely to be incured in course of realising the objective of
this transaction , if you agree to help me actualize this opportunity; I
will not contact any other company or person until I am convinced that
you are not interested in this proposal.

Contact me immediately indicating your willingness and also give your
direct and confidential fax and phone numbers for the effective
communication that this transaction requires.  As i am currently on six
months studie leave in holland.

I will furnish you with the procedure and also enlighten you on how the
funds will be disbursed and shared on receipt of your response. I will
also require your advice in the areas of investment as I plan to
establish a business venture in your country with my share. Remember
that a business of this nature needs to be kept confidential.

Yours Sincerely,

Mr.Lexi  A  kosoko

Dear sir,

In search of a competent person who would handle issues with utmost good
faith and matured confidentaility, i deceided to enlist into your
service

My is James Banana son of former Zimbabwean President, Reverend Canaan
Sodindo Banana who died on monday 10th november 2003.My late father was
president of Zimbabwe from 1980 -1987.He was succeded by the then prime
minister Robert Mugabe who because of political motives supported my
late father former aides and accused him of sexual harrasement with same
sex (homosexuality) which carries a ten years sentence in Zimbabwe.

After an eleven days trial we fled to Botswana after receiving
information that Robert Mugabe and his cohorts are after our lives and
properties thinking my father was supporting the opposition party.My
father's eleven account in Germany,Luxemburg,swizerland was frozen by
Government of my country.It is only this fund that my father deposited
with this security company declared as personal values that we depend on
as our future survival

My late father went back to zimbabwe were he was convicted for two years
by the help of former south African president Nelson Mandela

To summarise this story, my late father decided to deposit the sum of
$17,200,000USD (seventeen million two hundred thousand united states
dollars) with a private security firm in europe with my name as the
beneficiary.

Since my father is dead now and my mother is seriously ill, I consider
it worthwhile to look for a partner who will assist us in securing the
release of this deposit.For this transaction we will give out 16% for
the assistance, 50% share for possible help on investing in any reliable
venture, 2% to buy personal properties like a house and cars etc when we
relocate to your country.

If you would want to proceed under these terms, please reply for
detailed information.

If you do not accept my offer,please in good fate treat with utmost
confidentiality .

A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers for more
confidential communication will be highly appreciated.

Regards ,
James Banana.

Personal Business Proposal.
Good Day,

With warm hearts I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope
this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to
receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction,
which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.

My name is Felix Kamala the son of Mr. A.Y Kamala, a farmer from
Zimbabwe, murdered in the land dispute in my country. As led by my
instinct, I decided to contact you through email, after searching for
contacts via the internet, as it is the only means I can contact anybody
since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for now. I apologize if this
is not acceptable to you.

The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a
business venture. Due to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, as
a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act
Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black
farmers. Actually all white farmers were asked to surrender their farms
to the government for re-distribution and infact to his political party
members and my father though black was the treasury of the farmers
association and a strong member of an opposition party that did not
support the president's idea.

Thereafter he then ordered his party members and the police under his
pay row to invade my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm.
They killed my father and took away a lot of items from his farm.  After
the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my father
handed us over his will documents with instructions from my father that
we should leave Zimbabwe incase anything happen to him. The will
documents has a certificate of deposit, confirming a cash deposit
totaling Fifteen million five hundred thousand united state dollars.
[15.5m] Kept in custody for us in a security company unknown to the
company that the content is money hence it was deposited as personal
belongings. This money was deposited with this Private Security Company
for safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase of
land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in Botswana.

This violent and barbaric act by Mugabe has since led to the death of my
beloved mother and kid sister and other innocent lives. I was
continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father after he
was murdered. I resisted for a while, but when the danger became
unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe with the
help of my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from Australia also a
farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left with his family
following this ugly development I have tried to reach him but all to no
avail. I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking
political asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is
because the security company from South Africa, has a branch here, I
have contacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in
Johannesburg here, which they have since done.

Therefore I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part of
the money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum
seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial
transaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable partner,
whose account this money can be transferred, hence this proposal to you.
You have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big and
brave one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of the
safe keeping of this money. If you accept to assist me, all I want you
to do for me, is to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from
the security company's office here in The Netherlands, as it has now
been transferred from Johannesburg, South Africa to their branch here.
The company will be legally informed of you representing me.

For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose
to have 20% of the money for your assistance, and helping me open an
account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into
partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in
your country. Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your
reply. I have also set aside 1 % of this money for all kinds of expenses
that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4% for Charity
donation. If you prefer to accept the 20% for your moral and financial
assistance then the balance will be left in the account here for me.

Please, I want you to maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this
transaction. Your reply should be sent to my private email address only
felixkamala1@indiatimes.com. I look forward to your reply and
co-operation, and I thank you in advance as I anticipate your
co-operation.

Sincerely Yours,
Felix Kamala.

URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL:

Dear Friend,

Good day to you,firstly my name is Mr.Peters Mayoka.

My father was the chairman of contract review panel in my country before
the problem of the land reform program in my country Zimbabwe. Before
the escalation of the situation in Zimbabwe my father recovered
$28.500,000 Million US dollars from over inflated contracts by some
government officials. But he was a member of the opposition party the
MDC (Movement for Democratic Change), and the ruling Party, (ZANU PF)
has been against us.

So he had to flee the country for Europe(THE NETHERLANDS)which I am
currently seeking political asylum.

Before the escalation of the situation in Zimbabwe he had not reported
the recovery of his findings to the panel. So this money was in his
possession and I lodged it in a security company in Africa and currently
this money has been moved to their security branch in Europe. I and my
father have been trying to seek a partner, but it has been difficult for
us it was in this proccess my decided to go to Africa where he was
arressted and died in jail.

So it is as a result of this I am seeking you to help me make claims of
this fund($28.5m) in Europe as the beneficiary and transfer the money to
your account or any account of your choice, So that we can share this
money.

I have agreed to offer you 20% of this money for your assistance, and
70% would be mine and the other 10% would be set aside for any expenses
that we may incure during the course of this transaction. And part of my
60% would be invested in your country in any profitable business
proposed by you. We have never met, but I want to trust you and please
do not let me down when this fund finally gets into your account. Please
if you are interested, get to me through the email address to enable me
feed you with more details and necessary documentations.

I will be very gratefully as well if you can send to me your telephone
numbers to enable contact on the telephone.

Note: You can reach me on this e-mail address.(petersmayoka@netscape.net)

Please treat this as confidential.

Yours faithfully,

P.MAYOKA.

Greetings,

I am Engineer Steve Martins, a Director of the Contracts Award and
review Department with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC). I am contacting you on this business of transferring the sum of
US$35.5 THIRTY FIVE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS only) into
a safe foreign account and the need is very urgent.

I got your contact from the Nigerian Chambers of Commerce and
international family directory and it is with business trust that made
me to contact you on this matter. 

I write to solicit for the transfer of this money into your account.
This Money was generated from an over Invoiced contract sum in my
corporation (NNPC).I am contacting you for your help and partnership for
the following two reasons:

1. As a civil servant, I am not permitted to own foreign accounts due to
civil service code of conduct.

2. My present financial resources as a civil servant will not be
sufficient for me to handle the transfer alone successfully without
financial assistance from a reliable foreign partner abroad. 20% of this
sum would be for you as compensation for using your Bank account in
transferring this money, 5% would be used to reimburse the expenses made
by both parties during the processing of the transferring which
include,telephone bills, travelling expenses and fees. While 75% is for
me.

Please note that I will arrange to meet with you immediately after the
successful conclusion of the transfer, the 75% share of mine will be
used for investment overseas. Your assistance and co-operation is highly
needed. I assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free.

If you are interested I will require your banking information as
mentioned below:

1. Name to be used as beneficiary and beneficiary's address.

2. Your private and confidential telephone/ fax number(s)

3. Your banking details and address, your bank Telephone and fax
number(s).

4. Or if you are not comfortable with providing your existing account,
you can within the shortest possible time, confidentially open an
entirely new (Virgin) account for the transaction. I would prefer this
arrangement.

I hope to conclude this business with you within the next fourteen- (14)
working days. Looking forward to your anticipated and urgent positive
response via this

e-mail stevemartins@fsmail.net 

Best regards,

Engineer Steve Martins

 REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN A FINANCIAL TRANSACTION.

I am interested in your partnership in business. This business proposal
I wish to introduce you with is of mutual benefit and entirely based on
mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of confidentiality as regard
this transaction.

I am representing the board of the contract award and monitoring
committee of the Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources. I am seeking
your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US$130,500,000.00 (One
Hundred and Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)
into your private/company account.

The fund came about as a result of a contract awarded and executed and
on behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two
foreign contractors to the tune of US$380,000,000.00 (Three Hundred and
Eighty Million United States Dollars).  But in the course of
negotiation, the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the
cost of US$249,500,000.00 (Two Hundred and Forty-nine Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to my benefit unknown to the
contractor.

This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the
Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our
Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval. As a civil
servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law to
operate an account outside the shores of Zambia. Hence this message to
you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your account
details as a beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the
Bulgarian contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of
US$130,500,000.00 (One Hundred and Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars) into your provided account.

On actualization, the fund will be disbursed as stated below. 20% of the
fund will be for you as beneficiary 80% of the fund will be for Us. All
logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth
actualization of the transaction within the next few working days of
commencement. For further details as to the work ability of this
transaction, please reach me as soon as possible for further
clarification contact me on my email address below:

robertla@zwallet.com
Thank you and God bless as I await your urgent response.
Yours Sincerely,
Mr.Robert Larry

Dear friend,
I am sorry to encroach in your privacy, please permit me to introduce
myselfto you.
My name is Mariam Ajao omotoriola, I am the eldest daughter of late
engr.Omotoriola Ajao, I am 22 years old and a final year students of
mathematics
in the university of Ibadan.I lost both parents in a plane crash on the
4thof may 2002 in the city of Kano, Nigeria.My late father engr.omotoriola
ajao was the then Area Manager of petroleum pipeline marketing cooperation
(PPMC) before
his death. He was a wealthy man, and infact a model. Before his death, he
had about 3 petrol station and numerous properties in the country. But after
his death,his family member teamed up and sold all his properties both fixed
and
current,and now we are left with nothing. About two weeks ago, my father?s
personal lawyer, Thomas Emoson (SAN) contacted us and made us understand
that my late father has some amount of money to the tune of ($3.2 million
usd),Three million two hundred thousand united state dollar in a suspense
account in a finance house in London. He went further to say that he has the
legal power as my fathers attorney to release all documents that will enable
us make claims
of the fund, but that the only problem we will have is that we will have to
look for an honest, God fearing foreigner who will act as my fathers partner
in business so as to make claims of the fund.
Consequently, I also intend to donate part of this fund to the motherless
babies and orphanage once we are able to claim the fund because as an orphan
I
have suffered so much, and I know what it takes for one to stay without
parents.
This is the reason why I decided to seek for your assistant and cooperation
to help us make claims of my father property. I have attached the obituary
announcement of my late parents and other deceased member of staff of the
company as published in (THIS DAY), one of Nigerian dailies. As soon as
I receive your positive response, I will inform my fathers lawyer so that he
can
reach you and explain what is expected of you in this matter. I urgently
await your swift response.
Regards
Mariam Ajao.

Dear friend,

I am Mr John Eze, a native of Kano in Nigeria and I
am an Executive Accountant with the Nigeria ministry of mineral
resources and energy.
I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the
execution of a deal described here under for the benefit of all
parties and I hope you we keep it as a top secret because of the
nature of this transaction. Within the department of mining and
natural resources where I work as an accountant and with the
co-operation of four other top officials we have in our possession
an over due payment bills totally twenty million five hundred
thousand united state dollars ($50.5m) which we want to transfer
abroad with the assistance and co-operation of a foreign
company/individual to receive such funds, also we are handicapped in
the circumstances as the Nigeria civil code of conduct does not
allow us to operate off-shore account hence your importance in the
whole transaction.
This amount represent the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my department contraction firm, which we the
officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract
cost have been paid to the original contractors, leaving the
balances in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles
gotten approval to remit by Key Tested Telegraphic Transfer (K .T.T)
to any foreign bank you we provide by filling an application through
the justice ministry here in Nigeria for the transfer of rights
and privileges of former contractors to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to proposed that,
should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of
the sum we be 25% of the total sum, 70% for us and 5% for taxation
and other expenses .I we like to inform you that the transaction of
this deal is save there is nothing to fear about. Provided you treat
it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality on your part. Also your
area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this transaction.

I have all my confidence and trust in you and I hope you we not
disappoint me. I and my colleague on a year study leave here in
Europe. Content me if you are in interested in this deal and also if
you are not to enable me know my stand. I and my partners are in
position to make the payment of this fund possible provided you can
assure us the safety of our share.
Please remember to treat this matter confidentially because we are
still in service and remember once again that time is important in
this business. I wait in anticipation for your full co-operation.
Accept my special regards.

Mr John Eze. (Acct)

Dear Friend.

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I
believe everyone will die someday.

My name is Wilson duke, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been
diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer which was discovered very late, due to
my laxity in carrying for my health. It has defiled all forms of
medicine, and right now I have only about a few months to live,
according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared
for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was
never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all
this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have
or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second
chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from
how I have lived it.

Now that God ! has called me, I have willed and given most of my
properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as
well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept
my soul and so, I have decided to give arms to charity organizations and
give succour and confort to the less priviledged in our societies, as I
want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth.

So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the
U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has deteriorated so
badly, I cannot do this my self anymore. I once asked members of my
family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have
there to charity organization and to the less priviledged in Bulgaria
and Pakistan, and Africa they refused and kept the money to themselves.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of
twenty four million dollars that I have with a Security Company in
Europe for safe keeping. I will want you to help me collect this deposit
and disburse it to some charity organizations and to the less
priviledged.

Please send me a mail to indicate if you will assist me in this
disbursement.

I have set aside 10% for you for your time and patience.

You can e-mail me at: wilsonduke11@netscape.net

While I await to hear from you, may God be with you and your entire family.

Remain blessed.

Wilson duke.

I wish to introduce myself as Mr. JERRY BOZIMOR, 39
 years old AgriculturalEngineer and professional
 farmer. I am from Zimbabwe, a native of Harare and
 member of the Zimbabwe Movement for Democratic Change(MDC).
 I am interested in doing business with your company
 particularly by venturing into any viable business
 venture as an investment outlet, especially, in the
 field of Agriculture,finance and Engineering
 technology. I am in possession of some money, US$12,250,000
 Million ( Twelve million Two hundred and fifty thousand United States
 Dollars) that
 I wish to invest as a matter of urgency through your
 Company.

 If you are conversant with public issues, my country
 is undergoing terrible civil strife right now. The
 incumbent president Robert Mugabe, declared war on
 white farmers through his land re-distribution program
 which simply but, means grabbing land from us and
 redistributing them to his cohorts and supporters,
 action which is solely carried out for political
 reasons.

 Many of us were brutally murdered and presently, the
 government has given pardon to the Perpetrators of
 such crimes and is also going ahead in persecuting
 many of us including my immediate Family. Many of us
 have left the country and his latest threat to
 persecute those he sees as political heavy weights of
 the former regime of which my family prominently
 belonged have made us decided to leave as well.

 We are presently in the Netherlands and are in dire need
 of a good fellow who will help us invest our
 wealth and family asset which physical value stands at
 Twelve million two hundred and fifty thousand United States Dollars,
  ($12,250,000.)
 It is my desire to transfer the said sum through your offshore bank
 account.
 I believe it is much safer for me having transferred the money to the
 holdings of
 a security and finance firm here in the Netherlands.
 The money is in physical cash disguised to avoid detection
 and registered as family treasures and valuables.

 Terms of the transfer shall be discussed and I shall
 be willing to offer you 15% of the said Sum as
 commission and 5% to defray expenses that may be
 incurred during the course of the transfer.

 Thank you so much for your time.

  JERRY BOZIMOR.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am an accountant and a member of the Contract Tender Board (CTB) of
the Petroleum, Oil & Gas Corporation of South Africa (PTY) Ltd also
known as PetroSA. I am presently on a special diplomatic duty in the
South Africa foreign office in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I got your
contact through discreet inquiries in my search for a reliable
individual or company who can handle a strictly confidential transaction
that involves the transfer of a reasonable sum of money to a foreign
account. I have no doubt in your ability to handle a financial business
of considerable amount, which will form the bedrock of an extensive
business partnership in due course. In unfolding this proposal, I want
to count on your status that you will handle this transaction with all
maturity and confidentiality it deserves.

The money we want to transfer to you amount to a total of
US$15.500,000.00 (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars) only. It was extracted from various over-invoiced contracts,
masterminded by myself and some of my colleagues for our mutual benefit
when the contracts was awarded by the Contracts Tender Board (CTB) of
the Petroleum, Oil & Gas Corporation of South Africa (PTY) Ltd. The
above over-invoiced sum has been drafted and short-listed for final
payment to a foreign bank account and it has been reflected as an amount
to be paid to a foreign contractor for contract that has been executed
for the Petroleum, Oil & Gas Corporation of South Africa (PTY) Ltd. The
money is currently floating in the suspense account of the South Africa
Reserve Bank (SARB) awaiting claim by a foreign partner, which status we
absolutely want you to assume. The code of conduct bureau in South
Africa has made it an offence for civil servants like us to(A) operate a
foreign account(B) own a foreign company and(C)take up contract while
still in active service. This is why we need your assistance.

Now is the optimum period to realize this fund following the recent
directive given to all-federal parastatals and corporations to pay off
all foreign debts. I therefore seek your assistance to allow the
remittance of this fund to be made to your personal or company?s bank
account. We have agreed that 30% of the total sum will be given to you
and 70% will be for me and my colleagues after the successful
transference of the fund to your bank account.

I want to assure you that all modalities for the successful transfer of
this money to your account has been perfectly worked out and as such,
there is no fear of failure. However, I would want to believe that you
are honest enough and will not raise any misgiving attitude In any
aspect of the transaction. Most importantly, you will keep this
transaction very confidential so as not to tarnish the confidence
reposed on these officials by the nation?s financial house. If this
proposal interests you, kindly indicate your willingness to me through
email Address: allenmon7@netscape.net for immediate commencement of the
transaction.

To enable this fund to be successfully transferred to your account, you
will also have to provide the following information:

1. Your company name and address that you wish to use as the beneficiary
to claim the fund.

2. Your private telephone, fax Numbers.

3. Your Bank name, address and account number where you would want the
money remitted.

More information about the remittance of the fund to your account will
be sent to you when I receive your response. Meanwhile, your swift
response will help us to meet the ultimatum given to all foreign
contractors in this payment quarter to ensure that funds are claimed. We
also wish to discuss investment strategy with you. We have the plan of
investing part of our fund in real estate with your assistance in your
country. Please treat this information as confidential.

Yours faithfully,

Mr. Allen mongan.

Fax: 234-1-7596575 
Lagos-Nigeria 

DEAR SIR/MADAM I am Dr.Martins Ego. Chairman of the Tender Committee of
the 
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). My Committee is principally

concerned with payment of all contract awarded from 1998 to date, in order
of 
priority as regard capital projects of the NNPC. The information we gathered

from the Foreign Office of the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and Industries
is 
so positive as to convince us that you would provide us with solution to
a money 
transfer deal valued at Thirty One Million United States Dollars and
 subsequently

a joint business venture. In the course of our duties as values, and project

inspectors for the on-going liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) project, we have
over-invoiced 
the value of some jobs done by foreign contractors for the NNPC to the tune

of US$31M. As follows: - Computer optimization and Installation $16,000.000.00

Installation of 250,000.00 Monax Turbine$10,000.000.00 Turn Around Maintenance

$5,000,000.00 Our aim of over-invoicing this payment is to divert the excess

amount to a discrete account abroad. This fund is now floating in suspense
account 
at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). This is the fund my colleagues and
I have 
decided to transfer into your account since we, as civil servants are not
allowed 
to operate or own foreign account. The money will be shared as follows after

transfer:30% for you (Account Owner) 60% for me and my colleagues10% to
off-set 
both local and international expenses thatWould be incurred in the course
of 
this transaction. To be able to claim the funds, we will be purporting your

company to be the original contractor / beneficiary of the funds so all
procedures 
for international transfer shall be strictly followed, as we have worked
out 
all modalities for a swift and riskfree transfer. 
If this proposal satisfies you, please contact me Through martins_ego01@fsmail.net

or my direct fax line 234-1-7596575 with the following important information.

Bank Name / Address Account Name ,Account NumberTel/Fax Telex of Bank Personal

Phone / Fax Numbers for easy communication. This transaction will last for
14 
working days from the time we submit the required information, as all
 modalities

concerning this transaction have been worked out and it is completely risk
free. 

Please be informed that this subject is classified sensitive. 
Therefore treat the transaction with utmost confidentiality and urgency.
Yours 
Faithfully. 
Dr.Martins Ego.

PETERSON BULINGA
Contracts Award Monitoring Committee.
Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources.
Reply:petersonbulinga@netscape.net

ATTN:,
I humbly wish to solicit for your assistance in a business transaction.

This business proposal I wish to intimate you of will be of mutual
benefit to the both of us and its success is entirely based on mutual
trust, cooperation and a high level of confidentiality.

I am representing the board of the contract award and monitoring
committee of the Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources. I am seeking
your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US$15,000,000.00
(Fifteen Million United States Dollars) into your private/company
account.

The fund came up as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and
on behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two
foreign contractors to the tune of US$180,000,000.00 (One hundred and
Eighty Million United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation,
the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of
US$165,000,000.00 (One hundred and Sixty-Five Million United States
Dollars) to our advantage unknown to the contractor. This contract has
been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is
presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our Board is
in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval.

As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by
law to operate an account outside the shores of Zambia. Hence this
message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your
private/company account details (preferably an empty account) as a
beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the Bulgarian
contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of US$15,000,000.00
(Fifteen Million United States Dollars) into your provided account.

On actualization, the fund will be disbursed as stated below.
1. 20% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary
2. 80% of the fund will be for us.

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth
actualization of the transaction within the next few working days of
commencement. For further details as to the workability of this
transaction, please reach me as soon as possible for further
clarification.

Kindly expedite action, as we are behind schedule, to enable us include
this transfer in the first batch which would constitute the first
quarter payments for the 2004 financial year.

Thank you and God bless as I await your urgent response.

Dear Sir,

Compliments of the season. It is indeed my pleasure to write to you
this letter, which I believe will be a suprise, as we are both
complete strangers.My name is Mr Segun Agbaje, Deputy managing
director of Zentel International Bank Plc.

 I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with
account number 14-255-2004/ZIB/T who perished in a plane crash Korean
Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on  August 6, 2000.
Since the demise of this our customer,I personally has watched  with
keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as
no  one has come to claim his funds of USD4.1m,[Four Million
One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars] which has been with my
branchfor a  very long time.

On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as
the next of kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the
banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than Five
years, because money will be recalled to the bank treasury as
unclaimed after this period.
In view of this I got your contact through my private search in the
internet for your assistant to act as the next of Kin. I will give
you 30% of  the total.

Upon the receipt of your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail
the Application, Bank's fax number and the next step to take. I will
not
fail  to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and
that you
should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can
be
finalized within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a
relation to the deceased.

When you receive this letter. Kindly send your response to my private
e-mail below mail box :segun_agbaje1@uymail.com, signifying your
decision.Including
your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick communication.

Respectfully submitted,

Mr.Segun Agbaje

Dr.Idrissa Diop.
Ministry of Energy ,mines and power
Department of petroleum(S.N.P.C)
Dakar,Senegal.


Dear Sir,

I am.  Dr.Idrissa Diop,Project Director Senegal National Petroleum
Corporation (S.N.P.C) and a Member of Contract Tenders Board of the same
parastatals. Your contact was reliably introduced to me at the Foreign
chamber of commerce and industry in my search for a reliable and trusted
individual and/ or company who can handle a strictly confidential
transaction, which involves Transfer of reasonable sum of money to a
foreign account.

This money results from various contracts awarded by our corporation on
behalf of the Federal Government, which was deliberately over
invoiced/estimated to the tune of US$11,200,000.00 ( Eleven Million, Two
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). After the completion and
commissioning of the contract, the contractual sum was paid to the
contractors, leaving the over invoiced sum in the reserve account with
the Bank. We therefore require the partnership of a foreigner or foreign
firm to assist us in form of a trustee and provide an account for this
transfer.

In the last meeting with my colleagues,it was unanimously agreed that
30% of the total sum would be given to you. 60% for me and my
colleagues, 5% will be mapped out for charity donations, while 5% will
be used to reimburse the expenses that may be incurred during the course
of this transaction.

I assure you that this transaction is 100% (one hundred percent) risk
free, as we have concluded every arrangement to protect the interest of
everyone involved. Likewise all modalities for the successful transfer
of this money have been worked out with the Finance Ministry and the
Bank to facilitate the remittance of this money to any designated bank
account.

However, I will want to believe that you are honest enough and will not
raise any misgiving with respect to this transaction. More importantly,
you will keep this transaction very confidential so as not to jeopardize
ones reputation and ambition.


Thanking you of your prompt and positive response.

kindly contact me through my confidential   email address and call me immediately for the secret details of the transfer.

Best regards .


Dr.Idrissa Diop.
Telephone: 00221 5122631.

Miss Jennifer Makosana
jmakosana@yahoo.com

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL.
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don't know
me personally. I am Miss Jennifer Makosana, the first daughter of Late
Joseph Makosana, who was murdered in a land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your
contact through an internet trade directory here in Italy and I decided to
contact you. I do not know your person but I relied on faith to see me
through.
Black war veterans claiming to be farmers, invaded my father's house on
April 16, 2000 at about 6.32am in Macheke/Virginia district and murdered my
father because of his insistence that white farmers be allowed to retain
their farm lands despite the recently introduced land reforms "Act" in
Zimbabwe by the head of state, Sir Robert Mugabe. Until his death he was
the vice president of the Zimbabwean Farmers' Union (ZFU). It took us so
long to contact you because we had to wait for the appropriate time to do
so. (The reason I will explain to you in details later on.)
Before his untimely death, he had deposited the sum of Nineteen Million,
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars (US$ 19,500,000.00) This money was deposited
in a box as family valuables for security concerns from me and my family.
This fund was meant for the purchase of new machinery and agro-allied
chemicals for the new farms acquired in Swaziland.
This land problem came when our President, Sir Robert Mugabe introduced a
new land act "Modus Operandi" reform which wholly affected the rich white
farmers. A lot of people were killed because of this land reforms "Act" of
which my late father was one of the main targets. My father was solely
targeted because of his support for the white farmers.
Based on this, my family had to spread out; I am now in Italy with my
brother as refugees while my mother and my younger sisters are living in
South Africa as refugees as well. We decided to contact you to assist us in
transferring this money to your account in your country or any part of
the world for investment as the monetary/investment laws of South Africa and
Italy prohibits refugees from running bank accounts or be involved in any
transaction/investment. Based on this, we contacted you hoping that you will
assist us with this transaction in the name of God.
As the only educated daughter, I am saddled with the responsibility of
seeking a genuine and an honest person who will assist us in transferring
this money out of South Africa without the knowledge of my
country(Zimbabwe) government who are bent on taking everything my late
father had after confiscating all his farmlands and investments in Zimbabwe
and Swaziland. We are absolutely left with nothing except the money I
talked about previously.
For your kind assistance, my mother and I are offering you 20% of the funds
after the successful transfer of the funds to your account .5% will be set
aside for any expenses that might result in the process of this transaction,
while 75% will be for my family which will be used for investment in your
country under your direction as we do not know anything about investments.
Please contact me through the e-mail addresses indicated above if this
proposal is of interest to you, while I implore you to maintain absolute
confidentiality required in this transaction. If not, then I humbly
apologise for this infringement on your privacy.
Yours truly,

Miss Jeniffer Makosana.

business Guide and feel you will serve as a reliable
source to be used to achieve this aim, by trusting
under your care the total sum of Thirty million US
dollars (US $30M).

choice in your country was acquired through the
Construction Of  the newly completed Abuja National
Stadium which was used for the  just concluded All
African Games ( COJA )Abuja 2003. During the time the
contract was to be awarded to a foreign contractor, I
used my position and office then as the Senate
President to over invoice the sum of USD.30M from the
main contract sum.

The Construction of the Stadium have been completed
and commissioned the contractor have been paid, then
this over invoiced amount (USD.30M) is what I want to
trust under your care for lucrative investment of your
choice in your country.

to invest such amount of money in my country due to my
position in the Government such amount of money may
attracts some suspicion which may lead to my arrest,
that is why I need your urgent assistance, Please
indicate your interest in the area of a lucrative
business viability in your country.

For working with me to actualize this transaction, I
will give to you 30% of the total fund while 10% will
be used to settle every monetary expenses on the
course of this transaction and the remaining 60% will
be for me.

to my person in the Government as the Former senate
President of Nigeria.

Please indicate your interest by providing me with
your private direct phone line / fax number. And I
assure you that all we be well at the end of this
transaction.

VERY URGENT..PLZ
First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction,
this is by virtue if its nature as being utterly
CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET.
Though I know that a transaction of this
magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried,
but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.
I have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction,
as i have been reliably informed of your discreteness
and ability in transactions of this nature.
I am a Branch Manager with UNION BANK OF NIGERIA PLC.
We had a foreign client Engr. Johnson Creek
who deposited a huge sum of money (US$45million) with our
Bank.Eventually,
this client was among the victims of EGYPTAIR BOEING 767 FLIGHT
NO.990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999 in U.S.A but,
since then we have not had any body coming for
the claims as the next of kin.and I have waited for3-4 years.
A sitaution I have monitored closely with my position
in the Bank.
Now, having monitored this deposit and managed
it over the years before his death,
and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for
the past four years plus,
I have removed the file to my private vault.
I now solicit for your assistance to present you as
the next of kin as every other arrangement has been
concluded by me and ,I am only waiting for a foreigner
to enable me move the fund to his account.And your percentage will be
30%, 10% will be incured to proccess every thing.
This does not have any risk attached to it as all the
internal documentations will be handled by me.
I therefore request you to confirm your interest
and I will furnish you with details.
Your interest will be negotiated before we commence the operation.
I look forward to hearing from you.
God bless you and your family.
Regards,
DR UD. PIUS to drudpius45@yahoo.com

Good day,

I am Isaac Shongwe, Prescient Investment, South Africa. This is an
urgent and confidential business proposition.

On June 14, 2000, a foreign consultant with Global Oil Corporation, Mr.
Alan Baker made a numbered time (Fixed) deposit for twelve calendar
months, valued at US$8,320,000.00, with us. Upon maturity, I sent a
routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a
month, a reminder was sent and finally it was discovered from his
contract employers, Global Oil Corporation that Mr. Baker passed away.

On further investigation, I discovered that he had no heir and he died
without making a will or a testament. I also discovered that Mr. Baker
did not declare any relative in any of his official documents, including
his deposit paperwork in my possession and all attempts to trace any
relative was fruitless. This investment has been fixed under our
management. No one will ever come forward to claim it. Under South
African law, the money reverts to the Government if nobody applies for
claim over a period of 5 (five) years.

Consequently, my desire is to transfer this funds with the help of a
reliable foreiger, to a foreign bank account. I am writing to you
because I cannot operate a foreign account. Hence, I am seeking for an
individual who can help me safeguard and invest this money. I want to
present you as the beneficiary to this investment so that you claim this
money on my behalf with the help of my attorney. I am willing to pay
something as remuneration for your assistance.

Please provide me with your full names, address, telephone and fax
number so that my attorney process the necessary documents in this
regards that puts you as the beneficiary to this investment. Please
observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this
transaction will be of mutual benefit. If you are interested, reply me
by email ASAP.

Kind regards,
Isaac Shongwe.

Dear Sir, 

I am Mr. Denis Luseni and my sister is Miss Lilian Luseni, we are the
children of late Chief Brewa Luseni from Sierra Leone. I am writing you
in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer our
cash of nine Million Dollars ($9,000.000.00) now in the custody of a
private Security trust firm in Europe the money is in trunk box
deposited and declared as family valuables by my late father as a matter
of fact the company does not know the content as money, although my
father made them to under stand that the box belongs to his foreign
partner. 

Source of the money: 

My late father Chief Brewa Luseni , a native of Kono District in the
Northerh province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra
Leone Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father,
this money was the income accrued from Mining Co-operation's over draft
and minor sales. 

Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of Major Paul
Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that
almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power
of the civilian elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. My
father had already made arrangement for his family thats talking about
my mother, my little sister and myself to be evacuated to Cotonou
Republic of Benin with the CERTIFICATE OFDEPOSIT he made with a security
firm in Europe through the aid of U.N evacuation team. From there we
moved to Netherlands after the death of my mother with the help of the
red cross in Benin Republic. We are now in the Netherlands in political
asylum.

During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting
of Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra
Leone mining coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My
father including

other top Government functionaries were attaked and killed by the rebels
in November 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian
Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. 

As a result of my father's death , and with the news of my uncle's
involvement in the air crash in January it dashed our hope of survival.
The untimely deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related
complications of which she later died in the hospital after we must have
spent a lot of money on her early this year . Now my 19 years old sister
and myself are alone in this strange country ( THE NETHERLANDS)
suffering without any care or help. Without any relation, we are now
like refugees and orphans. 

Our only hope now is in you and the box deposited in the Security Firm
To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways. 

1. to assist me claim this box from the security Firm as our beneficiary

2. to transfer this money (USD$9M) in your name to your country 

3. to make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on our
behalf in your country and you, our Adviser/ Manager

For your assistance, I have agreed with my younger sister that 15% of
the total amount will be for your effort and another 1 % to cover all
the expenses that may incurre during the business transaction, Last, I
urge you to keep this transaction strictly confidential as no one knows
our where about. 

Please as you show your willingness, Forward to us your full name,
address and Tel/ Fax numbers, to me.

earnestly awaiting your response.

TO: deluseni@mail.gr
Thanks. 
May God bless you as you assist us. 
Mr. DENIS LUSENI.

MR. CLIFFORD SMITH
JOHANNESBURG
SOUTH AFRICA

Courtesy of business opportunity, I take liberty anchored on strong desire
to solicit for your assistance on this mutual beneficiary and risk free
transaction with you, which I hope you give urgent attention. To be precise,

I am MR. CLIFFORD SMITH Senior manager of SASFIN BANK Limited
JOHANNESBURG SOUTH AFRICA.

In my department, we discovered an abandoned sum of US$ 25.5 Million
(Twenty five Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) in an
account that belongs to one of our customers who died along with his
entire family in 1988 Lockerbie Pan American Airline plane crash. Since
we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless
somebody applied for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as
indicated in our banking procedures, but unfortunately to no avail
andnobody has come forward to claim the money.

Therefore, upon this discovery that I and other two officials in my
department now decide to establish a cordial business relationship with
you,hence my contacting you.

We want you to purportedly present your good self as the next of kin or
relation of the deceased so that we can release the fund (money) into
your account for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is
coming for it and again we do not want the money to go into the
government account as unclaimed bill .The banking law and procedures
herein stipulates that any accounts abandoned or dormant for a period of
some years is subject to be closed and all money contained therein will
be forfeited to the government treasury account. Now it is being
speculated that the above sum will be transferred into government
treasury account as unclaimed fund on or before May 2004. The reason for
you to present your good self as the next of kin is occasioned by the
fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner.

Mode of Sharing After the successful completion of the transfer is as
follows, for the role you will be expected to play in the whole
exercise, we have agreed to give you Thirty (30%) of the total sum,and
10% has been set aside for the expenses we are going to encounter by
both parties in the process of this transaction and the remaining 60%
shall be for my colleagues and I in support of the aforementioned, you
are urged to reply this letter indicating your readiness and interest to
participate in the business.

After your reply, you will be advised on the next step afterwards. I
quite believe that you will protect our interest by keeping this
business top secret and confidential. Your interest will be equally
protected, as we must maintain maximum confidentiality. Trust to hear
from you on the above TEL NO.OR THROUGH MY PRIVATE EMAIL ADDRESS
"cliffith2@yahoo.com''

Count on your earliest reply.

Thanks

Yours faithfully
MR. CLIFFORD SMITH

 URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL ASSISTANCE .


You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not
know mepersonally.I got your contact through the NETHERLANDS CHAMBER OF
COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, hence i took the initiative of writing you.
Please accept my apology for intruding into your privacy or for any
inconvineces that my letter might caused.

I am LESLIE MUSHASHA, the son of MAWA MUSHASHA, one of the few black
farmers in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in
Zimbabwe.

This land problem arose when the Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe
introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers
and some few black farmers, and this caused a rampage and indiscriminate
killing by some Zimbabwean war veterans and street urchins in the
society,as a result of this a lot of people were killed and my father
happened to be one of them.It is against this background that my family
and I fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and out of fear of been sent
to one of Mugabe's military camp against our will by Mugabe's militial
men and inventually turtured and kill that we decided to seek asylum in
the Netherlands where we are currently staying as political refugee.

Before the death of my father, he deposited with a security company here
in the NETHERLANDS the sum of US $ 18.6 million Dollars (Eighteen
million,Six Hundred thousand United dollars) and I am his next of Kin
which is the more reason why my wife and myself have choosen to seek
asylum here in the Neherlands to futher enable us to lay claim to this
funds. This money was deposited by my father in a box as family
valuables to avoid much demurrage and sundry charges from the security
company. This money according to my father was meant for the purchase of
new machines and chemicals for the Farms and also the establishment of
new farms in Swaziland.

My family and I have decided to seek for a viable partner that will help
us to invest this funds profitably in a viable business venture since
the law of Netherlands prohibits anyone applying for refugee status ( or
seeking asylum) to open any bank account or be involved in any financial
transaction throughout the territorial zone of The Netherlands,until
such time as the application is deemed successful or granted by the
Relevant Dutch Authorities.  I am saddled with the responsibility of
seeking a bussiness partner who will front for us and take charge of
this funds. The dutch authority are not aware that we have such funds
with the security company and we intend to keep this as top secret as it
will affect our asylum status. please note that this transaction is 100%
risk free as I am in possesion of all the relevant document relating to
the funds. i.e THE CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT AND PERSONAL IDENRIFICATION
CODE OF THE FUNDS. Please be inform at this stage that my family and I
have also decided to give you 25% of the tottal funds for your
assistance and 70% will be invested for us in any profitable business
that you think is viable and 5% will be for any cost incurred in the
cause of this transaction. please note that if this percentage is not
agreeable to you we are still open to suggestion and further discussion.
If you accept to assist me and my family please contact me through this
e-mail adress lesliemushasha@netscape.net immidiately for more
comprehensive details.

Thanking you in anticipation of your co-operation.

Yours Sincerely,
LESLIE MUSHASHA.

FROM THE DESK OF MR COLE JOSEPH
47 HILTON AVENUE,
VICTORIAL ISLAND,
LAGOS NIGERIA.

Dear Friend,

I am a director in the foreign affairs department of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC).  I got your email during a
personal research on the Internet and wish to use this opportunity to
notify you of the existence of a certain amount we wish to transfer
overseas for the purpose of investments and importation of goods from
your country.

In May 2001, a contract of sixty-six million United States dollars
($66,000,000) was awarded to a foreign company by my ministry. The
contract was supply, erection and system optimization of supper polyore
200,000-bpsd, system optimization of 280,000-monax axial plants and the
computerization of conveyor belt for Kaduna refinery. With only the
consent of the head of the contract evaluation department, I over
invoiced the contract value by thirty four million United States dollars
($34,000,000).

The contract has been completed long ago and the foreign company fully
paid off.  But in the office files and paper work, the company is still
owed USD34M representing the over invoiced amount. Because this amount
is derived from the award and execution of a foreign contract, there is
no way the money can be paid locally. That is why I contacted you so
that we can do the project together for our mutual benefit.  We have
concluded every necessary arrangement to transfer this amount to a
foreign account as the final phase payment for the said contract. What
we need is your bank account into which we can deposit the money and
after we shall come over there to share the money with you.

We sincerely need an honest person to work with and have agreed to share
the money in the following percentages, 70% will be for us who will
effect the transfer and 30% will be for you whose account is used to
secure the funds.  There is no risk involvement because applications
will be made to the concerned Federal ministries and parastatal with
official approvals given by the Federal government before the Central
bank of Nigeria will be officially empowered to wire the funds to your
account by telegraphic transfer.

If you are interested, contact me by Email through osmund@2by2.net
indicating your full names or company name and address. Your direct
telephone and fax numbers. The name and address of the bank you will
like us to deposit the money, the telephone and fax numbers of the bank,
your account number etc.  Everything has been arranged and I will send
more information about the business transaction to you as soon as I hear
from you. For obvious reasons, please keep the proposal top secret and
highly confidential.

Kind regards,
Cole

Westpac Banking Corporation,
63 St. Mary Axe
London EC3A 8LE

Having obtained your contact from the internet that you have been doing
all what is necessary to deserve trust, coupled with my deep interest to
invest in your country, I decided to contact and solicit your mutual
assistance at all cost.

I am Mr. Gilbert Smith, Branch Manager, Westpac Banking Corporation
London.

On January 6th 2000, one Mr. Claude Brian Best, an American National,a
consultant/contractor with Gardiner & Theobald,a leading firm of project
and cost management consultants, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit,
valued at £9,500,000.00(Nine Million,Five Hundred Thousand Pounds) for
twelve calender months in my Bank Branch.

Upon Maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address
but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers (Gardiner & Theobald) that Mr.
Claude Brian Best died from an automobile accident. On further
investion, it was discovered that he died without making a WILL and all
attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.

On further investigations, it was discovered that Late Mr. Claude Brian
Best did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official
documents, including his Bank Deposit paper work here at the Bank.

The total sum, £9,500,000.00 is still in my bank and the interest is
being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one
will ever come forward to claim it.

In accordance with the Federal banking Laws and constitution, at the
expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of
the Government if nobody applies as the next of Kin to claim the funds.

Consequently, I shall present you as a foreign partner to stand in as
the next of kin to late Mr. Claude Brian Best so that you and I can
benefit from the fruits of this old man's labour.

Upon acceptance of this proposal, I shall send to you the Westpac
Banking Corporation "Next of Kin Payment Application Form" as well as
detailed information on how this deal would be transacted.

We shall employ the services of a solicitor for the drafting of the LAST
WILL & TESTAMENT of Late Mr. Claude Brian Best and to obtain all other
relevant papers in your name for the necessary documentations for
payment approval in my bank headquarters in your favour.

The money will be shared in the ratio:

Sixty percent for me, thirty five percent for you and five percent for
any arising contigencies during the course of this transaction.

I guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that
will protect you from any breach of the law as I will use my position as
the Bank's Branch Manager to secure approvals and guarantee the
successful execution of this transaction.

Please be informed that your utmost confidentiality is required. If this
interests you, please reply me immediately via the private email address
below and please include your private telephone number for voice contact
and fax number so I can provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Email:gil22@zahadum.com 

Awaiting your urgent reply.

Thanks.

Best regards,               
       
Mr. Gilbert Smith

Gooday,

I got your contact address through a reliable source in my search for a
reliable and trustworthy person who will assist me in a business investment
venture in your country. I am Mrs. LUISA EJERCITOR ESTRADA, the wife of Mr.
Joseph Estrada the former president of Philippine located in the south East
Asia. My husband was presently impeached from office by a backed uprising of
mass demonstrators and the senate.

During my husband's regime as president of Philippine, I realized
US$25.540 millions of dollars (Twenty-Five Million, Five Hundred and Forty
Thousand US Dollars) from various contract projects I executedsuccessfully.
I had planned to invest this money for my children's future onreal estate and
industrial production. My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do it
secretly for now.

Before my husband was impeached from office, I concretely and secretly
deposited this money and declared it computer ledger cards with diplomatic
security company that transports valuable goods/consignment through
diplomatic courier service to their offshore offices. The consignments that
are contained in the two trunks are declared are owned by my foreign business partners.

I wish to discuss how much I will offer you if you will be willing to
assist me claim the money and invest it in your country. I want to assure
you that all modalities are put in place and it is a risk free transaction.
I'm trusting you as a God fearing person who will not sit on my lifesaving
fund. This business demands absolute secrecy and confidentiality, thus all
communications for now should be through e-mail because all my phone lines
are connected to the Philippine's telecommunication network services. I will
furnish you with more details when I receive your positive response.

Expecting your urgent reply, through the above email address:
estradaluisa@katamail.com

Thanks.
Best regards,
Dr (Mrs.) Louise Ejercitor Estrada

Dear. SIR/MADAM,


My name is Aruna Guei the son of late General Robert Guei, Ex-Military
head of State of Ivory Coast who was murdered along with the Interior
Minister on the 19th of September 2002. I contacted you because of my
need to deal with persons whom my family and l have had no previous
personal relationships.Since the murder of my father, We have been
subjected to all sorts of harassment and intimidation with lots of
negative reports emanating from the Government and the press about my
family. The present Government has also ensured that our bank accounts
are frozen and all assets seized.

It is in view of this that I seek your co-operation and assistance in
the transfer of the sum of Eight Million United States Dollars only.
(US$8,000,000.00) being the very last of my family fund in my possession
and control, after the murder of my father the Federal Government seized
all our properties and our accounts both local and international was
frozen.

My only hope now is this cash that my father carefully packaged and
deposited as artifacts with a Security/Finance Company in the
Netherlands The said sum can easily be withdrawn or paid to a
recommended beneficiary The security company based on my instructions
will release the fund to you and you will be presented as my partner who
will be fronting for me in area of viable and profitable business.

To show my preparedness and appreciation to carry-our this business with
you,30% of the total sum will be your share and 20% commission of the
proceeds realized from the investment of this fund will also be yours,
5% is to be set aside for any eventual cost that might arise as the
transaction proceeds. I need your full support and co-operation for the
success of this transaction. I plead with you to treat this issue
confidential and urgent because it is delicate and it demands a great
degree of secrecy. I and my family are presently in the Belgium seeking
Asylum.

I would want you to reach me through the E-mail.
arunaguei@mail2belgium.com, if you are interested to assist me. I
sincerely will appreciate your response.

I wait to hear from you.

Aruna Guei.

union Bank Of Nig. Plc
Union House Marina
Lagos State
Nigeria.
FROM THE DESK OF: DR.IBRAHIM MARTIN
POSITION: SENIOR MANAGER, BILLS AND EXCHANGE
REPLY TO: (dr_martins@nyc.com )
Dear Sir,
I sincerely write to seek your co-operation and trust
to enable my colleagues and I carry out an urgent
business opportunity in my department. I work with the
Union Bank of Nigeria PLC, currently I am the senior
manager of bills and exchange at the foreign
remittance department of my bank. I have an urgent and confidential
business proposal for you. On June 6, 1998, an Australian oil
consultant/contractor with via National Petroleum cooperation
(NNPC) Mr. Ali B. Ashraf
made a numbered time (fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer
month valued at US$51,000,000.00(fifty _one Million  US Dollars) in my 
branch. On maturity, I sent a routine notification tohis forwarded
address but got no reply after months we send a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employee (Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation)
that MR. Ali B. Ashrafdied from an automobile accident. On further
investigation, it was clear that he died without making a WILL.
All attempts by the Australian to trace his next of kin were fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Ali B. Ashraf did
not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents 
including his deposit document in my bank. The total sum
US$51,000,000.00 is still in my bank as dormant acct.
No one will ever come forward to claim it.
According to Nigerian banking law, after five years, the money
will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government. If the account
owner is certified death and nobody comes forward to claim it. This is the
situation , and my proposal is that I am looking for aforeigner who will stand
in as the beneficiary/next of kin. This is simple. All you have to do is to
immediately send me the details of a bank account anywhere in the
world for me to arrange the proper money transfer document. The money will then
be transferred into the account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for
me 30% for you while the remaining 10% will be set aside for expenses
incurred  with here and there. There is no risk involved. I am using my position
and connection in the bank here to do all the document work for the
transaction. We shall employ the services of an attorney to draft the
will and obtain all necessary documents and letter of administration in
yourfavor for the transfer. This transaction is risk free guaranteed. If
you are interested, , I will send to you the text of the application
that you will send to the Union Bank authority for an approval to
submit your claims.
Send your reply through mydirect and private email
address ( martins_dr@yahoo.co.uk )  indicate your direct
Fax and telephone numbers for effective communication
that this transaction needs. Do not reply through the
union bank email address because it belongs to the
senior staffs for public use.
Please note that you are not to appear in person, as
every thing regarding this project will be strictly on
documentations and every banking documents needed for
this transaction will be taken care of by my self.
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Yours Faithfully
DR.IBRAHIM MARTIN

Peace of the lord be with your entire  household,

I am Mrs. Mary Elizabeth Jones, a Kuwaiti national I was married to
Dr.Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory coast for nine
years before he died in the year 2000,He died after a brief illness that
lasted for only four days.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or
get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against.

We were married for eleven years and the union unfortunately did not
produce any offspring. Before his death we had given our lives to Christ
and were living according to his Words. A few weeks ago I was diagnosed
with cancer and the doctor has informed me that I do not have much time
to live. Presently I am practically an invalid as the cancer has ravaged
my body and I can feel my life slowly ebbing away. I do not have much
time to do the Lord's work but He will give me strength to see my last
assignment through.

My husband, Dr.Harry Jones before his death deposited his life savings
of $8.6Million (Eight Million Six hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) in a
consignment with a financial institution in the European continent as
gtem stones for security reasons unknown to the security firm best known
to me,my attorney and my late husband.

Before his death, we were committed to the growth of the church And the
propagation of the word, but I can no longer partake in these noble
tasks. I need a church, Christian individual or individuals who can
continue the work on our behalf and will utilize this money the way I am
going to instruct here into-funding churches, orphanages and widows
propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is
maintained. To care for the sick, the poor, the downtrodden wherever
they may be The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand
that gives. I took this decision because I don't have any child or next
of kin who can inherit these funds. Though the internet is a seemingly
unlikely place to find such individuals, I believe that the Lord hides
jewels in the most unlikely places. It is not the means that is
important but the message. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of
the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I
shall hold my peace. With God all things are possible.

My lawyer who is presently on an assignment in The Netherlands he will
issue you a letter of authorization that will prove you as the present-
beneficiary to these funds and also other documents backing the claim of
the consignment funds. I want you and the church to always pray for me
because the lord is my shepherd.  Happiness is that I lived a life of a
worthy Christian.

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.

Hoping to hearing from you.

N.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN THE 
NETHERLANDS IMMEDIATELY, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'S VERY 
UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS.

LAWYER`S CONTACT DETAILS:

NAME: Mr.Jefferson.L.Kingston

E-MAIL: cyrillawest@netscape.net

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

Yours in Christ,

TEL # 34 636 846 469,
Madrid, Spain


             
Dear Sir,
 
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me
since you do not know me personally. The purpose of my
introduction is that I am Mbeki Salingo, the first son
of MERIMBE TUTU SALINGO ,the most popular black farmer
in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land
dispute in my country. 

I got your contact through network online hence
decided to write you. Before the death of my father, 
he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit
the sum of US8.5 Million (Eight Million, Five Hundred
United States dollars)in one of the private security
company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe
this money was deposited in a box as gemstones to
avoid much demurrage from security company. This
amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and
chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms
in Swaziland. This land problem 
came when Zimbabwean President Mr.Robert Mugabe
introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affected the
rich white farmers and some few black farmers.And this
resulted to the killing and mob action 
by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the
society. In fact a lot of people were killed
because of this Land reform Act for which my father
was one of the victims.

It is against this background that, I and my family
fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently
staying in Spain where we are seeking
political asylum and moreso have decided to 
transfer my father^Òs money to a more reliable foreign
account. since the law of Spain prohibits a
refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to
be involved in any financial transaction throughout
the territorial zone of Spain, As the eldest son
of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of
seeking a genuine foreign
account where this money could be transferred without
the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking
everything we have got. The South African 
government seems to be playing along with them. I am
faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money
out of South Africa for fear of going through the same
experience in future, both countries have similar
political history. As a businessman,I am seeking for a
partner who I have to entrust my future and of my
family in his hands, I must let you know that this
transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me
and my family,all I want you to do for me, is to
arrangements with the security company to clear the
consignment(funds) from their afiliate office here in
Spain as i have already given directives for
the consignment to be brought to Spain from
South Africa.But before then all modalities will have
to be put in place e.g change of ownership of the
consignment and This money I intend to use for
investment. 

I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to
have certain percentage of the money for nominating
your account for this transaction. 
Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper
profitable investment of the money in your country.
Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me.
I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds
of expensesincurred in the process of this
transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am
willing to give you 15% of the money while the 
remaining 80% will be for my investment in your
country. Contact me with my private E-mail
address(mbekisalingo@zwallet.com) while I implore you
to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this
transaction. 

Thanks, GOD BLESS YOU

Yours Faithfully,
Mbeki Salingo

Good day and how are your business over there.It has been a long time

the deposit and the method of collection including the deposit payment
receipt were enclosed in the parcel. I received this parcel very close
to the time that my `Boss´were quitted out of the office.Hence I decided
to hold on to the document for my life utilization.

Before this, let me reiterate it to you that I have been reliably
gathered an information from one of my friend in your high commission
that normally visited Presidential Villa that you are trustworthy and
somebody that can stand firmly for any financial transaction because he
told me that you are capable, With this information,I now decide to seek
your able assistance due to your personality for you to front for me in
the claiming of this consignment as the American´s are bending on
charging my`Boss´for war crime which has even made him to be so
disturbed I really need your urgent assistance as I will like to come
down to your country for the rest of my life.

Please kindly get back to me on this my private tina_powell@fsmail.net

Dear

I am Mrs. Jewel Howard Taylor, a wife of embattled President of war torn
Liberia, Mr Charles Taylor. My husband just stepped down as President of
Liberia some months ago, but matters were not helped when UN Special War
Crimes Court for Sierra Leone indicted my husband for war crimes in June
last year, demanding his prosecution.

Currently i and my husband have been granted asylum in Nigeria, but I
relocated my two sons (Williams & Charles Jnr) immediately in July 2003
to Sao Tome & Principe (a small oil rich island off the coast of West
Africa).

They are currently in hiding there under new identities, awaiting the
outcome of events in my country, and what will become of me and my
husband in asylum.

The reason is this,During the political crisis some years ago in Sierra
Leone (West African Country rich in diamonds), my husband was actively
involved.

Early laast year, he entrusted some large quantities of diamonds to me.
He told me if anything happened to him, I should use it to take care of
myself. Fearing its detection due to the volume, my son (Williams)
traveled to South-Africa with the diamonds (on my instructions) and sold
them, getting a total of US$18,000,000.00(eighteen Million US Dollars
only).

This money he moved through diplomatic channel to a security safe house
in Europe for protective custody under a different name.

Now,the United Nations is intending freezing all my husbands assets and
affiliate accounts and the government of Nigeria has refused issuing
neither him nor my family any visa to travel out of their country again
because of the current political situation.

This is why I need you to please either travel to Europe to claim this
money and subsequently deposit same in a reputable bank there for onward
transfer to your account, or to instruct the security company to move
the funds out of there to any of their corresponding banks or offices in
Europe or Asia for onward transfer to your account.

Once you are able to show your sincerity I will send the necessary
correspondence and documentation related to the transaction to you to
effect this. I am also willing to forfeit 25% of the funds to you 5% set
aside for miscelleneous expenses, believing you will hold 70% on trust
for me sons until we are able to leave here and join you under new
identities.

My first son Williams is 27years old (an Economist), and Charles Jnr is
only 21 years old. My only daughter Helen died in October 1999 from
complications of pneumonia.

Please note that my husband is not even aware that I sold the diamonds,
nor does he know the whereabout of the funds.

Once the funds are safely out of the netherlands I and my sons will
leave to start a new life.

If you cannot help us, simply destroy and forget I ever contacted you.

You can contact me via email(t_jewel@voila.fr), enclosing your contacts
Numbers.

May God guide you in whatever you decide, and thank you for taking out
time to read this request.

Fondest regards.

Mrs. Jewel Howard Taylor

Bulawayo, Republic of Zimbabwe.


MY PLEASURE,

This is a proposal in context but actually an appeal soliciting for your
unreserved assistance in consummating an urgent transaction requiring
maximum confidence. Though this approach appears desperate,I can assure
you that whatever questions you would need to ask or any other thing you
will need to know regarding this proposal, will be adequately answered
to give you a clearer understanding of it so as to arrive at a
successful conclusion.

My name is Mr Ngobe Ngayaka Chief Credit Officer (CCO), Standard
Chartered Bank Bulawayo, Zimbabwe. On December 6, 1999, a Foreign
consultant/contractor with the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, Mr.Thierry
COSBAN, made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,
valued at Fifteen Million,UnitedStates Dollars in my branch. Upon
maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but
got no reply. After a month, I sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his contract employers, the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission, that Mr.
Cosban died from an automobile accident .On further investigation, I
found out that he died without making a Will, and all attempts to trace
his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation
and discovered that Mr. Cosban did not declare any next of kin or
relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit
paperwork in our Bank.

From past experiences, I know that no one will ever come forward to
claim the deceased funds. According to ZIMBABWEAN Law, at the expiration
of 5 (five) years, the funds will be Unclaimable and revert to the
ownership of the ZIMBABWE Government as contribution to the Defence
ministry if nobody applies to claim the fund. In order to avert this
development, I in conjunction with a colleague (the Chief Operating
Officer in the bank) now seek your permission to allow an attorney do a
backdated WILL in your name, so that the funds would be released to you
as the new owner (on behalf of me and my colleague). We are writing you
because, citizens resident here we cannot operate a foreign account or
have an account that is more than Zw$500,000.Consequently, I will
present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim it on
our behalf with the help of an attorney.

This is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your: FULL
NAME/FULL CONTACT ADDRESS/PHONE/FAX NUMBERS , so that an Attorney will
prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the
beneficiary of the funds. The money will then be released to your
custody by the bank,for us to share in the ratio of 70% for us and 30%
for you. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantee the
successful execution of this transaction. If you are interestd, please
reply immediately via my email address. Upon your response, I shall then
provide you with more details and further explanation that will help you
understand the transaction.

No doubt this proposal will make you apprehensive, please i imploy you
to observe utmost confidentiality and rest assured that this transaction
would be most profitable for both of us. Note also that we shall require
your assistance to invest our share in your country.

Buying of properties like houses, hotels etc) This is why your urgent
action and response is of priority to enable us conclude this
transaction, as soon as possible. Awaiting your urgent replyYou can also
send me a mail via my email :nngaya@uymail.com



Thanks and regards.
Mr. Ngobe Ngayaka.
Chief Credit Officer (CCO)
Standard Chartered Bank
Bulawayo ZIMBABWE.

Dear Sir, 

This letter may come to you as a surprise but I really prayed to God to
help me choose somebody that will be my true partner. 

My name is James Nandu Savimbi.I am the first son of Mr. Jonas Savinbi,
the leader of the UNITA movement in Angola. May be you know that my
father was killed recently in Angola by the Angolan Government soldiers
and he has since been buried. 

Two weeks before he died (May be he knows he will die), he called me and
showed me a box containing US$20 million and some Diamond value about
US$15 million. He sent the box to a security company in Europe for safe
keeping with a false name. 

He give me the certificate of deposit and the code number. With that I
can collect the box anytime I want. Now that my father is dead and I
need the money to take care of the family left behind of about two wives
and six children. 

I am now hiding as the government of Angola is desperately looking for
me to assasinate and also the former commander of my father wants to get
me at all cost.Also, I have to be very careful of my movement hence my
search for you to help me to get the box and keep it until I can escape
and meet you and you will also help me to invest the money in your
country or where it is good. 

I will give provide you with all the power(necessary documents) to
collect the box on my behalf when you tell me in your reply that you
will help me and I can trust and count on you. I don't trust anybody in
Angola and with the certificate and the code which I will give you,
there should/will be no problem in collecting the box. 

You don't have to worry,as this is 100% risk free to you as only me, my
dead father and the security company in Europe knows about this box. 

But I want you to keep this secret as there are some enemies of my
father scattered all over the whole World who are friends to the
government of Angola. The name of the country where the box is in Europe
and how much I will give you for help shall be revealed upon your
response to my mail. 

1 YOUR FULL NAME 
2. YOUR CONTACT (HOME)ADDRESS 
3. YOUR TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER 
4. YOUR DATE OF BIRTH & YOUR OCCUPATION 

I await your quick answer and sorry for poor english if there is any. 

Thank you. 

James Nandu Savimbi.

My Lordship/Friend,

Calvary greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I am former Mrs
Sikiratu Seki Adams, now Mrs Comfort Faith Adams, a widow to Late Saheed
Baba Adams.

I am 72years old, I am now a new Christian convert,suffering from long time
cancer of the breast. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating
and is quite obvious that I may not live more than six months, because the
cancer stage has gotten to a very severe stage.

My late husband was killed during the Gulf war, and during the period of
our marriage we had a son whowas also killed in a cold blood during the
Gulf war. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death, I inherited
all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not
live for more than six months and I am so scared about this.
So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the
development of evangelism in Africa,America, Europe and Asian Countries.

This mission which will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocated
to Nigeria, Africa where I live presently. I selected your church after
visiting the website for this purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to
donate the
sum of $3.000,000.00 Million US Dollars to your church/Ministry for the
development of evangelism and also as aids for the less privileged around
you.

Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Company in Holland and
the company has branches, therefore my lawyer will file an immediate application
for the transfer of the money in the name of your ministry.
Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for
personal use other than enhancement of evangelism.

Lastly, I want you/your ministry to be praying for me as regards my entire
life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth
lately that wealth acquisition without! Jesus Christ in one's life is vanity
upon vanity. If you have to die says the Lord, keep fit and I will give
you the crown of life.

May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the sweet fellowship
of the Holy Spirit be with you.

I await your urgent reply.

Yours in Christ
Mrs. Comfort Adams.
Christ Live Church,
Bodija, Ibadan, Nigeria.

"To her [Mary] I entrust you,
that the New Woman,
Mother of the Church and of the New Humanity,
may be your inspiration in the discovery
of a new feminine identity in the Gospel perspective."

- John Paul II, Sept. 4, 1988

From Peter Eneli
Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire

With Due Respect Dearest Beloved

I know you will be surprised to read from me, but
please consider this as a request from a family in
dire need of assistance. First, I must introduce
myself, I am Mr.Peter Eneli from South Africa. I am the
first son and only son of the Dr. Stephen Eneli
I am presently residing in Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire In West
Africa with my sick mother whom the doctors have confirmed
that whe will die before few months.

I got your contact from Business Directory in Cote d Ivoire
Chamber and Industry , and I on behalf of my mother
Mrs. Susan Eneli, decided to solicit for your
assistance to transfer the sum of Five
Million United States Dollars (US$5M) inherited from my father into your
personal or company's account. Before my father's
death, he was in charge of many positions in my country as you
 can confirm from this sites below

http://www.polity.org.za/html/govdocs/pr/2001/pr1003b.html
http://www.gov.za/projects/procurement/yengeni.htm
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1577682.stm
http://www.hsf.org.za/focus22/focus22ethics.html
http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2001/10/06/stories/0306000k.htm
http://www.armsdeal-vpo.co.za/articles00/govt_reserves.html
http://www.ifp.org.za/Releases/190303apr.htm

 He specifically drew my attention to the sum
of US$5M, which he deposited in a safe one trunk
box of a private Security Company in Abidjan,
Cote D'Ivoire TAGGED FAMILY VAUABLES.

In fact, my father said in his will and I quote: "My
beloved son, I wish to bring to your notice, that i have
deposit the sum of Five Million,
United States Dollars (US$5M) which I deposited in one trunk
 box with a Security Company in Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire In
West Africa. During the crisis and detention time, I was
very dedicated and committed to winning the war against the
rebels that are looking for my father because i escaped with
 my mother until we arrived here in Abidjan.



]From the above, you will understand that the lives and
future of my family depends on this money, as such I
will be very grateful if you can assist us. We are now
living in Abidjan as political asylum seekers and the
financial laws of Cote d Ivoire does not allow Asylum
Seekers certain financial rights to such huge amount
of money. In view of this, I cannot invest this money
in abidjan, hence I am asking you to assist me
transfer this money out of the Security Company for
investment purposes. For your efforts, I am prepared
to offer you 25% of the total fund while 5% will be
set aside for local and international expenses and 70%
will be kept by my family and me.

Finally, modalities on how the transfer will be done
will be conveyed to you once we have established trust
and confidence between ourselves and have your telephone and fax
 numbers for easy communication. Please, treat as urgent and have
 it in your mind that the security company never know that the
content of the consignment is money,it is just a secret between you and me.

Best regards.

Mr.Peter Eneli

PRIVATE AND URGENT.
Mr. Bruce Raymond.
Valckenier- straat 85,
1036 XE Amsterdam,
Netherlands.

Good day, 

I am contacting you because of a business concerning a huge sum of money
from a deceased deposit in the Security and Finance company where I work
here in Netherlands. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude
will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that
all will be well at the end of the day. I actually decided to contact
you due to the urgency of this transaction.
 
PROPOSITION;

I discovered an abandoned deposit in my company owned by one of our
foreign customers who died along with his entire family as a result of
an automobile crash. He actually deposited this funds amounting to
US$12,000,000.00 (Twelve million united states dollars), for safe
keeping in my company here in Amsterdam. Company file records shows that
the funds was actually for a project our late costumer wanted to start
in the near future (a multi million Dollar steel plant in Florida, USA),
before his sudden and untimely death. As such since his death none of
his relations or next-of-kin has come forward to lay claims for this
property as the heir, this is the basically the reason why I have
contacted you. My company cannot release the property unless someone
applies for claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our
operating guidelines. 

Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a
next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully
worked out by me for the funds to be released in your favour as the
beneficiary's next of kin. It may interest you to know that I have
secured from the probate an order of madamus to locate any of deceased
beneficiaries. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance
of our mutual business endeavour by furnishing me with the following;

1. Beneficiary full name and address
2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers
3. Occupation and position
4. Nationality and Date of birth
5. Marital status
6. Gender/sex

These requirements will enable me file letter of claim to the
appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favour before
you can personally appear for the claim. I shall be compensating you
with 30% of the total money while 10% will be for any expenses incurred
the rest will be mine on final conclusion of this project. Please note
that your share stays while the rest shall before me for investment
purposes.

If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of
the trust I have bestowed in you, I await your urgent mail. Please reply
to my private and confidential email: bruceraymond@indiatimes.com
 
Best Regards,
Mr. Bruce Raymond.

<p><font size=4>Nigerian You-Have-Won Fraud Letters: 43
Examples (Many More Coming)</font><br>

<font size=3>By date received, with names of supposed lottery, names 
mentioned in letter, and amount of supposed winnings.  Many
duplicates omitted. Many of these emails have been reformatted for
readability; the recipient's email address, and all angle brackets or HTML
tags were removed.  All of the other email and postal addresses, phone
numbers, etc., are as given in the email, but be warned, <b>do not attempt
to contact the perpetrators!</b>.  They are ruthless and violent
criminals.</font></p>

<p><b>How does the fraud work?</b>  The fictional lottery prize is the
bait.  The goal is to get you to come up with money for the "expenses"
required to transfer those millions to you.  Alternatively, with your
bank information, they could drain your account or steal your identity. 
If you travel to Africa or Europe to "pick up your prize," you are at
grave risk of being kidnapped and held for ransom.  See the <b><a 
href="http://potifos.com/fraud">main page</a></b> for more information 
about Nigerian email fraud.</p>

<p><b>How do you know the messages come from Nigeria?</b> The pattern of
these letters is extremely similar to the more familiar type of Nigerian
fraud letters, where the fraudsters pose as an African who needs your
help to quietly transfer millions of dollars to a foreign account.  The
bogus lotto letters are a second flood of messages written usually in
ALL CAPITAL LETTERS, with stilted English, in uncountable variations on
the basic theme.  Undoubtedly it's yet another product of the fraud
subculture in Lagos.  However, physical locations mentioned in the 
letters are usually in Amsterdam or Madrid.</p>
