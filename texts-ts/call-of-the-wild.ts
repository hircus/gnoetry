Title: The Call Of The Wild
Author: Jack London
buck
did
not
read
the
newspapers
*punct* ,
or
he
would
have
known
that
trouble
was
brewing
*punct* ,
not
alone
for
himself
*punct* ,
but
for
every
tide
*punct* -
water
dog
*punct* ,
strong
of
muscle
and
with
warm
*punct* ,
long
hair
*punct* ,
from
puget
sound
to
san
diego
*punct* .
*break*
because
men
*punct* ,
groping
in
the
arctic
darkness
*punct* ,
had
found
a
yellow
metal
*punct* ,
and
because
steamship
and
transportation
companies
were
booming
the
find
*punct* ,
thousands
of
men
were
rushing
into
the
northland
*punct* .
*break*
these
men
wanted
dogs
*punct* ,
and
the
dogs
they
wanted
were
heavy
dogs
*punct* ,
with
strong
muscles
by
which
to
toil
*punct* ,
and
furry
coats
to
protect
them
from
the
frost
*punct* .
*break*
buck
lived
at
a
big
house
in
the
sun-kissed
santa
clara
valley
*punct* .
*break*
judge
miller's
place
*punct* ,
it
was
called
*punct* .
*break*
it
stood
back
from
the
road
*punct* ,
half
hidden
among
the
trees
*punct* ,
through
which
glimpses
could
be
caught
of
the
wide
cool
veranda
that
ran
around
its
four
sides
*punct* .
*break*
the
house
was
approached
by
gravelled
driveways
which
wound
about
through
wide-spreading
lawns
and
under
the
interlacing
boughs
of
tall
poplars
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
rear
things
were
on
even
a
more
spacious
scale
than
at
the
front
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
great
stables
*punct* ,
where
a
dozen
grooms
and
boys
held
forth
*punct* ,
rows
of
vine-clad
servants
cottages
*punct* ,
an
endless
and
orderly
array
of
outhouses
*punct* ,
long
grape
arbors
*punct* ,
green
pastures
*punct* ,
orchards
*punct* ,
and
berry
patches
*punct* .
*break*
then
there
was
the
pumping
plant
for
the
artesian
well
*punct* ,
and
the
big
cement
tank
where
judge
miller's
boys
took
their
morning
plunge
and
kept
cool
in
the
hot
afternoon
*punct* .
*break*
and
over
this
great
demesne
buck
ruled
*punct* .
*break*
here
he
was
born
*punct* ,
and
here
he
had
lived
the
four
years
of
his
life
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
true
*punct* ,
there
were
other
dogs
*punct* ,
there
could
not
but
be
other
dogs
on
so
vast
a
place
*punct* ,
but
they
did
not
count
*punct* .
*break*
they
came
and
went
*punct* ,
resided
in
the
populous
kennels
*punct* ,
or
lived
obscurely
in
the
recesses
of
the
house
after
the
fashion
of
toots
*punct* ,
the
japanese
pug
*punct* ,
or
ysabel
*punct* ,
the
mexican
hairless,
*punct* ,
strange
creatures
that
rarely
put
nose
out
of
doors
or
set
foot
to
ground
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
there
were
the
fox
terriers
*punct* ,
a
score
of
them
at
least
*punct* ,
who
yelped
fearful
promises
at
toots
and
ysabel
looking
out
of
the
windows
at
them
and
protected
by
a
legion
of
housemaids
armed
with
brooms
and
mops
*punct* .
*break*
but
buck
was
neither
house-dog
nor
kennel-dog
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
realm
was
his
*punct* .
*break*
he
plunged
into
the
swimming
tank
or
went
hunting
with
the
judge's
sons
*punct* ;
he
escorted
mollie
and
alice
*punct* ,
the
judge's
daughters
*punct* ,
on
long
twilight
or
early
morning
rambles
*punct* ;
on
wintry
nights
he
lay
at
the
judge's
feet
before
the
roaring
library
fire
*punct* ;
he
carried
the
judge's
grandsons
on
his
back
*punct* ,
or
rolled
them
in
the
grass
*punct* ,
and
guarded
their
footsteps
through
wild
adventures
down
to
the
fountain
in
the
stable
yard
*punct* ,
and
even
beyond
*punct* ,
where
the
paddocks
were
*punct* ,
and
the
berry
patches
*punct* .
*break*
among
the
terriers
he
stalked
imperiously
*punct* ,
and
toots
and
ysabel
he
utterly
ignored
*punct* ,
for
he
was
king,
*punct* ,
king
over
all
creeping
*punct* ,
crawling
*punct* ,
flying
things
of
judge
miller's
place
*punct* ,
humans
included
*punct* .
*break*
his
father
*punct* ,
elmo
*punct* ,
a
huge
st
*punct* .
*break*
bernard
*punct* ,
had
been
the
judge's
inseparable
companion
*punct* ,
and
buck
bid
fair
to
follow
in
the
way
of
his
father
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
not
so
large,
*punct* ,
he
weighed
only
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds,
*punct* ,
for
his
mother
*punct* ,
shep
*punct* ,
had
been
a
scotch
shepherd
dog
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
*punct* ,
to
which
was
added
the
dignity
that
comes
of
good
living
and
universal
respect
*punct* ,
enabled
him
to
carry
himself
in
right
royal
fashion
*punct* .
*break*
during
the
four
years
since
his
puppyhood
he
had
lived
the
life
of
a
sated
aristocrat
*punct* ;
he
had
a
fine
pride
in
himself
*punct* ,
was
even
a
trifle
egotistical
*punct* ,
as
country
gentlemen
sometimes
become
because
of
their
insular
situation
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
had
saved
himself
by
not
becoming
a
mere
pampered
house-dog
*punct* .
*break*
hunting
and
kindred
outdoor
delights
had
kept
down
the
fat
and
hardened
his
muscles
*punct* ;
and
to
him
*punct* ,
as
to
the
cold-tubbing
races
*punct* ,
the
love
of
water
had
been
a
tonic
and
a
health
preserver
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
was
the
manner
of
dog
buck
was
in
the
fall
of
1897
*punct* ,
when
the
klondike
strike
dragged
men
from
all
the
world
into
the
frozen
north
*punct* .
*break*
but
buck
did
not
read
the
newspapers
*punct* ,
and
he
did
not
know
that
manuel
*punct* ,
one
of
the
gardener's
helpers
*punct* ,
was
an
undesirable
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
manuel
had
one
besetting
sin
*punct* .
*break*
he
loved
to
play
chinese
lottery
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
in
his
gambling
*punct* ,
he
had
one
besetting
weakness
*punct* ,
faith
in
a
system
*punct* ;
and
this
made
his
damnation
certain
*punct* .
*break*
for
to
play
a
system
requires
money
*punct* ,
while
the
wages
of
a
gardener's
helper
do
not
lap
over
the
needs
of
a
wife
and
numerous
progeny
*punct* .
*break*
the
judge
was
at
a
meeting
of
the
raisin
growers
association
*punct* ,
and
the
boys
were
busy
organizing
an
athletic
club
*punct* ,
on
the
memorable
night
of
manuel's
treachery
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
saw
him
and
buck
go
off
through
the
orchard
on
what
buck
imagined
was
merely
a
stroll
*punct* .
*break*
and
with
the
exception
of
a
solitary
man
*punct* ,
no
one
saw
them
arrive
at
the
little
flag
station
known
as
college
park
*punct* .
*break*
this
man
talked
with
manuel
*punct* ,
and
money
chinked
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
buck
had
accepted
the
rope
with
quiet
dignity
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
sure
*punct* ,
it
was
an
unwonted
performance
*punct* :
but
he
had
learned
to
trust
in
men
he
knew
*punct* ,
and
to
give
them
credit
for
a
wisdom
that
outreached
his
own
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
the
ends
of
the
rope
were
placed
in
the
stranger's
hands
*punct* ,
he
growled
menacingly
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
merely
intimated
his
displeasure
*punct* ,
in
his
pride
believing
that
to
intimate
was
to
command
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
his
surprise
the
rope
tightened
around
his
neck
*punct* ,
shutting
off
his
breath
*punct* .
*break*
in
quick
rage
he
sprang
at
the
man
*punct* ,
who
met
him
halfway
*punct* ,
grappled
him
close
by
the
throat
*punct* ,
and
with
a
deft
twist
threw
him
over
on
his
back
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
rope
tightened
mercilessly
*punct* ,
while
buck
struggled
in
a
fury
*punct* ,
his
tongue
lolling
out
of
his
mouth
and
his
great
chest
panting
futilely
*punct* .
*break*
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
been
so
vilely
treated
*punct* ,
and
never
in
all
his
life
had
he
been
so
angry
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
strength
ebbed
*punct* ,
his
eyes
glazed
*punct* ,
and
he
knew
nothing
when
the
train
was
flagged
and
the
two
men
threw
him
into
the
baggage
car
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
he
knew
*punct* ,
he
was
dimly
aware
that
his
tongue
was
hurting
and
that
he
was
being
jolted
along
in
some
kind
of
a
conveyance
*punct* .
*break*
the
hoarse
shriek
of
a
locomotive
whistling
a
crossing
told
him
where
he
was
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
travelled
too
often
with
the
judge
not
to
know
the
sensation
of
riding
in
a
baggage
car
*punct* .
*break*
he
opened
his
eyes
*punct* ,
and
into
them
came
the
unbridled
anger
of
a
kidnapped
king
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
sprang
for
his
throat
*punct* ,
but
buck
was
too
quick
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
his
jaws
closed
on
the
hand
*punct* ,
nor
did
they
relax
till
his
senses
were
choked
out
of
him
once
more
*punct* .
*break*
yep
*punct* ,
has
fits
*punct* ,
the
man
said
*punct* ,
hiding
his
mangled
hand
from
the
baggageman
*punct* ,
who
had
been
attracted
by
the
sounds
of
struggle
*punct* .
*break*
a
crack
dog-doctor
there
thinks
that
he
can
cure
m.
concerning
that
night's
ride
*punct* ,
the
man
spoke
most
eloquently
for
himself
*punct* ,
in
a
little
shed
back
of
a
saloon
on
the
san
francisco
water
front
*punct* .
*break*
all
i
get
is
fifty
for
it
*punct* ,
he
grumbled
*punct* ;
an
i
wouldn't
do
it
over
for
a
thousand
*punct* ,
cold
cash
*punct* .
*break*
his
hand
was
wrapped
in
a
bloody
handkerchief
*punct* ,
and
the
right
trouser
leg
was
ripped
from
knee
to
ankle
*punct* .
*break*
how
much
did
the
other
mug
get
*punct* ?
*break*
the
saloon-keeper
demanded
*punct* .
*break*
a
hundred
*punct* ,
was
the
reply
*punct* .
*break*
wouldn't
take
a
sou
less
*punct* ,
so
help
me
*punct* .
*break*
that
makes
a
hundred
and
fifty
*punct* ,
the
saloon-keeper
calculated
*punct* ;
and
he's
worth
it
*punct* ,
or
i'm
a
squarehead
*punct* .
*break*
the
kidnapper
undid
the
bloody
wrappings
and
looked
at
his
lacerated
hand
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
don't
get
the
hydrophoby
*punct* ,
it'll
be
because
you
was
born
to
hang
*punct* ,
laughed
the
saloon
*punct* -
keeper
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
lend
me
a
hand
before
you
pull
your
freight
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* .
*break*
dazed
*punct* ,
suffering
intolerable
pain
from
throat
and
tongue
*punct* ,
with
the
life
half
throttled
out
of
him
*punct* ,
buck
attempted
to
face
his
tormentors
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
was
thrown
down
and
choked
repeatedly
*punct* ,
till
they
succeeded
in
filing
the
heavy
brass
collar
from
off
his
neck
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
rope
was
removed
*punct* ,
and
he
was
flung
into
a
cagelike
crate
*punct* .
*break*
there
he
lay
for
the
remainder
of
the
weary
night
*punct* ,
nursing
his
wrath
and
wounded
pride
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
understand
what
it
all
meant
*punct* .
*break*
what
did
they
want
with
him
*punct* ,
these
strange
men
*punct* ?
*break*
why
were
they
keeping
him
pent
up
in
this
narrow
crate
*punct* ?
*break*
he
did
not
know
why
*punct* ,
but
he
felt
oppressed
by
the
vague
sense
of
impending
calamity
*punct* .
*break*
several
times
during
the
night
he
sprang
to
his
feet
when
the
shed
door
rattled
open
*punct* ,
expecting
to
see
the
judge
*punct* ,
or
the
boys
at
least
*punct* .
*break*
but
each
time
it
was
the
bulging
face
of
the
saloon-keeper
that
peered
in
at
him
by
the
sickly
light
of
a
tallow
candle
*punct* .
*break*
and
each
time
the
joyful
bark
that
trembled
in
buck's
throat
was
twisted
into
a
savage
growl
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
saloon-keeper
let
him
alone
*punct* ,
and
in
the
morning
four
men
entered
and
picked
up
the
crate
*punct* .
*break*
more
tormentors
*punct* ,
buck
decided
*punct* ,
for
they
were
evil-looking
creatures
*punct* ,
ragged
and
unkempt
*punct* ;
and
he
stormed
and
raged
at
them
through
the
bars
*punct* .
*break*
they
only
laughed
and
poked
sticks
at
him
*punct* ,
which
he
promptly
assailed
with
his
teeth
till
he
realized
that
that
was
what
they
wanted
*punct* .
*break*
whereupon
he
lay
down
sullenly
and
allowed
the
crate
to
be
lifted
into
a
wagon
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
*punct* ,
and
the
crate
in
which
he
was
imprisoned
*punct* ,
began
a
passage
through
many
hands
*punct* .
*break*
clerks
in
the
express
office
took
charge
of
him
*punct* ;
he
was
carted
about
in
another
wagon
*punct* ;
a
truck
carried
him
*punct* ,
with
an
assortment
of
boxes
and
parcels
*punct* ,
upon
a
ferry
steamer
*punct* ;
he
was
trucked
off
the
steamer
into
a
great
railway
depot
*punct* ,
and
finally
he
was
deposited
in
an
express
car
*punct* .
*break*
for
two
days
and
nights
this
express
car
was
dragged
along
at
the
tail
of
shrieking
locomotives
*punct* ;
and
for
two
days
and
nights
buck
neither
ate
nor
drank
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
anger
he
had
met
the
first
advances
of
the
express
messengers
with
growls
*punct* ,
and
they
had
retaliated
by
teasing
him
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
flung
himself
against
the
bars
*punct* ,
quivering
and
frothing
*punct* ,
they
laughed
at
him
and
taunted
him
*punct* .
*break*
they
growled
and
barked
like
detestable
dogs
*punct* ,
mewed
*punct* ,
and
flapped
their
arms
and
crowed
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
all
very
silly
*punct* ,
he
knew
*punct* ;
but
therefore
the
more
outrage
to
his
dignity
*punct* ,
and
his
anger
waxed
and
waxed
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
mind
the
hunger
so
much
*punct* ,
but
the
lack
of
water
caused
him
severe
suffering
and
fanned
his
wrath
to
fever-pitch
*punct* .
*break*
for
that
matter
*punct* ,
high-strung
and
finely
sensitive
*punct* ,
the
ill
treatment
had
flung
him
into
a
fever
*punct* ,
which
was
fed
by
the
inflammation
of
his
parched
and
swollen
throat
and
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
glad
for
one
thing
*punct* :
the
rope
was
off
his
neck
*punct* .
*break*
that
had
given
them
an
unfair
advantage
*punct* ;
but
now
that
it
was
off
*punct* ,
he
would
show
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
would
never
get
another
rope
around
his
neck
*punct* .
*break*
upon
that
he
was
resolved
*punct* .
*break*
for
two
days
and
nights
he
neither
ate
nor
drank
*punct* ,
and
during
those
two
days
and
nights
of
torment
*punct* ,
he
accumulated
a
fund
of
wrath
that
boded
ill
for
whoever
first
fell
foul
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
his
eyes
turned
blood-shot
*punct* ,
and
he
was
metamorphosed
into
a
raging
fiend
*punct* .
*break*
so
changed
was
he
that
the
judge
himself
would
not
have
recognized
him
*punct* ;
and
the
express
messengers
breathed
with
relief
when
they
bundled
him
off
the
train
at
seattle
*punct* .
*break*
four
men
gingerly
carried
the
crate
from
the
wagon
into
a
small
*punct* ,
high-walled
back
yard
*punct* .
*break*
a
stout
man
*punct* ,
with
a
red
sweater
that
sagged
generously
at
the
neck
*punct* ,
came
out
and
signed
the
book
for
the
driver
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
the
man
*punct* ,
buck
divined
*punct* ,
the
next
tormentor
*punct* ,
and
he
hurled
himself
savagely
against
the
bars
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
smiled
grimly
*punct* ,
and
brought
a
hatchet
and
a
club
*punct* .
*break*
you
ain't
going
to
take
him
out
now
*punct* ?
*break*
the
driver
asked
*punct* .
*break*
sure
*punct* ,
the
man
replied
*punct* ,
driving
the
hatchet
into
the
crate
for
a
pry
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
an
instantaneous
scattering
of
the
four
men
who
had
carried
it
in
*punct* ,
and
from
safe
perches
on
top
the
wall
they
prepared
to
watch
the
performance
*punct* .
*break*
buck
rushed
at
the
splintering
wood
*punct* ,
sinking
his
teeth
into
it
*punct* ,
surging
and
wrestling
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
wherever
the
hatchet
fell
on
the
outside
*punct* ,
he
was
there
on
the
inside
*punct* ,
snarling
and
growling
*punct* ,
as
furiously
anxious
to
get
out
as
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
was
calmly
intent
on
getting
him
out
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
you
red-eyed
devil
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
when
he
had
made
an
opening
sufficient
for
the
passage
of
buck's
body
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
same
time
he
dropped
the
hatchet
and
shifted
the
club
to
his
right
hand
*punct* .
*break*
and
buck
was
truly
a
red-eyed
devil
*punct* ,
as
he
drew
himself
together
for
the
spring
*punct* ,
hair
bristling
*punct* ,
mouth
foaming
*punct* ,
a
mad
glitter
in
his
blood-shot
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
straight
at
the
man
he
launched
his
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
of
fury
*punct* ,
surcharged
with
the
pent
passion
of
two
days
and
nights
*punct* .
*break*
in
mid
air
*punct* ,
just
as
his
jaws
were
about
to
close
on
the
man
*punct* ,
he
received
a
shock
that
checked
his
body
and
brought
his
teeth
together
with
an
agonizing
clip
*punct* .
*break*
he
whirled
over
*punct* ,
fetching
the
ground
on
his
back
and
side
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
never
been
struck
by
a
club
in
his
life
*punct* ,
and
did
not
understand
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
snarl
that
was
part
bark
and
more
scream
he
was
again
on
his
feet
and
launched
into
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
and
again
the
shock
came
and
he
was
brought
crushingly
to
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
this
time
he
was
aware
that
it
was
the
club
*punct* ,
but
his
madness
knew
no
caution
*punct* .
*break*
a
dozen
times
he
charged
*punct* ,
and
as
often
the
club
broke
the
charge
and
smashed
him
down
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
particularly
fierce
blow
*punct* ,
he
crawled
to
his
feet
*punct* ,
too
dazed
to
rush
*punct* .
*break*
he
staggered
limply
about
*punct* ,
the
blood
flowing
from
nose
and
mouth
and
ears
*punct* ,
his
beautiful
coat
sprayed
and
flecked
with
bloody
slaver
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
man
advanced
and
deliberately
dealt
him
a
frightful
blow
on
the
nose
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
pain
he
had
endured
was
as
nothing
compared
with
the
exquisite
agony
of
this
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
roar
that
was
almost
lionlike
in
its
ferocity
*punct* ,
he
again
hurled
himself
at
the
man
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
man
*punct* ,
shifting
the
club
from
right
to
left
*punct* ,
coolly
caught
him
by
the
under
jaw
*punct* ,
at
the
same
time
wrenching
downward
and
backward
*punct* .
*break*
buck
described
a
complete
circle
in
the
air
*punct* ,
and
half
of
another
*punct* ,
then
crashed
to
the
ground
on
his
head
and
chest
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
last
time
he
rushed
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
struck
the
shrewd
blow
he
had
purposely
withheld
for
so
long
*punct* ,
and
buck
crumpled
up
and
went
down
*punct* ,
knocked
utterly
senseless
*punct* .
*break*
he's
no
slouch
at
dog-breakin'
*punct* ,
that's
wot
i
say
*punct* ,
one
of
the
men
on
the
wall
cried
enthusiastically
*punct* .
*break*
druther
break
cayuses
any
day
*punct* ,
and
twice
on
sundays
*punct* ,
was
the
reply
of
the
driver
*punct* ,
as
he
climbed
on
the
wagon
and
started
the
horses
*punct* .
*break*
buck's
senses
came
back
to
him
*punct* ,
but
not
his
strength
*punct* .
*break*
he
lay
where
he
had
fallen
*punct* ,
and
from
there
he
watched
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
*punct* .
*break*
answers
to
the
name
of
buck
*punct* ,
the
man
soliloquized
*punct* ,
quoting
from
the
saloon-keeper's
letter
which
had
announced
the
consignment
of
the
crate
and
contents
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
buck
*punct* ,
my
boy
*punct* ,
he
went
on
in
a
genial
voice
*punct* ,
we've
had
our
little
ruction
*punct* ,
and
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
let
it
go
at
that
*punct* .
*break*
you've
learned
your
place
*punct* ,
and
i
know
mine
*punct* .
*break*
be
a
good
dog
and
all
ll
go
well
and
the
goose
hang
high
*punct* .
*break*
be
a
bad
dog
*punct* ,
and
i'll
whale
the
stuffin
outa
you
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
spoke
he
fearlessly
patted
the
head
he
had
so
mercilessly
pounded
*punct* ,
and
though
buck's
hair
involuntarily
bristled
at
touch
of
the
hand
*punct* ,
he
endured
it
without
protest
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
man
brought
him
water
he
drank
eagerly
*punct* ,
and
later
bolted
a
generous
meal
of
raw
meat
*punct* ,
chunk
by
chunk
*punct* ,
from
the
man's
hand
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
*punct* ,
once
for
all
*punct* ,
that
he
stood
no
chance
against
a
man
with
a
club
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
learned
the
lesson
*punct* ,
and
in
all
his
after
life
he
never
forgot
it
*punct* .
*break*
that
club
was
a
revelation
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
his
introduction
to
the
reign
of
primitive
law
*punct* ,
and
he
met
the
introduction
halfway
*punct* .
*break*
the
facts
of
life
took
on
a
fiercer
aspect
*punct* ;
and
while
he
faced
that
aspect
uncowed
*punct* ,
he
faced
it
with
all
the
latent
cunning
of
his
nature
aroused
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
days
went
by
*punct* ,
other
dogs
came
*punct* ,
in
crates
and
at
the
ends
of
ropes
*punct* ,
some
docilely
*punct* ,
and
some
raging
and
roaring
as
he
had
come
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
one
and
all
*punct* ,
he
watched
them
pass
under
the
dominion
of
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
*punct* .
*break*
again
and
again
*punct* ,
as
he
looked
at
each
brutal
performance
*punct* ,
the
lesson
was
driven
home
to
buck
*punct* :
a
man
with
a
club
was
a
lawgiver
*punct* ,
a
master
to
be
obeyed
*punct* ,
though
not
necessarily
conciliated
*punct* .
*break*
of
this
last
buck
was
never
guilty
*punct* ,
though
he
did
see
beaten
dogs
that
fawned
upon
the
man
*punct* ,
and
wagged
their
tails
*punct* ,
and
licked
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
also
he
saw
one
dog
*punct* ,
that
would
neither
conciliate
nor
obey
*punct* ,
finally
killed
in
the
struggle
for
mastery
*punct* .
*break*
now
and
again
men
came
*punct* ,
strangers
*punct* ,
who
talked
excitedly
*punct* ,
wheedlingly
*punct* ,
and
in
all
kinds
of
fashions
to
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
*punct* .
*break*
and
at
such
times
that
money
passed
between
them
the
strangers
took
one
or
more
of
the
dogs
away
with
them
*punct* .
*break*
buck
wondered
where
they
went
*punct* ,
for
they
never
came
back
*punct* ;
but
the
fear
of
the
future
was
strong
upon
him
*punct* ,
and
he
was
glad
each
time
when
he
was
not
selected
*punct* .
*break*
yet
his
time
came
*punct* ,
in
the
end
*punct* ,
in
the
form
of
a
little
weazened
man
who
spat
broken
english
and
many
strange
and
uncouth
exclamations
which
buck
could
not
understand
*punct* .
*break*
he
cried
*punct* ,
when
his
eyes
lit
upon
buck
*punct* .
*break*
dat
one
dam
bully
dog
*punct* !
*break*
three
hundred
*punct* ,
and
a
present
at
that
*punct* ,
was
the
prompt
reply
of
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
*punct* .
*break*
and
seem
it's
government
money
*punct* ,
you
ain't
got
no
kick
coming
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ,
perrault
*punct* ?
*break*
considering
that
the
price
of
dogs
had
been
boomed
skyward
by
the
unwonted
demand
*punct* ,
it
was
not
an
unfair
sum
for
so
fine
an
animal
*punct* .
*break*
the
canadian
government
would
be
no
loser
*punct* ,
nor
would
its
despatches
travel
the
slower
*punct* .
*break*
perrault
knew
dogs
*punct* ,
and
when
he
looked
at
buck
he
knew
that
he
was
one
in
a
thousand
*punct* ,
one
in
ten
t'ousand
*punct* ,
he
commented
mentally
*punct* .
*break*
buck
saw
money
pass
between
them
*punct* ,
and
was
not
surprised
when
curly
*punct* ,
a
good-natured
newfoundland
*punct* ,
and
he
were
led
away
by
the
little
weazened
man
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
the
last
he
saw
of
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
*punct* ,
and
as
curly
and
he
looked
at
receding
seattle
from
the
deck
of
the
narwhal
*punct* ,
it
was
the
last
he
saw
of
the
warm
southland
*punct* .
*break*
curly
and
he
were
taken
below
by
perrault
and
turned
over
to
a
black-faced
giant
called
francois
*punct* .
*break*
perrault
was
a
french-canadian
*punct* ,
and
swarthy
*punct* ;
but
francois
was
a
french-canadian
half-breed
*punct* ,
and
twice
as
swarthy
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
a
new
kind
of
men
to
buck
*punct* ,
of
which
he
was
destined
to
see
many
more
*punct* ,
and
while
he
developed
no
affection
for
them
*punct* ,
he
none
the
less
grew
honestly
to
respect
them
*punct* .
*break*
he
speedily
learned
that
perrault
and
francois
were
fair
men
*punct* ,
calm
and
impartial
in
administering
justice
*punct* ,
and
too
wise
in
the
way
of
dogs
to
be
fooled
by
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
tween-decks
of
the
narwhal
*punct* ,
buck
and
curly
joined
two
other
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
them
was
a
big
*punct* ,
snow-white
fellow
from
spitzbergen
who
had
been
brought
away
by
a
whaling
captain
*punct* ,
and
who
had
later
accompanied
a
geological
survey
into
the
barrens
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
friendly
*punct* ,
in
a
treacherous
sort
of
way
*punct* ,
smiling
into
one's
face
the
while
he
meditated
some
underhand
trick
*punct* ,
as
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
when
he
stole
from
buck's
food
at
the
first
meal
*punct* .
*break*
as
buck
sprang
to
punish
him
*punct* ,
the
lash
of
francois's
whip
sang
through
the
air
*punct* ,
reaching
the
culprit
first
*punct* ;
and
nothing
remained
to
buck
but
to
recover
the
bone
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
fair
of
francois
*punct* ,
he
decided
*punct* ,
and
the
half-breed
began
his
rise
in
buck's
estimation
*punct* .
*break*
the
other
dog
made
no
advances
*punct* ,
nor
received
any
*punct* ;
also
*punct* ,
he
did
not
attempt
to
steal
from
the
newcomers
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
gloomy
*punct* ,
morose
fellow
*punct* ,
and
he
showed
curly
plainly
that
all
he
desired
was
to
be
left
alone
*punct* ,
and
further
*punct* ,
that
there
would
be
trouble
if
he
were
not
left
alone
*punct* .
*break*
dave
he
was
called
*punct* ,
and
he
ate
and
slept
*punct* ,
or
yawned
between
times
*punct* ,
and
took
interest
in
nothing
*punct* ,
not
even
when
the
narwhal
crossed
queen
charlotte
sound
and
rolled
and
pitched
and
bucked
like
a
thing
possessed
*punct* .
*break*
when
buck
and
curly
grew
excited
*punct* ,
half
wild
with
fear
*punct* ,
he
raised
his
head
as
though
annoyed
*punct* ,
favored
them
with
an
incurious
glance
*punct* ,
yawned
*punct* ,
and
went
to
sleep
again
*punct* .
*break*
day
and
night
the
ship
throbbed
to
the
tireless
pulse
of
the
propeller
*punct* ,
and
though
one
day
was
very
like
another
*punct* ,
it
was
apparent
to
buck
that
the
weather
was
steadily
growing
colder
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
one
morning
*punct* ,
the
propeller
was
quiet
*punct* ,
and
the
narwhal
was
pervaded
with
an
atmosphere
of
excitement
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
it
*punct* ,
as
did
the
other
dogs
*punct* ,
and
knew
that
a
change
was
at
hand
*punct* .
*break*
francois
leashed
them
and
brought
them
on
deck
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
first
step
upon
the
cold
surface
*punct* ,
buck's
feet
sank
into
a
white
mushy
something
very
like
mud
*punct* .
*break*
he
sprang
back
with
a
snort
*punct* .
*break*
more
of
this
white
stuff
was
falling
through
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
he
shook
himself
*punct* ,
but
more
of
it
fell
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
sniffed
it
curiously
*punct* ,
then
licked
some
up
on
his
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
it
bit
like
fire
*punct* ,
and
the
next
instant
was
gone
*punct* .
*break*
this
puzzled
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
tried
it
again
*punct* ,
with
the
same
result
*punct* .
*break*
the
onlookers
laughed
uproariously
*punct* ,
and
he
felt
ashamed
*punct* ,
he
knew
not
why
*punct* ,
for
it
was
his
first
snow
*punct* .
*break*
buck's
first
day
on
the
dyea
beach
was
like
a
nightmare
*punct* .
*break*
every
hour
was
filled
with
shock
and
surprise
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
suddenly
jerked
from
the
heart
of
civilization
and
flung
into
the
heart
of
things
primordial
*punct* .
*break*
no
lazy
*punct* ,
sun-kissed
life
was
this
*punct* ,
with
nothing
to
do
but
loaf
and
be
bored
*punct* .
*break*
here
was
neither
peace
*punct* ,
nor
rest
*punct* ,
nor
a
moment's
safety
*punct* .
*break*
all
was
confusion
and
action
*punct* ,
and
every
moment
life
and
limb
were
in
peril
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
imperative
need
to
be
constantly
alert
*punct* ;
for
these
dogs
and
men
were
not
town
dogs
and
men
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
savages
*punct* ,
all
of
them
*punct* ,
who
knew
no
law
but
the
law
of
club
and
fang
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
never
seen
dogs
fight
as
these
wolfish
creatures
fought
*punct* ,
and
his
first
experience
taught
him
an
unforgetable
lesson
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
true
*punct* ,
it
was
a
vicarious
experience
*punct* ,
else
he
would
not
have
lived
to
profit
by
it
*punct* .
*break*
curly
was
the
victim
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
camped
near
the
log
store
*punct* ,
where
she
*punct* ,
in
her
friendly
way
*punct* ,
made
advances
to
a
husky
dog
the
size
of
a
full-grown
wolf
*punct* ,
though
not
half
so
large
as
she
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
warning
*punct* ,
only
a
leap
in
like
a
flash
*punct* ,
a
metallic
clip
of
teeth
*punct* ,
a
leap
out
equally
swift
*punct* ,
and
curly's
face
was
ripped
open
from
eye
to
jaw
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
wolf
manner
of
fighting
*punct* ,
to
strike
and
leap
away
*punct* ;
but
there
was
more
to
it
than
this
*punct* .
*break*
thirty
or
forty
huskies
ran
to
the
spot
and
surrounded
the
combatants
in
an
intent
and
silent
circle
*punct* .
*break*
buck
did
not
comprehend
that
silent
intentness
*punct* ,
nor
the
eager
way
with
which
they
were
licking
their
chops
*punct* .
*break*
curly
rushed
her
antagonist
*punct* ,
who
struck
again
and
leaped
aside
*punct* .
*break*
he
met
her
next
rush
with
his
chest
*punct* ,
in
a
peculiar
fashion
that
tumbled
her
off
her
feet
*punct* .
*break*
she
never
regained
them
*punct* ,
this
was
what
the
onlooking
huskies
had
waited
for
*punct* .
*break*
they
closed
in
upon
her
*punct* ,
snarling
and
yelping
*punct* ,
and
she
was
buried
*punct* ,
screaming
with
agony
*punct* ,
beneath
the
bristling
mass
of
bodies
*punct* .
*break*
so
sudden
was
it
*punct* ,
and
so
unexpected
*punct* ,
that
buck
was
taken
aback
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
spitz
run
out
his
scarlet
tongue
in
a
way
he
had
of
laughing
*punct* ;
and
he
saw
francois
*punct* ,
swinging
an
axe
*punct* ,
spring
into
the
mess
of
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
three
men
with
clubs
were
helping
him
to
scatter
them
*punct* .
*break*
it
did
not
take
long
*punct* .
*break*
two
minutes
from
the
time
curly
went
down
*punct* ,
the
last
of
her
assailants
were
clubbed
off
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
lay
there
limp
and
lifeless
in
the
bloody
*punct* ,
trampled
snow
*punct* ,
almost
literally
torn
to
pieces
*punct* ,
the
swart
half-breed
standing
over
her
and
cursing
horribly
*punct* .
*break*
the
scene
often
came
back
to
buck
to
trouble
him
in
his
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
was
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
no
fair
play
*punct* .
*break*
once
down
*punct* ,
that
was
the
end
of
you
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
he
would
see
to
it
that
he
never
went
down
*punct* .
*break*
spitz
ran
out
his
tongue
and
laughed
again
*punct* ,
and
from
that
moment
buck
hated
him
with
a
bitter
and
deathless
hatred
*punct* .
*break*
before
he
had
recovered
from
the
shock
caused
by
the
tragic
passing
of
curly
*punct* ,
he
received
another
shock
*punct* .
*break*
francois
fastened
upon
him
an
arrangement
of
straps
and
buckles
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
harness
*punct* ,
such
as
he
had
seen
the
grooms
put
on
the
horses
at
home
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
he
had
seen
horses
work
*punct* ,
so
he
was
set
to
work
*punct* ,
hauling
francois
on
a
sled
to
the
forest
that
fringed
the
valley
*punct* ,
and
returning
with
a
load
of
firewood
*punct* .
*break*
though
his
dignity
was
sorely
hurt
by
thus
being
made
a
draught
animal
*punct* ,
he
was
too
wise
to
rebel
*punct* .
*break*
he
buckled
down
with
a
will
and
did
his
best
*punct* ,
though
it
was
all
new
and
strange
*punct* .
*break*
francois
was
stem
*punct* ,
demanding
instant
obedience
*punct* ,
and
by
virtue
of
his
whip
receiving
instant
obedience
*punct* ;
while
dave
*punct* ,
who
was
an
experienced
wheeler
*punct* ,
nipped
buck's
hind
quarters
whenever
he
was
in
error
*punct* .
*break*
spitz
was
the
leader
*punct* ,
likewise
experienced
*punct* ,
and
while
he
could
not
always
get
at
buck
*punct* ,
he
growled
sharp
reproof
now
and
again
*punct* ,
or
cunningly
threw
his
weight
in
the
traces
to
jerk
buck
into
the
way
he
should
go
*punct* .
*break*
buck
learned
easily
*punct* ,
and
under
the
combined
tuition
of
his
two
mates
and
francois
made
remarkable
progress
*punct* .
*break*
ere
they
returned
to
camp
he
knew
enough
to
stop
at
ho
*punct* ,
to
go
ahead
at
mush
*punct* ,
to
swing
wide
on
the
bends
*punct* ,
and
to
keep
clear
of
the
wheeler
when
the
loaded
sled
shot
downhill
at
their
heels
*punct* .
*break*
t'ree

*break*
by
afternoon
*punct* ,
perrault
*punct* ,
who
was
in
a
hurry
to
be
on
the
trail
with
his
despatches
*punct* ,
returned
with
two
more
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
billee
and
joe
he
called
them
*punct* ,
two
brothers
*punct* ,
and
true
huskies
both
*punct* .
*break*
sons
of
the
one
mother
though
they
were
*punct* ,
they
were
as
different
as
day
and
night
*punct* .
*break*
billee's
one
fault
was
his
excessive
good
nature
*punct* ,
while
joe
was
the
very
opposite
*punct* ,
sour
and
introspective
*punct* ,
with
a
perpetual
snarl
and
a
malignant
eye
*punct* .
*break*
buck
received
them
in
comradely
fashion
*punct* ,
dave
ignored
them
*punct* ,
while
spitz
proceeded
to
thrash
first
one
and
then
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
billee
wagged
his
tail
appeasingly
*punct* ,
turned
to
run
when
he
saw
that
appeasement
was
of
no
avail
*punct* ,
and
cried
*punct* ,
still
appeasingly
*punct* ,
when
spitz's
sharp
teeth
scored
his
flank
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
matter
how
spitz
circled
*punct* ,
joe
whirled
around
on
his
heels
to
face
him
*punct* ,
mane
bristling
*punct* ,
ears
laid
back
*punct* ,
lips
writhing
and
snarling
*punct* ,
jaws
clipping
together
as
fast
as
he
could
snap
*punct* ,
and
eyes
diabolically
gleaming
*punct* ,
the
incarnation
of
belligerent
fear
*punct* .
*break*
so
terrible
was
his
appearance
that
spitz
was
forced
to
forego
disciplining
him
*punct* ;
but
to
cover
his
own
discomfiture
he
turned
upon
the
inoffensive
and
wailing
billee
and
drove
him
to
the
confines
of
the
camp
*punct* .
*break*
by
evening
perrault
secured
another
dog
*punct* ,
an
old
husky
*punct* ,
long
and
lean
and
gaunt
*punct* ,
with
a
battle-scarred
face
and
a
single
eye
which
flashed
a
warning
of
prowess
that
commanded
respect
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
called
sol-leks
*punct* ,
which
means
the
angry
one
*punct* .
*break*
like
dave
*punct* ,
he
asked
nothing
*punct* ,
gave
nothing
*punct* ,
expected
nothing
*punct* ;
and
when
he
marched
slowly
and
deliberately
into
their
midst
*punct* ,
even
spitz
left
him
alone
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
one
peculiarity
which
buck
was
unlucky
enough
to
discover
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
like
to
be
approached
on
his
blind
side
*punct* .
*break*
of
this
offence
buck
was
unwittingly
guilty
*punct* ,
and
the
first
knowledge
he
had
of
his
indiscretion
was
when
sol-leks
whirled
upon
him
and
slashed
his
shoulder
to
the
bone
for
three
inches
up
and
down
*punct* .
*break*
forever
after
buck
avoided
his
blind
side
*punct* ,
and
to
the
last
of
their
comradeship
had
no
more
trouble
*punct* .
*break*
his
only
apparent
ambition
*punct* ,
like
dave's
*punct* ,
was
to
be
left
alone
*punct* ;
though
*punct* ,
as
buck
was
afterward
to
learn
*punct* ,
each
of
them
possessed
one
other
and
even
more
vital
ambition
*punct* .
*break*
that
night
buck
faced
the
great
problem
of
sleeping
*punct* .
*break*
the
tent
*punct* ,
illumined
by
a
candle
*punct* ,
glowed
warmly
in
the
midst
of
the
white
plain
*punct* ;
and
when
he
*punct* ,
as
a
matter
of
course
*punct* ,
entered
it
*punct* ,
both
perrault
and
francois
bombarded
him
with
curses
and
cooking
utensils
*punct* ,
till
he
recovered
from
his
consternation
and
fled
ignominiously
into
the
outer
cold
*punct* .
*break*
a
chill
wind
was
blowing
that
nipped
him
sharply
and
bit
with
especial
venom
into
his
wounded
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
he
lay
down
on
the
snow
and
attempted
to
sleep
*punct* ,
but
the
frost
soon
drove
him
shivering
to
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
miserable
and
disconsolate
*punct* ,
he
wandered
about
among
the
many
tents
*punct* ,
only
to
find
that
one
place
was
as
cold
as
another
*punct* .
*break*
here
and
there
savage
dogs
rushed
upon
him
*punct* ,
but
he
bristled
his
neck-hair
and
snarled
*punct* ,
for
he
was
learning
fast
*punct* ,
and
they
let
him
go
his
way
unmolested
*punct* .
*break*
finally
an
idea
came
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
return
and
see
how
his
own
team-mates
were
making
out
*punct* .
*break*
to
his
astonishment
*punct* ,
they
had
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
again
he
wandered
about
through
the
great
camp
*punct* ,
looking
for
them
*punct* ,
and
again
he
returned
*punct* .
*break*
were
they
in
the
tent
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
that
could
not
be
*punct* ,
else
he
would
not
have
been
driven
out
*punct* .
*break*
then
where
could
they
possibly
be
*punct* ?
*break*
with
drooping
tail
and
shivering
body
*punct* ,
very
forlorn
indeed
*punct* ,
he
aimlessly
circled
the
tent
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
the
snow
gave
way
beneath
his
fore
legs
and
he
sank
down
*punct* .
*break*
something
wriggled
under
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
he
sprang
back
*punct* ,
bristling
and
snarling
*punct* ,
fearful
of
the
unseen
and
unknown
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
friendly
little
yelp
reassured
him
*punct* ,
and
he
went
back
to
investigate
*punct* .
*break*
a
whiff
of
warm
air
ascended
to
his
nostrils
*punct* ,
and
there
*punct* ,
curled
up
under
the
snow
in
a
snug
ball
*punct* ,
lay
billee
*punct* .
*break*
he
whined
placatingly
*punct* ,
squirmed
and
wriggled
to
show
his
good
will
and
intentions
*punct* ,
and
even
ventured
*punct* ,
as
a
bribe
for
peace
*punct* ,
to
lick
buck's
face
with
his
warm
wet
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
was
the
way
they
did
it
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
buck
confidently
selected
a
spot
*punct* ,
and
with
much
fuss
and
waste
effort
proceeded
to
dig
a
hole
for
himself
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
trice
the
heat
from
his
body
filled
the
confined
space
and
he
was
asleep
*punct* .
*break*
the
day
had
been
long
and
arduous
*punct* ,
and
he
slept
soundly
and
comfortably
*punct* ,
though
he
growled
and
barked
and
wrestled
with
bad
dreams
*punct* .
*break*
nor
did
he
open
his
eyes
till
roused
by
the
noises
of
the
waking
camp
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
snowed
during
the
night
and
he
was
completely
buried
*punct* .
*break*
the
snow
walls
pressed
him
on
every
side
*punct* ,
and
a
great
surge
of
fear
swept
through
him
*punct* ,
the
fear
of
the
wild
thing
for
the
trap
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
token
that
he
was
harking
back
through
his
own
life
to
the
lives
of
his
forebears
*punct* ;
for
he
was
a
civilized
dog
*punct* ,
an
unduly
civilized
dog
*punct* ,
and
of
his
own
experience
knew
no
trap
and
so
could
not
of
himself
fear
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
muscles
of
his
whole
body
contracted
spasmodically
and
instinctively
*punct* ,
the
hair
on
his
neck
and
shoulders
stood
on
end
*punct* ,
and
with
a
ferocious
snarl
he
bounded
straight
up
into
the
blinding
day
*punct* ,
the
snow
flying
about
him
in
a
flashing
cloud
*punct* .
*break*
ere
he
landed
on
his
feet
*punct* ,
he
saw
the
white
camp
spread
out
before
him
and
knew
where
he
was
and
remembered
all
that
had
passed
from
the
time
he
went
for
a
stroll
with
manuel
to
the
hole
he
had
dug
for
himself
the
night
before
*punct* .
*break*
a
shout
from
francois
hailed
his
appearance
*punct* .
*break*
wot
i
say
*punct* ?
*break*
the
dog-driver
cried
to
perrault
*punct* .
*break*
dat
buck
for
sure
learn
queek
as
anyt'ing
*punct* .
*break*
perrault
nodded
gravely
*punct* .
*break*
as
courier
for
the
canadian
government
*punct* ,
bearing
important
despatches
*punct* ,
he
was
anxious
to
secure
the
best
dogs
*punct* ,
and
he
was
particularly
gladdened
by
the
possession
of
buck
*punct* .
*break*
three
more
huskies
were
added
to
the
team
inside
an
hour
*punct* ,
making
a
total
of
nine
*punct* ,
and
before
another
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
they
were
in
harness
and
swinging
up
the
trail
toward
the
dyea
canon
*punct* .
*break*
buck
was
glad
to
be
gone
*punct* ,
and
though
the
work
was
hard
he
found
he
did
not
particularly
despise
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
surprised
at
the
eagerness
which
animated
the
whole
team
and
which
was
communicated
to
him
*punct* ;
but
still
more
surprising
was
the
change
wrought
in
dave
and
sol-leks
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
new
dogs
*punct* ,
utterly
transformed
by
the
harness
*punct* .
*break*
all
passiveness
and
unconcern
had
dropped
from
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
alert
and
active
*punct* ,
anxious
that
the
work
should
go
well
*punct* ,
and
fiercely
irritable
with
whatever
*punct* ,
by
delay
or
confusion
*punct* ,
retarded
that
work
*punct* .
*break*
the
toil
of
the
traces
seemed
the
supreme
expression
of
their
being
*punct* ,
and
all
that
they
lived
for
and
the
only
thing
in
which
they
took
delight
*punct* .
*break*
dave
was
wheeler
or
sled
dog
*punct* ,
pulling
in
front
of
him
was
buck
*punct* ,
then
came
sol-leks
*punct* ;
the
rest
of
the
team
was
strung
out
ahead
*punct* ,
single
file
*punct* ,
to
the
leader
*punct* ,
which
position
was
filled
by
spitz
*punct* .
*break*
buck
had
been
purposely
placed
between
dave
and
sol-leks
so
that
he
might
receive
instruction
*punct* .
*break*
apt
scholar
that
he
was
*punct* ,
they
were
equally
apt
teachers
*punct* ,
never
allowing
him
to
linger
long
in
error
*punct* ,
and
enforcing
their
teaching
with
their
sharp
teeth
*punct* .
*break*
dave
was
fair
and
very
wise
*punct* .
*break*
he
never
nipped
buck
without
cause
*punct* ,
and
he
never
failed
to
nip
him
when
he
stood
in
need
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
as
francois's
whip
backed
him
up
*punct* ,
buck
found
it
to
be
cheaper
to
mend
his
ways
than
to
retaliate
*punct* ,
once
*punct* ,
during
a
brief
halt
*punct* ,
when
he
got
tangled
in
the
traces
and
delayed
the
start
*punct* ,
both
dave
and
sol
*punct* -
leks
flew
at
him
and
administered
a
sound
trouncing
*punct* .
*break*
the
resulting
tangle
was
even
worse
*punct* ,
but
buck
took
good
care
to
keep
the
traces
clear
thereafter
*punct* ;
and
ere
the
day
was
done
*punct* ,
so
well
had
he
mastered
his
work
*punct* ,
his
mates
about
ceased
nagging
him
*punct* .
*break*
francois's
whip
snapped
less
frequently
*punct* ,
and
perrault
even
honored
buck
by
lifting
up
his
feet
and
carefully
examining
them
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
hard
day's
run
*punct* ,
up
the
canon
*punct* ,
through
sheep
camp
*punct* ,
past
the
scales
and
the
timber
line
*punct* ,
across
glaciers
and
snowdrifts
hundreds
of
feet
deep
*punct* ,
and
over
the
great
chilcoot
divide
*punct* ,
which
stands
between
the
salt
water
and
the
fresh
and
guards
forbiddingly
the
sad
and
lonely
north
*punct* .
*break*
they
made
good
time
down
the
chain
of
lakes
which
fills
the
craters
of
extinct
volcanoes
*punct* ,
and
late
that
night
pulled
into
the
huge
camp
at
the
head
of
lake
bennett
*punct* ,
where
thousands
of
goldseekers
were
building
boats
against
the
break-up
of
the
ice
in
the
spring
*punct* .
*break*
buck
made
his
hole
in
the
snow
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
exhausted
just
*punct* ,
but
all
too
early
was
routed
out
in
the
cold
darkness
and
harnessed
with
his
mates
to
the
sled
*punct* .
*break*
that
day
they
made
forty
miles
*punct* ,
the
trail
being
packed
*punct* ;
but
the
next
day
*punct* ,
and
for
many
days
to
follow
*punct* ,
they
broke
their
own
trail
*punct* ,
worked
harder
*punct* ,
and
made
poorer
time
*punct* .
*break*
as
a
rule
*punct* ,
perrault
travelled
ahead
of
the
team
*punct* ,
packing
the
snow
with
webbed
shoes
to
make
it
easier
for
them
*punct* .
*break*
francois
*punct* ,
guiding
the
sled
at
the
gee
*punct* -
pole
*punct* ,
sometimes
exchanged
places
with
him
*punct* ,
but
not
often
*punct* .
*break*
perrault
was
in
a
hurry
*punct* ,
and
he
prided
himself
on
his
knowledge
of
ice
*punct* ,
which
knowledge
was
indispensable
*punct* ,
for
the
fall
ice
was
very
thin
*punct* ,
and
where
there
was
swift
water
*punct* ,
there
was
no
ice
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
day
after
day
*punct* ,
for
days
unending
*punct* ,
buck
toiled
in
the
traces
*punct* .
*break*
always
*punct* ,
they
broke
camp
in
the
dark
*punct* ,
and
the
first
gray
of
dawn
found
them
hitting
the
trail
with
fresh
miles
reeled
off
behind
them
*punct* .
*break*
and
always
they
pitched
camp
after
dark
*punct* ,
eating
their
bit
of
fish
*punct* ,
and
crawling
to
sleep
into
the
snow
*punct* .
*break*
buck
was
ravenous
*punct* .
*break*
the
pound
and
a
half
of
sun-dried
salmon
*punct* ,
which
was
his
ration
for
each
day
*punct* ,
seemed
to
go
nowhere
*punct* .
*break*
he
never
had
enough
*punct* ,
and
suffered
from
perpetual
hunger
pangs
*punct* .
*break*
yet
the
other
dogs
*punct* ,
because
they
weighed
less
and
were
born
to
the
life
*punct* ,
received
a
pound
only
of
the
fish
and
managed
to
keep
in
good
condition
*punct* .
*break*
he
swiftly
lost
the
fastidiousness
which
had
characterized
his
old
life
*punct* .
*break*
a
dainty
eater
*punct* ,
he
found
that
his
mates
*punct* ,
finishing
first
*punct* ,
robbed
him
of
his
unfinished
ration
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
defending
it
*punct* .
*break*
while
he
was
fighting
off
two
or
three
*punct* ,
it
was
disappearing
down
the
throats
of
the
others
*punct* .
*break*
to
remedy
this
*punct* ,
he
ate
as
fast
as
they
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
so
greatly
did
hunger
compel
him
*punct* ,
he
was
not
above
taking
what
did
not
belong
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
watched
and
learned
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
saw
pike
*punct* ,
one
of
the
new
dogs
*punct* ,
a
clever
malingerer
and
thief
*punct* ,
slyly
steal
a
slice
of
bacon
when
perrault's
back
was
turned
*punct* ,
he
duplicated
the
performance
the
following
day
*punct* ,
getting
away
with
the
whole
chunk
*punct* .
*break*
a
great
uproar
was
raised
*punct* ,
but
he
was
unsuspected
*punct* ;
while
dub
*punct* ,
an
awkward
blunderer
who
was
always
getting
caught
*punct* ,
was
punished
for
buck's
misdeed
*punct* .
*break*
this
first
theft
marked
buck
as
fit
to
survive
in
the
hostile
northland
environment
*punct* .
*break*
it
marked
his
adaptability
*punct* ,
his
capacity
to
adjust
himself
to
changing
conditions
*punct* ,
the
lack
of
which
would
have
meant
swift
and
terrible
death
*punct* .
*break*
it
marked
*punct* ,
further
*punct* ,
the
decay
or
going
to
pieces
of
his
moral
nature
*punct* ,
a
vain
thing
and
a
handicap
in
the
ruthless
struggle
for
existence
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
all
well
enough
in
the
southland
*punct* ,
under
the
law
of
love
and
fellowship
*punct* ,
to
respect
private
property
and
personal
feelings
*punct* ;
but
in
the
northland
*punct* ,
under
the
law
of
club
and
fang
*punct* ,
whoso
took
such
things
into
account
was
a
fool
*punct* ,
and
in
so
far
as
he
observed
them
he
would
fail
to
prosper
*punct* .
*break*
not
that
buck
reasoned
it
out
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
fit
*punct* ,
that
was
all
*punct* ,
and
unconsciously
he
accommodated
himself
to
the
new
mode
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
all
his
days
*punct* ,
no
matter
what
the
odds
*punct* ,
he
had
never
run
from
a
fight
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
club
of
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
had
beaten
into
him
a
more
fundamental
and
primitive
code
*punct* .
*break*
civilized
*punct* ,
he
could
have
died
for
a
moral
consideration
*punct* ,
say
the
defence
of
judge
miller's
riding-whip
*punct* ;
but
the
completeness
of
his
decivilization
was
now
evidenced
by
his
ability
to
flee
from
the
defence
of
a
moral
consideration
and
so
save
his
hide
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
steal
for
joy
of
it
*punct* ,
but
because
of
the
clamor
of
his
stomach
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
rob
openly
*punct* ,
but
stole
secretly
and
cunningly
*punct* ,
out
of
respect
for
club
and
fang
*punct* .
*break*
in
short
*punct* ,
the
things
he
did
were
done
because
it
was
easier
to
do
them
than
not
to
do
them
*punct* .
*break*
his
development
*punct* ,
or
retrogression
*punct* ,
was
rapid
*punct* .
*break*
his
muscles
became
hard
as
iron
*punct* ,
and
he
grew
callous
to
all
ordinary
pain
*punct* .
*break*
he
achieved
an
internal
as
well
as
external
economy
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
eat
anything
*punct* ,
no
matter
how
loathsome
or
indigestible
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
once
eaten
*punct* ,
the
juices
of
his
stomach
extracted
the
last
least
particle
of
nutriment
*punct* ;
and
his
blood
carried
it
to
the
farthest
reaches
of
his
body
*punct* ,
building
it
into
the
toughest
and
stoutest
of
tissues
*punct* .
*break*
sight
and
scent
became
remarkably
keen
*punct* ,
while
his
hearing
developed
such
acuteness
that
in
his
sleep
he
heard
the
faintest
sound
and
knew
whether
it
heralded
peace
or
peril
*punct* .
*break*
he
learned
to
bite
the
ice
out
with
his
teeth
when
it
collected
between
his
toes
*punct* ;
and
when
he
was
thirsty
and
there
was
a
thick
scum
of
ice
over
the
water
hole
*punct* ,
he
would
break
it
by
rearing
and
striking
it
with
stiff
fore
legs
*punct* .
*break*
his
most
conspicuous
trait
was
an
ability
to
scent
the
wind
and
forecast
it
a
night
in
advance
*punct* .
*break*
no
matter
how
breathless
the
air
when
he
dug
his
nest
by
tree
or
bank
*punct* ,
the
wind
that
later
blew
inevitably
found
him
to
leeward
*punct* ,
sheltered
and
snug
*punct* .
*break*
and
not
only
did
he
learn
by
experience
*punct* ,
but
instincts
long
dead
became
alive
again
*punct* .
*break*
the
domesticated
generations
fell
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
in
vague
ways
he
remembered
back
to
the
youth
of
the
breed
*punct* ,
to
the
time
the
wild
dogs
ranged
in
packs
through
the
primeval
forest
and
killed
their
meat
as
they
ran
it
down
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
no
task
for
him
to
learn
to
fight
with
cut
and
slash
and
the
quick
wolf
snap
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
manner
had
fought
forgotten
ancestors
*punct* .
*break*
they
quickened
the
old
life
within
him
*punct* ,
and
the
old
tricks
which
they
had
stamped
into
the
heredity
of
the
breed
were
his
tricks
*punct* .
*break*
they
came
to
him
without
effort
or
discovery
*punct* ,
as
though
they
had
been
his
always
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
*punct* ,
on
the
still
cold
nights
*punct* ,
he
pointed
his
nose
at
a
star
and
howled
long
and
wolflike
*punct* ,
it
was
his
ancestors
*punct* ,
dead
and
dust
*punct* ,
pointing
nose
at
star
and
howling
down
through
the
centuries
and
through
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
his
cadences
were
their
cadences
*punct* ,
the
cadences
which
voiced
their
woe
and
what
to
them
was
the
meaning
of
the
stiffness
*punct* ,
and
the
cold
*punct* ,
and
dark
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
as
token
of
what
a
puppet
thing
life
is
*punct* ,
the
ancient
song
surged
through
him
and
he
came
into
his
own
again
*punct* ;
and
he
came
because
men
had
found
a
yellow
metal
in
the
north
*punct* ,
and
because
manuel
was
a
gardener's
helper
whose
wages
did
not
lap
over
the
needs
of
his
wife
and
divers
small
copies
of
himself
*punct* .
*break*
the
dominant
primordial
beast
was
strong
in
buck
*punct* ,
and
under
the
fierce
conditions
of
trail
life
it
grew
and
grew
*punct* .
*break*
yet
it
was
a
secret
growth
*punct* .
*break*
his
newborn
cunning
gave
him
poise
and
control
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
too
busy
adjusting
himself
to
the
new
life
to
feel
at
ease
*punct* ,
and
not
only
did
he
not
pick
fights
*punct* ,
but
he
avoided
them
whenever
possible
*punct* .
*break*
a
certain
deliberateness
characterized
his
attitude
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
not
prone
to
rashness
and
precipitate
action
*punct* ;
and
in
the
bitter
hatred
between
him
and
spitz
he
betrayed
no
impatience
*punct* ,
shunned
all
offensive
acts
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
possibly
because
he
divined
in
buck
a
dangerous
rival
*punct* ,
spitz
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
showing
his
teeth
*punct* .
*break*
he
even
went
out
of
his
way
to
bully
buck
*punct* ,
striving
constantly
to
start
the
fight
which
could
end
only
in
the
death
of
one
or
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
early
in
the
trip
this
might
have
taken
place
had
it
not
been
for
an
unwonted
accident
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
end
of
this
day
they
made
a
bleak
and
miserable
camp
on
the
shore
of
lake
le
barge
*punct* .
*break*
driving
snow
*punct* ,
a
wind
that
cut
like
a
white-hot
knife
*punct* ,
and
darkness
had
forced
them
to
grope
for
a
camping
place
*punct* .
*break*
they
could
hardly
have
fared
worse
*punct* .
*break*
at
their
backs
rose
a
perpendicular
wall
of
rock
*punct* ,
and
perrault
and
francois
were
compelled
to
make
their
fire
and
spread
their
sleeping
robes
on
the
ice
of
the
lake
itself
*punct* .
*break*
the
tent
they
had
discarded
at
dyea
in
order
to
travel
light
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
sticks
of
driftwood
furnished
them
with
a
fire
that
thawed
down
through
the
ice
and
left
them
to
eat
supper
in
the
dark
*punct* .
*break*
close
in
under
the
sheltering
rock
buck
made
his
nest
*punct* .
*break*
so
snug
and
warm
was
it
*punct* ,
that
he
was
loath
to
leave
it
when
francois
distributed
the
fish
which
he
had
first
thawed
over
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
buck
finished
his
ration
and
returned
*punct* ,
he
found
his
nest
occupied
*punct* .
*break*
a
warning
snarl
told
him
that
the
trespasser
was
spitz
*punct* .
*break*
till
now
buck
had
avoided
trouble
with
his
enemy
*punct* ,
but
this
was
too
much
*punct* .
*break*
the
beast
in
him
roared
*punct* .
*break*
he
sprang
upon
spitz
with
a
fury
which
surprised
them
both
*punct* ,
and
spitz
particularly
*punct* ,
for
his
whole
experience
with
buck
had
gone
to
teach
him
that
his
rival
was
an
unusually
timid
dog
*punct* ,
who
managed
to
hold
his
own
only
because
of
his
great
weight
and
size
*punct* .
*break*
francois
was
surprised
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
when
they
shot
out
in
a
tangle
from
the
disrupted
nest
and
he
divined
the
cause
of
the
trouble
*punct* .
*break*
a-a
*punct* -
ah
*punct* !
*break*
he
cried
to
buck
*punct* .
*break*
gif
it
to
heem
*punct* ,
by
gar
*punct* !
*break*
gif
it
to
heem
*punct* ,
the
dirty
t'eef
*punct* !
*break*
spitz
was
equally
willing
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
crying
with
sheer
rage
and
eagerness
as
he
circled
back
and
forth
for
a
chance
to
spring
in
*punct* .
*break*
buck
was
no
less
eager
*punct* ,
and
no
less
cautious
*punct* ,
as
he
likewise
circled
back
and
forth
for
the
advantage
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
was
then
that
the
unexpected
happened
*punct* ,
the
thing
which
projected
their
struggle
for
supremacy
far
into
the
future
*punct* ,
past
many
a
weary
mile
of
trail
and
toil
*punct* .
*break*
an
oath
from
perrault
*punct* ,
the
resounding
impact
of
a
club
upon
a
bony
frame
*punct* ,
and
a
shrill
yelp
of
pain
*punct* ,
heralded
the
breaking
forth
of
pandemonium
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
crept
in
while
buck
and
spitz
were
fighting
*punct* ,
and
when
the
two
men
sprang
among
them
with
stout
clubs
they
showed
their
teeth
and
fought
back
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
crazed
by
the
smell
of
the
food
*punct* .
*break*
perrault
found
one
with
head
buried
in
the
grub-box
*punct* .
*break*
his
club
landed
heavily
on
the
gaunt
ribs
*punct* ,
and
the
grub-box
was
capsized
on
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
instant
a
score
of
the
famished
brutes
were
scrambling
for
the
bread
and
bacon
*punct* .
*break*
the
clubs
fell
upon
them
unheeded
*punct* .
*break*
they
yelped
and
howled
under
the
rain
of
blows
*punct* ,
but
struggled
none
the
less
madly
till
the
last
crumb
had
been
devoured
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
meantime
the
astonished
team-dogs
had
burst
out
of
their
nests
only
to
be
set
upon
by
the
fierce
invaders
*punct* .
*break*
never
had
buck
seen
such
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
as
though
their
bones
would
burst
through
their
skins
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
mere
skeletons
*punct* ,
draped
loosely
in
draggled
hides
*punct* ,
with
blazing
eyes
and
slavered
fangs
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
hunger-madness
made
them
terrifying
*punct* ,
irresistible
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
opposing
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
team-dogs
were
swept
back
against
the
cliff
at
the
first
onset
*punct* .
*break*
buck
was
beset
by
three
huskies
*punct* ,
and
in
a
trice
his
head
and
shoulders
were
ripped
and
slashed
*punct* .
*break*
the
din
was
frightful
*punct* .
*break*
billee
was
crying
as
usual
*punct* .
*break*
dave
and
sol-leks
*punct* ,
dripping
blood
from
a
score
of
wounds
*punct* ,
were
fighting
bravely
side
by
side
*punct* .
*break*
joe
was
snapping
like
a
demon
*punct* .
*break*
once
*punct* ,
his
teeth
closed
on
the
fore
leg
of
a
husky
*punct* ,
and
he
crunched
down
through
the
bone
*punct* .
*break*
pike
*punct* ,
the
malingerer
*punct* ,
leaped
upon
the
crippled
animal
*punct* ,
breaking
its
neck
with
a
quick
flash
of
teeth
and
a
jerk
*punct* ,
buck
got
a
frothing
adversary
by
the
throat
*punct* ,
and
was
sprayed
with
blood
when
his
teeth
sank
through
the
jugular
*punct* .
*break*
the
warm
taste
of
it
in
his
mouth
goaded
him
to
greater
fierceness
*punct* .
*break*
he
flung
himself
upon
another
*punct* ,
and
at
the
same
time
felt
teeth
sink
into
his
own
throat
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
spitz
*punct* ,
treacherously
attacking
from
the
side
*punct* .
*break*
perrault
and
francois
*punct* ,
having
cleaned
out
their
part
of
the
camp
*punct* ,
hurried
to
save
their
sled-dogs
*punct* .
*break*
the
wild
wave
of
famished
beasts
rolled
back
before
them
*punct* ,
and
buck
shook
himself
free
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
the
two
men
were
compelled
to
run
back
to
save
the
grub
*punct* ,
upon
which
the
huskies
returned
to
the
attack
on
the
team
*punct* .
*break*
billee
*punct* ,
terrified
into
bravery
*punct* ,
sprang
through
the
savage
circle
and
fled
away
over
the
ice
*punct* .
*break*
pike
and
dub
followed
on
his
heels
*punct* ,
with
the
rest
of
the
team
behind
*punct* .
*break*
as
buck
drew
himself
together
to
spring
after
them
*punct* ,
out
of
the
tail
of
his
eye
he
saw
spitz
rush
upon
him
with
the
evident
intention
of
overthrowing
him
*punct* .
*break*
once
off
his
feet
and
under
that
mass
of
huskies
*punct* ,
there
was
no
hope
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
braced
himself
to
the
shock
of
spitz's
charge
*punct* ,
then
joined
the
flight
out
on
the
lake
*punct* .
*break*
later
*punct* ,
the
nine
team-dogs
gathered
together
and
sought
shelter
in
the
forest
*punct* .
*break*
though
unpursued
*punct* ,
they
were
in
a
sorry
plight
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
not
one
who
was
not
wounded
in
four
or
five
places
*punct* ,
while
some
were
wounded
grievously
*punct* .
*break*
dub
was
badly
injured
in
a
hind
leg
*punct* ;
dolly
*punct* ,
the
last
husky
added
to
the
team
at
dyea
*punct* ,
had
a
badly
torn
throat
*punct* ;
joe
had
lost
an
eye
*punct* ;
while
billee
*punct* ,
the
good-natured
*punct* ,
with
an
ear
chewed
and
rent
to
ribbons
*punct* ,
cried
and
whimpered
throughout
the
night
*punct* .
*break*
at
daybreak
they
limped
warily
back
to
camp
*punct* ,
to
find
the
marauders
gone
and
the
two
men
in
bad
tempers
*punct* .
*break*
fully
half
their
grub
supply
was
gone
*punct* .
*break*
the
huskies
had
chewed
through
the
sled
lashings
and
canvas
coverings
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
nothing
*punct* ,
no
matter
how
remotely
eatable
*punct* ,
had
escaped
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
eaten
a
pair
of
perrault's
moose-hide
moccasins
*punct* ,
chunks
out
of
the
leather
traces
*punct* ,
and
even
two
feet
of
lash
from
the
end
of
francois's
whip
*punct* .
*break*
he
broke
from
a
mournful
contemplation
of
it
to
look
over
his
wounded
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
my
frien's
*punct* ,
he
said
softly
*punct* ,
mebbe

*punct* ,

*break*
mebbe

*break*

*punct* ?
*break*
the
courier
shook
his
head
dubiously
*punct* .
*break*
with
four
hundred
miles
of
trail
still
between
him
and
dawson
*punct* ,
he
could
ill
afford
to
have
madness
break
out
among
his
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
two
hours
of
cursing
and
exertion
got
the
harnesses
into
shape
*punct* ,
and
the
wound-stiffened
team
was
under
way
*punct* ,
struggling
painfully
over
the
hardest
part
of
the
trail
they
had
yet
encountered
*punct* ,
and
for
that
matter
*punct* ,
the
hardest
between
them
and
dawson
*punct* .
*break*
the
thirty
mile
river
was
wide
open
*punct* .
*break*
its
wild
water
defied
the
frost
*punct* ,
and
it
was
in
the
eddies
only
and
in
the
quiet
places
that
the
ice
held
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
six
days
of
exhausting
toil
were
required
to
cover
those
thirty
terrible
miles
*punct* .
*break*
and
terrible
they
were
*punct* ,
for
every
foot
of
them
was
accomplished
at
the
risk
of
life
to
dog
and
man
*punct* .
*break*
a
dozen
times
*punct* ,
perrault
*punct* ,
nosing
the
way
broke
through
the
ice
bridges
*punct* ,
being
saved
by
the
long
pole
he
carried
*punct* ,
which
he
so
held
that
it
fell
each
time
across
the
hole
made
by
his
body
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
cold
snap
was
on
*punct* ,
the
thermometer
registering
fifty
below
zero
*punct* ,
and
each
time
he
broke
through
he
was
compelled
for
very
life
to
build
a
fire
and
dry
his
garments
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
daunted
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
because
nothing
daunted
him
that
he
had
been
chosen
for
government
courier
*punct* .
*break*
he
took
all
manner
of
risks
*punct* ,
resolutely
thrusting
his
little
weazened
face
into
the
frost
and
struggling
on
from
dim
dawn
to
dark
*punct* .
*break*
he
skirted
the
frowning
shores
on
rim
ice
that
bent
and
crackled
under
foot
and
upon
which
they
dared
not
halt
*punct* .
*break*
once
*punct* ,
the
sled
broke
through
*punct* ,
with
dave
and
buck
*punct* ,
and
they
were
half-frozen
and
all
but
drowned
by
the
time
they
were
dragged
out
*punct* .
*break*
the
usual
fire
was
necessary
to
save
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
coated
solidly
with
ice
*punct* ,
and
the
two
men
kept
them
on
the
run
around
the
fire
*punct* ,
sweating
and
thawing
*punct* ,
so
close
that
they
were
singed
by
the
flames
*punct* .
*break*
at
another
time
spitz
went
through
*punct* ,
dragging
the
whole
team
after
him
up
to
buck
*punct* ,
who
strained
backward
with
all
his
strength
*punct* ,
his
fore
paws
on
the
slippery
edge
and
the
ice
quivering
and
snapping
all
around
*punct* .
*break*
but
behind
him
was
dave
*punct* ,
likewise
straining
backward
*punct* ,
and
behind
the
sled
was
francois
*punct* ,
pulling
till
his
tendons
cracked
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
the
rim
ice
broke
away
before
and
behind
*punct* ,
and
there
was
no
escape
except
up
the
cliff
*punct* .
*break*
perrault
scaled
it
by
a
miracle
*punct* ,
while
francois
prayed
for
just
that
miracle
*punct* ;
and
with
every
thong
and
sled
lashing
and
the
last
bit
of
harness
rove
into
a
long
rope
*punct* ,
the
dogs
were
hoisted
*punct* ,
one
by
one
*punct* ,
to
the
cliff
crest
*punct* .
*break*
francois
came
up
last
*punct* ,
after
the
sled
and
load
*punct* .
*break*
then
came
the
search
for
a
place
to
descend
*punct* ,
which
descent
was
ultimately
made
by
the
aid
of
the
rope
*punct* ,
and
night
found
them
back
on
the
river
with
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
day's
credit
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
time
they
made
the
hootalinqua
and
good
ice
*punct* ,
buck
was
played
out
*punct* .
*break*
the
rest
of
the
dogs
were
in
like
condition
*punct* ;
but
perrault
*punct* ,
to
make
up
lost
time
*punct* ,
pushed
them
late
and
early
*punct* .
*break*
the
first
day
they
covered
thirty-five
miles
to
the
big
salmon
*punct* ;
the
next
day
thirty-five
more
to
the
little
salmon
*punct* ;
the
third
day
forty
miles
*punct* ,
which
brought
them
well
up
toward
the
five
fingers
*punct* .
*break*
buck's
feet
were
not
so
compact
and
hard
as
the
feet
of
the
huskies
*punct* .
*break*
his
had
softened
during
the
many
generations
since
the
day
his
last
wild
ancestor
was
tamed
by
a
cave-dweller
or
river
man
*punct* .
*break*
au
day
long
he
limped
in
agony
*punct* ,
and
camp
once
made
*punct* ,
lay
down
like
a
dead
dog
*punct* .
*break*
hungry
as
he
was
*punct* ,
he
would
not
move
to
receive
his
ration
of
fish
*punct* ,
which
francois
had
to
bring
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
the
dog-driver
rubbed
buck's
feet
for
half
an
hour
each
night
after
supper
*punct* ,
and
sacrificed
the
tops
of
his
own
moccasins
to
make
four
moccasins
for
buck
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
a
great
relief
*punct* ,
and
buck
caused
even
the
weazened
face
of
perrault
to
twist
itself
into
a
grin
one
morning
*punct* ,
when
francois
forgot
the
moccasins
and
buck
lay
on
his
back
*punct* ,
his
four
feet
waving
appealingly
in
the
air
*punct* ,
and
refused
to
budge
without
them
*punct* .
*break*
later
his
feet
grew
hard
to
the
trail
*punct* ,
and
the
worn-out
foot-gear
was
thrown
away
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
pelly
one
morning
*punct* ,
as
they
were
harnessing
up
*punct* ,
dolly
*punct* ,
who
had
never
been
conspicuous
for
anything
*punct* ,
went
suddenly
mad
*punct* .
*break*
she
announced
her
condition
by
a
long
*punct* ,
heartbreaking
wolf
howl
that
sent
every
dog
bristling
with
fear
*punct* ,
then
sprang
straight
for
buck
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
never
seen
a
dog
go
mad
*punct* ,
nor
did
he
have
any
reason
to
fear
madness
*punct* ;
yet
he
knew
that
here
was
horror
*punct* ,
and
fled
away
from
it
in
a
panic
*punct* .
*break*
straight
away
he
raced
*punct* ,
with
dolly
*punct* ,
panting
and
frothing
*punct* ,
one
leap
behind
*punct* ;
nor
could
she
gain
on
him
*punct* ,
so
great
was
his
terror
*punct* ,
nor
could
he
leave
her
*punct* ,
so
great
was
her
madness
*punct* .
*break*
he
plunged
through
the
wooded
breast
of
the
island
*punct* ,
flew
down
to
the
lower
end
*punct* ,
crossed
a
back
channel
filled
with
rough
ice
to
another
island
*punct* ,
gained
a
third
island
*punct* ,
curved
back
to
the
main
river
*punct* ,
and
in
desperation
started
to
cross
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
all
the
time
*punct* ,
though
he
did
not
took
*punct* ,
he
could
hear
her
snarling
just
one
leap
behind
*punct* .
*break*
francois
called
to
him
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
and
he
doubled
back
*punct* ,
still
one
leap
ahead
*punct* ,
gasping
painfully
for
air
and
putting
all
his
faith
in
that
francois
would
save
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
dog-driver
held
the
axe
poised
in
his
hand
*punct* ,
and
as
buck
shot
past
him
the
axe
crashed
down
upon
mad
dolly's
head
*punct* .
*break*
buck
staggered
over
against
the
sled
*punct* ,
exhausted
*punct* ,
sobbing
for
breath
*punct* ,
helpless
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
spitz's
opportunity
*punct* .
*break*
he
sprang
upon
buck
*punct* ,
and
twice
his
teeth
sank
into
his
unresisting
foe
and
ripped
and
tore
the
flesh
to
the
bone
*punct* .
*break*
then
francois's
lash
descended
*punct* ,
and
buck
had
the
satisfaction
of
watching
spitz
receive
the
worst
whipping
as
yet
administered
to
any
of
the
teams
*punct* .
*break*
one
devil

*punct* .
*break*
some

*break*
from
then
on
it
was
war
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
spitz
*punct* ,
as
lead-dog
and
acknowledged
master
of
the
team
*punct* ,
felt
his
supremacy
threatened
by
this
strange
southland
dog
*punct* .
*break*
and
strange
buck
was
to
him
*punct* ,
for
of
the
many
southland
dogs
he
had
known
*punct* ,
not
one
had
shown
up
worthily
in
camp
and
on
trail
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
all
too
soft
*punct* ,
dying
under
the
toil
*punct* ,
the
frost
*punct* ,
and
starvation
*punct* .
*break*
buck
was
the
exception
*punct* .
*break*
he
alone
endured
and
prospered
*punct* ,
matching
the
husky
in
strength
*punct* ,
savagery
*punct* ,
and
cunning
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
was
a
masterful
dog
*punct* ,
and
what
made
him
dangerous
was
the
fact
that
the
club
of
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
had
knocked
all
blind
pluck
and
rashness
out
of
his
desire
for
mastery
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
preeminently
cunning
*punct* ,
and
could
bide
his
time
with
a
patience
that
was
nothing
less
than
primitive
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
inevitable
that
the
clash
for
leadership
should
come
*punct* .
*break*
buck
wanted
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
wanted
it
because
it
was
his
nature
*punct* ,
because
he
had
been
gripped
tight
by
that
nameless
*punct* ,
incomprehensible
pride
of
the
trail
and
trace
*punct* ,
that
pride
which
holds
dogs
in
the
toil
to
the
last
gasp
*punct* ,
which
lures
them
to
die
joyfully
in
the
harness
*punct* ,
and
breaks
their
hearts
if
they
are
cut
out
of
the
harness
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
the
pride
of
dave
as
wheel-dog
*punct* ,
of
sol-leks
as
he
pulled
with
all
his
strength
*punct* ;
the
pride
that
laid
hold
of
them
at
break
of
camp
*punct* ,
transforming
them
from
sour
and
sullen
brutes
into
straining
*punct* ,
eager
*punct* ,
ambitious
creatures
*punct* ;
the
pride
that
spurred
them
on
all
day
and
dropped
them
at
pitch
of
camp
at
night
*punct* ,
letting
them
fall
back
into
gloomy
unrest
and
uncontent
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
the
pride
that
bore
up
spitz
and
made
him
thrash
the
sled-dogs
who
blundered
and
shirked
in
the
traces
or
hid
away
at
harness-up
time
in
the
morning
*punct* .
*break*
likewise
it
was
this
pride
that
made
him
fear
buck
as
a
possible
lead-dog
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
was
buck's
pride
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
he
openly
threatened
the
other's
leadership
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
between
him
and
the
shirks
he
should
have
punished
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
did
it
deliberately
*punct* .
*break*
one
night
there
was
a
heavy
snowfall
*punct* ,
and
in
the
morning
pike
*punct* ,
the
malingerer
*punct* ,
did
not
appear
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
securely
hidden
in
his
nest
under
a
foot
of
snow
*punct* .
*break*
francois
called
him
and
sought
him
in
vain
*punct* .
*break*
spitz
was
wild
with
wrath
*punct* .
*break*
he
raged
through
the
camp
*punct* ,
smelling
and
digging
in
every
likely
place
*punct* ,
snarling
so
frightfully
that
pike
heard
and
shivered
in
his
hiding-place
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
he
was
at
last
unearthed
*punct* ,
and
spitz
flew
at
him
to
punish
him
*punct* ,
buck
flew
*punct* ,
with
equal
rage
*punct* ,
in
between
*punct* .
*break*
so
unexpected
was
it
*punct* ,
and
so
shrewdly
managed
*punct* ,
that
spitz
was
hurled
backward
and
off
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
pike
*punct* ,
who
had
been
trembling
abjectly
*punct* ,
took
heart
at
this
open
mutiny
*punct* ,
and
sprang
upon
his
overthrown
leader
*punct* .
*break*
buck
*punct* ,
to
whom
fair
play
was
a
forgotten
code
*punct* ,
likewise
sprang
upon
spitz
*punct* .
*break*
but
francois
*punct* ,
chuckling
at
the
incident
while
unswerving
in
the
administration
of
justice
*punct* ,
brought
his
lash
down
upon
buck
with
all
his
might
*punct* .
*break*
this
failed
to
drive
buck
from
his
prostrate
rival
*punct* ,
and
the
butt
of
the
whip
was
brought
into
play
*punct* .
*break*
half
*punct* -
stunned
by
the
blow
*punct* ,
buck
was
knocked
backward
and
the
lash
laid
upon
him
again
and
again
*punct* ,
while
spitz
soundly
punished
the
many
times
offending
pike
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
days
that
followed
*punct* ,
as
dawson
grew
closer
and
closer
*punct* ,
buck
still
continued
to
interfere
between
spitz
and
the
culprits
*punct* ;
but
he
did
it
craftily
*punct* ,
when
francois
was
not
around
*punct* ,
with
the
covert
mutiny
of
buck
*punct* ,
a
general
insubordination
sprang
up
and
increased
*punct* .
*break*
dave
and
sol-leks
were
unaffected
*punct* ,
but
the
rest
of
the
team
went
from
bad
to
worse
*punct* .
*break*
things
no
longer
went
right
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
continual
bickering
and
jangling
*punct* .
*break*
trouble
was
always
afoot
*punct* ,
and
at
the
bottom
of
it
was
buck
*punct* .
*break*
he
kept
francois
busy
*punct* ,
for
the
dog
*punct* -
driver
was
in
constant
apprehension
of
the
life-and-death
struggle
between
the
two
which
he
knew
must
take
place
sooner
or
later
*punct* ;
and
on
more
than
one
night
the
sounds
of
quarrelling
and
strife
among
the
other
dogs
turned
him
out
of
his
sleeping
robe
*punct* ,
fearful
that
buck
and
spitz
were
at
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
opportunity
did
not
present
itself
*punct* ,
and
they
pulled
into
dawson
one
dreary
afternoon
with
the
great
fight
still
to
come
*punct* .
*break*
here
were
many
men
*punct* ,
and
countless
dogs
*punct* ,
and
buck
found
them
all
at
work
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
the
ordained
order
of
things
that
dogs
should
work
*punct* .
*break*
all
day
they
swung
up
and
down
the
main
street
in
long
teams
*punct* ,
and
in
the
night
their
jingling
bells
still
went
by
*punct* .
*break*
they
hauled
cabin
logs
and
firewood
*punct* ,
freighted
up
to
the
mines
*punct* ,
and
did
all
manner
of
work
that
horses
did
in
the
santa
clara
valley
*punct* .
*break*
here
and
there
buck
met
southland
dogs
*punct* ,
but
in
the
main
they
were
the
wild
wolf
husky
breed
*punct* .
*break*
every
night
*punct* ,
regularly
*punct* ,
at
nine
*punct* ,
at
twelve
*punct* ,
at
three
*punct* ,
they
lifted
a
nocturnal
song
*punct* ,
a
weird
and
eerie
chant
*punct* ,
in
which
it
was
buck's
delight
to
join
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
aurora
borealis
flaming
coldly
overhead
*punct* ,
or
the
stars
leaping
in
the
frost
dance
*punct* ,
and
the
land
numb
and
frozen
under
its
pall
of
snow
*punct* ,
this
song
of
the
huskies
might
have
been
the
defiance
of
life
*punct* ,
only
it
was
pitched
in
minor
key
*punct* ,
with
long
*punct* -
drawn
wailings
and
half-sobs
*punct* ,
and
was
more
the
pleading
of
life
*punct* ,
the
articulate
travail
of
existence
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
an
old
song
*punct* ,
old
as
the
breed
itself
*punct* ,
one
of
the
first
songs
of
the
younger
world
in
a
day
when
songs
were
sad
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
invested
with
the
woe
of
unnumbered
generations
*punct* ,
this
plaint
by
which
buck
was
so
strangely
stirred
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
moaned
and
sobbed
*punct* ,
it
was
with
the
pain
of
living
that
was
of
old
the
pain
of
his
wild
fathers
*punct* ,
and
the
fear
and
mystery
of
the
cold
and
dark
that
was
to
them
fear
and
mystery
*punct* .
*break*
and
that
he
should
be
stirred
by
it
marked
the
completeness
with
which
he
harked
back
through
the
ages
of
fire
and
roof
to
the
raw
beginnings
of
life
in
the
howling
ages
*punct* .
*break*
seven
days
from
the
time
they
pulled
into
dawson
*punct* ,
they
dropped
down
the
steep
bank
by
the
barracks
to
the
yukon
trail
*punct* ,
and
pulled
for
dyea
and
salt
water
*punct* .
*break*
perrault
was
carrying
despatches
if
anything
more
urgent
than
those
he
had
brought
in
*punct* ;
also
*punct* ,
the
travel
pride
had
gripped
him
*punct* ,
and
he
purposed
to
make
the
record
trip
of
the
year
*punct* .
*break*
several
things
favored
him
in
this
*punct* .
*break*
the
week's
rest
had
recuperated
the
dogs
and
put
them
in
thorough
trim
*punct* .
*break*
the
trail
they
had
broken
into
the
country
was
packed
hard
by
later
journeyers
*punct* .
*break*
and
further
*punct* ,
the
police
had
arranged
in
two
or
three
places
deposits
of
grub
for
dog
and
man
*punct* ,
and
he
was
travelling
light
*punct* .
*break*
they
made
sixty
mile
*punct* ,
which
is
a
fifty-mile
run
*punct* ,
on
the
first
day
*punct* ;
and
the
second
day
saw
them
booming
up
the
yukon
well
on
their
way
to
pelly
*punct* .
*break*
but
such
splendid
running
was
achieved
not
without
great
trouble
and
vexation
on
the
part
of
francois
*punct* .
*break*
the
insidious
revolt
led
by
buck
had
destroyed
the
solidarity
of
the
team
*punct* .
*break*
it
no
longer
was
as
one
dog
leaping
in
the
traces
*punct* .
*break*
the
encouragement
buck
gave
the
rebels
led
them
into
all
kinds
of
petty
misdemeanors
*punct* .
*break*
no
more
was
spitz
a
leader
greatly
to
be
feared
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
awe
departed
*punct* ,
and
they
grew
equal
to
challenging
his
authority
*punct* .
*break*
pike
robbed
him
of
half
a
fish
one
night
*punct* ,
and
gulped
it
down
under
the
protection
of
buck
*punct* .
*break*
another
night
dub
and
joe
fought
spitz
and
made
him
forego
the
punishment
they
deserved
*punct* .
*break*
and
even
billee
*punct* ,
the
good-natured
*punct* ,
was
less
good-natured
*punct* ,
and
whined
not
half
so
placatingly
as
in
former
days
*punct* .
*break*
buck
never
came
near
spitz
without
snarling
and
bristling
menacingly
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
his
conduct
approached
that
of
a
bully
*punct* ,
and
he
was
given
to
swaggering
up
and
down
before
spitz's
very
nose
*punct* .
*break*
the
breaking
down
of
discipline
likewise
affected
the
dogs
in
their
relations
with
one
another
*punct* .
*break*
they
quarrelled
and
bickered
more
than
ever
among
themselves
*punct* ,
till
at
times
the
camp
was
a
howling
bedlam
*punct* .
*break*
dave
and
sol-leks
alone
were
unaltered
*punct* ,
though
they
were
made
irritable
by
the
unending
squabbling
*punct* .
*break*
francois
swore
strange
barbarous
oaths
*punct* ,
and
stamped
the
snow
in
futile
rage
*punct* ,
and
tore
his
hair
*punct* .
*break*
his
lash
was
always
singing
among
the
dogs
*punct* ,
but
it
was
of
small
avail
*punct* .
*break*
directly
his
back
was
turned
they
were
at
it
again
*punct* .
*break*
he
backed
up
spitz
with
his
whip
*punct* ,
while
buck
backed
up
the
remainder
of
the
team
*punct* .
*break*
francois
knew
he
was
behind
all
the
trouble
*punct* ,
and
buck
knew
he
knew
*punct* ;
but
buck
was
too
clever
ever
again
to
be
caught
red-handed
*punct* .
*break*
he
worked
faithfully
in
the
harness
*punct* ,
for
the
toil
had
become
a
delight
to
him
*punct* ;
yet
it
was
a
greater
delight
slyly
to
precipitate
a
fight
amongst
his
mates
and
tangle
the
traces
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
mouth
of
the
tahkeena
*punct* ,
one
night
after
supper
*punct* ,
dub
turned
up
a
snowshoe
rabbit
*punct* ,
blundered
it
*punct* ,
and
missed
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
second
the
whole
team
was
in
full
cry
*punct* .
*break*
a
hundred
yards
away
was
a
camp
of
the
northwest
police
*punct* ,
with
fifty
dogs
*punct* ,
huskies
all
*punct* ,
who
joined
the
chase
*punct* .
*break*
the
rabbit
sped
down
the
river
*punct* ,
turned
off
into
a
small
creek
*punct* ,
up
the
frozen
bed
of
which
it
held
steadily
*punct* .
*break*
it
ran
lightly
on
the
surface
of
the
snow
*punct* ,
while
the
dogs
ploughed
through
by
main
strength
*punct* .
*break*
buck
led
the
pack
*punct* ,
sixty
strong
*punct* ,
around
bend
after
bend
*punct* ,
but
he
could
not
gain
*punct* .
*break*
he
lay
down
low
to
the
race
*punct* ,
whining
eagerly
*punct* ,
his
splendid
body
flashing
forward
*punct* ,
leap
by
leap
*punct* ,
in
the
wan
white
moonlight
*punct* .
*break*
and
leap
by
leap
*punct* ,
like
some
pale
frost
wraith
*punct* ,
the
snowshoe
rabbit
flashed
on
ahead
*punct* .
*break*
all
that
stirring
of
old
instincts
which
at
stated
periods
drives
men
out
from
the
sounding
cities
to
forest
and
plain
to
kill
things
by
chemically
propelled
leaden
pellets
*punct* ,
the
blood
lust
*punct* ,
the
joy
to
kill
*punct* ,
all
this
was
buck's
*punct* ,
only
it
was
infinitely
more
intimate
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
ranging
at
the
head
of
the
pack
*punct* ,
running
the
wild
thing
down
*punct* ,
the
living
meat
*punct* ,
to
kill
with
his
own
teeth
and
wash
his
muzzle
to
the
eyes
in
warm
blood
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
an
ecstasy
that
marks
the
summit
of
life
*punct* ,
and
beyond
which
life
cannot
rise
*punct* .
*break*
and
such
is
the
paradox
of
living
*punct* ,
this
ecstasy
comes
when
one
is
most
alive
*punct* ,
and
it
comes
as
a
complete
forgetfulness
that
one
is
alive
*punct* .
*break*
this
ecstasy
*punct* ,
this
forgetfulness
of
living
*punct* ,
comes
to
the
artist
*punct* ,
caught
up
and
out
of
himself
in
a
sheet
of
flame
*punct* ;
it
comes
to
the
soldier
*punct* ,
war-mad
on
a
stricken
field
and
refusing
quarter
*punct* ;
and
it
came
to
buck
*punct* ,
leading
the
pack
*punct* ,
sounding
the
old
wolf-cry
*punct* ,
straining
after
the
food
that
was
alive
and
that
fled
swiftly
before
him
through
the
moonlight
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
sounding
the
deeps
of
his
nature
*punct* ,
and
of
the
parts
of
his
nature
that
were
deeper
than
he
*punct* ,
going
back
into
the
womb
of
time
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
mastered
by
the
sheer
surging
of
life
*punct* ,
the
tidal
wave
of
being
*punct* ,
the
perfect
joy
of
each
separate
muscle
*punct* ,
joint
*punct* ,
and
sinew
in
that
it
was
everything
that
was
not
death
*punct* ,
that
it
was
aglow
and
rampant
*punct* ,
expressing
itself
in
movement
*punct* ,
flying
exultantly
under
the
stars
and
over
the
face
of
dead
matter
that
did
not
move
*punct* .
*break*
but
spitz
*punct* ,
cold
and
calculating
even
in
his
supreme
moods
*punct* ,
left
the
pack
and
cut
across
a
narrow
neck
of
land
where
the
creek
made
a
long
bend
around
*punct* .
*break*
buck
did
not
know
of
this
*punct* ,
and
as
he
rounded
the
bend
*punct* ,
the
frost
wraith
of
a
rabbit
still
flitting
before
him
*punct* ,
he
saw
another
and
larger
frost
wraith
leap
from
the
overhanging
bank
into
the
immediate
path
of
the
rabbit
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
spitz
*punct* .
*break*
the
rabbit
could
not
turn
*punct* ,
and
as
the
white
teeth
broke
its
back
in
mid
air
it
shrieked
as
loudly
as
a
stricken
man
may
shriek
*punct* .
*break*
at
sound
of
this
*punct* ,
the
cry
of
life
plunging
down
from
life's
apex
in
the
grip
of
death
*punct* ,
the
fall
pack
at
buck's
heels
raised
a
hell's
chorus
of
delight
*punct* .
*break*
buck
did
not
cry
out
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
check
himself
*punct* ,
but
drove
in
upon
spitz
*punct* ,
shoulder
to
shoulder
*punct* ,
so
hard
that
he
missed
the
throat
*punct* .
*break*
they
rolled
over
and
over
in
the
powdery
snow
*punct* .
*break*
spitz
gained
his
feet
almost
as
though
he
had
not
been
overthrown
*punct* ,
slashing
buck
down
the
shoulder
and
leaping
clear
*punct* .
*break*
twice
his
teeth
clipped
together
*punct* ,
like
the
steel
jaws
of
a
trap
*punct* ,
as
he
backed
away
for
better
footing
*punct* ,
with
lean
and
lifting
lips
that
writhed
and
snarled
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
flash
buck
knew
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
had
come
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
to
the
death
*punct* .
*break*
as
they
circled
about
*punct* ,
snarling
*punct* ,
ears
laid
back
*punct* ,
keenly
watchful
for
the
advantage
*punct* ,
the
scene
came
to
buck
with
a
sense
of
familiarity
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
to
remember
it
all,
*punct* ,
the
white
woods
*punct* ,
and
earth
*punct* ,
and
moonlight
*punct* ,
and
the
thrill
of
battle
*punct* .
*break*
over
the
whiteness
and
silence
brooded
a
ghostly
calm
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
not
the
faintest
whisper
of
air
*punct* ,
nothing
moved
*punct* ,
not
a
leaf
quivered
*punct* ,
the
visible
breaths
of
the
dogs
rising
slowly
and
lingering
in
the
frosty
air
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
made
short
work
of
the
snowshoe
rabbit
*punct* ,
these
dogs
that
were
ill-tamed
wolves
*punct* ;
and
they
were
now
drawn
up
in
an
expectant
circle
*punct* .
*break*
they
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
were
silent
*punct* ,
their
eyes
only
gleaming
and
their
breaths
drifting
slowly
upward
*punct* .
*break*
to
buck
it
was
nothing
new
or
strange
*punct* ,
this
scene
of
old
time
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
as
though
it
had
always
been
*punct* ,
the
wonted
way
of
things
*punct* .
*break*
spitz
was
a
practised
fighter
*punct* .
*break*
from
spitzbergen
through
the
arctic
*punct* ,
and
across
canada
and
the
barrens
*punct* ,
he
had
held
his
own
with
all
manner
of
dogs
and
achieved
to
mastery
over
them
*punct* .
*break*
bitter
rage
was
his
*punct* ,
but
never
blind
rage
*punct* .
*break*
in
passion
to
rend
and
destroy
*punct* ,
he
never
forgot
that
his
enemy
was
in
like
passion
to
rend
and
destroy
*punct* .
*break*
he
never
rushed
till
he
was
prepared
to
receive
a
rush
*punct* ;
never
attacked
till
he
had
first
defended
that
attack
*punct* .
*break*
in
vain
buck
strove
to
sink
his
teeth
in
the
neck
of
the
big
white
dog
*punct* .
*break*
wherever
his
fangs
struck
for
the
softer
flesh
*punct* ,
they
were
countered
by
the
fangs
of
spitz
*punct* .
*break*
fang
clashed
fang
*punct* ,
and
lips
were
cut
and
bleeding
*punct* ,
but
buck
could
not
penetrate
his
enemy's
guard
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
warmed
up
and
enveloped
spitz
in
a
whirlwind
of
rushes
*punct* .
*break*
time
and
time
again
he
tried
for
the
snow-white
throat
*punct* ,
where
life
bubbled
near
to
the
surface
*punct* ,
and
each
time
and
every
time
spitz
slashed
him
and
got
away
*punct* .
*break*
then
buck
took
to
rushing
*punct* ,
as
though
for
the
throat
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
suddenly
drawing
back
his
head
and
curving
in
from
the
side
*punct* ,
he
would
drive
his
shoulder
at
the
shoulder
of
spitz
*punct* ,
as
a
ram
by
which
to
overthrow
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
instead
*punct* ,
buck's
shoulder
was
slashed
down
each
time
as
spitz
leaped
lightly
away
*punct* .
*break*
spitz
was
untouched
*punct* ,
while
buck
was
streaming
with
blood
and
panting
hard
*punct* .
*break*
the
fight
was
growing
desperate
*punct* .
*break*
and
all
the
while
the
silent
and
wolfish
circle
waited
to
finish
off
whichever
dog
went
down
*punct* .
*break*
as
buck
grew
winded
*punct* ,
spitz
took
to
rushing
*punct* ,
and
he
kept
him
staggering
for
footing
*punct* .
*break*
once
buck
went
over
*punct* ,
and
the
whole
circle
of
sixty
dogs
started
up
*punct* ;
but
he
recovered
himself
*punct* ,
almost
in
mid
air
*punct* ,
and
the
circle
sank
down
again
and
waited
*punct* .
*break*
but
buck
possessed
a
quality
that
made
for
greatness
*punct* ,
imagination
*punct* .
*break*
he
fought
by
instinct
*punct* ,
but
he
could
fight
by
head
as
well
*punct* .
*break*
he
rushed
*punct* ,
as
though
attempting
the
old
shoulder
trick
*punct* ,
but
at
the
last
instant
swept
low
to
the
snow
and
in
*punct* .
*break*
his
teeth
closed
on
spitz's
left
fore
leg
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
crunch
of
breaking
bone
*punct* ,
and
the
white
dog
faced
him
on
three
legs
*punct* .
*break*
thrice
he
tried
to
knock
him
over
*punct* ,
then
repeated
the
trick
and
broke
the
right
fore
leg
*punct* .
*break*
despite
the
pain
and
helplessness
*punct* ,
spitz
struggled
madly
to
keep
up
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
the
silent
circle
*punct* ,
with
gleaming
eyes
*punct* ,
lolling
tongues
*punct* ,
and
silvery
breaths
drifting
upward
*punct* ,
closing
in
upon
him
as
he
had
seen
similar
circles
close
in
upon
beaten
antagonists
in
the
past
*punct* .
*break*
only
this
time
he
was
the
one
who
was
beaten
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
hope
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
buck
was
inexorable
*punct* .
*break*
mercy
was
a
thing
reserved
for
gender
climes
*punct* .
*break*
he
manoeuvred
for
the
final
rush
*punct* .
*break*
the
circle
had
tightened
till
he
could
feel
the
breaths
of
the
huskies
on
his
flanks
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
see
them
*punct* ,
beyond
spitz
and
to
either
side
*punct* ,
half
crouching
for
the
spring
*punct* ,
their
eyes
fixed
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
a
pause
seemed
to
fall
*punct* .
*break*
every
animal
was
motionless
as
though
turned
to
stone
*punct* .
*break*
only
spitz
quivered
and
bristled
as
he
staggered
back
and
forth
*punct* ,
snarling
with
horrible
menace
*punct* ,
as
though
to
frighten
off
impending
death
*punct* .
*break*
then
buck
sprang
in
and
out
*punct* ;
but
while
he
was
in
*punct* ,
shoulder
had
at
last
squarely
met
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
the
dark
circle
became
a
dot
on
the
moon-flooded
snow
as
spitz
disappeared
from
view
*punct* .
*break*
buck
stood
and
looked
on
*punct* ,
the
successful
champion
*punct* ,
the
dominant
primordial
beast
who
had
made
his
kill
and
found
it
good
*punct* .
*break*
wot
i
say
*punct* ?
*break*
i
spik
true
w'en
i
say

*punct* .
*break*
this
was
francois's
speech
next
morning
when
he
discovered
spitz
missing
and
buck
covered
with
wounds
*punct* .
*break*
he
drew
him
to
the
fire
and
by
its
light
pointed
them
out
*punct* .
*break*
dat
spitz
fight
lak
hell
*punct* ,
said
perrault
*punct* ,
as
he
surveyed
the
gaping
rips
and
cuts
*punct* .
*break*
an
dat
buck
fight
lak
two
hells
*punct* ,
was
francois's
answer
*punct* .
*break*
an
now
we
make
good
time
*punct* .
*break*
no
more
spitz
*punct* ,
no
more
trouble
*punct* ,
sure
*punct* .
*break*
while
perrault
packed
the
camp
outfit
and
loaded
the
sled
*punct* ,
the
dog-driver
proceeded
to
harness
the
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
buck
trotted
up
to
the
place
spitz
would
have
occupied
as
leader
*punct* ;
but
francois
*punct* ,
not
noticing
him
*punct* ,
brought
sol-leks
to
the
coveted
position
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
judgment
*punct* ,
sol-leks
was
the
best
lead-dog
left
*punct* .
*break*
buck
sprang
upon
sol-leks
in
a
fury
*punct* ,
driving
him
back
and
standing
in
his
place
*punct* .
*break*
francois
cried
*punct* ,
slapping
his
thighs
gleefully
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
dat
buck
*punct* .
*break*
heem

*break*
go

*punct* ,
chook
*punct* !
*break*
he
cried
*punct* ,
but
buck
refused
to
budge
*punct* .
*break*
he
took
buck
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
*punct* ,
and
though
the
dog
growled
threateningly
*punct* ,
dragged
him
to
one
side
and
replaced
sol-leks
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
dog
did
not
like
it
*punct* ,
and
showed
plainly
that
he
was
afraid
of
buck
*punct* .
*break*
francois
was
obdurate
*punct* ,
but
when
he
turned
his
back
buck
again
displaced
sol-leks
*punct* ,
who
was
not
at
all
unwilling
to
go
*punct* .
*break*
francois
was
angry
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
by
gar
*punct* ,
i
feex
you
*punct* !
*break*
he
cried
*punct* ,
coming
back
with
a
heavy
club
in
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
buck
remembered
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
*punct* ,
and
retreated
slowly
*punct* ;
nor
did
he
attempt
to
charge
in
when
sol-leks
was
once
more
brought
forward
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
circled
just
beyond
the
range
of
the
club
*punct* ,
snarling
with
bitterness
and
rage
*punct* ;
and
while
he
circled
he
watched
the
club
so
as
to
dodge
it
if
thrown
by
francois
*punct* ,
for
he
was
become
wise
in
the
way
of
clubs
*punct* .
*break*
the
driver
went
about
his
work
*punct* ,
and
he
called
to
buck
when
he
was
ready
to
put
him
in
his
old
place
in
front
of
dave
*punct* .
*break*
buck
retreated
two
or
three
steps
*punct* .
*break*
francois
followed
him
up
*punct* ,
whereupon
he
again
retreated
*punct* .
*break*
after
some
time
of
this
*punct* ,
francois
threw
down
the
club
*punct* ,
thinking
that
buck
feared
a
thrashing
*punct* .
*break*
but
buck
was
in
open
revolt
*punct* .
*break*
he
wanted
*punct* ,
not
to
escape
a
clubbing
*punct* ,
but
to
have
the
leadership
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
his
by
right
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
earned
it
*punct* ,
and
he
would
not
be
content
with
less
*punct* .
*break*
perrault
took
a
hand
*punct* .
*break*
between
them
they
ran
him
about
for
the
better
part
of
an
hour
*punct* .
*break*
they
threw
clubs
at
him
*punct* .
*break*
they
cursed
him
*punct* ,
and
his
fathers
and
mothers
before
him
*punct* ,
and
all
his
seed
to
come
after
him
down
to
the
remotest
generation
*punct* ,
and
every
hair
on
his
body
and
drop
of
blood
in
his
veins
*punct* ;
and
he
answered
curse
with
snarl
and
kept
out
of
their
reach
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
try
to
run
away
*punct* ,
but
retreated
around
and
around
the
camp
*punct* ,
advertising
plainly
that
when
his
desire
was
met
*punct* ,
he
would
come
in
and
be
good
*punct* .
*break*
francois
sat
down
and
scratched
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
perrault
looked
at
his
watch
and
swore
*punct* .
*break*
time
was
flying
*punct* ,
and
they
should
have
been
on
the
trail
an
hour
gone
*punct* .
*break*
francois
scratched
his
head
again
*punct* .
*break*
he
shook
it
and
grinned
sheepishly
at
the
courier
*punct* ,
who
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
sign
that
they
were
beaten
*punct* .
*break*
then
francois
went
up
to
where
sol-leks
stood
and
called
to
buck
*punct* .
*break*
buck
laughed
*punct* ,
as
dogs
laugh
*punct* ,
yet
kept
his
distance
*punct* .
*break*
francois
unfastened
sol-leks's
traces
and
put
him
back
in
his
old
place
*punct* .
*break*
the
team
stood
harnessed
to
the
sled
in
an
unbroken
line
*punct* ,
ready
for
the
trail
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
place
for
buck
save
at
the
front
*punct* .
*break*
once
more
francois
called
*punct* ,
and
once
more
buck
laughed
and
kept
away
*punct* .
*break*
t'row
down
de
club
*punct* ,
perrault
commanded
*punct* .
*break*
francois
complied
*punct* ,
whereupon
buck
trotted
in
*punct* ,
laughing
triumphantly
*punct* ,
and
swung
around
into
position
at
the
head
of
the
team
*punct* .
*break*
his
traces
were
fastened
*punct* ,
the
sled
broken
out
*punct* ,
and
with
both
men
running
they
dashed
out
on
to
the
river
trail
*punct* .
*break*
highly
as
the
dog-driver
had
forevalued
buck
*punct* ,
with
his
two
devils
*punct* ,
he
found
*punct* ,
while
the
day
was
yet
young
*punct* ,
that
he
had
undervalued
*punct* .
*break*
at
a
bound
buck
took
up
the
duties
of
leadership
*punct* ;
and
where
judgment
was
required
*punct* ,
and
quick
thinking
and
quick
acting
*punct* ,
he
showed
himself
the
superior
even
of
spitz
*punct* ,
of
whom
francois
had
never
seen
an
equal
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
was
in
giving
the
law
and
making
his
mates
live
up
to
it
*punct* ,
that
buck
excelled
*punct* .
*break*
dave
and
sol-leks
did
not
mind
the
change
in
leadership
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
none
of
their
business
*punct* .
*break*
their
business
was
to
toil
*punct* ,
and
toil
mightily
*punct* ,
in
the
traces
*punct* .
*break*
so
long
as
that
were
not
interfered
with
*punct* ,
they
did
not
care
what
happened
*punct* .
*break*
billee
*punct* ,
the
good-natured
*punct* ,
could
lead
for
all
they
cared
*punct* ,
so
long
as
he
kept
order
*punct* .
*break*
the
rest
of
the
team
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
had
grown
unruly
during
the
last
days
of
spitz
*punct* ,
and
their
surprise
was
great
now
that
buck
proceeded
to
lick
them
into
shape
*punct* .
*break*
pike
*punct* ,
who
pulled
at
buck's
heels
*punct* ,
and
who
never
put
an
ounce
more
of
his
weight
against
the
breast-band
than
he
was
compelled
to
do
*punct* ,
was
swiftly
and
repeatedly
shaken
for
loafing
*punct* ;
and
ere
the
first
day
was
done
he
was
pulling
more
than
ever
before
in
his
life
*punct* .
*break*
the
first
night
in
camp
*punct* ,
joe
*punct* ,
the
sour
one
*punct* ,
was
punished
roundly
*punct* ,
a
thing
that
spitz
had
never
succeeded
in
doing
*punct* .
*break*
buck
simply
smothered
him
by
virtue
of
superior
weight
*punct* ,
and
cut
him
up
till
he
ceased
snapping
and
began
to
whine
for
mercy
*punct* .
*break*
the
general
tone
of
the
team
picked
up
immediately
*punct* .
*break*
it
recovered
its
old-time
solidarity
*punct* ,
and
once
more
the
dogs
leaped
as
one
dog
in
the
traces
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
rink
rapids
two
native
huskies
*punct* ,
teek
and
koona
*punct* ,
were
added
*punct* ;
and
the
celerity
with
which
buck
broke
them
in
took
away
francois's
breath
*punct* .
*break*
nevaire
such
a
dog
as
dat
buck
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,

*break*

*break*
wot
you
say
*punct* ,
perrault
*punct* ?
*break*
and
perrault
nodded
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
ahead
of
the
record
then
*punct* ,
and
gaining
day
by
day
*punct* .
*break*
the
trail
was
in
excellent
condition
*punct* ,
well
packed
and
hard
*punct* ,
and
there
was
no
new-fallen
snow
with
which
to
contend
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
too
cold
*punct* .
*break*
the
temperature
dropped
to
fifty
below
zero
and
remained
there
the
whole
trip
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
rode
and
ran
by
turn
*punct* ,
and
the
dogs
were
kept
on
the
jump
*punct* ,
with
but
infrequent
stoppages
*punct* .
*break*
the
thirty
mile
river
was
comparatively
coated
with
ice
*punct* ,
and
they
covered
in
one
day
going
out
what
had
taken
them
ten
days
coming
in
*punct* .
*break*
in
one
run
they
made
a
sixty-mile
dash
from
the
foot
of
lake
le
barge
to
the
white
horse
rapids
*punct* .
*break*
across
marsh
*punct* ,
tagish
*punct* ,
and
bennett
*punct* ,
seventy
miles
of
lakes
*punct* ,
they
flew
so
fast
that
the
man
whose
turn
it
was
to
run
towed
behind
the
sled
at
the
end
of
a
rope
*punct* .
*break*
and
on
the
last
night
of
the
second
week
they
topped
white
pass
and
dropped
down
the
sea
slope
with
the
lights
of
skaguay
and
of
the
shipping
at
their
feet
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
record
run
*punct* .
*break*
each
day
for
fourteen
days
they
had
averaged
forty
miles
*punct* .
*break*
for
three
days
perrault
and
francois
threw
chests
up
and
down
the
main
street
of
skaguay
and
were
deluged
with
invitations
to
drink
*punct* ,
while
the
team
was
the
constant
centre
of
a
worshipful
crowd
of
dog-busters
and
mushers
*punct* .
*break*
then
three
or
four
western
bad
men
aspired
to
clean
out
the
town
*punct* ,
were
riddled
like
pepper-boxes
for
their
pains
*punct* ,
and
public
interest
turned
to
other
idols
*punct* .
*break*
next
came
official
orders
*punct* .
*break*
francois
called
buck
to
him
*punct* ,
threw
his
arms
around
him
*punct* ,
wept
over
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
that
was
the
last
of
francois
and
perrault
*punct* .
*break*
like
other
men
*punct* ,
they
passed
out
of
buck's
life
for
good
*punct* .
*break*
a
scotch
half-breed
took
charge
of
him
and
his
mates
*punct* ,
and
in
company
with
a
dozen
other
dog-teams
he
started
back
over
the
weary
trail
to
dawson
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
no
light
running
now
*punct* ,
nor
record
time
*punct* ,
but
heavy
toil
each
day
*punct* ,
with
a
heavy
load
behind
*punct* ;
for
this
was
the
mail
train
*punct* ,
carrying
word
from
the
world
to
the
men
who
sought
gold
under
the
shadow
of
the
pole
*punct* .
*break*
buck
did
not
like
it
*punct* ,
but
he
bore
up
well
to
the
work
*punct* ,
taking
pride
in
it
after
the
manner
of
dave
and
sol-leks
*punct* ,
and
seeing
that
his
mates
*punct* ,
whether
they
prided
in
it
or
not
*punct* ,
did
their
fair
share
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
monotonous
life
*punct* ,
operating
with
machine-like
regularity
*punct* .
*break*
one
day
was
very
like
another
*punct* .
*break*
at
a
certain
time
each
morning
the
cooks
turned
out
*punct* ,
fires
were
built
*punct* ,
and
breakfast
was
eaten
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
while
some
broke
camp
*punct* ,
others
harnessed
the
dogs
*punct* ,
and
they
were
under
way
an
hour
or
so
before
the
darkness
fell
which
gave
warning
of
dawn
*punct* .
*break*
at
night
*punct* ,
camp
was
made
*punct* .
*break*
some
pitched
the
flies
*punct* ,
others
cut
firewood
and
pine
boughs
for
the
beds
*punct* ,
and
still
others
carried
water
or
ice
for
the
cooks
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
the
dogs
were
fed
*punct* .
*break*
to
them
*punct* ,
this
was
the
one
feature
of
the
day
*punct* ,
though
it
was
good
to
loaf
around
*punct* ,
after
the
fish
was
eaten
*punct* ,
for
an
hour
or
so
with
the
other
dogs
*punct* ,
of
which
there
were
fivescore
and
odd
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
fierce
fighters
among
them
*punct* ,
but
three
battles
with
the
fiercest
brought
buck
to
mastery
*punct* ,
so
that
when
he
bristled
and
showed
his
teeth
they
got
out
of
his
way
*punct* .
*break*
best
of
all
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
he
loved
to
lie
near
the
fire
*punct* ,
hind
legs
crouched
under
him
*punct* ,
fore
legs
stretched
out
in
front
*punct* ,
head
raised
*punct* ,
and
eyes
blinking
dreamily
at
the
flames
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
he
thought
of
judge
miller's
big
house
in
the
sun-kissed
santa
clara
valley
*punct* ,
and
of
the
cement
swimming-tank
*punct* ,
and
ysabel
*punct* ,
the
mexican
hairless
*punct* ,
and
toots
*punct* ,
the
japanese
pug
*punct* ;
but
oftener
he
remembered
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
*punct* ,
the
death
of
curly
*punct* ,
the
great
fight
with
spitz
*punct* ,
and
the
good
things
he
had
eaten
or
would
like
to
eat
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
not
homesick
*punct* .
*break*
the
sunland
was
very
dim
and
distant
*punct* ,
and
such
memories
had
no
power
over
him
*punct* .
*break*
far
more
potent
were
the
memories
of
his
heredity
that
gave
things
he
had
never
seen
before
a
seeming
familiarity
*punct* ;
the
instincts
*punct* ,
which
were
but
the
memories
of
his
ancestors
become
habits
*punct* ,
which
had
lapsed
in
later
days
*punct* ,
and
still
later
*punct* ,
in
him
*punct* ,
quickened
and
become
alive
again
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
as
he
crouched
there
*punct* ,
blinking
dreamily
at
the
flames
*punct* ,
it
seemed
that
the
flames
were
of
another
fire
*punct* ,
and
that
as
he
crouched
by
this
other
fire
he
saw
another
and
different
man
from
the
half-breed
cook
before
him
*punct* .
*break*
this
other
man
was
shorter
of
leg
and
longer
of
arm
*punct* ,
with
muscles
that
were
stringy
and
knotty
rather
than
rounded
and
swelling
*punct* .
*break*
the
hair
of
this
man
was
long
and
matted
*punct* ,
and
his
head
slanted
back
under
it
from
the
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
he
uttered
strange
sounds
*punct* ,
and
seemed
very
much
afraid
of
the
darkness
*punct* ,
into
which
he
peered
continually
*punct* ,
clutching
in
his
hand
*punct* ,
which
hung
midway
between
knee
and
foot
*punct* ,
a
stick
with
a
heavy
stone
made
fast
to
the
end
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
all
but
naked
*punct* ,
a
ragged
and
fire-scorched
skin
hanging
part
way
down
his
back
*punct* ,
but
on
his
body
there
was
much
hair
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
places
*punct* ,
across
the
chest
and
shoulders
and
down
the
outside
of
the
arms
and
thighs
*punct* ,
it
was
matted
into
almost
a
thick
fur
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
stand
erect
*punct* ,
but
with
trunk
inclined
forward
from
the
hips
*punct* ,
on
legs
that
bent
at
the
knees
*punct* .
*break*
about
his
body
there
was
a
peculiar
springiness
*punct* ,
or
resiliency
*punct* ,
almost
catlike
*punct* ,
and
a
quick
alertness
as
of
one
who
lived
in
perpetual
fear
of
things
seen
and
unseen
*punct* .
*break*
at
other
times
this
hairy
man
squatted
by
the
fire
with
head
between
his
legs
and
slept
*punct* .
*break*
on
such
occasions
his
elbows
were
on
his
knees
*punct* ,
his
hands
clasped
above
his
head
as
though
to
shed
rain
by
the
hairy
arms
*punct* .
*break*
and
beyond
that
fire
*punct* ,
in
the
circling
darkness
*punct* ,
buck
could
see
many
gleaming
coals
*punct* ,
two
by
two
*punct* ,
always
two
by
two
*punct* ,
which
he
knew
to
be
the
eyes
of
great
beasts
of
prey
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
could
hear
the
crashing
of
their
bodies
through
the
undergrowth
*punct* ,
and
the
noises
they
made
in
the
night
*punct* .
*break*
and
dreaming
there
by
the
yukon
bank
*punct* ,
with
lazy
eyes
blinking
at
the
fire
*punct* ,
these
sounds
and
sights
of
another
world
would
make
the
hair
to
rise
along
his
back
and
stand
on
end
across
his
shoulders
and
up
his
neck
*punct* ,
till
he
whimpered
low
and
suppressedly
*punct* ,
or
growled
softly
*punct* ,
and
the
half-breed
cook
shouted
at
him
*punct* ,
hey
*punct* ,
you
buck
*punct* ,
wake
up
*punct* !
*break*
whereupon
the
other
world
would
vanish
and
the
real
world
come
into
his
eyes
*punct* ,
and
he
would
get
up
and
yawn
and
stretch
as
though
he
had
been
asleep
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
hard
trip
*punct* ,
with
the
mail
behind
them
*punct* ,
and
the
heavy
work
wore
them
down
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
short
of
weight
and
in
poor
condition
when
they
made
dawson
*punct* ,
and
should
have
had
a
ten
days
or
a
week's
rest
at
least
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
two
days
time
they
dropped
down
the
yukon
bank
from
the
barracks
*punct* ,
loaded
with
letters
for
the
outside
*punct* .
*break*
the
dogs
were
tired
*punct* ,
the
drivers
grumbling
*punct* ,
and
to
make
matters
worse
*punct* ,
it
snowed
every
day
*punct* .
*break*
this
meant
a
soft
trail
*punct* ,
greater
friction
on
the
runners
*punct* ,
and
heavier
pulling
for
the
dogs
*punct* ;
yet
the
drivers
were
fair
through
it
all
*punct* ,
and
did
their
best
for
the
animals
*punct* .
*break*
each
night
the
dogs
were
attended
to
first
*punct* .
*break*
they
ate
before
the
drivers
ate
*punct* ,
and
no
man
sought
his
sleeping-robe
till
he
had
seen
to
the
feet
of
the
dogs
he
drove
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
their
strength
went
down
*punct* .
*break*
since
the
beginning
of
the
winter
they
had
travelled
eighteen
hundred
miles
*punct* ,
dragging
sleds
the
whole
weary
distance
*punct* ;
and
eighteen
hundred
miles
will
tell
upon
life
of
the
toughest
*punct* .
*break*
buck
stood
it
*punct* ,
keeping
his
mates
up
to
their
work
and
maintaining
discipline
*punct* ,
though
he
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
was
very
tired
*punct* .
*break*
billee
cried
and
whimpered
regularly
in
his
sleep
each
night
*punct* .
*break*
joe
was
sourer
than
ever
*punct* ,
and
sol-leks
was
unapproachable
*punct* ,
blind
side
or
other
side
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
was
dave
who
suffered
most
of
all
*punct* .
*break*
something
had
gone
wrong
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
became
more
morose
and
irritable
*punct* ,
and
when
camp
was
pitched
at
once
made
his
nest
*punct* ,
where
his
driver
fed
him
*punct* .
*break*
once
out
of
the
harness
and
down
*punct* ,
he
did
not
get
on
his
feet
again
till
harness-up
time
in
the
morning
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
*punct* ,
in
the
traces
*punct* ,
when
jerked
by
a
sudden
stoppage
of
the
sled
*punct* ,
or
by
straining
to
start
it
*punct* ,
he
would
cry
out
with
pain
*punct* .
*break*
the
driver
examined
him
*punct* ,
but
could
find
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
drivers
became
interested
in
his
case
*punct* .
*break*
they
talked
it
over
at
meal-time
*punct* ,
and
over
their
last
pipes
before
going
to
bed
*punct* ,
and
one
night
they
held
a
consultation
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
brought
from
his
nest
to
the
fire
and
was
pressed
and
prodded
till
he
cried
out
many
times
*punct* .
*break*
something
was
wrong
inside
*punct* ,
but
they
could
locate
no
broken
bones
*punct* ,
could
not
make
it
out
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
time
cassiar
bar
was
reached
*punct* ,
he
was
so
weak
that
he
was
falling
repeatedly
in
the
traces
*punct* .
*break*
the
scotch
half-breed
called
a
halt
and
took
him
out
of
the
team
*punct* ,
making
the
next
dog
*punct* ,
sol-leks
*punct* ,
fast
to
the
sled
*punct* .
*break*
his
intention
was
to
rest
dave
*punct* ,
letting
him
run
free
behind
the
sled
*punct* .
*break*
sick
as
he
was
*punct* ,
dave
resented
being
taken
out
*punct* ,
grunting
and
growling
while
the
traces
were
unfastened
*punct* ,
and
whimpering
broken-heartedly
when
he
saw
sol-leks
in
the
position
he
had
held
and
served
so
long
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
pride
of
trace
and
trail
was
his
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
sick
unto
death
*punct* ,
he
could
not
bear
that
another
dog
should
do
his
work
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
sled
started
*punct* ,
he
floundered
in
the
soft
snow
alongside
the
beaten
trail
*punct* ,
attacking
sol-leks
with
his
teeth
*punct* ,
rushing
against
him
and
trying
to
thrust
him
off
into
the
soft
snow
on
the
other
side
*punct* ,
striving
to
leap
inside
his
traces
and
get
between
him
and
the
sled
*punct* ,
and
a
the
while
whining
and
yelping
and
crying
with
grief
and
pain
*punct* .
*break*
the
half-breed
tried
to
drive
him
away
with
the
whip
*punct* ;
but
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
stinging
lash
*punct* ,
and
the
man
had
not
the
heart
to
strike
harder
*punct* .
*break*
dave
refused
to
run
quietly
on
the
trail
behind
the
sled
*punct* ,
where
the
going
was
easy
*punct* ,
but
continued
to
flounder
alongside
in
the
soft
snow
*punct* ,
where
the
going
was
most
difficult
*punct* ,
till
exhausted
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
fell
*punct* ,
and
lay
where
he
fell
*punct* ,
howling
lugubriously
as
the
long
train
of
sleds
churned
by
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
last
remnant
of
his
strength
he
managed
to
stagger
along
behind
till
the
train
made
another
stop
*punct* ,
when
he
floundered
past
the
sleds
to
his
own
*punct* ,
where
he
stood
alongside
sol-leks
*punct* .
*break*
his
driver
lingered
a
moment
to
get
a
light
for
his
pipe
from
the
man
behind
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
returned
and
started
his
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
they
swung
out
on
the
trail
with
remarkable
lack
of
exertion
*punct* ,
turned
their
heads
uneasily
*punct* ,
and
stopped
in
surprise
*punct* .
*break*
the
driver
was
surprised
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ;
the
sled
had
not
moved
*punct* .
*break*
he
called
his
comrades
to
witness
the
sight
*punct* .
*break*
dave
had
bitten
through
both
of
sol-leks's
traces
*punct* ,
and
was
standing
directly
in
front
of
the
sled
in
his
proper
place
*punct* .
*break*
he
pleaded
with
his
eyes
to
remain
there
*punct* .
*break*
the
driver
was
perplexed
*punct* .
*break*
his
comrades
talked
of
how
a
dog
could
break
its
heart
through
being
denied
the
work
that
killed
it
*punct* ,
and
recalled
instances
they
had
known
*punct* ,
where
dogs
*punct* ,
too
old
for
the
toil
*punct* ,
or
injured
*punct* ,
had
died
because
they
were
cut
out
of
the
traces
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
they
held
it
a
mercy
*punct* ,
since
dave
was
to
die
anyway
*punct* ,
that
he
should
die
in
the
traces
*punct* ,
heart-easy
and
content
*punct* .
*break*
so
he
was
harnessed
in
again
*punct* ,
and
proudly
he
pulled
as
of
old
*punct* ,
though
more
than
once
he
cried
out
involuntarily
from
the
bite
of
his
inward
hurt
*punct* .
*break*
several
times
he
fell
down
and
was
dragged
in
the
traces
*punct* ,
and
once
the
sled
ran
upon
him
so
that
he
limped
thereafter
in
one
of
his
hind
legs
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
held
out
till
camp
was
reached
*punct* ,
when
his
driver
made
a
place
for
him
by
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
morning
found
him
too
weak
to
travel
*punct* .
*break*
at
harness-up
time
he
tried
to
crawl
to
his
driver
*punct* .
*break*
by
convulsive
efforts
he
got
on
his
feet
*punct* ,
staggered
*punct* ,
and
fell
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
wormed
his
way
forward
slowly
toward
where
the
harnesses
were
being
put
on
his
mates
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
advance
his
fore
legs
and
drag
up
his
body
with
a
sort
of
hitching
movement
*punct* ,
when
he
would
advance
his
fore
legs
and
hitch
ahead
again
for
a
few
more
inches
*punct* .
*break*
his
strength
left
him
*punct* ,
and
the
last
his
mates
saw
of
him
he
lay
gasping
in
the
snow
and
yearning
toward
them
*punct* .
*break*
but
they
could
hear
him
mournfully
howling
till
they
passed
out
of
sight
behind
a
belt
of
river
timber
*punct* .
*break*
here
the
train
was
halted
*punct* .
*break*
the
scotch
half-breed
slowly
retraced
his
steps
to
the
camp
they
had
left
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
ceased
talking
*punct* .
*break*
a
revolver-shot
rang
out
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
came
back
hurriedly
*punct* .
*break*
the
whips
snapped
*punct* ,
the
bells
tinkled
merrily
*punct* ,
the
sleds
churned
along
the
trail
*punct* ;
but
buck
knew
*punct* ,
and
every
dog
knew
*punct* ,
what
had
taken
place
behind
the
belt
of
river
trees
*punct* .
*break*
thirty
days
from
the
time
it
left
dawson
*punct* ,
the
salt
water
mail
*punct* ,
with
buck
and
his
mates
at
the
fore
*punct* ,
arrived
at
skaguay
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
in
a
wretched
state
*punct* ,
worn
out
and
worn
down
*punct* .
*break*
buck's
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
had
dwindled
to
one
hundred
and
fifteen
*punct* .
*break*
the
rest
of
his
mates
*punct* ,
though
lighter
dogs
*punct* ,
had
relatively
lost
more
weight
than
he
*punct* .
*break*
pike
*punct* ,
the
malingerer
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
in
his
lifetime
of
deceit
*punct* ,
had
often
successfully
feigned
a
hurt
leg
*punct* ,
was
now
limping
in
earnest
*punct* .
*break*
sol-leks
was
limping
*punct* ,
and
dub
was
suffering
from
a
wrenched
shoulder-blade
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
all
terribly
footsore
*punct* .
*break*
no
spring
or
rebound
was
left
in
them
*punct* .
*break*
their
feet
fell
heavily
on
the
trail
*punct* ,
jarring
their
bodies
and
doubting
the
fatigue
of
a
day's
travel
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
them
except
that
they
were
dead
tired
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
the
dead-tiredness
that
comes
through
brief
and
excessive
effort
*punct* ,
from
which
recovery
is
a
matter
of
hours
*punct* ;
but
it
was
the
dead-tiredness
that
comes
through
the
slow
and
prolonged
strength
drainage
of
months
of
toil
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
power
of
recuperation
left
*punct* ,
no
reserve
strength
to
call
upon
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
been
all
used
*punct* ,
the
last
least
bit
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
every
muscle
*punct* ,
every
fibre
*punct* ,
every
cell
*punct* ,
was
tired
*punct* ,
dead
tired
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
was
reason
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
in
less
than
five
months
they
had
travelled
twenty-five
hundred
miles
*punct* ,
during
the
last
eighteen
hundred
of
which
they
had
had
but
five
days
rest
*punct* .
*break*
when
they
arrived
at
skaguay
they
were
apparently
on
their
last
legs
*punct* .
*break*
they
could
barely
keep
the
traces
taut
*punct* ,
and
on
the
down
grades
just
managed
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
sled
*punct* .
*break*
mush
on
*punct* ,
poor
sore
feets
*punct* ,
the
driver
encouraged
them
as
they
tottered
down
the
main
street
of
skaguay
*punct* .
*break*
dis

*punct* .
*break*
den

*break*
one
bully
long
res'
*punct* .
*break*
the
drivers
confidently
expected
a
long
stopover
*punct* .
*break*
themselves
*punct* ,
they
had
covered
twelve
hundred
miles
with
two
days
rest
*punct* ,
and
in
the
nature
of
reason
and
common
justice
they
deserved
an
interval
of
loafing
*punct* .
*break*
but
so
many
were
the
men
who
had
rushed
into
the
klondike
*punct* ,
and
so
many
were
the
sweethearts
*punct* ,
wives
*punct* ,
and
kin
that
had
not
rushed
in
*punct* ,
that
the
congested
mail
was
taking
on
alpine
proportions
*punct* ;
also
*punct* ,
there
were
official
orders
*punct* .
*break*
fresh
batches
of
hudson
bay
dogs
were
to
take
the
places
of
those
worthless
for
the
trail
*punct* .
*break*
the
worthless
ones
were
to
be
got
rid
of
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
since
dogs
count
for
little
against
dollars
*punct* ,
they
were
to
be
sold
*punct* .
*break*
three
days
passed
*punct* ,
by
which
time
buck
and
his
mates
found
how
really
tired
and
weak
they
were
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
*punct* ,
two
men
from
the
states
came
along
and
bought
them
*punct* ,
harness
and
all
*punct* ,
for
a
song
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
addressed
each
other
as
hal
and
charles
*punct* .
*break*
charles
was
a
middle-aged
*punct* ,
lightish-colored
man
*punct* ,
with
weak
and
watery
eyes
and
a
mustache
that
twisted
fiercely
and
vigorously
up
*punct* ,
giving
the
lie
to
the
limply
drooping
lip
it
concealed
*punct* .
*break*
hal
was
a
youngster
of
nineteen
or
twenty
*punct* ,
with
a
big
colt's
revolver
and
a
hunting-knife
strapped
about
him
on
a
belt
that
fairly
bristled
with
cartridges
*punct* .
*break*
this
belt
was
the
most
salient
thing
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
advertised
his
callowness
*punct* ,
a
callowness
sheer
and
unutterable
*punct* .
*break*
both
men
were
manifestly
out
of
place
*punct* ,
and
why
such
as
they
should
adventure
the
north
is
part
of
the
mystery
of
things
that
passes
understanding
*punct* .
*break*
buck
heard
the
chaffering
*punct* ,
saw
the
money
pass
between
the
man
and
the
government
agent
*punct* ,
and
knew
that
the
scotch
half-breed
and
the
mail-train
drivers
were
passing
out
of
his
life
on
the
heels
of
perrault
and
francois
and
the
others
who
had
gone
before
*punct* .
*break*
when
driven
with
his
mates
to
the
new
owners
camp
*punct* ,
buck
saw
a
slipshod
and
slovenly
affair
*punct* ,
tent
half
stretched
*punct* ,
dishes
unwashed
*punct* ,
everything
in
disorder
*punct* ;
also
*punct* ,
he
saw
a
woman
*punct* .
*break*
mercedes
the
men
called
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
charles's
wife
and
hal's
sister
*punct* ,
a
nice
family
party
*punct* .
*break*
buck
watched
them
apprehensively
as
they
proceeded
to
take
down
the
tent
and
load
the
sled
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
great
deal
of
effort
about
their
manner
*punct* ,
but
no
businesslike
method
*punct* .
*break*
the
tent
was
rolled
into
an
awkward
bundle
three
times
as
large
as
it
should
have
been
*punct* .
*break*
the
tin
dishes
were
packed
away
unwashed
*punct* .
*break*
mercedes
continually
fluttered
in
the
way
of
her
men
and
kept
up
an
unbroken
chattering
of
remonstrance
and
advice
*punct* .
*break*
when
they
put
a
clothes-sack
on
the
front
of
the
sled
*punct* ,
she
suggested
it
should
go
on
the
back
*punct* ;
and
when
they
had
put
it
on
the
back
*punct* ,
and
covered
it
over
with
a
couple
of
other
bundles
*punct* ,
she
discovered
overlooked
articles
which
could
abide
nowhere
else
but
in
that
very
sack
*punct* ,
and
they
unloaded
again
*punct* .
*break*
three
men
from
a
neighboring
tent
came
out
and
looked
on
*punct* ,
grinning
and
winking
at
one
another
*punct* .
*break*
you've
got
a
right
smart
load
as
it
is
*punct* ,
said
one
of
them
*punct* ;
and
it's
not
me
should
tell
you
your
business
*punct* ,
but
i
wouldn't
tote
that
tent
along
if
i
was
you
*punct* .
*break*
cried
mercedes
*punct* ,
throwing
up
her
hands
in
dainty
dismay
*punct* .
*break*
however
in
the
world
could
i
manage
without
a
tent
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
springtime
*punct* ,
and
you
won't
get
any
more
cold
weather
*punct* ,
the
man
replied
*punct* .
*break*
she
shook
her
head
decidedly
*punct* ,
and
charles
and
hal
put
the
last
odds
and
ends
on
top
the
mountainous
load
*punct* .
*break*
think
it'll
ride
*punct* ?
*break*
one
of
the
men
asked
*punct* .
*break*
why
shouldn't
it
*punct* ?
*break*
charles
demanded
rather
shortly
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
that's
all
right
*punct* ,
that's
all
right
*punct* ,
the
man
hastened
meekly
to
say
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
just
a-wonderin'
*punct* ,
that
is
all
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
a
mite
top-heavy
*punct* .
*break*
charles
turned
his
back
and
drew
the
lashings
down
as
well
as
he
could
*punct* ,
which
was
not
in
the
least
well
*punct* .
*break*
an
of
course
the
dogs
can
hike
along
all
day
with
that
contraption
behind
them
*punct* ,
affirmed
a
second
of
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
certainly
*punct* ,
said
hal
*punct* ,
with
freezing
politeness
*punct* ,
taking
hold
of
the
gee-pole
with
one
hand
and
swinging
his
whip
from
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
mush
on
there
*punct* !
*break*
the
dogs
sprang
against
the
breast-bands
*punct* ,
strained
hard
for
a
few
moments
*punct* ,
then
relaxed
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
unable
to
move
the
sled
*punct* .
*break*
the
lazy
brutes
*punct* ,
i'll
show
them
*punct* ,
he
cried
*punct* ,
preparing
to
lash
out
at
them
with
the
whip
*punct* .
*break*
but
mercedes
interfered
*punct* ,
crying
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
hal
*punct* ,
you
mustn't
*punct* ,
as
she
caught
hold
of
the
whip
and
wrenched
it
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
poor
dears
*punct* !
*break*
now
you
must
promise
you
won't
be
harsh
with
them
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
*punct* ,
or
i
won't
go
a
step
*punct* .
*break*
precious
lot
you
know
about
dogs
*punct* ,
her
brother
sneered
*punct* ;
and
i
wish
you'd
leave
me
alone
*punct* .
*break*
they're
lazy
*punct* ,
i
tell
you
*punct* ,
and
you've
got
to
whip
them
to
get
anything
out
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
that's
their
way
*punct* .
*break*
you
ask
any
one
*punct* .
*break*
ask
one
of
those
men
*punct* .
*break*
mercedes
looked
at
them
imploringly
*punct* ,
untold
repugnance
at
sight
of
pain
written
in
her
pretty
face
*punct* .
*break*
they're
weak
as
water
*punct* ,
if
you
want
to
know
*punct* ,
came
the
reply
from
one
of
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
plum
tuckered
out
*punct* ,
that's
what's
the
matter
*punct* .
*break*
they
need
a
rest
*punct* .
*break*
rest
be
blanked
*punct* ,
said
hal
*punct* ,
with
his
beardless
lips
*punct* ;
and
mercedes
said
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
in
pain
and
sorrow
at
the
oath
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
was
a
clannish
creature
*punct* ,
and
rushed
at
once
to
the
defence
of
her
brother
*punct* .
*break*
never
mind
that
man
*punct* ,
she
said
pointedly
*punct* .
*break*
you're
driving
our
dogs
*punct* ,
and
you
do
what
you
think
best
with
them
*punct* .
*break*
again
hal's
whip
fell
upon
the
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
they
threw
themselves
against
the
breast-bands
*punct* ,
dug
their
feet
into
the
packed
snow
*punct* ,
got
down
low
to
it
*punct* ,
and
put
forth
all
their
strength
*punct* .
*break*
the
sled
held
as
though
it
were
an
anchor
*punct* .
*break*
after
two
efforts
*punct* ,
they
stood
still
*punct* ,
panting
*punct* .
*break*
the
whip
was
whistling
savagely
*punct* ,
when
once
more
mercedes
interfered
*punct* .
*break*
she
dropped
on
her
knees
before
buck
*punct* ,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
*punct* ,
and
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
*punct* .
*break*
you
poor
*punct* ,
poor
dears
*punct* ,
she
cried
sympathetically
*punct* ,
why
don't
you
pull
hard?
*punct* ,
then
you
wouldn't
be
whipped
*punct* .
*break*
buck
did
not
like
her
*punct* ,
but
he
was
feeling
too
miserable
to
resist
her
*punct* ,
taking
it
as
part
of
the
day's
miserable
work
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
the
onlookers
*punct* ,
who
had
been
clenching
his
teeth
to
suppress
hot
speech
*punct* ,
now
spoke
up:
*punct* ,
it's
not
that
i
care
a
whoop
what
becomes
of
you
*punct* ,
but
for
the
dogs
sakes
i
just
want
to
tell
you
*punct* ,
you
can
help
them
a
mighty
lot
by
breaking
out
that
sled
*punct* .
*break*
the
runners
are
froze
fast
*punct* .
*break*
throw
your
weight
against
the
gee-pole
*punct* ,
right
and
left
*punct* ,
and
break
it
out
*punct* .
*break*
a
third
time
the
attempt
was
made
*punct* ,
but
this
time
*punct* ,
following
the
advice
*punct* ,
hal
broke
out
the
runners
which
had
been
frozen
to
the
snow
*punct* .
*break*
the
overloaded
and
unwieldy
sled
forged
ahead
*punct* ,
buck
and
his
mates
struggling
frantically
under
the
rain
of
blows
*punct* .
*break*
a
hundred
yards
ahead
the
path
turned
and
sloped
steeply
into
the
main
street
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
have
required
an
experienced
man
to
keep
the
top-heavy
sled
upright
*punct* ,
and
hal
was
not
such
a
man
*punct* .
*break*
as
they
swung
on
the
turn
the
sled
went
over
*punct* ,
spilling
half
its
load
through
the
loose
lashings
*punct* .
*break*
the
dogs
never
stopped
*punct* .
*break*
the
lightened
sled
bounded
on
its
side
behind
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
angry
because
of
the
ill
treatment
they
had
received
and
the
unjust
load
*punct* .
*break*
buck
was
raging
*punct* .
*break*
he
broke
into
a
run
*punct* ,
the
team
following
his
lead
*punct* .
*break*
hal
cried
whoa
*punct* !
*break*
but
they
gave
no
heed
*punct* .
*break*
he
tripped
and
was
pulled
off
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
the
capsized
sled
ground
over
him
*punct* ,
and
the
dogs
dashed
on
up
the
street
*punct* ,
adding
to
the
gayety
of
skaguay
as
they
scattered
the
remainder
of
the
outfit
along
its
chief
thoroughfare
*punct* .
*break*
kind-hearted
citizens
caught
the
dogs
and
gathered
up
the
scattered
belongings
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
they
gave
advice
*punct* .
*break*
half
the
load
and
twice
the
dogs
*punct* ,
if
they
ever
expected
to
reach
dawson
*punct* ,
was
what
was
said
*punct* .
*break*
hal
and
his
sister
and
brother-in-law
listened
unwillingly
*punct* ,
pitched
tent
*punct* ,
and
overhauled
the
outfit
*punct* .
*break*
canned
goods
were
turned
out
that
made
men
laugh
*punct* ,
for
canned
goods
on
the
long
trail
is
a
thing
to
dream
about
*punct* .
*break*
blankets
for
a
hotel
quoth
one
of
the
men
who
laughed
and
helped
*punct* .
*break*
half
as
many
is
too
much
*punct* ;
get
rid
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
throw
away
that
tent
*punct* ,
and
all
those
dishes,
*punct* ,
who's
going
to
wash
them
*punct* ,
anyway
*punct* ?
*break*
good
lord
*punct* ,
do
you
think
you're
travelling
on
a
pullman
*punct* ?
*break*
and
so
it
went
*punct* ,
the
inexorable
elimination
of
the
superfluous
*punct* .
*break*
mercedes
cried
when
her
clothes-bags
were
dumped
on
the
ground
and
article
after
article
was
thrown
out
*punct* .
*break*
she
cried
in
general
*punct* ,
and
she
cried
in
particular
over
each
discarded
thing
*punct* .
*break*
she
clasped
hands
about
knees
*punct* ,
rocking
back
and
forth
broken-heartedly
*punct* .
*break*
she
averred
she
would
not
go
an
inch
*punct* ,
not
for
a
dozen
charleses
*punct* .
*break*
she
appealed
to
everybody
and
to
everything
*punct* ,
finally
wiping
her
eyes
and
proceeding
to
cast
out
even
articles
of
apparel
that
were
imperative
necessaries
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
her
zeal
*punct* ,
when
she
had
finished
with
her
own
*punct* ,
she
attacked
the
belongings
of
her
men
and
went
through
them
like
a
tornado
*punct* .
*break*
this
accomplished
*punct* ,
the
outfit
*punct* ,
though
cut
in
half
*punct* ,
was
still
a
formidable
bulk
*punct* .
*break*
charles
and
hal
went
out
in
the
evening
and
bought
six
outside
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
these
*punct* ,
added
to
the
six
of
the
original
team
*punct* ,
and
teek
and
koona
*punct* ,
the
huskies
obtained
at
the
rink
rapids
on
the
record
trip
*punct* ,
brought
the
team
up
to
fourteen
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
outside
dogs
*punct* ,
though
practically
broken
in
since
their
landing
*punct* ,
did
not
amount
to
much
*punct* .
*break*
three
were
short-haired
pointers
*punct* ,
one
was
a
newfoundland
*punct* ,
and
the
other
two
were
mongrels
of
indeterminate
breed
*punct* .
*break*
they
did
not
seem
to
know
anything
*punct* ,
these
newcomers
*punct* .
*break*
buck
and
his
comrades
looked
upon
them
with
disgust
*punct* ,
and
though
he
speedily
taught
them
their
places
and
what
not
to
do
*punct* ,
he
could
not
teach
them
what
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
they
did
not
take
kindly
to
trace
and
trail
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
exception
of
the
two
mongrels
*punct* ,
they
were
bewildered
and
spirit-broken
by
the
strange
savage
environment
in
which
they
found
themselves
and
by
the
ill
treatment
they
had
received
*punct* .
*break*
the
two
mongrels
were
without
spirit
at
all
*punct* ;
bones
were
the
only
things
breakable
about
them
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
newcomers
hopeless
and
forlorn
*punct* ,
and
the
old
team
worn
out
by
twenty-five
hundred
miles
of
continuous
trail
*punct* ,
the
outlook
was
anything
but
bright
*punct* .
*break*
the
two
men
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
were
quite
cheerful
*punct* .
*break*
and
they
were
proud
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
doing
the
thing
in
style
*punct* ,
with
fourteen
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
seen
other
sleds
depart
over
the
pass
for
dawson
*punct* ,
or
come
in
from
dawson
*punct* ,
but
never
had
they
seen
a
sled
with
so
many
as
fourteen
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
nature
of
arctic
travel
there
was
a
reason
why
fourteen
dogs
should
not
drag
one
sled
*punct* ,
and
that
was
that
one
sled
could
not
carry
the
food
for
fourteen
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
but
charles
and
hal
did
not
know
this
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
worked
the
trip
out
with
a
pencil
*punct* ,
so
much
to
a
dog
*punct* ,
so
many
dogs
*punct* ,
so
many
days
*punct* ,
q.e.d
*punct* .
*break*
mercedes
looked
over
their
shoulders
and
nodded
comprehensively
*punct* ,
it
was
all
so
very
simple
*punct* .
*break*
late
next
morning
buck
led
the
long
team
up
the
street
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
nothing
lively
about
it
*punct* ,
no
snap
or
go
in
him
and
his
fellows
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
starting
dead
weary
*punct* .
*break*
four
times
he
had
covered
the
distance
between
salt
water
and
dawson
*punct* ,
and
the
knowledge
that
*punct* ,
jaded
and
tired
*punct* ,
he
was
facing
the
same
trail
once
more
*punct* ,
made
him
bitter
*punct* .
*break*
his
heart
was
not
in
the
work
*punct* ,
nor
was
the
heart
of
any
dog
*punct* .
*break*
the
outsides
were
timid
and
frightened
*punct* ,
the
insides
without
confidence
in
their
masters
*punct* .
*break*
buck
felt
vaguely
that
there
was
no
depending
upon
these
two
men
and
the
woman
*punct* .
*break*
they
did
not
know
how
to
do
anything
*punct* ,
and
as
the
days
went
by
it
became
apparent
that
they
could
not
learn
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
slack
in
all
things
*punct* ,
without
order
or
discipline
*punct* .
*break*
it
took
them
half
the
night
to
pitch
a
slovenly
camp
*punct* ,
and
half
the
morning
to
break
that
camp
and
get
the
sled
loaded
in
fashion
so
slovenly
that
for
the
rest
of
the
day
they
were
occupied
in
stopping
and
rearranging
the
load
*punct* .
*break*
some
days
they
did
not
make
ten
miles
*punct* .
*break*
on
other
days
they
were
unable
to
get
started
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
and
on
no
day
did
they
succeed
in
making
more
than
half
the
distance
used
by
the
men
as
a
basis
in
their
dog-food
computation
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
inevitable
that
they
should
go
short
on
dog-food
*punct* .
*break*
but
they
hastened
it
by
overfeeding
*punct* ,
bringing
the
day
nearer
when
underfeeding
would
commence
*punct* .
*break*
the
outside
dogs
*punct* ,
whose
digestions
had
not
been
trained
by
chronic
famine
to
make
the
most
of
little
*punct* ,
had
voracious
appetites
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
*punct* ,
in
addition
to
this
*punct* ,
the
worn
*punct* -
out
huskies
pulled
weakly
*punct* ,
hal
decided
that
the
orthodox
ration
was
too
small
*punct* .
*break*
he
doubled
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
to
cap
it
all
*punct* ,
when
mercedes
*punct* ,
with
tears
in
her
pretty
eyes
and
a
quaver
in
her
throat
*punct* ,
could
not
cajole
him
into
giving
the
dogs
still
more
*punct* ,
she
stole
from
the
fish-sacks
and
fed
them
slyly
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
was
not
food
that
buck
and
the
huskies
needed
*punct* ,
but
rest
*punct* .
*break*
and
though
they
were
making
poor
time
*punct* ,
the
heavy
load
they
dragged
sapped
their
strength
severely
*punct* .
*break*
then
came
the
underfeeding
*punct* .
*break*
hal
awoke
one
day
to
the
fact
that
his
dog-food
was
half
gone
and
the
distance
only
quarter
covered
*punct* ;
further
*punct* ,
that
for
love
or
money
no
additional
dog-food
was
to
be
obtained
*punct* .
*break*
so
he
cut
down
even
the
orthodox
ration
and
tried
to
increase
the
day's
travel
*punct* .
*break*
his
sister
and
brother-in-law
seconded
him
*punct* ;
but
they
were
frustrated
by
their
heavy
outfit
and
their
own
incompetence
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
give
the
dogs
less
food
*punct* ;
but
it
was
impossible
to
make
the
dogs
travel
faster
*punct* ,
while
their
own
inability
to
get
under
way
earlier
in
the
morning
prevented
them
from
travelling
longer
hours
*punct* .
*break*
not
only
did
they
not
know
how
to
work
dogs
*punct* ,
but
they
did
not
know
how
to
work
themselves
*punct* .
*break*
the
first
to
go
was
dub
*punct* .
*break*
poor
blundering
thief
that
he
was
*punct* ,
always
getting
caught
and
punished
*punct* ,
he
had
none
the
less
been
a
faithful
worker
*punct* .
*break*
his
wrenched
shoulder-blade
*punct* ,
untreated
and
unrested
*punct* ,
went
from
bad
to
worse
*punct* ,
till
finally
hal
shot
him
with
the
big
colt's
revolver
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
saying
of
the
country
that
an
outside
dog
starves
to
death
on
the
ration
of
the
husky
*punct* ,
so
the
six
outside
dogs
under
buck
could
do
no
less
than
die
on
half
the
ration
of
the
husky
*punct* .
*break*
the
newfoundland
went
first
*punct* ,
followed
by
the
three
short-haired
pointers
*punct* ,
the
two
mongrels
hanging
more
grittily
on
to
life
*punct* ,
but
going
in
the
end
*punct* .
*break*
by
this
time
all
the
amenities
and
gentlenesses
of
the
southland
had
fallen
away
from
the
three
people
*punct* .
*break*
shorn
of
its
glamour
and
romance
*punct* ,
arctic
travel
became
to
them
a
reality
too
harsh
for
their
manhood
and
womanhood
*punct* .
*break*
mercedes
ceased
weeping
over
the
dogs
*punct* ,
being
too
occupied
with
weeping
over
herself
and
with
quarrelling
with
her
husband
and
brother
*punct* .
*break*
to
quarrel
was
the
one
thing
they
were
never
too
weary
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
their
irritability
arose
out
of
their
misery
*punct* ,
increased
with
it
*punct* ,
doubled
upon
it
*punct* ,
outdistanced
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
wonderful
patience
of
the
trail
which
comes
to
men
who
toil
hard
and
suffer
sore
*punct* ,
and
remain
sweet
of
speech
and
kindly
*punct* ,
did
not
come
to
these
two
men
and
the
woman
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
no
inkling
of
such
a
patience
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
stiff
and
in
pain
*punct* ;
their
muscles
ached
*punct* ,
their
bones
ached
*punct* ,
their
very
hearts
ached
*punct* ;
and
because
of
this
they
became
sharp
of
speech
*punct* ,
and
hard
words
were
first
on
their
lips
in
the
morning
and
last
at
night
*punct* .
*break*
charles
and
hal
wrangled
whenever
mercedes
gave
them
a
chance
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
cherished
belief
of
each
that
he
did
more
than
his
share
of
the
work
*punct* ,
and
neither
forbore
to
speak
this
belief
at
every
opportunity
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
mercedes
sided
with
her
husband
*punct* ,
sometimes
with
her
brother
*punct* .
*break*
the
result
was
a
beautiful
and
unending
family
quarrel
*punct* .
*break*
starting
from
a
dispute
as
to
which
should
chop
a
few
sticks
for
the
fire
*punct* ,
a
dispute
which
concerned
only
charles
and
hal
*punct* ,
presently
would
be
lugged
in
the
rest
of
the
family
*punct* ,
fathers
*punct* ,
mothers
*punct* ,
uncles
*punct* ,
cousins
*punct* ,
people
thousands
of
miles
away
*punct* ,
and
some
of
them
dead
*punct* .
*break*
that
hal's
views
on
art
*punct* ,
or
the
sort
of
society
plays
his
mother's
brother
wrote
*punct* ,
should
have
anything
to
do
with
the
chopping
of
a
few
sticks
of
firewood
*punct* ,
passes
comprehension
*punct* ;
nevertheless
the
quarrel
was
as
likely
to
tend
in
that
direction
as
in
the
direction
of
charles's
political
prejudices
*punct* .
*break*
and
that
charles's
sister's
tale-bearing
tongue
should
be
relevant
to
the
building
of
a
yukon
fire
*punct* ,
was
apparent
only
to
mercedes
*punct* ,
who
disburdened
herself
of
copious
opinions
upon
that
topic
*punct* ,
and
incidentally
upon
a
few
other
traits
unpleasantly
peculiar
to
her
husband's
family
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
meantime
the
fire
remained
unbuilt
*punct* ,
the
camp
half
pitched
*punct* ,
and
the
dogs
unfed
*punct* .
*break*
mercedes
nursed
a
special
grievance
*punct* ,
the
grievance
of
sex
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
pretty
and
soft
*punct* ,
and
had
been
chivalrously
treated
all
her
days
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
present
treatment
by
her
husband
and
brother
was
everything
save
chivalrous
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
her
custom
to
be
helpless
*punct* .
*break*
upon
which
impeachment
of
what
to
her
was
her
most
essential
sex-prerogative
*punct* ,
she
made
their
lives
unendurable
*punct* .
*break*
she
no
longer
considered
the
dogs
*punct* ,
and
because
she
was
sore
and
tired
*punct* ,
she
persisted
in
riding
on
the
sled
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
pretty
and
soft
*punct* ,
but
she
weighed
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
*punct* ,
a
lusty
last
straw
to
the
load
dragged
by
the
weak
and
starving
animals
*punct* .
*break*
she
rode
for
days
*punct* ,
till
they
fell
in
the
traces
and
the
sled
stood
still
*punct* .
*break*
charles
and
hal
begged
her
to
get
off
and
walk
*punct* ,
pleaded
with
her
*punct* ,
entreated
*punct* ,
the
while
she
wept
and
importuned
heaven
with
a
recital
of
their
brutality
*punct* .
*break*
on
one
occasion
they
took
her
off
the
sled
by
main
strength
*punct* .
*break*
they
never
did
it
again
*punct* .
*break*
she
let
her
legs
go
limp
like
a
spoiled
child
*punct* ,
and
sat
down
on
the
trail
*punct* .
*break*
they
went
on
their
way
*punct* ,
but
she
did
not
move
*punct* .
*break*
after
they
had
travelled
three
miles
they
unloaded
the
sled
*punct* ,
came
back
for
her
*punct* ,
and
by
main
strength
put
her
on
the
sled
again
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
excess
of
their
own
misery
they
were
callous
to
the
suffering
of
their
animals
*punct* .
*break*
hal's
theory
*punct* ,
which
he
practised
on
others
*punct* ,
was
that
one
must
get
hardened
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
started
out
preaching
it
to
his
sister
and
brother-in-law
*punct* .
*break*
failing
there
*punct* ,
he
hammered
it
into
the
dogs
with
a
club
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
five
fingers
the
dog-food
gave
out
*punct* ,
and
a
toothless
old
squaw
offered
to
trade
them
a
few
pounds
of
frozen
horse-hide
for
the
colt's
revolver
that
kept
the
big
hunting-knife
company
at
hal's
hip
*punct* .
*break*
a
poor
substitute
for
food
was
this
hide
*punct* ,
just
as
it
had
been
stripped
from
the
starved
horses
of
the
cattlemen
six
months
back
*punct* .
*break*
in
its
frozen
state
it
was
more
like
strips
of
galvanized
iron
*punct* ,
and
when
a
dog
wrestled
it
into
his
stomach
it
thawed
into
thin
and
innutritious
leathery
strings
and
into
a
mass
of
short
hair
*punct* ,
irritating
and
indigestible
*punct* .
*break*
and
through
it
all
buck
staggered
along
at
the
head
of
the
team
as
in
a
nightmare
*punct* .
*break*
he
pulled
when
he
could
*punct* ;
when
he
could
no
longer
pull
*punct* ,
he
fell
down
and
remained
down
till
blows
from
whip
or
club
drove
him
to
his
feet
again
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
stiffness
and
gloss
had
gone
out
of
his
beautiful
furry
coat
*punct* .
*break*
the
hair
hung
down
*punct* ,
limp
and
draggled
*punct* ,
or
matted
with
dried
blood
where
hal's
club
had
bruised
him
*punct* .
*break*
his
muscles
had
wasted
away
to
knotty
strings
*punct* ,
and
the
flesh
pads
had
disappeared
*punct* ,
so
that
each
rib
and
every
bone
in
his
frame
were
outlined
cleanly
through
the
loose
hide
that
was
wrinkled
in
folds
of
emptiness
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
heartbreaking
*punct* ,
only
buck's
heart
was
unbreakable
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
in
the
red
sweater
had
proved
that
*punct* .
*break*
as
it
was
with
buck
*punct* ,
so
was
it
with
his
mates
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
perambulating
skeletons
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
seven
all
together
*punct* ,
including
him
*punct* .
*break*
in
their
very
great
misery
they
had
become
insensible
to
the
bite
of
the
lash
or
the
bruise
of
the
club
*punct* .
*break*
the
pain
of
the
beating
was
dull
and
distant
*punct* ,
just
as
the
things
their
eyes
saw
and
their
ears
heard
seemed
dull
and
distant
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
not
half
living
*punct* ,
or
quarter
living
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
simply
so
many
bags
of
bones
in
which
sparks
of
life
fluttered
faintly
*punct* .
*break*
when
a
halt
was
made
*punct* ,
they
dropped
down
in
the
traces
like
dead
dogs
*punct* ,
and
the
spark
dimmed
and
paled
and
seemed
to
go
out
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
the
club
or
whip
fell
upon
them
*punct* ,
the
spark
fluttered
feebly
up
*punct* ,
and
they
tottered
to
their
feet
and
staggered
on
*punct* .
*break*
there
came
a
day
when
billee
*punct* ,
the
good-natured
*punct* ,
fell
and
could
not
rise
*punct* .
*break*
hal
had
traded
off
his
revolver
*punct* ,
so
he
took
the
axe
and
knocked
billee
on
the
head
as
he
lay
in
the
traces
*punct* ,
then
cut
the
carcass
out
of
the
harness
and
dragged
it
to
one
side
*punct* .
*break*
buck
saw
*punct* ,
and
his
mates
saw
*punct* ,
and
they
knew
that
this
thing
was
very
close
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
next
day
koona
went
*punct* ,
and
but
five
of
them
remained
*punct* :
joe
*punct* ,
too
far
gone
to
be
malignant
*punct* ;
pike
*punct* ,
crippled
and
limping
*punct* ,
only
half
conscious
and
not
conscious
enough
longer
to
malinger
*punct* ;
sol-leks
*punct* ,
the
one-eyed
*punct* ,
still
faithful
to
the
toil
of
trace
and
trail
*punct* ,
and
mournful
in
that
he
had
so
little
strength
with
which
to
pull
*punct* ;
teek
*punct* ,
who
had
not
travelled
so
far
that
winter
and
who
was
now
beaten
more
than
the
others
because
he
was
fresher
*punct* ;
and
buck
*punct* ,
still
at
the
head
of
the
team
*punct* ,
but
no
longer
enforcing
discipline
or
striving
to
enforce
it
*punct* ,
blind
with
weakness
half
the
time
and
keeping
the
trail
by
the
loom
of
it
and
by
the
dim
feel
of
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
beautiful
spring
weather
*punct* ,
but
neither
dogs
nor
humans
were
aware
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
each
day
the
sun
rose
earlier
and
set
later
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
dawn
by
three
in
the
morning
*punct* ,
and
twilight
lingered
till
nine
at
night
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
long
day
was
a
blaze
of
sunshine
*punct* .
*break*
the
ghostly
winter
silence
had
given
way
to
the
great
spring
murmur
of
awakening
life
*punct* .
*break*
this
murmur
arose
from
all
the
land
*punct* ,
fraught
with
the
joy
of
living
*punct* .
*break*
it
came
from
the
things
that
lived
and
moved
again
*punct* ,
things
which
had
been
as
dead
and
which
had
not
moved
during
the
long
months
of
frost
*punct* .
*break*
the
sap
was
rising
in
the
pines
*punct* .
*break*
the
willows
and
aspens
were
bursting
out
in
young
buds
*punct* .
*break*
shrubs
and
vines
were
putting
on
fresh
garbs
of
green
*punct* .
*break*
crickets
sang
in
the
nights
*punct* ,
and
in
the
days
all
manner
of
creeping
*punct* ,
crawling
things
rustled
forth
into
the
sun
*punct* .
*break*
partridges
and
woodpeckers
were
booming
and
knocking
in
the
forest
*punct* .
*break*
squirrels
were
chattering
*punct* ,
birds
singing
*punct* ,
and
overhead
honked
the
wild-fowl
driving
up
from
the
south
in
cunning
wedges
that
split
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
from
every
hill
slope
came
the
trickle
of
running
water
*punct* ,
the
music
of
unseen
fountains
*punct* .
*break*
au
things
were
thawing
*punct* ,
bending
*punct* ,
snapping
*punct* .
*break*
the
yukon
was
straining
to
break
loose
the
ice
that
bound
it
down
*punct* .
*break*
it
ate
away
from
beneath
*punct* ;
the
sun
ate
from
above
*punct* .
*break*
air-holes
formed
*punct* ,
fissures
sprang
and
spread
apart
*punct* ,
while
thin
sections
of
ice
fell
through
bodily
into
the
river
*punct* .
*break*
and
amid
all
this
bursting
*punct* ,
rending
*punct* ,
throbbing
of
awakening
life
*punct* ,
under
the
blazing
sun
and
through
the
soft-sighing
breezes
*punct* ,
like
wayfarers
to
death
*punct* ,
staggered
the
two
men
*punct* ,
the
woman
*punct* ,
and
the
huskies
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
dogs
falling
*punct* ,
mercedes
weeping
and
riding
*punct* ,
hal
swearing
innocuously
*punct* ,
and
charles's
eyes
wistfully
watering
*punct* ,
they
staggered
into
john
thornton's
camp
at
the
mouth
of
white
river
*punct* .
*break*
when
they
halted
*punct* ,
the
dogs
dropped
down
as
though
they
had
all
been
struck
dead
*punct* .
*break*
mercedes
dried
her
eyes
and
looked
at
john
thornton
*punct* .
*break*
charles
sat
down
on
a
log
to
rest
*punct* .
*break*
he
sat
down
very
slowly
and
painstakingly
what
of
his
great
stiffness
*punct* .
*break*
hal
did
the
talking
*punct* .
*break*
john
thornton
was
whittling
the
last
touches
on
an
axe-handle
he
had
made
from
a
stick
of
birch
*punct* .
*break*
he
whittled
and
listened
*punct* ,
gave
monosyllabic
replies
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
when
it
was
asked
*punct* ,
terse
advice
*punct* .
*break*
he
knew
the
breed
*punct* ,
and
he
gave
his
advice
in
the
certainty
that
it
would
not
be
followed
*punct* .
*break*
they
told
us
up
above
that
the
bottom
was
dropping
out
of
the
trail
and
that
the
best
thing
for
us
to
do
was
to
lay
over
*punct* ,
hal
said
in
response
to
thornton's
warning
to
take
no
more
chances
on
the
rotten
ice
*punct* .
*break*
they
told
us
we
couldn't
make
white
river
*punct* ,
and
here
we
are
*punct* .
*break*
this
last
with
a
sneering
ring
of
triumph
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
they
told
you
true
*punct* ,
john
thornton
answered
*punct* .
*break*
the
bottom's
likely
to
drop
out
at
any
moment
*punct* .
*break*
only
fools
*punct* ,
with
the
blind
luck
of
fools
*punct* ,
could
have
made
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
tell
you
straight
*punct* ,
i
wouldn't
risk
my
carcass
on
that
ice
for
all
the
gold
in
alaska
*punct* .
*break*
that's
because
you're
not
a
fool
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
said
hal
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
same
*punct* ,
we'll
go
on
to
dawson
*punct* .
*break*
he
uncoiled
his
whip
*punct* .
*break*
get
up
there
*punct* ,
buck
*punct* !
*break*
get
up
there
*punct* !
*break*
thornton
went
on
whittling
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
idle
*punct* ,
he
knew
*punct* ,
to
get
between
a
fool
and
his
folly
*punct* ;
while
two
or
three
fools
more
or
less
would
not
alter
the
scheme
of
things
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
team
did
not
get
up
at
the
command
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
long
since
passed
into
the
stage
where
blows
were
required
to
rouse
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
whip
flashed
out
*punct* ,
here
and
there
*punct* ,
on
its
merciless
errands
*punct* .
*break*
john
thornton
compressed
his
lips
*punct* .
*break*
sol-leks
was
the
first
to
crawl
to
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
joe
came
next
*punct* ,
yelping
with
pain
*punct* .
*break*
pike
made
painful
efforts
*punct* .
*break*
twice
he
fell
over
*punct* ,
when
half
up
*punct* ,
and
on
the
third
attempt
managed
to
rise
*punct* .
*break*
buck
made
no
effort
*punct* .
*break*
he
lay
quietly
where
he
had
fallen
*punct* .
*break*
the
lash
bit
into
him
again
and
again
*punct* ,
but
he
neither
whined
nor
struggled
*punct* .
*break*
several
times
thornton
started
*punct* ,
as
though
to
speak
*punct* ,
but
changed
his
mind
*punct* .
*break*
a
moist
ure
came
into
his
eyes
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
the
whipping
continued
*punct* ,
he
arose
and
walked
irresolutely
up
and
down
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
the
first
time
buck
had
failed
*punct* ,
in
itself
a
sufficient
reason
to
drive
hal
into
a
rage
*punct* .
*break*
he
exchanged
the
whip
for
the
customary
club
*punct* .
*break*
buck
refused
to
move
under
the
rain
of
heavier
blows
which
now
fell
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
like
his
mates
*punct* ,
he
barely
able
to
get
up
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
unlike
them
*punct* ,
he
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
get
up
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
vague
feeling
of
impending
doom
*punct* .
*break*
this
had
been
strong
upon
him
when
he
pulled
in
to
the
bank
*punct* ,
and
it
had
not
departed
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
what
of
the
thin
and
rotten
ice
he
had
felt
under
his
feet
all
day
*punct* ,
it
seemed
that
he
sensed
disaster
close
at
hand
*punct* ,
out
there
ahead
on
the
ice
where
his
master
was
trying
to
drive
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
refused
to
stir
*punct* .
*break*
so
greatly
had
he
suffered
*punct* ,
and
so
far
gone
was
he
*punct* ,
that
the
blows
did
not
hurt
much
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
they
continued
to
fall
upon
him
*punct* ,
the
spark
of
life
within
flickered
and
went
down
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
nearly
out
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
strangely
numb
*punct* .
*break*
as
though
from
a
great
distance
*punct* ,
he
was
aware
that
he
was
being
beaten
*punct* .
*break*
the
last
sensations
of
pain
left
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
no
longer
felt
anything
*punct* ,
though
very
faintly
he
could
hear
the
impact
of
the
club
upon
his
body
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
was
no
longer
his
body
*punct* ,
it
seemed
so
far
away
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
*punct* ,
suddenly
*punct* ,
without
warning
*punct* ,
uttering
a
cry
that
was
inarticulate
and
more
like
the
cry
of
an
animal
*punct* ,
john
thornton
sprang
upon
the
man
who
wielded
the
club
*punct* .
*break*
hal
was
hurled
backward
*punct* ,
as
though
struck
by
a
failing
tree
*punct* .
*break*
charles
looked
on
wistfully
*punct* ,
wiped
his
watery
eyes
*punct* ,
but
did
not
get
up
because
of
his
stiffness
*punct* .
*break*
john
thornton
stood
over
buck
*punct* ,
struggling
to
control
himself
*punct* ,
too
convulsed
with
rage
to
speak
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
strike
that
dog
again
*punct* ,
i'll
kill
you
*punct* ,
he
at
last
managed
to
say
in
a
choking
voice
*punct* .
*break*
it's
my
dog
*punct* ,
hal
replied
*punct* ,
wiping
the
blood
from
his
mouth
as
he
came
back
*punct* .
*break*
get
out
of
my
way
*punct* ,
or
i'll
fix
you
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
going
to
dawson
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
stood
between
him
and
buck
*punct* ,
and
evinced
no
intention
of
getting
out
of
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
hal
drew
his
long
hunting-knife
*punct* .
*break*
cried
*punct* ,
laughed
*punct* ,
and
manifested
the
chaotic
abandonment
of
hysteria
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
rapped
hal's
knuckles
with
the
axe-handle
*punct* ,
knocking
the
knife
to
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
he
rapped
his
knuckles
again
as
he
tried
to
pick
it
up
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
stooped
*punct* ,
picked
it
up
himself
*punct* ,
and
with
two
strokes
cut
buck's
traces
*punct* .
*break*
hal
had
no
fight
left
in
him
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
his
hands
were
full
with
his
sister
*punct* ,
or
his
arms
*punct* ,
rather
*punct* ;
while
buck
was
too
near
dead
to
be
of
further
use
in
hauling
the
sled
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
minutes
later
they
pulled
out
from
the
bank
and
down
the
river
*punct* .
*break*
buck
heard
them
go
and
raised
his
head
to
see
*punct* ,
pike
was
leading
*punct* ,
sol-leks
was
at
the
wheel
*punct* ,
and
between
were
joe
and
teek
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
limping
and
staggering
*punct* .
*break*
mercedes
was
riding
the
loaded
sled
*punct* .
*break*
hal
guided
at
the
gee-pole
*punct* ,
and
charles
stumbled
along
in
the
rear
*punct* .
*break*
as
buck
watched
them
*punct* ,
thornton
knelt
beside
him
and
with
rough
*punct* ,
kindly
hands
searched
for
broken
bones
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
time
his
search
had
disclosed
nothing
more
than
many
bruises
and
a
state
of
terrible
starvation
*punct* ,
the
sled
was
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
*punct* .
*break*
dog
and
man
watched
it
crawling
along
over
the
ice
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
*punct* ,
they
saw
its
back
end
drop
down
*punct* ,
as
into
a
rut
*punct* ,
and
the
gee-pole
*punct* ,
with
hal
clinging
to
it
*punct* ,
jerk
into
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
mercedes's
scream
came
to
their
ears
*punct* .
*break*
they
saw
charles
turn
and
make
one
step
to
run
back
*punct* ,
and
then
a
whole
section
of
ice
give
way
and
dogs
and
humans
disappear
*punct* .
*break*
a
yawning
hole
was
all
that
was
to
be
seen
*punct* .
*break*
the
bottom
had
dropped
out
of
the
trail
*punct* .
*break*
john
thornton
and
buck
looked
at
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
you
poor
devil
*punct* ,
said
john
thornton
*punct* ,
and
buck
licked
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
chapter
vi
for
the
love
of
a
man
when
john
thornton
froze
his
feet
in
the
previous
december
his
partners
had
made
him
comfortable
and
left
him
to
get
well
*punct* ,
going
on
themselves
up
the
river
to
get
out
a
raft
of
saw-logs
for
dawson
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
still
limping
slightly
at
the
time
he
rescued
buck
*punct* ,
but
with
the
continued
warm
weather
even
the
slight
limp
left
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
here
*punct* ,
lying
by
the
river
bank
through
the
long
spring
days
*punct* ,
watching
the
running
water
*punct* ,
listening
lazily
to
the
songs
of
birds
and
the
hum
of
nature
*punct* ,
buck
slowly
won
back
his
strength
*punct* .
*break*
a
rest
comes
very
good
after
one
has
travelled
three
thousand
miles
*punct* ,
and
it
must
be
confessed
that
buck
waxed
lazy
as
his
wounds
healed
*punct* ,
his
muscles
swelled
out
*punct* ,
and
the
flesh
came
back
to
cover
his
bones
*punct* .
*break*
for
that
matter
*punct* ,
they
were
all
loafing,
*punct* ,
buck
*punct* ,
john
thornton
*punct* ,
and
skeet
and
nig,
*punct* ,
waiting
for
the
raft
to
come
that
was
to
carry
them
down
to
dawson
*punct* .
*break*
skeet
was
a
little
irish
setter
who
early
made
friends
with
buck
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
in
a
dying
condition
*punct* ,
was
unable
to
resent
her
first
advances
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
the
doctor
trait
which
some
dogs
possess
*punct* ;
and
as
a
mother
cat
washes
her
kittens
*punct* ,
so
she
washed
and
cleansed
buck's
wounds
*punct* .
*break*
regularly
*punct* ,
each
morning
after
he
had
finished
his
breakfast
*punct* ,
she
performed
her
self
*punct* -
appointed
task
*punct* ,
till
he
came
to
look
for
her
ministrations
as
much
as
he
did
for
thornton's
*punct* .
*break*
nig
*punct* ,
equally
friendly
*punct* ,
though
less
demonstrative
*punct* ,
was
a
huge
black
dog
*punct* ,
half
bloodhound
and
half
deerhound
*punct* ,
with
eyes
that
laughed
and
a
boundless
good
nature
*punct* .
*break*
to
buck's
surprise
these
dogs
manifested
no
jealousy
toward
him
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
to
share
the
kindliness
and
largeness
of
john
thornton
*punct* .
*break*
as
buck
grew
stronger
they
enticed
him
into
all
sorts
of
ridiculous
games
*punct* ,
in
which
thornton
himself
could
not
forbear
to
join
*punct* ;
and
in
this
fashion
buck
romped
through
his
convalescence
and
into
a
new
existence
*punct* .
*break*
love
*punct* ,
genuine
passionate
love
*punct* ,
was
his
for
the
first
time
*punct* .
*break*
this
he
had
never
experienced
at
judge
miller's
down
in
the
sun-kissed
santa
clara
valley
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
judge's
sons
*punct* ,
hunting
and
tramping
*punct* ,
it
had
been
a
working
partnership
*punct* ;
with
the
judge's
grandsons
*punct* ,
a
sort
of
pompous
guardianship
*punct* ;
and
with
the
judge
himself
*punct* ,
a
stately
and
dignified
friendship
*punct* .
*break*
but
love
that
was
feverish
and
burning
*punct* ,
that
was
adoration
*punct* ,
that
was
madness
*punct* ,
it
had
taken
john
thornton
to
arouse
*punct* .
*break*
this
man
had
saved
his
life
*punct* ,
which
was
something
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
further
*punct* ,
he
was
the
ideal
master
*punct* .
*break*
other
men
saw
to
the
welfare
of
their
dogs
from
a
sense
of
duty
and
business
expediency
*punct* ;
he
saw
to
the
welfare
of
his
as
if
they
were
his
own
children
*punct* ,
because
he
could
not
help
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
saw
further
*punct* .
*break*
he
never
forgot
a
kindly
greeting
or
a
cheering
word
*punct* ,
and
to
sit
down
for
a
long
talk
with
them
*punct* ,
gas
he
called
it
*punct* ,
was
as
much
his
delight
as
theirs
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
way
of
taking
buck's
head
roughly
between
his
hands
*punct* ,
and
resting
his
own
head
upon
buck's
*punct* ,
of
shaking
him
back
and
forth
*punct* ,
the
while
calling
him
ill
names
that
to
buck
were
love
names
*punct* .
*break*
buck
knew
no
greater
joy
than
that
rough
embrace
and
the
sound
of
murmured
oaths
*punct* ,
and
at
each
jerk
back
and
forth
it
seemed
that
his
heart
would
be
shaken
out
of
his
body
so
great
was
its
ecstasy
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
*punct* ,
released
*punct* ,
he
sprang
to
his
feet
*punct* ,
his
mouth
laughing
*punct* ,
his
eyes
eloquent
*punct* ,
his
throat
vibrant
with
unuttered
sound
*punct* ,
and
in
that
fashion
remained
without
movement
*punct* ,
john
thornton
would
reverently
exclaim
*punct* ,
god
*punct* !
*break*
you
can
all
but
speak
*punct* !
*break*
buck
had
a
trick
of
love
expression
that
was
akin
to
hurt
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
often
seize
thornton's
hand
in
his
mouth
and
close
so
fiercely
that
the
flesh
bore
the
impress
of
his
teeth
for
some
time
afterward
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
buck
understood
the
oaths
to
be
love
words
*punct* ,
so
the
man
understood
this
feigned
bite
for
a
caress
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
most
part
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
buck's
love
was
expressed
in
adoration
*punct* .
*break*
while
he
went
wild
with
happiness
when
thornton
touched
him
or
spoke
to
him
*punct* ,
he
did
not
seek
these
tokens
*punct* .
*break*
unlike
skeet
*punct* ,
who
was
wont
to
shove
her
nose
under
thornton's
hand
and
nudge
and
nudge
till
petted
*punct* ,
or
nig
*punct* ,
who
would
stalk
up
and
rest
his
great
head
on
thornton's
knee
*punct* ,
buck
was
content
to
adore
at
a
distance
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
lie
by
the
hour
*punct* ,
eager
*punct* ,
alert
*punct* ,
at
thornton's
feet
*punct* ,
looking
up
into
his
face
*punct* ,
dwelling
upon
it
*punct* ,
studying
it
*punct* ,
following
with
keenest
interest
each
fleeting
expression
*punct* ,
every
movement
or
change
of
feature
*punct* .
*break*
or
*punct* ,
as
chance
might
have
it
*punct* ,
he
would
lie
farther
away
*punct* ,
to
the
side
or
rear
*punct* ,
watching
the
outlines
of
the
man
and
the
occasional
movements
of
his
body
*punct* .
*break*
and
often
*punct* ,
such
was
the
communion
in
which
they
lived
*punct* ,
the
strength
of
buck's
gaze
would
draw
john
thornton's
head
around
*punct* ,
and
he
would
return
the
gaze
*punct* ,
without
speech
*punct* ,
his
heart
shining
out
of
his
eyes
as
buck's
heart
shone
out
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
long
time
after
his
rescue
*punct* ,
buck
did
not
like
thornton
to
get
out
of
his
sight
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
moment
he
left
the
tent
to
when
he
entered
it
again
*punct* ,
buck
would
follow
at
his
heels
*punct* .
*break*
his
transient
masters
since
he
had
come
into
the
northland
had
bred
in
him
a
fear
that
no
master
could
be
permanent
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
afraid
that
thornton
would
pass
out
of
his
life
as
perrault
and
francois
and
the
scotch
half-breed
had
passed
out
*punct* .
*break*
even
in
the
night
*punct* ,
in
his
dreams
*punct* ,
he
was
haunted
by
this
fear
*punct* .
*break*
at
such
times
he
would
shake
off
sleep
and
creep
through
the
chill
to
the
flap
of
the
tent
*punct* ,
where
he
would
stand
and
listen
to
the
sound
of
his
master's
breathing
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
spite
of
this
great
love
he
bore
john
thornton
*punct* ,
which
seemed
to
bespeak
the
soft
civilizing
influence
*punct* ,
the
strain
of
the
primitive
*punct* ,
which
the
northland
had
aroused
in
him
*punct* ,
remained
alive
and
active
*punct* .
*break*
faithfulness
and
devotion
*punct* ,
things
born
of
fire
and
roof
*punct* ,
were
his
*punct* ;
yet
he
retained
his
wildness
and
wiliness
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
thing
of
the
wild
*punct* ,
come
in
from
the
wild
to
sit
by
john
thornton's
fire
*punct* ,
rather
than
a
dog
of
the
soft
southland
stamped
with
the
marks
of
generations
of
civilization
*punct* .
*break*
because
of
his
very
great
love
*punct* ,
he
could
not
steal
from
this
man
*punct* ,
but
from
any
other
man
*punct* ,
in
any
other
camp
*punct* ,
he
did
not
hesitate
an
instant
*punct* ;
while
the
cunning
with
which
he
stole
enabled
him
to
escape
detection
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
and
body
were
scored
by
the
teeth
of
many
dogs
*punct* ,
and
he
fought
as
fiercely
as
ever
and
more
shrewdly
*punct* .
*break*
skeet
and
nig
were
too
good-natured
for
quarrelling,
*punct* ,
besides
*punct* ,
they
belonged
to
john
thornton
*punct* ;
but
the
strange
dog
*punct* ,
no
matter
what
the
breed
or
valor
*punct* ,
swiftly
acknowledged
buck's
supremacy
or
found
himself
struggling
for
life
with
a
terrible
antagonist
*punct* .
*break*
and
buck
was
merciless
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
learned
well
the
law
of
club
and
fang
*punct* ,
and
he
never
forewent
an
advantage
or
drew
back
from
a
foe
he
had
started
on
the
way
to
death
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
lessoned
from
spitz
*punct* ,
and
from
the
chief
fighting
dogs
of
the
police
and
mail
*punct* ,
and
knew
there
was
no
middle
course
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
master
or
be
mastered
*punct* ;
while
to
show
mercy
was
a
weakness
*punct* .
*break*
mercy
did
not
exist
in
the
primordial
life
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
misunderstood
for
fear
*punct* ,
and
such
misunderstandings
made
for
death
*punct* .
*break*
kill
or
be
killed
*punct* ,
eat
or
be
eaten
*punct* ,
was
the
law
*punct* ;
and
this
mandate
*punct* ,
down
out
of
the
depths
of
time
*punct* ,
he
obeyed
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
older
than
the
days
he
had
seen
and
the
breaths
he
had
drawn
*punct* .
*break*
he
linked
the
past
with
the
present
*punct* ,
and
the
eternity
behind
him
throbbed
through
him
in
a
mighty
rhythm
to
which
he
swayed
as
the
tides
and
seasons
swayed
*punct* .
*break*
he
sat
by
john
thornton's
fire
*punct* ,
a
broad-breasted
dog
*punct* ,
white-fanged
and
long-furred
*punct* ;
but
behind
him
were
the
shades
of
all
manner
of
dogs
*punct* ,
half-wolves
and
wild
wolves
*punct* ,
urgent
and
prompting
*punct* ,
tasting
the
savor
of
the
meat
he
ate
*punct* ,
thirsting
for
the
water
he
drank
*punct* ,
scenting
the
wind
with
him
*punct* ,
listening
with
him
and
telling
him
the
sounds
made
by
the
wild
life
in
the
forest
*punct* ,
dictating
his
moods
*punct* ,
directing
his
actions
*punct* ,
lying
down
to
sleep
with
him
when
he
lay
down
*punct* ,
and
dreaming
with
him
and
beyond
him
and
becoming
themselves
the
stuff
of
his
dreams
*punct* .
*break*
so
peremptorily
did
these
shades
beckon
him
*punct* ,
that
each
day
mankind
and
the
claims
of
mankind
slipped
farther
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
deep
in
the
forest
a
call
was
sounding
*punct* ,
and
as
often
as
he
heard
this
call
*punct* ,
mysteriously
thrilling
and
luring
*punct* ,
he
felt
compelled
to
turn
his
back
upon
the
fire
and
the
beaten
earth
around
it
*punct* ,
and
to
plunge
into
the
forest
*punct* ,
and
on
and
on
*punct* ,
he
knew
not
where
or
why
*punct* ;
nor
did
he
wonder
where
or
why
*punct* ,
the
call
sounding
imperiously
*punct* ,
deep
in
the
forest
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
often
as
he
gained
the
soft
unbroken
earth
and
the
green
shade
*punct* ,
the
love
for
john
thornton
drew
him
back
to
the
fire
again
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
alone
held
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
rest
of
mankind
was
as
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
chance
travellers
might
praise
or
pet
him
*punct* ;
but
he
was
cold
under
it
all
*punct* ,
and
from
a
too
demonstrative
man
he
would
get
up
and
walk
away
*punct* .
*break*
when
thornton's
partners
*punct* ,
hans
and
pete
*punct* ,
arrived
on
the
long-expected
raft
*punct* ,
buck
refused
to
notice
them
till
he
learned
they
were
close
to
thornton
*punct* ;
after
that
he
tolerated
them
in
a
passive
sort
of
way
*punct* ,
accepting
favors
from
them
as
though
he
favored
them
by
accepting
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
of
the
same
large
type
as
thornton
*punct* ,
living
close
to
the
earth
*punct* ,
thinking
simply
and
seeing
clearly
*punct* ;
and
ere
they
swung
the
raft
into
the
big
eddy
by
the
saw
*punct* -
mill
at
dawson
*punct* ,
they
understood
buck
and
his
ways
*punct* ,
and
did
not
insist
upon
an
intimacy
such
as
obtained
with
skeet
and
nig
*punct* .
*break*
for
thornton
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
his
love
seemed
to
grow
and
grow
*punct* .
*break*
he
*punct* ,
alone
among
men
*punct* ,
could
put
a
pack
upon
buck's
back
in
the
summer
travelling
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
was
too
great
for
buck
to
do
*punct* ,
when
thornton
commanded
*punct* .
*break*
one
day
*punct* ,
they
had
grub-staked
themselves
from
the
proceeds
of
the
raft
and
left
dawson
for
the
head-waters
of
the
tanana
*punct* ,
the
men
and
dogs
were
sitting
on
the
crest
of
a
cliff
which
fell
away
*punct* ,
straight
down
*punct* ,
to
naked
bed-rock
three
hundred
feet
below
*punct* .
*break*
john
thornton
was
sitting
near
the
edge
*punct* ,
buck
at
his
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
a
thoughtless
whim
seized
thornton
*punct* ,
and
he
drew
the
attention
of
hans
and
pete
to
the
experiment
he
had
in
mind
*punct* .
*break*
jump
*punct* ,
buck
*punct* !
*break*
he
commanded
*punct* ,
sweeping
his
arm
out
and
over
the
chasm
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
instant
he
was
grappling
with
buck
on
the
extreme
edge
*punct* ,
while
hans
and
pete
were
dragging
them
back
into
safety
*punct* .
*break*
it's
uncanny
*punct* ,
pete
said
*punct* ,
after
it
was
over
and
they
had
caught
their
speech
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
shook
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
it
is
splendid
*punct* ,
and
it
is
terrible
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
know
*punct* ,
it
sometimes
makes
me
afraid
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
not
hankering
to
be
the
man
that
lays
hands
on
you
while
he's
around
*punct* ,
pete
announced
conclusively
*punct* ,
nodding
his
head
toward
buck
*punct* .
*break*
was
hans's
contribution
*punct* .
*break*
not
mineself
either
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
at
circle
city
*punct* ,
ere
the
year
was
out
*punct* ,
that
pete's
apprehensions
were
realized
*punct* .
*break*
black
burton
*punct* ,
a
man
evil-tempered
and
malicious
*punct* ,
had
been
picking
a
quarrel
with
a
tenderfoot
at
the
bar
*punct* ,
when
thornton
stepped
good-naturedly
between
*punct* .
*break*
buck
*punct* ,
as
was
his
custom
*punct* ,
was
lying
in
a
corner
*punct* ,
head
on
paws
*punct* ,
watching
his
master's
every
action
*punct* .
*break*
burton
struck
out
*punct* ,
without
warning
*punct* ,
straight
from
the
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
was
sent
spinning
*punct* ,
and
saved
himself
from
falling
only
by
clutching
the
rail
of
the
bar
*punct* .
*break*
those
who
were
looking
on
heard
what
was
neither
bark
nor
yelp
*punct* ,
but
a
something
which
is
best
described
as
a
roar
*punct* ,
and
they
saw
buck's
body
rise
up
in
the
air
as
he
left
the
floor
for
burton's
throat
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
saved
his
life
by
instinctively
throwing
out
his
arm
*punct* ,
but
was
hurled
backward
to
the
floor
with
buck
on
top
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
buck
loosed
his
teeth
from
the
flesh
of
the
arm
and
drove
in
again
for
the
throat
*punct* .
*break*
this
time
the
man
succeeded
only
in
partly
blocking
*punct* ,
and
his
throat
was
torn
open
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
crowd
was
upon
buck
*punct* ,
and
he
was
driven
off
*punct* ;
but
while
a
surgeon
checked
the
bleeding
*punct* ,
he
prowled
up
and
down
*punct* ,
growling
furiously
*punct* ,
attempting
to
rush
in
*punct* ,
and
being
forced
back
by
an
array
of
hostile
clubs
*punct* .
*break*
a
miners
meeting
*punct* ,
called
on
the
spot
*punct* ,
decided
that
the
dog
had
sufficient
provocation
*punct* ,
and
buck
was
discharged
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
reputation
was
made
*punct* ,
and
from
that
day
his
name
spread
through
every
camp
in
alaska
*punct* .
*break*
later
on
*punct* ,
in
the
fall
of
the
year
*punct* ,
he
saved
john
thornton's
life
in
quite
another
fashion
*punct* .
*break*
the
three
partners
were
lining
a
long
and
narrow
poling-boat
down
a
bad
stretch
of
rapids
on
the
forty
*punct* -
mile
creek
*punct* .
*break*
hans
and
pete
moved
along
the
bank
*punct* ,
snubbing
with
a
thin
manila
rope
from
tree
to
tree
*punct* ,
while
thornton
remained
in
the
boat
*punct* ,
helping
its
descent
by
means
of
a
pole
*punct* ,
and
shouting
directions
to
the
shore
*punct* .
*break*
buck
*punct* ,
on
the
bank
*punct* ,
worried
and
anxious
*punct* ,
kept
abreast
of
the
boat
*punct* ,
his
eyes
never
off
his
master
*punct* .
*break*
at
a
particularly
bad
spot
*punct* ,
where
a
ledge
of
barely
submerged
rocks
jutted
out
into
the
river
*punct* ,
hans
cast
off
the
rope
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
while
thornton
poled
the
boat
out
into
the
stream
*punct* ,
ran
down
the
bank
with
the
end
in
his
hand
to
snub
the
boat
when
it
had
cleared
the
ledge
*punct* .
*break*
this
it
did
*punct* ,
and
was
flying
down-stream
in
a
current
as
swift
as
a
mill-race
*punct* ,
when
hans
checked
it
with
the
rope
and
checked
too
suddenly
*punct* .
*break*
the
boat
flirted
over
and
snubbed
in
to
the
bank
bottom
up
*punct* ,
while
thornton
*punct* ,
flung
sheer
out
of
it
*punct* ,
was
carried
down-stream
toward
the
worst
part
of
the
rapids
*punct* ,
a
stretch
of
wild
water
in
which
no
swimmer
could
live
*punct* .
*break*
buck
had
sprung
in
on
the
instant
*punct* ;
and
at
the
end
of
three
hundred
yards
*punct* ,
amid
a
mad
swirl
of
water
*punct* ,
he
overhauled
thornton
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
felt
him
grasp
his
tail
*punct* ,
buck
headed
for
the
bank
*punct* ,
swimming
with
all
his
splendid
strength
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
progress
shoreward
was
slow
*punct* ;
the
progress
down-stream
amazingly
rapid
*punct* .
*break*
from
below
came
the
fatal
roaring
where
the
wild
current
went
wilder
and
was
rent
in
shreds
and
spray
by
the
rocks
which
thrust
through
like
the
teeth
of
an
enormous
comb
*punct* .
*break*
the
suck
of
the
water
as
it
took
the
beginning
of
the
last
steep
pitch
was
frightful
*punct* ,
and
thornton
knew
that
the
shore
was
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
he
scraped
furiously
over
a
rock
*punct* ,
bruised
across
a
second
*punct* ,
and
struck
a
third
with
crushing
force
*punct* .
*break*
he
clutched
its
slippery
top
with
both
hands
*punct* ,
releasing
buck
*punct* ,
and
above
the
roar
of
the
churning
water
shouted
*punct* :
go
*punct* ,
buck
*punct* !
*break*
buck
could
not
hold
his
own
*punct* ,
and
swept
on
down-stream
*punct* ,
struggling
desperately
*punct* ,
but
unable
to
win
back
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
heard
thornton's
command
repeated
*punct* ,
he
partly
reared
out
of
the
water
*punct* ,
throwing
his
head
high
*punct* ,
as
though
for
a
last
look
*punct* ,
then
turned
obediently
toward
the
bank
*punct* .
*break*
he
swam
powerfully
and
was
dragged
ashore
by
pete
and
hans
at
the
very
point
where
swimming
ceased
to
be
possible
and
destruction
began
*punct* .
*break*
they
knew
that
the
time
a
man
could
cling
to
a
slippery
rock
in
the
face
of
that
driving
current
was
a
matter
of
minutes
*punct* ,
and
they
ran
as
fast
as
they
could
up
the
bank
to
a
point
far
above
where
thornton
was
hanging
on
*punct* .
*break*
they
attached
the
line
with
which
they
had
been
snubbing
the
boat
to
buck's
neck
and
shoulders
*punct* ,
being
careful
that
it
should
neither
strangle
him
nor
impede
his
swimming
*punct* ,
and
launched
him
into
the
stream
*punct* .
*break*
he
struck
out
boldly
*punct* ,
but
not
straight
enough
into
the
stream
*punct* .
*break*
he
discovered
the
mistake
too
late
*punct* ,
when
thornton
was
abreast
of
him
and
a
bare
half-dozen
strokes
away
while
he
was
being
carried
helplessly
past
*punct* .
*break*
hans
promptly
snubbed
with
the
rope
*punct* ,
as
though
buck
were
a
boat
*punct* .
*break*
the
rope
thus
tightening
on
him
in
the
sweep
of
the
current
*punct* ,
he
was
jerked
under
the
surface
*punct* ,
and
under
the
surface
he
remained
till
his
body
struck
against
the
bank
and
he
was
hauled
out
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
half
drowned
*punct* ,
and
hans
and
pete
threw
themselves
upon
him
*punct* ,
pounding
the
breath
into
him
and
the
water
out
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
staggered
to
his
feet
and
fell
down
*punct* .
*break*
the
faint
sound
of
thornton's
voice
came
to
them
*punct* ,
and
though
they
could
not
make
out
the
words
of
it
*punct* ,
they
knew
that
he
was
in
his
extremity
*punct* .
*break*
his
master's
voice
acted
on
buck
like
an
electric
shock
*punct* ,
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
ran
up
the
bank
ahead
of
the
men
to
the
point
of
his
previous
departure
*punct* .
*break*
again
the
rope
was
attached
and
he
was
launched
*punct* ,
and
again
he
struck
out
*punct* ,
but
this
time
straight
into
the
stream
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
miscalculated
once
*punct* ,
but
he
would
not
be
guilty
of
it
a
second
time
*punct* .
*break*
hans
paid
out
the
rope
*punct* ,
permitting
no
slack
*punct* ,
while
pete
kept
it
clear
of
coils
*punct* .
*break*
buck
held
on
till
he
was
on
a
line
straight
above
thornton
*punct* ;
then
he
turned
*punct* ,
and
with
the
speed
of
an
express
train
headed
down
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
saw
him
coming
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
buck
struck
him
like
a
battering
ram
*punct* ,
with
the
whole
force
of
the
current
behind
him
*punct* ,
he
reached
up
and
closed
with
both
arms
around
the
shaggy
neck
*punct* .
*break*
hans
snubbed
the
rope
around
the
tree
*punct* ,
and
buck
and
thornton
were
jerked
under
the
water
*punct* .
*break*
strangling
*punct* ,
suffocating
*punct* ,
sometimes
one
uppermost
and
sometimes
the
other
*punct* ,
dragging
over
the
jagged
bottom
*punct* ,
smashing
against
rocks
and
snags
*punct* ,
they
veered
in
to
the
bank
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
came
to
*punct* ,
belly
downward
and
being
violently
propelled
back
and
forth
across
a
drift
log
by
hans
and
pete
*punct* .
*break*
his
first
glance
was
for
buck
*punct* ,
over
whose
limp
and
apparently
lifeless
body
nig
was
setting
up
a
howl
*punct* ,
while
skeet
was
licking
the
wet
face
and
closed
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
was
himself
bruised
and
battered
*punct* ,
and
he
went
carefully
over
buck's
body
*punct* ,
when
he
had
been
brought
around
*punct* ,
finding
three
broken
ribs
*punct* .
*break*
that
settles
it
*punct* ,
he
announced
*punct* .
*break*
we
camp
right
here
*punct* .
*break*
and
camp
they
did
*punct* ,
till
buck's
ribs
knitted
and
he
was
able
to
travel
*punct* .
*break*
that
winter
*punct* ,
at
dawson
*punct* ,
buck
performed
another
exploit
*punct* ,
not
so
heroic
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
but
one
that
put
his
name
many
notches
higher
on
the
totem-pole
of
alaskan
fame
*punct* .
*break*
this
exploit
was
particularly
gratifying
to
the
three
men
*punct* ;
for
they
stood
in
need
of
the
outfit
which
it
furnished
*punct* ,
and
were
enabled
to
make
a
long-desired
trip
into
the
virgin
east
*punct* ,
where
miners
had
not
yet
appeared
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
brought
about
by
a
conversation
in
the
eldorado
saloon
*punct* ,
in
which
men
waxed
boastful
of
their
favorite
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
buck
*punct* ,
because
of
his
record
*punct* ,
was
the
target
for
these
men
*punct* ,
and
thornton
was
driven
stoutly
to
defend
him
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
one
man
stated
that
his
dog
could
start
a
sled
with
five
hundred
pounds
and
walk
off
with
it
*punct* ;
a
second
bragged
six
hundred
for
his
dog
*punct* ;
and
a
third
*punct* ,
seven
hundred
*punct* .
*break*
said
john
thornton
*punct* ;
buck
can
start
a
thousand
pounds
*punct* .
*break*
and
break
it
out
*punct* ?
*break*
and
walk
off
with
it
for
a
hundred
yards
*punct* ?
*break*
demanded
matthewson
*punct* ,
a
bonanza
king
*punct* ,
he
of
the
seven
hundred
vaunt
*punct* .
*break*
and
break
it
out
*punct* ,
and
walk
off
with
it
for
a
hundred
yards
*punct* ,
john
thornton
said
coolly
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
matthewson
said
*punct* ,
slowly
and
deliberately
*punct* ,
so
that
all
could
hear
*punct* ,
i've
got
a
thousand
dollars
that
says
he
can't
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
it
is
*punct* .
*break*
so
saying
*punct* ,
he
slammed
a
sack
of
gold
dust
of
the
size
of
a
bologna
sausage
down
upon
the
bar
*punct* .
*break*
thornton's
bluff
*punct* ,
if
bluff
it
was
*punct* ,
had
been
called
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
feel
a
flush
of
warm
blood
creeping
up
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
his
tongue
had
tricked
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
know
whether
buck
could
start
a
thousand
pounds
*punct* .
*break*
half
a
ton
*punct* !
*break*
the
enormousness
of
it
appalled
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
great
faith
in
buck's
strength
and
had
often
thought
him
capable
of
starting
such
a
load
*punct* ;
but
never
*punct* ,
as
now
*punct* ,
had
he
faced
the
possibility
of
it
*punct* ,
the
eyes
of
a
dozen
men
fixed
upon
him
*punct* ,
silent
and
waiting
*punct* .
*break*
further
*punct* ,
he
had
no
thousand
dollars
*punct* ;
nor
had
hans
or
pete
*punct* .
*break*
i've
got
a
sled
standing
outside
now
*punct* ,
with
twenty
fiftypound
sacks
of
flour
on
it
*punct* ,
matthewson
went
on
with
brutal
directness
*punct* ;
so
don't
let
that
hinder
you
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
did
not
reply
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
*punct* .
*break*
he
glanced
from
face
to
face
in
the
absent
way
of
a
man
who
has
lost
the
power
of
thought
and
is
seeking
somewhere
to
find
the
thing
that
will
start
it
going
again
*punct* .
*break*
the
face
of
jim
o'brien
*punct* ,
a
mastodon
king
and
old-time
comrade
*punct* ,
caught
his
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
as
a
cue
to
him
*punct* ,
seeming
to
rouse
him
to
do
what
he
would
never
have
dreamed
of
doing
*punct* .
*break*
can
you
lend
me
a
thousand
*punct* ?
*break*
he
asked
*punct* ,
almost
in
a
whisper
*punct* .
*break*
sure
*punct* ,
answered
o'brien
*punct* ,
thumping
down
a
plethoric
sack
by
the
side
of
matthewson's
*punct* .
*break*
though
it's
little
faith
i'm
having
*punct* ,
john
*punct* ,
that
the
beast
can
do
the
trick
*punct* .
*break*
the
eldorado
emptied
its
occupants
into
the
street
to
see
the
test
*punct* .
*break*
the
tables
were
deserted
*punct* ,
and
the
dealers
and
gamekeepers
came
forth
to
see
the
outcome
of
the
wager
and
to
lay
odds
*punct* .
*break*
several
hundred
men
*punct* ,
furred
and
mittened
*punct* ,
banked
around
the
sled
within
easy
distance
*punct* .
*break*
matthewson's
sled
*punct* ,
loaded
with
a
thousand
pounds
of
flour
*punct* ,
had
been
standing
for
a
couple
of
hours
*punct* ,
and
in
the
intense
cold
*punct* ,
it
was
sixty
below
zero
*punct* ,
the
runners
had
frozen
fast
to
the
hard-packed
snow
*punct* .
*break*
men
offered
odds
of
two
to
one
that
buck
could
not
budge
the
sled
*punct* .
*break*
a
quibble
arose
concerning
the
phrase
break
out
*punct* .
*break*
o'brien
contended
it
was
thornton's
privilege
to
knock
the
runners
loose
*punct* ,
leaving
buck
to
break
it
out
from
a
dead
standstill
*punct* .
*break*
matthewson
insisted
that
the
phrase
included
breaking
the
runners
from
the
frozen
grip
of
the
snow
*punct* .
*break*
a
majority
of
the
men
who
had
witnessed
the
making
of
the
bet
decided
in
his
favor
*punct* ,
whereat
the
odds
went
up
to
three
to
one
against
buck
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
no
takers
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
man
believed
him
capable
of
the
feat
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
had
been
hurried
into
the
wager
*punct* ,
heavy
with
doubt
*punct* ;
and
now
that
he
looked
at
the
sled
itself
*punct* ,
the
concrete
fact
*punct* ,
with
the
regular
team
of
ten
dogs
curled
up
in
the
snow
before
it
*punct* ,
the
more
impossible
the
task
appeared
*punct* .
*break*
matthewson
waxed
jubilant
*punct* .
*break*
three
to
one
*punct* !
*break*
i'll
lay
you
another
thousand
at
that
figure
*punct* ,
thornton
*punct* .
*break*
what
d'ye
say
*punct* ?
*break*
thornton's
doubt
was
strong
in
his
face
*punct* ,
but
his
fighting
spirit
was
aroused
*punct* ,
the
fighting
spirit
that
soars
above
odds
*punct* ,
fails
to
recognize
the
impossible
*punct* ,
and
is
deaf
to
all
save
the
clamor
for
battle
*punct* .
*break*
he
called
hans
and
pete
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
their
sacks
were
slim
*punct* ,
and
with
his
own
the
three
partners
could
rake
together
only
two
hundred
dollars
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
ebb
of
their
fortunes
*punct* ,
this
sum
was
their
total
capital
*punct* ;
yet
they
laid
it
unhesitatingly
against
matthewson's
six
hundred
*punct* .
*break*
the
team
of
ten
dogs
was
unhitched
*punct* ,
and
buck
*punct* ,
with
his
own
harness
*punct* ,
was
put
into
the
sled
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
caught
the
contagion
of
the
excitement
*punct* ,
and
he
felt
that
in
some
way
he
must
do
a
great
thing
for
john
thornton
*punct* .
*break*
murmurs
of
admiration
at
his
splendid
appearance
went
up
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
in
perfect
condition
*punct* ,
without
an
ounce
of
superfluous
flesh
*punct* ,
and
the
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
that
he
weighed
were
so
many
pounds
of
grit
and
virility
*punct* .
*break*
his
furry
coat
shone
with
the
sheen
of
silk
*punct* .
*break*
down
the
neck
and
across
the
shoulders
*punct* ,
his
mane
*punct* ,
in
repose
as
it
was
*punct* ,
half
bristled
and
seemed
to
lift
with
every
movement
*punct* ,
as
though
excess
of
vigor
made
each
particular
hair
alive
and
active
*punct* .
*break*
the
great
breast
and
heavy
fore
legs
were
no
more
than
in
proportion
with
the
rest
of
the
body
*punct* ,
where
the
muscles
showed
in
tight
rolls
underneath
the
skin
*punct* .
*break*
men
felt
these
muscles
and
proclaimed
them
hard
as
iron
*punct* ,
and
the
odds
went
down
to
two
to
one
*punct* .
*break*
gad
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
gad
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
stuttered
a
member
of
the
latest
dynasty
*punct* ,
a
king
of
the
skookum
benches
*punct* .
*break*
i
offer
you
eight
hundred
for
him
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
before
the
test
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
eight
hundred
just
as
he
stands
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
shook
his
head
and
stepped
to
buck's
side
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
stand
off
from
him
*punct* ,
matthewson
protested
*punct* .
*break*
free
play
and
plenty
of
room
*punct* .
*break*
the
crowd
fell
silent
*punct* ;
only
could
be
heard
the
voices
of
the
gamblers
vainly
offering
two
to
one
*punct* .
*break*
everybody
acknowledged
buck
a
magnificent
animal
*punct* ,
but
twenty
fifty-pound
sacks
of
flour
bulked
too
large
in
their
eyes
for
them
to
loosen
their
pouch-strings
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
knelt
down
by
buck's
side
*punct* .
*break*
he
took
his
head
in
his
two
hands
and
rested
cheek
on
cheek
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
playfully
shake
him
*punct* ,
as
was
his
wont
*punct* ,
or
murmur
soft
love
curses
*punct* ;
but
he
whispered
in
his
ear
*punct* .
*break*
as
you
love
me
*punct* ,
buck
*punct* .
*break*
as
you
love
me
*punct* ,
was
what
he
whispered
*punct* .
*break*
buck
whined
with
suppressed
eagerness
*punct* .
*break*
the
crowd
was
watching
curiously
*punct* .
*break*
the
affair
was
growing
mysterious
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
like
a
conjuration
*punct* .
*break*
as
thornton
got
to
his
feet
*punct* ,
buck
seized
his
mittened
hand
between
his
jaws
*punct* ,
pressing
in
with
his
teeth
and
releasing
slowly
*punct* ,
half-reluctantly
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
answer
*punct* ,
in
terms
*punct* ,
not
of
speech
*punct* ,
but
of
love
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
stepped
well
back
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
buck
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
buck
tightened
the
traces
*punct* ,
then
slacked
them
for
a
matter
of
several
inches
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
way
he
had
learned
*punct* .
*break*
thornton's
voice
rang
out
*punct* ,
sharp
in
the
tense
silence
*punct* .
*break*
buck
swung
to
the
right
*punct* ,
ending
the
movement
in
a
plunge
that
took
up
the
slack
and
with
a
sudden
jerk
arrested
his
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
*punct* .
*break*
the
load
quivered
*punct* ,
and
from
under
the
runners
arose
a
crisp
crackling
*punct* .
*break*
buck
duplicated
the
manoeuvre
*punct* ,
this
time
to
the
left
*punct* .
*break*
the
crackling
turned
into
a
snapping
*punct* ,
the
sled
pivoting
and
the
runners
slipping
and
grating
several
inches
to
the
side
*punct* .
*break*
the
sled
was
broken
out
*punct* .
*break*
men
were
holding
their
breaths
*punct* ,
intensely
unconscious
of
the
fact
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
mush
*punct* !
*break*
thornton's
command
cracked
out
like
a
pistol-shot
*punct* .
*break*
buck
threw
himself
forward
*punct* ,
tightening
the
traces
with
a
jarring
lunge
*punct* .
*break*
his
whole
body
was
gathered
compactly
together
in
the
tremendous
effort
*punct* ,
the
muscles
writhing
and
knotting
like
live
things
under
the
silky
fur
*punct* .
*break*
his
great
chest
was
low
to
the
ground
*punct* ,
his
head
forward
and
down
*punct* ,
while
his
feet
were
flying
like
mad
*punct* ,
the
claws
scarring
the
hard-packed
snow
in
parallel
grooves
*punct* .
*break*
the
sled
swayed
and
trembled
*punct* ,
half-started
forward
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
his
feet
slipped
*punct* ,
and
one
man
groaned
aloud
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
sled
lurched
ahead
in
what
appeared
a
rapid
succession
of
jerks
*punct* ,
though
it
never
really
came
to
a
dead
stop
again
*punct* ...
half
an
inch
*punct* ...
an
inch
*punct* ...
two
inches
*punct* ...
the
jerks
perceptibly
diminished
*punct* ;
as
the
sled
gained
momentum
*punct* ,
he
caught
them
up
*punct* ,
till
it
was
moving
steadily
along
*punct* .
*break*
men
gasped
and
began
to
breathe
again
*punct* ,
unaware
that
for
a
moment
they
had
ceased
to
breathe
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
was
running
behind
*punct* ,
encouraging
buck
with
short
*punct* ,
cheery
words
*punct* .
*break*
the
distance
had
been
measured
off
*punct* ,
and
as
he
neared
the
pile
of
firewood
which
marked
the
end
of
the
hundred
yards
*punct* ,
a
cheer
began
to
grow
and
grow
*punct* ,
which
burst
into
a
roar
as
he
passed
the
firewood
and
halted
at
command
*punct* .
*break*
every
man
was
tearing
himself
loose
*punct* ,
even
matthewson
*punct* .
*break*
hats
and
mittens
were
flying
in
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
men
were
shaking
hands
*punct* ,
it
did
not
matter
with
whom
*punct* ,
and
bubbling
over
in
a
general
incoherent
babel
*punct* .
*break*
but
thornton
fell
on
his
knees
beside
buck
*punct* .
*break*
head
was
against
head
*punct* ,
and
he
was
shaking
him
back
and
forth
*punct* .
*break*
those
who
hurried
up
heard
him
cursing
buck
*punct* ,
and
he
cursed
him
long
and
fervently
*punct* ,
and
softly
and
lovingly
*punct* .
*break*
gad

spluttered
the

*break*
thornton
rose
to
his

*break*
his
eyes
were
wet

*break*
the
tears
were
streaming
frankly
down
his
cheeks

the
best
i
can
do
for
you
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
buck
seized
thornton's
hand
in
his
teeth
*punct* .
*break*
thornton
shook
him
back
and
forth
*punct* .
*break*
as
though
animated
by
a
common
impulse
*punct* ,
the
onlookers
drew
back
to
a
respectful
distance
*punct* ;
nor
were
they
again
indiscreet
enough
to
interrupt
*punct* .
*break*
when
buck
earned
sixteen
hundred
dollars
in
five
minutes
for
john
thornton
*punct* ,
he
made
it
possible
for
his
master
to
pay
off
certain
debts
and
to
journey
with
his
partners
into
the
east
after
a
fabled
lost
mine
*punct* ,
the
history
of
which
was
as
old
as
the
history
of
the
country
*punct* .
*break*
many
men
had
sought
it
*punct* ;
few
had
found
it
*punct* ;
and
more
than
a
few
there
were
who
had
never
returned
from
the
quest
*punct* .
*break*
this
lost
mine
was
steeped
in
tragedy
and
shrouded
in
mystery
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
knew
of
the
first
man
*punct* .
*break*
the
oldest
tradition
stopped
before
it
got
back
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
beginning
there
had
been
an
ancient
and
ramshackle
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
dying
men
had
sworn
to
it
*punct* ,
and
to
the
mine
the
site
of
which
it
marked
*punct* ,
clinching
their
testimony
with
nuggets
that
were
unlike
any
known
grade
of
gold
in
the
northland
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
living
man
had
looted
this
treasure
house
*punct* ,
and
the
dead
were
dead
*punct* ;
wherefore
john
thornton
and
pete
and
hans
*punct* ,
with
buck
and
half
a
dozen
other
dogs
*punct* ,
faced
into
the
east
on
an
unknown
trail
to
achieve
where
men
and
dogs
as
good
as
themselves
had
failed
*punct* .
*break*
they
sledded
seventy
miles
up
the
yukon
*punct* ,
swung
to
the
left
into
the
stewart
river
*punct* ,
passed
the
mayo
and
the
mcquestion
*punct* ,
and
held
on
until
the
stewart
itself
became
a
streamlet
*punct* ,
threading
the
upstanding
peaks
which
marked
the
backbone
of
the
continent
*punct* .
*break*
john
thornton
asked
little
of
man
or
nature
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
unafraid
of
the
wild
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
handful
of
salt
and
a
rifle
he
could
plunge
into
the
wilderness
and
fare
wherever
he
pleased
and
as
long
as
he
pleased
*punct* .
*break*
being
in
no
haste
*punct* ,
indian
fashion
*punct* ,
he
hunted
his
dinner
in
the
course
of
the
day's
travel
*punct* ;
and
if
he
failed
to
find
it
*punct* ,
like
the
indian
*punct* ,
he
kept
on
travelling
*punct* ,
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
come
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
on
this
great
journey
into
the
east
*punct* ,
straight
meat
was
the
bill
of
fare
*punct* ,
ammunition
and
tools
principally
made
up
the
load
on
the
sled
*punct* ,
and
the
time-card
was
drawn
upon
the
limitless
future
*punct* .
*break*
to
buck
it
was
boundless
delight
*punct* ,
this
hunting
*punct* ,
fishing
*punct* ,
and
indefinite
wandering
through
strange
places
*punct* .
*break*
for
weeks
at
a
time
they
would
hold
on
steadily
*punct* ,
day
after
day
*punct* ;
and
for
weeks
upon
end
they
would
camp
*punct* ,
here
and
there
*punct* ,
the
dogs
loafing
and
the
men
burning
holes
through
frozen
muck
and
gravel
and
washing
countless
pans
of
dirt
by
the
heat
of
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
they
went
hungry
*punct* ,
sometimes
they
feasted
riotously
*punct* ,
all
according
to
the
abundance
of
game
and
the
fortune
of
hunting
*punct* .
*break*
summer
arrived
*punct* ,
and
dogs
and
men
packed
on
their
backs
*punct* ,
rafted
across
blue
mountain
lakes
*punct* ,
and
descended
or
ascended
unknown
rivers
in
slender
boats
whipsawed
from
the
standing
forest
*punct* .
*break*
the
months
came
and
went
*punct* ,
and
back
and
forth
they
twisted
through
the
uncharted
vastness
*punct* ,
where
no
men
were
and
yet
where
men
had
been
if
the
lost
cabin
were
true
*punct* .
*break*
they
went
across
divides
in
summer
blizzards
*punct* ,
shivered
under
the
midnight
sun
on
naked
mountains
between
the
timber
line
and
the
eternal
snows
*punct* ,
dropped
into
summer
valleys
amid
swarming
gnats
and
flies
*punct* ,
and
in
the
shadows
of
glaciers
picked
strawberries
and
flowers
as
ripe
and
fair
as
any
the
southland
could
boast
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
fall
of
the
year
they
penetrated
a
weird
lake
country
*punct* ,
sad
and
silent
*punct* ,
where
wild
*punct* -
fowl
had
been
*punct* ,
but
where
then
there
was
no
life
nor
sign
of
life
*punct* ,
only
the
blowing
of
chill
winds
*punct* ,
the
forming
of
ice
in
sheltered
places
*punct* ,
and
the
melancholy
rippling
of
waves
on
lonely
beaches
*punct* .
*break*
and
through
another
winter
they
wandered
on
the
obliterated
trails
of
men
who
had
gone
before
*punct* .
*break*
once
*punct* ,
they
came
upon
a
path
blazed
through
the
forest
*punct* ,
an
ancient
path
*punct* ,
and
the
lost
cabin
seemed
very
near
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
path
began
nowhere
and
ended
nowhere
*punct* ,
and
it
remained
mystery
*punct* ,
as
the
man
who
made
it
and
the
reason
he
made
it
remained
mystery
*punct* .
*break*
another
time
they
chanced
upon
the
time-graven
wreckage
of
a
hunting
lodge
*punct* ,
and
amid
the
shreds
of
rotted
blankets
john
thornton
found
a
long-barrelled
flint-lock
*punct* .
*break*
he
knew
it
for
a
hudson
bay
company
gun
of
the
young
days
in
the
northwest
*punct* ,
when
such
a
gun
was
worth
its
height
in
beaver
skins
packed
flat
*punct* ,
and
that
was
all
*punct* ,
no
hint
as
to
the
man
who
in
an
early
day
had
reared
the
lodge
and
left
the
gun
among
the
blankets
*punct* .
*break*
spring
came
on
once
more
*punct* ,
and
at
the
end
of
all
their
wandering
they
found
*punct* ,
not
the
lost
cabin
*punct* ,
but
a
shallow
placer
in
a
broad
valley
where
the
gold
showed
like
yellow
butter
across
the
bottom
of
the
washing-pan
*punct* .
*break*
they
sought
no
farther
*punct* .
*break*
each
day
they
worked
earned
them
thousands
of
dollars
in
clean
dust
and
nuggets
*punct* ,
and
they
worked
every
day
*punct* .
*break*
the
gold
was
sacked
in
moose-hide
bags
*punct* ,
fifty
pounds
to
the
bag
*punct* ,
and
piled
like
so
much
firewood
outside
the
spruce-bough
lodge
*punct* .
*break*
like
giants
they
toiled
*punct* ,
days
flashing
on
the
heels
of
days
like
dreams
as
they
heaped
the
treasure
up
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
nothing
for
the
dogs
to
do
*punct* ,
save
the
hauling
in
of
meat
now
and
again
that
thornton
killed
*punct* ,
and
buck
spent
long
hours
musing
by
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
the
vision
of
the
short-legged
hairy
man
came
to
him
more
frequently
*punct* ,
now
that
there
was
little
work
to
be
done
*punct* ;
and
often
*punct* ,
blinking
by
the
fire
*punct* ,
buck
wandered
with
him
in
that
other
world
which
he
remembered
*punct* .
*break*
the
salient
thing
of
this
other
world
seemed
fear
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
watched
the
hairy
man
sleeping
by
the
fire
*punct* ,
head
between
his
knees
and
hands
clasped
above
*punct* ,
buck
saw
that
he
slept
restlessly
*punct* ,
with
many
starts
and
awakenings
*punct* ,
at
which
times
he
would
peer
fearfully
into
the
darkness
and
fling
more
wood
upon
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
did
they
walk
by
the
beach
of
a
sea
*punct* ,
where
the
hairy
man
gathered
shell
*punct* -
fish
and
ate
them
as
he
gathered
*punct* ,
it
was
with
eyes
that
roved
everywhere
for
hidden
danger
and
with
legs
prepared
to
run
like
the
wind
at
its
first
appearance
*punct* .
*break*
through
the
forest
they
crept
noiselessly
*punct* ,
buck
at
the
hairy
man's
heels
*punct* ;
and
they
were
alert
and
vigilant
*punct* ,
the
pair
of
them
*punct* ,
ears
twitching
and
moving
and
nostrils
quivering
*punct* ,
for
the
man
heard
and
smelled
as
keenly
as
buck
*punct* .
*break*
the
hairy
man
could
spring
up
into
the
trees
and
travel
ahead
as
fast
as
on
the
ground
*punct* ,
swinging
by
the
arms
from
limb
to
limb
*punct* ,
sometimes
a
dozen
feet
apart
*punct* ,
letting
go
and
catching
*punct* ,
never
falling
*punct* ,
never
missing
his
grip
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
he
seemed
as
much
at
home
among
the
trees
as
on
the
ground
*punct* ;
and
buck
had
memories
of
nights
of
vigil
spent
beneath
trees
wherein
the
hairy
man
roosted
*punct* ,
holding
on
tightly
as
he
slept
*punct* .
*break*
and
closely
akin
to
the
visions
of
the
hairy
man
was
the
call
still
sounding
in
the
depths
of
the
forest
*punct* .
*break*
it
filled
him
with
a
great
unrest
and
strange
desires
*punct* .
*break*
it
caused
him
to
feel
a
vague
*punct* ,
sweet
gladness
*punct* ,
and
he
was
aware
of
wild
yearnings
and
stirrings
for
he
knew
not
what
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
he
pursued
the
call
into
the
forest
*punct* ,
looking
for
it
as
though
it
were
a
tangible
thing
*punct* ,
barking
softly
or
defiantly
*punct* ,
as
the
mood
might
dictate
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
thrust
his
nose
into
the
cool
wood
moss
*punct* ,
or
into
the
black
soil
where
long
grasses
grew
*punct* ,
and
snort
with
joy
at
the
fat
earth
smells
*punct* ;
or
he
would
crouch
for
hours
*punct* ,
as
if
in
concealment
*punct* ,
behind
fungus
*punct* -
covered
trunks
of
fallen
trees
*punct* ,
wide-eyed
and
wide-eared
to
all
that
moved
and
sounded
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
might
be
*punct* ,
lying
thus
*punct* ,
that
he
hoped
to
surprise
this
call
he
could
not
understand
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
did
not
know
why
he
did
these
various
things
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
impelled
to
do
them
*punct* ,
and
did
not
reason
about
them
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
irresistible
impulses
seized
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
be
lying
in
camp
*punct* ,
dozing
lazily
in
the
heat
of
the
day
*punct* ,
when
suddenly
his
head
would
lift
and
his
ears
cock
up
*punct* ,
intent
and
listening
*punct* ,
and
he
would
spring
to
his
feet
and
dash
away
*punct* ,
and
on
and
on
*punct* ,
for
hours
*punct* ,
through
the
forest
aisles
and
across
the
open
spaces
where
the
niggerheads
bunched
*punct* .
*break*
he
loved
to
run
down
dry
watercourses
*punct* ,
and
to
creep
and
spy
upon
the
bird
life
in
the
woods
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
day
at
a
time
he
would
lie
in
the
underbrush
where
he
could
watch
the
partridges
drumming
and
strutting
up
and
down
*punct* .
*break*
but
especially
he
loved
to
run
in
the
dim
twilight
of
the
summer
midnights
*punct* ,
listening
to
the
subdued
and
sleepy
murmurs
of
the
forest
*punct* ,
reading
signs
and
sounds
as
man
may
read
a
book
*punct* ,
and
seeking
for
the
mysterious
something
that
called
*punct* ,
called
*punct* ,
waking
or
sleeping
*punct* ,
at
all
times
*punct* ,
for
him
to
come
*punct* .
*break*
one
night
he
sprang
from
sleep
with
a
start
*punct* ,
eager-eyed
*punct* ,
nostrils
quivering
and
scenting
*punct* ,
his
mane
bristling
in
recurrent
waves
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
forest
came
the
call
*punct* ,
or
one
note
of
it
*punct* ,
for
the
call
was
many
noted
*punct* ,
distinct
and
definite
as
never
before,
*punct* ,
a
long-drawn
howl
*punct* ,
like
*punct* ,
yet
unlike
*punct* ,
any
noise
made
by
husky
dog
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
knew
it
*punct* ,
in
the
old
familiar
way
*punct* ,
as
a
sound
heard
before
*punct* .
*break*
he
sprang
through
the
sleeping
camp
and
in
swift
silence
dashed
through
the
woods
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
drew
closer
to
the
cry
he
went
more
slowly
*punct* ,
with
caution
in
every
movement
*punct* ,
till
he
came
to
an
open
place
among
the
trees
*punct* ,
and
looking
out
saw
*punct* ,
erect
on
haunches
*punct* ,
with
nose
pointed
to
the
sky
*punct* ,
a
long
*punct* ,
lean
*punct* ,
timber
wolf
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
made
no
noise
*punct* ,
yet
it
ceased
from
its
howling
and
tried
to
sense
his
presence
*punct* .
*break*
buck
stalked
into
the
open
*punct* ,
half
crouching
*punct* ,
body
gathered
compactly
together
*punct* ,
tail
straight
and
stiff
*punct* ,
feet
falling
with
unwonted
care
*punct* .
*break*
every
movement
advertised
commingled
threatening
and
overture
of
friendliness
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
menacing
truce
that
marks
the
meeting
of
wild
beasts
that
prey
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
wolf
fled
at
sight
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
followed
*punct* ,
with
wild
leapings
*punct* ,
in
a
frenzy
to
overtake
*punct* .
*break*
he
ran
him
into
a
blind
channel
*punct* ,
in
the
bed
of
the
creek
where
a
timber
jam
barred
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
the
wolf
whirled
about
*punct* ,
pivoting
on
his
hind
legs
after
the
fashion
of
joe
and
of
all
cornered
husky
dogs
*punct* ,
snarling
and
bristling
*punct* ,
clipping
his
teeth
together
in
a
continuous
and
rapid
succession
of
snaps
*punct* .
*break*
buck
did
not
attack
*punct* ,
but
circled
him
about
and
hedged
him
in
with
friendly
advances
*punct* .
*break*
the
wolf
was
suspicious
and
afraid
*punct* ;
for
buck
made
three
of
him
in
weight
*punct* ,
while
his
head
barely
reached
buck's
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
watching
his
chance
*punct* ,
he
darted
away
*punct* ,
and
the
chase
was
resumed
*punct* .
*break*
time
and
again
he
was
cornered
*punct* ,
and
the
thing
repeated
*punct* ,
though
he
was
in
poor
condition
*punct* ,
or
buck
could
not
so
easily
have
overtaken
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
run
till
buck's
head
was
even
with
his
flank
*punct* ,
when
he
would
whirl
around
at
bay
*punct* ,
only
to
dash
away
again
at
the
first
opportunity
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
the
end
buck's
pertinacity
was
rewarded
*punct* ;
for
the
wolf
*punct* ,
finding
that
no
harm
was
intended
*punct* ,
finally
sniffed
noses
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
then
they
became
friendly
*punct* ,
and
played
about
in
the
nervous
*punct* ,
half
*punct* -
coy
way
with
which
fierce
beasts
belie
their
fierceness
*punct* .
*break*
after
some
time
of
this
the
wolf
started
off
at
an
easy
lope
in
a
manner
that
plainly
showed
he
was
going
somewhere
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
it
clear
to
buck
that
he
was
to
come
*punct* ,
and
they
ran
side
by
side
through
the
sombre
twilight
*punct* ,
straight
up
the
creek
bed
*punct* ,
into
the
gorge
from
which
it
issued
*punct* ,
and
across
the
bleak
divide
where
it
took
its
rise
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
opposite
slope
of
the
watershed
they
came
down
into
a
level
country
where
were
great
stretches
of
forest
and
many
streams
*punct* ,
and
through
these
great
stretches
they
ran
steadily
*punct* ,
hour
after
hour
*punct* ,
the
sun
rising
higher
and
the
day
growing
warmer
*punct* .
*break*
buck
was
wildly
glad
*punct* .
*break*
he
knew
he
was
at
last
answering
the
call
*punct* ,
running
by
the
side
of
his
wood
brother
toward
the
place
from
where
the
call
surely
came
*punct* .
*break*
old
memories
were
coming
upon
him
fast
*punct* ,
and
he
was
stirring
to
them
as
of
old
he
stirred
to
the
realities
of
which
they
were
the
shadows
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
done
this
thing
before
*punct* ,
somewhere
in
that
other
and
dimly
remembered
world
*punct* ,
and
he
was
doing
it
again
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
running
free
in
the
open
*punct* ,
the
unpacked
earth
underfoot
*punct* ,
the
wide
sky
overhead
*punct* .
*break*
they
stopped
by
a
running
stream
to
drink
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
stopping
*punct* ,
buck
remembered
john
thornton
*punct* .
*break*
he
sat
down
*punct* .
*break*
the
wolf
started
on
toward
the
place
from
where
the
call
surely
came
*punct* ,
then
returned
to
him
*punct* ,
sniffing
noses
and
making
actions
as
though
to
encourage
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
buck
turned
about
and
started
slowly
on
the
back
track
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
better
part
of
an
hour
the
wild
brother
ran
by
his
side
*punct* ,
whining
softly
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
sat
down
*punct* ,
pointed
his
nose
upward
*punct* ,
and
howled
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
mournful
howl
*punct* ,
and
as
buck
held
steadily
on
his
way
he
heard
it
grow
faint
and
fainter
until
it
was
lost
in
the
distance
*punct* .
*break*
john
thornton
was
eating
dinner
when
buck
dashed
into
camp
and
sprang
upon
him
in
a
frenzy
of
affection
*punct* ,
overturning
him
*punct* ,
scrambling
upon
him
*punct* ,
licking
his
face
*punct* ,
biting
his
hand
*punct* ,
playing
the
general
tom-fool
*punct* ,
as
john
thornton
characterized
it
*punct* ,
the
while
he
shook
buck
back
and
forth
and
cursed
him
lovingly
*punct* .
*break*
for
two
days
and
nights
buck
never
left
camp
*punct* ,
never
let
thornton
out
of
his
sight
*punct* .
*break*
he
followed
him
about
at
his
work
*punct* ,
watched
him
while
he
ate
*punct* ,
saw
him
into
his
blankets
at
night
and
out
of
them
in
the
morning
*punct* .
*break*
but
after
two
days
the
call
in
the
forest
began
to
sound
more
imperiously
than
ever
*punct* .
*break*
buck's
restlessness
came
back
on
him
*punct* ,
and
he
was
haunted
by
recollections
of
the
wild
brother
*punct* ,
and
of
the
smiling
land
beyond
the
divide
and
the
run
side
by
side
through
the
wide
forest
stretches
*punct* .
*break*
once
again
he
took
to
wandering
in
the
woods
*punct* ,
but
the
wild
brother
came
no
more
*punct* ;
and
though
he
listened
through
long
vigils
*punct* ,
the
mournful
howl
was
never
raised
*punct* .
*break*
he
began
to
sleep
out
at
night
*punct* ,
staying
away
from
camp
for
days
at
a
time
*punct* ;
and
once
he
crossed
the
divide
at
the
head
of
the
creek
and
went
down
into
the
land
of
timber
and
streams
*punct* .
*break*
there
he
wandered
for
a
week
*punct* ,
seeking
vainly
for
fresh
sign
of
the
wild
brother
*punct* ,
killing
his
meat
as
he
travelled
and
travelling
with
the
long
*punct* ,
easy
lope
that
seems
never
to
tire
*punct* .
*break*
he
fished
for
salmon
in
a
broad
stream
that
emptied
somewhere
into
the
sea
*punct* ,
and
by
this
stream
he
killed
a
large
black
bear
*punct* ,
blinded
by
the
mosquitoes
while
likewise
fishing
*punct* ,
and
raging
through
the
forest
helpless
and
terrible
*punct* .
*break*
even
so
*punct* ,
it
was
a
hard
fight
*punct* ,
and
it
aroused
the
last
latent
remnants
of
buck's
ferocity
*punct* .
*break*
and
two
days
later
*punct* ,
when
he
returned
to
his
kill
and
found
a
dozen
wolverenes
quarrelling
over
the
spoil
*punct* ,
he
scattered
them
like
chaff
*punct* ;
and
those
that
fled
left
two
behind
who
would
quarrel
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
the
blood-longing
became
stronger
than
ever
before
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
killer
*punct* ,
a
thing
that
preyed
*punct* ,
living
on
the
things
that
lived
*punct* ,
unaided
*punct* ,
alone
*punct* ,
by
virtue
of
his
own
strength
and
prowess
*punct* ,
surviving
triumphantly
in
a
hostile
environment
where
only
the
strong
survived
*punct* .
*break*
because
of
all
this
he
became
possessed
of
a
great
pride
in
himself
*punct* ,
which
communicated
itself
like
a
contagion
to
his
physical
being
*punct* .
*break*
it
advertised
itself
in
all
his
movements
*punct* ,
was
apparent
in
the
play
of
every
muscle
*punct* ,
spoke
plainly
as
speech
in
the
way
he
carried
himself
*punct* ,
and
made
his
glorious
furry
coat
if
anything
more
glorious
*punct* .
*break*
but
for
the
stray
brown
on
his
muzzle
and
above
his
eyes
*punct* ,
and
for
the
splash
of
white
hair
that
ran
midmost
down
his
chest
*punct* ,
he
might
well
have
been
mistaken
for
a
gigantic
wolf
*punct* ,
larger
than
the
largest
of
the
breed
*punct* .
*break*
from
his
st
*punct* .
*break*
bernard
father
he
had
inherited
size
and
weight
*punct* ,
but
it
was
his
shepherd
mother
who
had
given
shape
to
that
size
and
weight
*punct* .
*break*
his
muzzle
was
the
long
wolf
muzzle
*punct* ,
save
that
was
larger
than
the
muzzle
of
any
wolf
*punct* ;
and
his
head
*punct* ,
somewhat
broader
*punct* ,
was
the
wolf
head
on
a
massive
scale
*punct* .
*break*
his
cunning
was
wolf
cunning
*punct* ,
and
wild
cunning
*punct* ;
his
intelligence
*punct* ,
shepherd
intelligence
and
st
*punct* .
*break*
bernard
intelligence
*punct* ;
and
all
this
*punct* ,
plus
an
experience
gained
in
the
fiercest
of
schools
*punct* ,
made
him
as
formidable
a
creature
as
any
that
intelligence
roamed
the
wild
*punct* .
*break*
a
carnivorous
animal
living
on
a
straight
meat
diet
*punct* ,
he
was
in
full
flower
*punct* ,
at
the
high
tide
of
his
life
*punct* ,
overspilling
with
vigor
and
virility
*punct* .
*break*
when
thornton
passed
a
caressing
hand
along
his
back
*punct* ,
a
snapping
and
crackling
followed
the
hand
*punct* ,
each
hair
discharing
its
pent
magnetism
at
the
contact
*punct* .
*break*
every
part
*punct* ,
brain
and
body
*punct* ,
nerve
tissue
and
fibre
*punct* ,
was
keyed
to
the
most
exquisite
pitch
*punct* ;
and
between
all
the
parts
there
was
a
perfect
equilibrium
or
adjustment
*punct* .
*break*
to
sights
and
sounds
and
events
which
required
action
*punct* ,
he
responded
with
lightning-like
rapidity
*punct* .
*break*
quickly
as
a
husky
dog
could
leap
to
defend
from
attack
or
to
attack
*punct* ,
he
could
leap
twice
as
quickly
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
the
movement
*punct* ,
or
heard
sound
*punct* ,
and
responded
in
less
time
than
another
dog
required
to
compass
the
mere
seeing
or
hearing
*punct* .
*break*
he
perceived
and
determined
and
responded
in
the
same
instant
*punct* .
*break*
in
point
of
fact
the
three
actions
of
perceiving
*punct* ,
determining
*punct* ,
and
responding
were
sequential
*punct* ;
but
so
infinitesimal
were
the
intervals
of
time
between
them
that
they
appeared
simultaneous
*punct* .
*break*
his
muscles
were
surcharged
with
vitality
*punct* ,
and
snapped
into
play
sharply
*punct* ,
like
steel
springs
*punct* .
*break*
life
streamed
through
him
in
splendid
flood
*punct* ,
glad
and
rampant
*punct* ,
until
it
seemed
that
it
would
burst
him
asunder
in
sheer
ecstasy
and
pour
forth
generously
over
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
never
was
there
such
a
dog
*punct* ,
said
john
thornton
one
day
*punct* ,
as
the
partners
watched
buck
marching
out
of
camp
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
was
made
*punct* ,
the
mould
was
broke
*punct* ,
said
pete
*punct* .
*break*
i
t'ink
so
mineself
*punct* ,
hans
affirmed
*punct* .
*break*
they
saw
him
marching
out
of
camp
*punct* ,
but
they
did
not
see
the
instant
and
terrible
transformation
which
took
place
as
soon
as
he
was
within
the
secrecy
of
the
forest
*punct* .
*break*
he
no
longer
marched
*punct* .
*break*
at
once
he
became
a
thing
of
the
wild
*punct* ,
stealing
along
softly
*punct* ,
cat
*punct* -
footed
*punct* ,
a
passing
shadow
that
appeared
and
disappeared
among
the
shadows
*punct* .
*break*
he
knew
how
to
take
advantage
of
every
cover
*punct* ,
to
crawl
on
his
belly
like
a
snake
*punct* ,
and
like
a
snake
to
leap
and
strike
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
take
a
ptarmigan
from
its
nest
*punct* ,
kill
a
rabbit
as
it
slept
*punct* ,
and
snap
in
mid
air
the
little
chipmunks
fleeing
a
second
too
late
for
the
trees
*punct* .
*break*
fish
*punct* ,
in
open
pools
*punct* ,
were
not
too
quick
for
him
*punct* ;
nor
were
beaver
*punct* ,
mending
their
dams
*punct* ,
too
wary
*punct* .
*break*
he
killed
to
eat
*punct* ,
not
from
wantonness
*punct* ;
but
he
preferred
to
eat
what
he
killed
himself
*punct* .
*break*
so
a
lurking
humor
ran
through
his
deeds
*punct* ,
and
it
was
his
delight
to
steal
upon
the
squirrels
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
when
he
all
but
had
them
*punct* ,
to
let
them
go
*punct* ,
chattering
in
mortal
fear
to
the
treetops
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
fall
of
the
year
came
on
*punct* ,
the
moose
appeared
in
greater
abundance
*punct* ,
moving
slowly
down
to
meet
the
winter
in
the
lower
and
less
rigorous
valleys
*punct* .
*break*
buck
had
already
dragged
down
a
stray
part-grown
calf
*punct* ;
but
he
wished
strongly
for
larger
and
more
formidable
quarry
*punct* ,
and
he
came
upon
it
one
day
on
the
divide
at
the
head
of
the
creek
*punct* .
*break*
a
band
of
twenty
moose
had
crossed
over
from
the
land
of
streams
and
timber
*punct* ,
and
chief
among
them
was
a
great
bull
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
in
a
savage
temper
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
standing
over
six
feet
from
the
ground
*punct* ,
was
as
formidable
an
antagonist
as
even
buck
could
desire
*punct* .
*break*
back
and
forth
the
bull
tossed
his
great
palmated
antlers
*punct* ,
branching
to
fourteen
points
and
embracing
seven
feet
within
the
tips
*punct* .
*break*
his
small
eyes
burned
with
a
vicious
and
bitter
light
*punct* ,
while
he
roared
with
fury
at
sight
of
buck
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
bull's
side
*punct* ,
just
forward
of
the
flank
*punct* ,
protruded
a
feathered
arrow-end
*punct* ,
which
accounted
for
his
savageness
*punct* .
*break*
guided
by
that
instinct
which
came
from
the
old
hunting
days
of
the
primordial
world
*punct* ,
buck
proceeded
to
cut
the
bull
out
from
the
herd
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
no
slight
task
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
bark
and
dance
about
in
front
of
the
bull
*punct* ,
just
out
of
reach
of
the
great
antlers
and
of
the
terrible
splay
hoofs
which
could
have
stamped
his
life
out
with
a
single
blow
*punct* .
*break*
unable
to
turn
his
back
on
the
fanged
danger
and
go
on
*punct* ,
the
bull
would
be
driven
into
paroxysms
of
rage
*punct* .
*break*
at
such
moments
he
charged
buck
*punct* ,
who
retreated
craftily
*punct* ,
luring
him
on
by
a
simulated
inability
to
escape
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
he
was
thus
separated
from
his
fellows
*punct* ,
two
or
three
of
the
younger
bulls
would
charge
back
upon
buck
and
enable
the
wounded
bull
to
rejoin
the
herd
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
a
patience
of
the
wild
*punct* ,
dogged
*punct* ,
tireless
*punct* ,
persistent
as
life
itself
*punct* ,
that
holds
motionless
for
endless
hours
the
spider
in
its
web
*punct* ,
the
snake
in
its
coils
*punct* ,
the
panther
in
its
ambuscade
*punct* ;
this
patience
belongs
peculiarly
to
life
when
it
hunts
its
living
food
*punct* ;
and
it
belonged
to
buck
as
he
clung
to
the
flank
of
the
herd
*punct* ,
retarding
its
march
*punct* ,
irritating
the
young
bulls
*punct* ,
worrying
the
cows
with
their
half-grown
calves
*punct* ,
and
driving
the
wounded
bull
mad
with
helpless
rage
*punct* .
*break*
for
half
a
day
this
continued
*punct* .
*break*
buck
multiplied
himself
*punct* ,
attacking
from
all
sides
*punct* ,
enveloping
the
herd
in
a
whirlwind
of
menace
*punct* ,
cutting
out
his
victim
as
fast
as
it
could
rejoin
its
mates
*punct* ,
wearing
out
the
patience
of
creatures
preyed
upon
*punct* ,
which
is
a
lesser
patience
than
that
of
creatures
preying
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
day
wore
along
and
the
sun
dropped
to
its
bed
in
the
northwest
*punct* ,
the
darkness
had
come
back
and
the
fall
nights
were
six
hours
long
*punct* ,
the
young
bulls
retraced
their
steps
more
and
more
reluctantly
to
the
aid
of
their
beset
leader
*punct* .
*break*
the
down-coming
winter
was
harrying
them
on
to
the
lower
levels
*punct* ,
and
it
seemed
they
could
never
shake
off
this
tireless
creature
that
held
them
back
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
it
was
not
the
life
of
the
herd
*punct* ,
or
of
the
young
bulls
*punct* ,
that
was
threatened
*punct* .
*break*
the
life
of
only
one
member
was
demanded
*punct* ,
which
was
a
remoter
interest
than
their
lives
*punct* ,
and
in
the
end
they
were
content
to
pay
the
toll
*punct* .
*break*
as
twilight
fell
the
old
bull
stood
with
lowered
head
*punct* ,
watching
his
mates
*punct* ,
the
cows
he
had
known
*punct* ,
the
calves
he
had
fathered
*punct* ,
the
bulls
he
had
mastered
*punct* ,
as
they
shambled
on
at
a
rapid
pace
through
the
fading
light
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
follow
*punct* ,
for
before
his
nose
leaped
the
merciless
fanged
terror
that
would
not
let
him
go
*punct* .
*break*
three
hundredweight
more
than
half
a
ton
he
weighed
*punct* ;
he
had
lived
a
long
*punct* ,
strong
life
*punct* ,
full
of
fight
and
struggle
*punct* ,
and
at
the
end
he
faced
death
at
the
teeth
of
a
creature
whose
head
did
not
reach
beyond
his
great
knuckled
knees
*punct* .
*break*
from
then
on
*punct* ,
night
and
day
*punct* ,
buck
never
left
his
prey
*punct* ,
never
gave
it
a
moment's
rest
*punct* ,
never
permitted
it
to
browse
the
leaves
of
trees
or
the
shoots
of
young
birch
and
willow
*punct* .
*break*
nor
did
he
give
the
wounded
bull
opportunity
to
slake
his
burning
thirst
in
the
slender
trickling
streams
they
crossed
*punct* .
*break*
often
*punct* ,
in
desperation
*punct* ,
he
burst
into
long
stretches
of
flight
*punct* .
*break*
at
such
times
buck
did
not
attempt
to
stay
him
*punct* ,
but
loped
easily
at
his
heels
*punct* ,
satisfied
with
the
way
the
game
was
played
*punct* ,
lying
down
when
the
moose
stood
still
*punct* ,
attacking
him
fiercely
when
he
strove
to
eat
or
drink
*punct* .
*break*
the
great
head
drooped
more
and
more
under
its
tree
of
horns
*punct* ,
and
the
shambling
trot
grew
weak
and
weaker
*punct* .
*break*
he
took
to
standing
for
long
periods
*punct* ,
with
nose
to
the
ground
and
dejected
ears
dropped
limply
*punct* ;
and
buck
found
more
time
in
which
to
get
water
for
himself
and
in
which
to
rest
*punct* .
*break*
at
such
moments
*punct* ,
panting
with
red
lolling
tongue
and
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
big
bull
*punct* ,
it
appeared
to
buck
that
a
change
was
coming
over
the
face
of
things
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
feel
a
new
stir
in
the
land
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
moose
were
coming
into
the
land
*punct* ,
other
kinds
of
life
were
coming
in
*punct* .
*break*
forest
and
stream
and
air
seemed
palpitant
with
their
presence
*punct* .
*break*
the
news
of
it
was
borne
in
upon
him
*punct* ,
not
by
sight
*punct* ,
or
sound
*punct* ,
or
smell
*punct* ,
but
by
some
other
and
subtler
sense
*punct* .
*break*
he
heard
nothing
*punct* ,
saw
nothing
*punct* ,
yet
knew
that
the
land
was
somehow
different
*punct* ;
that
through
it
strange
things
were
afoot
and
ranging
*punct* ;
and
he
resolved
to
investigate
after
he
had
finished
the
business
in
hand
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
at
the
end
of
the
fourth
day
*punct* ,
he
pulled
the
great
moose
down
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
day
and
a
night
he
remained
by
the
kill
*punct* ,
eating
and
sleeping
*punct* ,
turn
and
turn
about
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
rested
*punct* ,
refreshed
and
strong
*punct* ,
he
turned
his
face
toward
camp
and
john
thornton
*punct* .
*break*
he
broke
into
the
long
easy
lope
*punct* ,
and
went
on
*punct* ,
hour
after
hour
*punct* ,
never
at
loss
for
the
tangled
way
*punct* ,
heading
straight
home
through
strange
country
with
a
certitude
of
direction
that
put
man
and
his
magnetic
needle
to
shame
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
held
on
he
became
more
and
more
conscious
of
the
new
stir
in
the
land
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
life
abroad
in
it
different
from
the
life
which
had
been
there
throughout
the
summer
*punct* .
*break*
no
longer
was
this
fact
borne
in
upon
him
in
some
subtle
*punct* ,
mysterious
way
*punct* .
*break*
the
birds
talked
of
it
*punct* ,
the
squirrels
chattered
about
it
*punct* ,
the
very
breeze
whispered
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
several
times
he
stopped
and
drew
in
the
fresh
morning
air
in
great
sniffs
*punct* ,
reading
a
message
which
made
him
leap
on
with
greater
speed
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
oppressed
with
a
sense
of
calamity
happening
*punct* ,
if
it
were
not
calamity
already
happened
*punct* ;
and
as
he
crossed
the
last
watershed
and
dropped
down
into
the
valley
toward
camp
*punct* ,
he
proceeded
with
greater
caution
*punct* .
*break*
three
miles
away
he
came
upon
a
fresh
trail
that
sent
his
neck
hair
rippling
and
bristling
*punct* ,
it
led
straight
toward
camp
and
john
thornton
*punct* .
*break*
buck
hurried
on
*punct* ,
swiftly
and
stealthily
*punct* ,
every
nerve
straining
and
tense
*punct* ,
alert
to
the
multitudinous
details
which
told
a
story
*punct* ,
all
but
the
end
*punct* .
*break*
his
nose
gave
him
a
varying
description
of
the
passage
of
the
life
on
the
heels
of
which
he
was
travelling
*punct* .
*break*
he
remarked
die
pregnant
silence
of
the
forest
*punct* .
*break*
the
bird
life
had
flitted
*punct* .
*break*
the
squirrels
were
in
hiding
*punct* .
*break*
one
only
he
saw,
*punct* ,
a
sleek
gray
fellow
*punct* ,
flattened
against
a
gray
dead
limb
so
that
he
seemed
a
part
of
it
*punct* ,
a
woody
excrescence
upon
the
wood
itself
*punct* .
*break*
as
buck
slid
along
with
the
obscureness
of
a
gliding
shadow
*punct* ,
his
nose
was
jerked
suddenly
to
the
side
as
though
a
positive
force
had
gripped
and
pulled
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
followed
the
new
scent
into
a
thicket
and
found
nig
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
lying
on
his
side
*punct* ,
dead
where
he
had
dragged
himself
*punct* ,
an
arrow
protruding
*punct* ,
head
and
feathers
*punct* ,
from
either
side
of
his
body
*punct* .
*break*
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
*punct* ,
buck
came
upon
one
of
the
sled-dogs
thornton
had
bought
in
dawson
*punct* .
*break*
this
dog
was
thrashing
about
in
a
death-struggle
*punct* ,
directly
on
the
trail
*punct* ,
and
buck
passed
around
him
without
stopping
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
camp
came
the
faint
sound
of
many
voices
*punct* ,
rising
and
falling
in
a
sing-song
chant
*punct* .
*break*
bellying
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
clearing
*punct* ,
he
found
hans
*punct* ,
lying
on
his
face
*punct* ,
feathered
with
arrows
like
a
porcupine
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
same
instant
buck
peered
out
where
the
spruce-bough
lodge
had
been
and
saw
what
made
his
hair
leap
straight
up
on
his
neck
and
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
a
gust
of
overpowering
rage
swept
over
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
know
that
he
growled
*punct* ,
but
he
growled
aloud
with
a
terrible
ferocity
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
last
time
in
his
life
he
allowed
passion
to
usurp
cunning
and
reason
*punct* ,
and
it
was
because
of
his
great
love
for
john
thornton
that
he
lost
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
the
yeehats
were
dancing
about
the
wreckage
of
the
spruce-bough
lodge
when
they
heard
a
fearful
roaring
and
saw
rushing
upon
them
an
animal
the
like
of
which
they
had
never
seen
before
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
buck
*punct* ,
a
live
hurricane
of
fury
*punct* ,
hurling
himself
upon
them
in
a
frenzy
to
destroy
*punct* .
*break*
he
sprang
at
the
foremost
man
*punct* ,
it
was
the
chief
of
the
yeehats
*punct* ,
ripping
the
throat
wide
open
till
the
rent
jugular
spouted
a
fountain
of
blood
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
pause
to
worry
the
victim
*punct* ,
but
ripped
in
passing
*punct* ,
with
the
next
bound
tearing
wide
the
throat
of
a
second
man
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
withstanding
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
plunged
about
in
their
very
midst
*punct* ,
tearing
*punct* ,
rending
*punct* ,
destroying
*punct* ,
in
constant
and
terrific
motion
which
defied
the
arrows
they
discharged
at
him
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
so
inconceivably
rapid
were
his
movements
*punct* ,
and
so
closely
were
the
indians
tangled
together
*punct* ,
that
they
shot
one
another
with
the
arrows
*punct* ;
and
one
young
hunter
*punct* ,
hurling
a
spear
at
buck
in
mid
air
*punct* ,
drove
it
through
the
chest
of
another
hunter
with
such
force
that
the
point
broke
through
the
skin
of
the
back
and
stood
out
beyond
*punct* .
*break*
then
a
panic
seized
the
yeehats
*punct* ,
and
they
fled
in
terror
to
the
woods
*punct* ,
proclaiming
as
they
fled
the
advent
of
the
evil
spirit
*punct* .
*break*
and
truly
buck
was
the
fiend
incarnate
*punct* ,
raging
at
their
heels
and
dragging
them
down
like
deer
as
they
raced
through
the
trees
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
fateful
day
for
the
yeehats
*punct* .
*break*
they
scattered
far
and
wide
over
the
country
*punct* ,
and
it
was
not
till
a
week
later
that
the
last
of
the
survivors
gathered
together
in
a
lower
valley
and
counted
their
losses
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
buck
*punct* ,
wearying
of
the
pursuit
*punct* ,
he
returned
to
the
desolated
camp
*punct* .
*break*
he
found
pete
where
he
had
been
killed
in
his
blankets
in
the
first
moment
of
surprise
*punct* .
*break*
thornton's
desperate
struggle
was
fresh-written
on
the
earth
*punct* ,
and
buck
scented
every
detail
of
it
down
to
the
edge
of
a
deep
pool
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
edge
*punct* ,
head
and
fore
feet
in
the
water
*punct* ,
lay
skeet
*punct* ,
faithful
to
the
last
*punct* .
*break*
the
pool
itself
*punct* ,
muddy
and
discolored
from
the
sluice
boxes
*punct* ,
effectually
hid
what
it
contained
*punct* ,
and
it
contained
john
thornton
*punct* ;
for
buck
followed
his
trace
into
the
water
*punct* ,
from
which
no
trace
led
away
*punct* .
*break*
all
day
buck
brooded
by
the
pool
or
roamed
restlessly
about
the
camp
*punct* .
*break*
death
*punct* ,
as
a
cessation
of
movement
*punct* ,
as
a
passing
out
and
away
from
the
lives
of
the
living
*punct* ,
he
knew
*punct* ,
and
he
knew
john
thornton
was
dead
*punct* .
*break*
it
left
a
great
void
in
him
*punct* ,
somewhat
akin
to
hunger
*punct* ,
but
a
void
which
ached
and
ached
*punct* ,
and
which
food
could
not
fill
*punct* ,
at
times
*punct* ,
when
he
paused
to
contemplate
the
carcasses
of
the
yeehats
*punct* ,
he
forgot
the
pain
of
it
*punct* ;
and
at
such
times
he
was
aware
of
a
great
pride
in
himself,
*punct* ,
a
pride
greater
than
any
he
had
yet
experienced
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
killed
man
*punct* ,
the
noblest
game
of
all
*punct* ,
and
he
had
killed
in
the
face
of
the
law
of
club
and
fang
*punct* .
*break*
he
sniffed
the
bodies
curiously
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
died
so
easily
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
harder
to
kill
a
husky
dog
than
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
no
match
at
all
*punct* ,
were
it
not
for
their
arrows
and
spears
and
clubs
*punct* .
*break*
thenceforward
he
would
be
unafraid
of
them
except
when
they
bore
in
their
hands
their
arrows
*punct* ,
spears
*punct* ,
and
clubs
*punct* .
*break*
night
came
on
*punct* ,
and
a
full
moon
rose
high
over
the
trees
into
the
sky
*punct* ,
lighting
the
land
till
it
lay
bathed
in
ghostly
day
*punct* .
*break*
and
with
the
coming
of
the
night
*punct* ,
brooding
and
mourning
by
the
pool
*punct* ,
buck
became
alive
to
a
stirring
of
the
new
life
in
the
forest
other
than
that
which
the
yeehats
had
made
*punct* ,
he
stood
up
*punct* ,
listening
and
scenting
*punct* .
*break*
from
far
away
drifted
a
faint
*punct* ,
sharp
yelp
*punct* ,
followed
by
a
chorus
of
similar
sharp
yelps
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
moments
passed
the
yelps
grew
closer
and
louder
*punct* .
*break*
again
buck
knew
them
as
things
heard
in
that
other
world
which
persisted
in
his
memory
*punct* .
*break*
he
walked
to
the
centre
of
the
open
space
and
listened
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
call
*punct* ,
the
many
*punct* -
noted
call
*punct* ,
sounding
more
luringly
and
compellingly
than
ever
before
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
never
before
*punct* ,
he
was
ready
to
obey
*punct* .
*break*
john
thornton
was
dead
*punct* .
*break*
the
last
tie
was
broken
*punct* .
*break*
man
and
the
claims
of
man
no
longer
bound
him
*punct* .
*break*
hunting
their
living
meat
*punct* ,
as
the
yeehats
were
hunting
it
*punct* ,
on
the
flanks
of
the
migrating
moose
*punct* ,
the
wolf
pack
had
at
last
crossed
over
from
the
land
of
streams
and
timber
and
invaded
buck's
valley
*punct* .
*break*
into
the
clearing
where
the
moonlight
streamed
*punct* ,
they
poured
in
a
silvery
flood
*punct* ;
and
in
the
centre
of
the
clearing
stood
buck
*punct* ,
motionless
as
a
statue
*punct* ,
waiting
their
coming
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
awed
*punct* ,
so
still
and
large
he
stood
*punct* ,
and
a
moment's
pause
fell
*punct* ,
till
the
boldest
one
leaped
straight
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
like
a
flash
buck
struck
*punct* ,
breaking
the
neck
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
stood
*punct* ,
without
movement
*punct* ,
as
before
*punct* ,
the
stricken
wolf
rolling
in
agony
behind
him
*punct* .
*break*
three
others
tried
it
in
sharp
succession
*punct* ;
and
one
after
the
other
they
drew
back
*punct* ,
streaming
blood
from
slashed
throats
or
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
sufficient
to
fling
the
whole
pack
forward
*punct* ,
pell-mell
*punct* ,
crowded
together
*punct* ,
blocked
and
confused
by
its
eagerness
to
pull
down
the
prey
*punct* .
*break*
buck's
marvellous
quickness
and
agility
stood
him
in
good
stead
*punct* .
*break*
pivoting
on
his
hind
legs
*punct* ,
and
snapping
and
gashing
*punct* ,
he
was
everywhere
at
once
*punct* ,
presenting
a
front
which
was
apparently
unbroken
so
swiftly
did
he
whirl
and
guard
from
side
to
side
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
prevent
them
from
getting
behind
him
*punct* ,
he
was
forced
back
*punct* ,
down
past
the
pool
and
into
the
creek
bed
*punct* ,
till
he
brought
up
against
a
high
gravel
bank
*punct* .
*break*
he
worked
along
to
a
right
angle
in
the
bank
which
the
men
had
made
in
the
course
of
mining
*punct* ,
and
in
this
angle
he
came
to
bay
*punct* ,
protected
on
three
sides
and
with
nothing
to
do
but
face
the
front
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
well
did
he
face
it
*punct* ,
that
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
wolves
drew
back
discomfited
*punct* .
*break*
the
tongues
of
all
were
out
and
lolling
*punct* ,
the
white
fangs
showing
cruelly
white
in
the
moonlight
*punct* .
*break*
some
were
lying
down
with
heads
ra
ised
and
ears
pricked
forward
*punct* ;
others
stood
on
their
feet
*punct* ,
watching
him
*punct* ;
and
still
others
were
lapping
water
from
the
pool
*punct* .
*break*
one
wolf
*punct* ,
long
and
lean
and
gray
*punct* ,
advanced
cautiously
*punct* ,
in
a
friendly
manner
*punct* ,
and
buck
recognized
the
wild
brother
with
whom
he
had
run
for
a
night
and
a
day
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
whining
softly
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
buck
whined
*punct* ,
they
touched
noses
*punct* .
*break*
then
an
old
wolf
*punct* ,
gaunt
and
battle-scarred
*punct* ,
came
forward
*punct* .
*break*
buck
writhed
his
lips
into
the
preliminary
of
a
snarl
*punct* ,
but
sniffed
noses
with
him
*punct* ,
whereupon
the
old
wolf
sat
down
*punct* ,
pointed
nose
at
the
moon
*punct* ,
and
broke
out
the
long
wolf
howl
*punct* .
*break*
the
others
sat
down
and
howled
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
the
call
came
to
buck
in
unmistakable
accents
*punct* .
*break*
he
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
sat
down
and
howled
*punct* .
*break*
this
over
*punct* ,
he
came
out
of
his
angle
and
the
pack
crowded
around
him
*punct* ,
sniffing
in
half
*punct* -
friendly
*punct* ,
half-savage
manner
*punct* .
*break*
the
leaders
lifted
the
yelp
of
the
pack
and
sprang
away
into
the
woods
*punct* .
*break*
the
wolves
swung
in
behind
*punct* ,
yelping
in
chorus
*punct* .
*break*
and
buck
ran
with
them
*punct* ,
side
by
side
with
the
wild
brother
*punct* ,
yelping
as
he
ran
*punct* .
*break*
the
years
were
not
many
when
the
yeehats
noted
a
change
in
the
breed
of
timber
wolves
*punct* ;
for
some
were
seen
with
splashes
of
brown
on
head
and
muzzle
*punct* ,
and
with
a
rift
of
white
centring
down
the
chest
*punct* .
*break*
but
more
remarkable
than
this
*punct* ,
the
yeehats
tell
of
a
ghost
dog
that
runs
at
the
head
of
the
pack
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
afraid
of
this
ghost
dog
*punct* ,
for
it
has
cunning
greater
than
they
*punct* ,
stealing
from
their
camps
in
fierce
winters
*punct* ,
robbing
their
traps
*punct* ,
slaying
their
dogs
*punct* ,
and
defying
their
bravest
hunters
*punct* .
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
the
tale
grows
worse
*punct* .
*break*
hunters
there
are
who
fail
to
return
to
the
camp
*punct* ,
and
hunters
there
have
been
whom
their
tribesmen
found
with
throats
slashed
cruelly
open
and
with
wolf
prints
about
them
in
the
snow
greater
than
the
prints
of
any
wolf
*punct* .
*break*
each
fall
*punct* ,
when
the
yeehats
follow
the
movement
of
the
moose
*punct* ,
there
is
a
certain
valley
which
they
never
enter
*punct* .
*break*
and
women
there
are
who
become
sad
when
the
word
goes
over
the
fire
of
how
the
evil
spirit
came
to
select
that
valley
for
an
abiding-place
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
summers
there
is
one
visitor
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
to
that
valley
*punct* ,
of
which
the
yeehats
do
not
know
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
great
*punct* ,
gloriously
coated
wolf
*punct* ,
like
*punct* ,
and
yet
unlike
*punct* ,
all
other
wolves
*punct* .
*break*
he
crosses
alone
from
the
smiling
timber
land
and
comes
down
into
an
open
space
among
the
trees
*punct* .
*break*
here
a
yellow
stream
flows
from
rotted
moose
*punct* -
hide
sacks
and
sinks
into
the
ground
*punct* ,
with
long
grasses
growing
through
it
and
vegetable
mould
overrunning
it
and
hiding
its
yellow
from
the
sun
*punct* ;
and
here
he
muses
for
a
time
*punct* ,
howling
once
*punct* ,
long
and
mournfully
*punct* ,
ere
he
departs
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
is
not
always
alone
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
long
winter
nights
come
on
and
the
wolves
follow
their
meat
into
the
lower
valleys
*punct* ,
he
may
be
seen
running
at
the
head
of
the
pack
through
the
pale
moonlight
or
glimmering
borealis
*punct* ,
leaping
gigantic
above
his
fellows
*punct* ,
his
great
throat
a-bellow
as
he
sings
a
song
of
the
younger
world
*punct* ,
which
is
the
song
of
the
pack
*punct* .
*break*
