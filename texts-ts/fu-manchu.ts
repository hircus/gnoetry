Title: The Insidious Dr. Fu Manchu
Author: Sax Rohmer
a
gentleman
to
see
you
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* .
*break*
from
across
the
common
a
clock
sounded
the
half-hour
*punct* .
*break*
a
late
visitor
*punct* .
*break*
show
him
up
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* .
*break*
i
pushed
my
writing
aside
and
tilted
the
lamp-shade
*punct* ,
as
footsteps
sounded
on
the
landing
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
moment
i
had
jumped
to
my
feet
*punct* ,
for
a
tall
*punct* ,
lean
man
*punct* ,
with
his
square-cut
*punct* ,
clean-shaven
face
sun-baked
to
the
hue
of
coffee
*punct* ,
entered
and
extended
both
hands
*punct* ,
with
a
cry
*punct* :
good
old
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
didn't
expect
me
*punct* ,
i'll
swear
*punct* !
*break*
it
was
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
whom
i
had
thought
to
be
in
burma
*punct* !
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
and
gripped
his
hands
hard
*punct* ,
this
is
a
delightful
surprise
*punct* !
*break*
whatever
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
excuse
me
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
he
broke
in
*punct* .
*break*
don't
put
it
down
to
the
sun
*punct* !
*break*
and
he
put
out
the
lamp
*punct* ,
plunging
the
room
into
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
too
surprised
to
speak
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
you
will
think
me
mad
*punct* ,
he
continued
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
dimly
*punct* ,
i
could
see
him
at
the
window
*punct* ,
peering
out
into
the
road
*punct* ,
but
before
you
are
many
hours
older
you
will
know
that
i
have
good
reason
to
be
cautious
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
nothing
suspicious
*punct* !
*break*
perhaps
i
am
first
this
time
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
stepping
back
to
the
writing-table
he
relighted
the
lamp
*punct* .
*break*
mysterious
enough
for
you
*punct* ?
*break*
he
laughed
*punct* ,
and
glanced
at
my
unfinished
ms.
a
story
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
from
which
i
gather
that
the
district
is
beastly
healthy
*punct* ,
what
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
i
can
put
some
material
in
your
way
that
*punct* ,
if
sheer
uncanny
mystery
is
a
marketable
commodity
*punct* ,
ought
to
make
you
independent
of
influenza
and
broken
legs
and
shattered
nerves
and
all
the
rest
*punct* .
*break*
i
surveyed
him
doubtfully
*punct* ,
but
there
was
nothing
in
his
appearance
to
justify
me
in
supposing
him
to
suffer
from
delusions
*punct* .
*break*
his
eyes
were
too
bright
*punct* ,
certainly
*punct* ,
and
a
hardness
now
had
crept
over
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
i
got
out
the
whisky
and
siphon
*punct* ,
saying
*punct* :
you
have
taken
your
leave
early
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
not
on
leave
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
and
slowly
filled
his
pipe
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
on
duty
*punct* .
*break*
what
*punct* ,
are
you
moved
to
london
or
something
*punct* ?
*break*
i
have
got
a
roving
commission
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
and
it
doesn't
rest
with
me
where
i
am
to-day
nor
where
i
shall
be
to-morrow
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
something
ominous
in
the
words
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
putting
down
my
glass
*punct* ,
its
contents
untasted
*punct* ,
i
faced
round
and
looked
him
squarely
in
the
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
out
with
it
*punct* !
*break*
what
is
it
all
about
*punct* ?
*break*
smith
suddenly
stood
up
and
stripped
off
his
coat
*punct* .
*break*
rolling
back
his
left
shirt-sleeve
he
revealed
a
wicked-looking
wound
in
the
fleshy
part
of
the
forearm
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
quite
healed
*punct* ,
but
curiously
striated
for
an
inch
or
so
around
*punct* .
*break*
ever
seen
one
like
it
*punct* ?
*break*
not
exactly
*punct* ,
i
confessed
*punct* .
*break*
it
appears
to
have
been
deeply
cauterized
*punct* .
*break*
a
barb
steeped
in
the
venom
of
a
hamadryad
went
in
there
*punct* !
*break*
a
shudder
i
could
not
repress
ran
coldly
through
me
at
mention
of
that
most
deadly
of
all
the
reptiles
of
the
east
*punct* .
*break*
there's
only
one
treatment
*punct* ,
he
continued
*punct* ,
rolling
his
sleeve
down
again
*punct* ,
and
that's
with
a
sharp
knife
*punct* ,
a
match
*punct* ,
and
a
broken
cartridge
*punct* .
*break*
i
lay
on
my
back
*punct* ,
raving
*punct* ,
for
three
days
afterwards
*punct* ,
in
a
forest
that
stank
with
malaria
*punct* ,
but
i
should
have
been
lying
there
now
if
i
had
hesitated
*punct* .
*break*
here's
the
point
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
an
accident
*punct* !
*break*
what
do
you
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
i
mean
that
it
was
a
deliberate
attempt
on
my
life
*punct* ,
and
i
am
hard
upon
the
tracks
of
the
man
who
extracted
that
venom
*punct* ,
patiently
*punct* ,
drop
by
drop
*punct* ,
from
the
poison-glands
of
the
snake
*punct* ,
who
prepared
that
arrow
*punct* ,
and
who
caused
it
to
be
shot
at
me
*punct* .
*break*
what
fiend
is
this
*punct* ?
*break*
a
fiend
who
*punct* ,
unless
my
calculations
are
at
fault
is
now
in
london
*punct* ,
and
who
regularly
wars
with
pleasant
weapons
of
that
kind
*punct* .
*break*
petrie
*punct* ,
i
have
traveled
from
burma
not
in
the
interests
of
the
british
government
merely
*punct* ,
but
in
the
interests
of
the
entire
white
race
*punct* ,
and
i
honestly
believe
*punct* ,
though
i
pray
i
may
be
wrong
*punct* ,
that
its
survival
depends
largely
upon
the
success
of
my
mission
*punct* .
*break*
to
say
that
i
was
perplexed
conveys
no
idea
of
the
mental
chaos
created
by
these
extraordinary
statements
*punct* ,
for
into
my
humdrum
suburban
life
nayland
smith
had
brought
fantasy
of
the
wildest
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
not
know
what
to
think
*punct* ,
what
to
believe
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
wasting
precious
time
*punct* !
*break*
he
rapped
decisively
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
draining
his
glass
*punct* ,
he
stood
up
*punct* .
*break*
i
came
straight
to
you
*punct* ,
because
you
are
the
only
man
i
dare
to
trust
*punct* .
*break*
except
the
big
chief
at
headquarters
*punct* ,
you
are
the
only
person
in
england
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ,
who
knows
that
nayland
smith
has
quitted
burma
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
have
someone
with
me
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
all
the
time
*punct* ,
it's
imperative
*punct* !
*break*
can
you
put
me
up
here
*punct* ,
and
spare
a
few
days
to
the
strangest
business
*punct* ,
i
promise
you
*punct* ,
that
ever
was
recorded
in
fact
or
fiction
*punct* ?
*break*
i
agreed
readily
enough
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
unfortunately
*punct* ,
my
professional
duties
were
not
onerous
*punct* .
*break*
he
cried
*punct* ,
wringing
my
hand
in
his
impetuous
way
*punct* .
*break*
we
start
now
*punct* .
*break*
what
*punct* ,
to-night
*punct* ?
*break*
i
had
thought
of
turning
in
*punct* ,
i
must
admit
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
not
dared
to
sleep
for
forty-eight
hours
*punct* ,
except
in
fifteen-minute
stretches
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
is
one
move
that
must
be
made
to-night
and
immediately
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
warn
sir
crichton
davey
*punct* .
*break*
sir
crichton
davey
*punct* ,
of
the
india
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
he
is
a
doomed
man
*punct* !
*break*
unless
he
follows
my
instructions
without
question
*punct* ,
without
hesitation
*punct* ,
before
heaven
*punct* ,
nothing
can
save
him
*punct* !
*break*
i
do
not
know
when
the
blow
will
fall
*punct* ,
how
it
will
fall
*punct* ,
nor
from
whence
*punct* ,
but
i
know
that
my
*punct* ,
first
duty
is
to
warn
him
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
walk
down
to
the
corner
of
the
common
and
get
a
taxi
*punct* .
*break*
how
strangely
does
the
adventurous
intrude
upon
the
humdrum
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
when
it
intrudes
at
all
*punct* ,
more
often
than
not
its
intrusion
is
sudden
and
unlooked
for
*punct* .
*break*
to-day
*punct* ,
we
may
seek
for
romance
and
fail
to
find
it
*punct* :
unsought
*punct* ,
it
lies
in
wait
for
us
at
most
prosaic
corners
of
life's
highway
*punct* .
*break*
the
drive
that
night
*punct* ,
though
it
divided
the
drably
commonplace
from
the
wildly
bizarre
*punct* ,
though
it
was
the
bridge
between
the
ordinary
and
the
outre
*punct* ,
has
left
no
impression
upon
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
into
the
heart
of
a
weird
mystery
the
cab
bore
me
*punct* ;
and
in
reviewing
my
memories
of
those
days
i
wonder
that
the
busy
thoroughfares
through
which
we
passed
did
not
display
before
my
eyes
signs
and
portents
*punct* ,
warnings
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
so
*punct* .
*break*
i
recall
nothing
of
the
route
and
little
of
import
that
passed
between
us
*punct* ,
we
both
were
strangely
silent
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
until
we
were
come
to
our
journey's
end
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* :
what's
this
*punct* ?
*break*
muttered
my
friend
hoarsely
*punct* .
*break*
constables
were
moving
on
a
little
crowd
of
curious
idlers
who
pressed
about
the
steps
of
sir
crichton
davey's
house
and
sought
to
peer
in
at
the
open
door
*punct* .
*break*
without
waiting
for
the
cab
to
draw
up
to
the
curb
*punct* ,
nayland
smith
recklessly
leaped
out
and
i
followed
close
at
his
heels
*punct* .
*break*
what
has
happened
*punct* ?
*break*
he
demanded
breathlessly
of
a
constable
*punct* .
*break*
the
latter
glanced
at
him
doubtfully
*punct* ,
but
something
in
his
voice
and
bearing
commanded
respect
*punct* .
*break*
sir
crichton
davey
has
been
killed
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
smith
lurched
back
as
though
he
had
received
a
physical
blow
*punct* ,
and
clutched
my
shoulder
convulsively
*punct* .
*break*
beneath
the
heavy
tan
his
face
had
blanched
*punct* ,
and
his
eyes
were
set
in
a
stare
of
horror
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
too
late
*punct* !
*break*
with
clenched
fists
he
turned
and
*punct* ,
pressing
through
the
group
of
loungers
*punct* ,
bounded
up
the
steps
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
hall
a
man
who
unmistakably
was
a
scotland
yard
official
stood
talking
to
a
footman
*punct* .
*break*
other
members
of
the
household
were
moving
about
*punct* ,
more
or
less
aimlessly
*punct* ,
and
the
chilly
hand
of
king
fear
had
touched
one
and
all
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
as
they
came
and
went
*punct* ,
they
glanced
ever
over
their
shoulders
*punct* ,
as
if
each
shadow
cloaked
a
menace
*punct* ,
and
listened
*punct* ,
as
it
seemed
*punct* ,
for
some
sound
which
they
dreaded
to
hear
*punct* .
*break*
smith
strode
up
to
the
detective
and
showed
him
a
card
*punct* ,
upon
glancing
at
which
the
scotland
yard
man
said
something
in
a
low
voice
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
nodding
*punct* ,
touched
his
hat
to
smith
in
a
respectful
manner
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
brief
questions
and
answers
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
gloomy
silence
*punct* ,
we
followed
the
detective
up
the
heavily
carpeted
stair
*punct* ,
along
a
corridor
lined
with
pictures
and
busts
*punct* ,
and
into
a
large
library
*punct* .
*break*
a
group
of
people
were
in
this
room
*punct* ,
and
one
*punct* ,
in
whom
i
recognized
chalmers
cleeve
*punct* ,
of
harley
street
*punct* ,
was
bending
over
a
motionless
form
stretched
upon
a
couch
*punct* .
*break*
another
door
communicated
with
a
small
study
*punct* ,
and
through
the
opening
i
could
see
a
man
on
all
fours
examining
the
carpet
*punct* .
*break*
the
uncomfortable
sense
of
hush
*punct* ,
the
group
about
the
physician
*punct* ,
the
bizarre
figure
crawling
*punct* ,
beetle-like
*punct* ,
across
the
inner
room
*punct* ,
and
the
grim
hub
*punct* ,
around
which
all
this
ominous
activity
turned
*punct* ,
made
up
a
scene
that
etched
itself
indelibly
on
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
entered
dr.
cleeve
straightened
himself
*punct* ,
frowning
thoughtfully
*punct* .
*break*
frankly
*punct* ,
i
do
not
care
to
venture
any
opinion
at
present
regarding
the
immediate
cause
of
death
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
sir
crichton
was
addicted
to
cocaine
*punct* ,
but
there
are
indications
which
are
not
in
accordance
with
cocaine-poisoning
*punct* .
*break*
i
fear
that
only
a
post-mortem
can
establish
the
facts
*punct* ,
if
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* ,
we
ever
arrive
at
them
*punct* .
*break*
a
most
mysterious
case
*punct* !
*break*
smith
stepping
forward
and
engaging
the
famous
pathologist
in
conversation
*punct* ,
i
seized
the
opportunity
to
examine
sir
crichton's
body
*punct* .
*break*
the
dead
man
was
in
evening
dress
*punct* ,
but
wore
an
old
smoking-jacket
*punct* .
*break*
he
lad
been
of
spare
but
hardy
build
*punct* ,
with
thin
*punct* ,
aquiline
features
*punct* ,
which
now
were
oddly
puffy
*punct* ,
as
were
his
clenched
hands
*punct* .
*break*
i
pushed
back
his
sleeve
*punct* ,
and
saw
the
marks
of
the
hypodermic
syringe
upon
his
left
arm
*punct* .
*break*
quite
mechanically
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
right
arm
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
unscarred
*punct* ,
but
on
the
back
of
the
hand
was
a
faint
red
mark
*punct* ,
not
unlike
the
imprint
of
painted
lips
*punct* .
*break*
i
examined
it
closely
*punct* ,
and
even
tried
to
rub
it
off
*punct* ,
but
it
evidently
was
caused
by
some
morbid
process
of
local
inflammation
*punct* ,
if
it
were
not
a
birthmark
*punct* .
*break*
turning
to
a
pale
young
man
whom
i
had
understood
to
be
sir
crichton's
private
secretary
*punct* ,
i
drew
his
attention
to
this
mark
*punct* ,
and
inquired
if
it
were
constitutional
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
answered
dr.
cleeve
*punct* ,
overhearing
my
question
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
already
made
that
inquiry
*punct* .
*break*
does
it
suggest
anything
to
your
mind
*punct* ?
*break*
i
must
confess
that
it
affords
me
no
assistance
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
most
curious
*punct* .
*break*
excuse
me
*punct* ,
mr.
burboyne
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* ,
now
turning
to
the
secretary
*punct* ,
but
inspector
weymouth
will
tell
you
that
i
act
with
authority
*punct* .
*break*
i
understand
that
sir
crichton
was
*punct* ,
seized
with
*punct* ,
illness
in
his
study
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
at
half-past
ten
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
working
here
in
the
library
*punct* ,
and
he
inside
*punct* ,
as
was
our
custom
*punct* .
*break*
the
communicating
door
was
kept
closed
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
always
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
open
for
a
minute
or
less
about
ten-twenty-five
*punct* ,
when
a
message
came
for
sir
crichton
*punct* .
*break*
i
took
it
in
to
him
*punct* ,
and
he
then
seemed
in
his
usual
health
*punct* .
*break*
what
was
the
message
*punct* ?
*break*
i
could
not
say
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
brought
by
a
district
messenger
*punct* ,
and
he
placed
it
beside
him
on
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
there
now
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
and
at
half-past
ten
*punct* ?
*break*
sir
crichton
suddenly
burst
open
the
door
and
threw
himself
*punct* ,
with
a
scream
*punct* ,
into
the
library
*punct* .
*break*
i
ran
to
him
but
he
waved
me
back
*punct* .
*break*
his
eyes
were
glaring
horribly
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
just
reached
his
side
when
he
fell
*punct* ,
writhing
*punct* ,
upon
the
floor
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
past
speech
*punct* ,
but
as
i
raised
him
and
laid
him
upon
the
couch
*punct* ,
he
gasped
something
that
sounded
like
the
red
hand
*punct* !
*break*
before
i
could
get
to
bell
or
telephone
he
was
dead
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
burboyne's
voice
shook
as
he
spoke
the
words
*punct* ,
and
smith
seemed
to
find
this
evidence
confusing
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
not
think
he
referred
to
the
mark
on
his
own
hand
*punct* ?
*break*
i
think
not
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
direction
of
his
last
glance
*punct* ,
i
feel
sure
he
referred
to
something
in
the
study
*punct* .
*break*
what
did
you
do
*punct* ?
*break*
having
summoned
the
servants
*punct* ,
i
ran
into
the
study
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
was
absolutely
nothing
unusual
to
be
seen
*punct* .
*break*
the
windows
were
closed
and
fastened
*punct* .
*break*
he
worked
with
closed
windows
in
the
hottest
weather
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
other
door
*punct* ,
for
the
study
occupies
the
end
of
a
narrow
wing
*punct* ,
so
that
no
one
could
possibly
have
gained
access
to
it
*punct* ,
whilst
i
was
in
the
library
*punct* ,
unseen
by
me
*punct* .
*break*
had
someone
concealed
himself
in
the
study
earlier
in
the
evening
*punct* ,
and
i
am
convinced
that
it
offers
no
hiding-place
*punct* ,
he
could
only
have
come
out
again
by
passing
through
here
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
tugged
at
the
lobe
of
his
left
ear
*punct* ,
as
was
his
habit
when
meditating
*punct* .
*break*
you
had
been
at
work
here
in
this
way
for
some
time
*punct* ?
*break*
sir
crichton
was
preparing
an
important
book
*punct* .
*break*
had
anything
unusual
occurred
prior
to
this
evening
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
mr.
burboyne
*punct* ,
with
evident
perplexity
*punct* ;
though
i
attached
no
importance
to
it
at
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
three
nights
ago
sir
crichton
came
out
to
me
*punct* ,
and
appeared
very
nervous
*punct* ;
but
at
times
his
nerves
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
on
this
occasion
he
asked
me
to
search
the
study
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
an
idea
that
something
was
concealed
there
*punct* .
*break*
some
thing
or
someone
*punct* ?
*break*
something
was
the
word
he
used
*punct* .
*break*
i
searched
*punct* ,
but
fruitlessly
*punct* ,
and
he
seemed
quite
satisfied
*punct* ,
and
returned
to
his
work
*punct* .
*break*
thank
you
*punct* ,
mr.
burboyne
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend
and
i
would
like
a
few
minutes
private
investigation
in
the
study
*punct* .
*break*
sir
crichton
davey's
study
was
a
small
one
*punct* ,
and
a
glance
sufficed
to
show
that
*punct* ,
as
the
secretary
had
said
*punct* ,
it
offered
no
hiding-place
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
heavily
carpeted
*punct* ,
and
over-full
of
burmese
and
chinese
ornaments
and
curios
*punct* ,
and
upon
the
mantelpiece
stood
several
framed
photographs
which
showed
this
to
be
the
sanctum
of
a
wealthy
bachelor
who
was
no
misogynist
*punct* .
*break*
a
map
of
the
indian
empire
occupied
the
larger
part
of
one
wall
*punct* .
*break*
the
grate
was
empty
*punct* ,
for
the
weather
was
extremely
warm
*punct* ,
and
a
green-shaded
lamp
on
the
littered
writing-table
afforded
the
only
light
*punct* .
*break*
the
air
was
stale
*punct* ,
for
both
windows
were
closed
and
fastened
*punct* .
*break*
smith
immediately
pounced
upon
a
large
*punct* ,
square
envelope
that
lay
beside
the
blotting-pad
*punct* .
*break*
sir
crichton
had
not
even
troubled
to
open
it
*punct* ,
but
my
friend
did
so
*punct* .
*break*
it
contained
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
*punct* !
*break*
he
directed
*punct* ,
handing
the
letter
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
raised
it
to
my
nostrils
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
scented
with
some
pungent
perfume
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
it
is
a
rather
rare
essential
oil
*punct* ,
was
the
reply
*punct* ,
which
i
have
met
with
before
*punct* ,
though
never
in
europe
*punct* .
*break*
i
begin
to
understand
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
he
tilted
the
lamp-shade
and
made
a
close
examination
of
the
scraps
of
paper
*punct* ,
matches
*punct* ,
and
other
debris
that
lay
in
the
grate
and
on
the
hearth
*punct* .
*break*
i
took
up
a
copper
vase
from
the
mantelpiece
*punct* ,
and
was
examining
it
curiously
*punct* ,
when
he
turned
*punct* ,
a
strange
expression
upon
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
put
that
back
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ,
he
said
quietly
*punct* .
*break*
much
surprised
*punct* ,
i
did
as
he
directed
*punct* .
*break*
don't
touch
anything
in
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
he
dangerous
*punct* .
*break*
something
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
chilled
me
*punct* ,
and
i
hastily
replaced
the
vase
*punct* ,
and
stood
by
the
door
of
the
study
*punct* ,
watching
him
search
*punct* ,
methodically
*punct* ,
every
inch
of
the
room
*punct* ,
behind
the
books
*punct* ,
in
all
the
ornaments
*punct* ,
in
table
drawers
*punct* ,
in
cupboards
*punct* ,
on
shelves
*punct* .
*break*
that
will
do
*punct* ,
he
said
at
last
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
nothing
here
and
i
have
no
time
to
search
farther
*punct* .
*break*
we
returned
to
the
library
*punct* .
*break*
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ,
said
my
friend
*punct* ,
i
have
a
particular
reason
for
asking
that
sir
crichton's
body
be
removed
from
this
room
at
once
and
the
library
locked
*punct* .
*break*
let
no
one
be
admitted
on
any
pretense
whatever
until
you
hear
from
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
spoke
volumes
for
the
mysterious
credentials
borne
by
my
friend
that
the
man
from
scotland
yard
accepted
his
orders
without
demur
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
after
a
brief
chat
with
mr.
burboyne
*punct* ,
smith
passed
briskly
downstairs
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
hall
a
man
who
looked
like
a
groom
out
of
livery
was
waiting
*punct* .
*break*
are
you
wills
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
you
who
heard
a
cry
of
some
kind
at
the
rear
of
the
house
about
the
time
of
sir
crichton's
death
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
locking
the
garage
door
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
happening
to
look
up
at
the
window
of
sir
crichton's
study
*punct* ,
i
saw
him
jump
out
of
his
chair
*punct* .
*break*
where
he
used
to
sit
at
his
writing
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
you
could
see
his
shadow
on
the
blind
*punct* .
*break*
next
minute
i
heard
a
call
out
in
the
lane
*punct* .
*break*
what
kind
of
call
*punct* ?
*break*
the
man
*punct* ,
whom
the
uncanny
happening
clearly
had
frightened
*punct* ,
seemed
puzzled
for
a
suitable
description
*punct* .
*break*
a
sort
of
wail
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
he
said
at
last
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
heard
anything
like
it
before
*punct* ,
and
don't
want
to
again
*punct* .
*break*
inquired
smith
*punct* ,
and
he
uttered
a
low
*punct* ,
wailing
cry
*punct* ,
impossible
to
describe
*punct* .
*break*
wills
perceptibly
shuddered
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
it
was
an
eerie
sound
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
but
much
louder
*punct* .
*break*
that
will
do
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* ,
and
i
thought
i
detected
a
note
of
triumph
in
his
voice
*punct* .
*break*
take
us
through
to
the
back
of
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
bowed
and
led
the
way
*punct* ,
so
that
shortly
we
found
ourselves
in
a
small
*punct* ,
paved
courtyard
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
perfect
summer's
night
*punct* ,
and
the
deep
blue
vault
above
was
jeweled
with
myriads
of
starry
points
*punct* .
*break*
how
impossible
it
seemed
to
reconcile
that
vast
*punct* ,
eternal
calm
with
the
hideous
passions
and
fiendish
agencies
which
that
night
had
loosed
a
soul
upon
the
infinite
*punct* .
*break*
up
yonder
are
the
study
windows
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
over
that
wall
on
your
left
is
the
back
lane
from
which
the
cry
came
*punct* ,
and
beyond
is
regent's
park
*punct* .
*break*
are
the
study
windows
visible
from
there
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
who
occupies
the
adjoining
house
*punct* ?
*break*
major-general
platt-houston
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
but
the
family
is
out
of
town
*punct* .
*break*
those
iron
stairs
are
a
means
of
communication
between
the
domestic
offices
and
the
servants
quarters
*punct* ,
i
take
it
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
then
send
someone
to
make
my
business
known
to
the
major-general's
housekeeper
*punct* ;
i
want
to
examine
those
stairs
*punct* .
*break*
singular
though
my
friend's
proceedings
appeared
to
me
*punct* ,
i
had
ceased
to
wonder
at
anything
*punct* .
*break*
since
nayland
smith's
arrival
at
my
rooms
i
seemed
to
have
been
moving
through
the
fitful
phases
of
a
nightmare
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend's
account
of
how
he
came
by
the
wound
in
his
arm
*punct* ;
the
scene
on
our
arrival
at
the
house
of
sir
crichton
davey
*punct* ;
the
secretary's
story
of
the
dying
man's
cry
*punct* ,
the
red
hand!
*punct* ;
the
hidden
perils
of
the
study
*punct* ;
the
wall
in
the
lane
*punct* ,
all
were
fitter
incidents
of
delirium
than
of
sane
reality
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
when
a
white-faced
butler
made
us
known
to
a
nervous
old
lady
who
proved
to
be
the
housekeeper
of
the
next-door
residence
*punct* ,
i
was
not
surprised
at
smith's
saying
*punct* :
lounge
up
and
down
outside
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
everyone
has
cleared
off
now
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
getting
late
*punct* .
*break*
keep
your
eyes
open
and
be
on
your
guard
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
i
had
the
start
*punct* ,
but
he
is
here
before
me
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
what
is
worse
*punct* ,
he
probably
knows
by
now
that
i
am
here
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
with
which
he
entered
the
house
and
left
me
out
in
the
square
*punct* ,
with
leisure
to
think
*punct* ,
to
try
to
understand
*punct* .
*break*
the
crowd
which
usually
haunts
the
scene
of
a
sensational
crime
had
been
cleared
away
*punct* ,
and
it
had
been
circulated
that
sir
crichton
had
died
from
natural
causes
*punct* .
*break*
the
intense
heat
having
driven
most
of
the
residents
out
of
town
*punct* ,
practically
i
had
the
square
to
myself
*punct* ,
and
i
gave
myself
up
to
a
brief
consideration
of
the
mystery
in
which
i
so
suddenly
had
found
myself
involved
*punct* .
*break*
by
what
agency
had
sir
crichton
met
his
death
*punct* ?
*break*
did
nayland
smith
know
*punct* ?
*break*
i
rather
suspected
that
he
did
*punct* .
*break*
what
was
the
hidden
significance
of
the
perfumed
envelope
*punct* ?
*break*
who
was
that
mysterious
personage
whom
smith
so
evidently
dreaded
*punct* ,
who
had
attempted
his
life
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
presumably
*punct* ,
had
murdered
sir
crichton
*punct* ?
*break*
sir
crichton
davey
*punct* ,
during
the
time
that
he
had
held
office
in
india
*punct* ,
and
during
his
long
term
of
service
at
home
*punct* ,
had
earned
the
good
will
of
all
*punct* ,
british
and
native
alike
*punct* .
*break*
who
was
his
secret
enemy
*punct* ?
*break*
something
touched
me
lightly
on
the
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
i
turned
*punct* ,
with
my
heart
fluttering
like
a
child's
*punct* .
*break*
this
night's
work
had
imposed
a
severe
strain
even
upon
my
callous
nerves
*punct* .
*break*
a
girl
wrapped
in
a
hooded
opera-cloak
stood
at
my
elbow
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
she
glanced
up
at
me
*punct* ,
i
thought
that
i
never
had
seen
a
face
so
seductively
lovely
nor
of
so
unusual
a
type
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
skin
of
a
perfect
blonde
*punct* ,
she
had
eyes
and
lashes
as
black
as
a
creole's
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
together
with
her
full
red
lips
*punct* ,
told
me
that
this
beautiful
stranger
*punct* ,
whose
touch
had
so
startled
me
*punct* ,
was
not
a
child
of
our
northern
shores
*punct* .
*break*
forgive
me
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* ,
speaking
with
an
odd
*punct* ,
pretty
accent
*punct* ,
and
laying
a
slim
hand
*punct* ,
with
jeweled
fingers
*punct* ,
confidingly
upon
my
arm
*punct* ,
if
i
startled
you
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
is
it
true
that
sir
crichton
davey
has
been
*punct* ,
murdered
*punct* ?
*break*
i
looked
into
her
big
*punct* ,
questioning
eyes
*punct* ,
a
harsh
suspicion
laboring
in
my
mind
*punct* ,
but
could
read
nothing
in
their
mysterious
depths
*punct* ,
only
i
wondered
anew
at
my
questioner's
beauty
*punct* .
*break*
the
grotesque
idea
momentarily
possessed
me
that
*punct* ,
were
the
bloom
of
her
red
lips
due
to
art
and
not
to
nature
*punct* ,
their
kiss
would
leave
*punct* ,
though
not
indelibly
*punct* ,
just
such
a
mark
as
i
had
seen
upon
the
dead
man's
hand
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
dismissed
the
fantastic
notion
as
bred
of
the
night's
horrors
*punct* ,
and
worthy
only
of
a
mediaeval
legend
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
she
was
some
friend
or
acquaintance
of
sir
crichton
who
lived
close
by
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
say
that
he
has
been
murdered
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* ,
acting
upon
the
latter
supposition
*punct* ,
and
seeking
to
tell
her
what
she
asked
as
gently
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
is
*punct* ,
dead
*punct* ?
*break*
she
closed
her
eyes
and
uttered
a
low
*punct* ,
moaning
sound
*punct* ,
swaying
dizzily
*punct* .
*break*
thinking
she
was
about
to
swoon
*punct* ,
i
threw
my
arm
round
her
shoulder
to
support
her
*punct* ,
but
she
smiled
sadly
*punct* ,
and
pushed
me
gently
away
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
quite
well
*punct* ,
thank
you
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
certain
*punct* ?
*break*
let
me
walk
with
you
until
you
feel
quite
sure
of
yourself
*punct* .
*break*
she
shook
her
head
*punct* ,
flashed
a
rapid
glance
at
me
with
her
beautiful
eyes
*punct* ,
and
looked
away
in
a
sort
of
sorrowful
embarrassment
*punct* ,
for
which
i
was
entirely
at
a
loss
to
account
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
she
resumed
*punct* :
i
cannot
let
my
name
be
mentioned
in
this
dreadful
matter
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
i
think
i
have
some
information
*punct* ,
for
the
police
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
give
this
to
*punct* ,
whomever
you
think
proper
*punct* ?
*break*
she
handed
me
a
sealed
envelope
*punct* ,
again
met
my
eyes
with
one
of
her
dazzling
glances
*punct* ,
and
hurried
away
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
gone
no
more
than
ten
or
twelve
yards
*punct* ,
and
i
still
was
standing
bewildered
*punct* ,
watching
her
graceful
*punct* ,
retreating
figure
*punct* ,
when
she
turned
abruptly
and
came
back
*punct* .
*break*
without
looking
directly
at
me
*punct* ,
but
alternately
glancing
towards
a
distant
corner
of
the
square
and
towards
the
house
of
major-general
platt-houston
*punct* ,
she
made
the
following
extraordinary
request
*punct* :
if
you
would
do
me
a
very
great
service
*punct* ,
for
which
i
always
would
be
grateful,
*punct* ,
she
glanced
at
me
with
passionate
intentness
*punct* ,
when
you
have
given
my
message
to
the
proper
person
*punct* ,
leave
him
and
do
not
go
near
him
any
more
to-night
*punct* !
*break*
before
i
could
find
words
to
reply
she
gathered
up
her
cloak
and
ran
*punct* .
*break*
before
i
could
determine
whether
or
not
to
follow
her
*punct* ,
for
her
words
had
aroused
anew
all
my
worst
suspicions
*punct* ,
she
had
disappeared
*punct* !
*break*
i
heard
the
whir
of
a
restarted
motor
at
no
great
distance
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
the
instant
that
nayland
smith
came
running
down
the
steps
*punct* ,
i
knew
that
i
had
nodded
at
my
post
*punct* .
*break*
i
cried
as
he
joined
me
*punct* ,
tell
me
what
we
must
do
*punct* !
*break*
and
rapidly
i
acquainted
him
with
the
incident
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend
looked
very
grave
*punct* ;
then
a
grim
smile
crept
round
his
lips
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
a
big
card
to
play
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ;
but
he
did
not
know
that
i
held
one
to
beat
it
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
this
girl
*punct* !
*break*
who
is
she
*punct* ?
*break*
she
is
one
of
the
finest
weapons
in
the
enemy's
armory
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
woman
is
a
two-edged
sword
*punct* ,
and
treacherous
*punct* .
*break*
to
our
great
good
fortune
*punct* ,
she
has
formed
a
sudden
predilection
*punct* ,
characteristically
oriental
*punct* ,
for
yourself
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
you
may
scoff
*punct* ,
but
it
is
evident
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
employed
to
get
this
letter
placed
in
my
hands
*punct* .
*break*
give
it
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
so
*punct* .
*break*
she
has
succeeded
*punct* .
*break*
he
held
the
envelope
under
my
nose
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
with
a
sudden
sense
of
nausea
*punct* ,
i
recognized
the
strange
perfume
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
what
this
presaged
in
sir
crichton's
case
*punct* ?
*break*
can
you
doubt
any
longer
*punct* ?
*break*
she
did
not
want
you
to
share
my
fate
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
said
unsteadily
*punct* ,
i
have
followed
your
lead
blindly
in
this
horrible
business
and
have
not
pressed
for
an
explanation
*punct* ,
but
i
must
insist
before
i
go
one
step
farther
upon
knowing
what
it
all
means
*punct* .
*break*
just
a
few
steps
farther
*punct* ,
he
rejoined
*punct* ;
as
far
as
a
cab
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
hardly
safe
here
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
you
need
not
fear
shots
or
knives
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
whose
servants
are
watching
us
now
scorns
to
employ
such
clumsy
*punct* ,
tell-tale
weapons
*punct* .
*break*
only
three
cabs
were
on
the
rank
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
we
entered
the
first
*punct* ,
something
hissed
past
my
ear
*punct* .
*break*
missed
both
smith
and
me
by
a
miracle
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
passing
over
the
roof
of
the
taxi
*punct* ,
presumably
fell
in
the
enclosed
garden
occupying
the
center
of
the
square
*punct* .
*break*
what
was
that
*punct* ?
*break*
get
in
*punct* ,
quickly
*punct* !
*break*
smith
rapped
back
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
attempt
number
one
*punct* !
*break*
more
than
that
i
cannot
say
*punct* .
*break*
don't
let
the
man
hear
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
noticed
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
pull
up
the
window
on
your
side
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
and
look
out
behind
*punct* .
*break*
the
cab
moved
off
with
a
metallic
jerk
*punct* ,
and
i
turned
and
looked
back
through
the
little
window
in
the
rear
*punct* .
*break*
someone
has
got
into
another
cab
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
following
ours
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
lay
back
and
laughed
unmirthfully
*punct* .
*break*
petrie
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
if
i
escape
alive
from
this
business
i
shall
know
that
i
bear
a
charmed
life
*punct* .
*break*
i
made
no
reply
*punct* ,
as
he
pulled
out
the
dilapidated
pouch
and
filled
his
pipe
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
asked
me
to
explain
matters
*punct* ,
he
continued
*punct* ,
and
i
will
do
so
to
the
best
of
my
ability
*punct* .
*break*
you
no
doubt
wonder
why
a
servant
of
the
british
government
*punct* ,
lately
stationed
in
burma
*punct* ,
suddenly
appears
in
london
*punct* ,
in
the
character
of
a
detective
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
here
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
and
i
bear
credentials
from
the
very
highest
sources
*punct* ,
because
*punct* ,
quite
by
accident
*punct* ,
i
came
upon
a
clew
*punct* .
*break*
following
it
up
*punct* ,
in
the
ordinary
course
of
routine
*punct* ,
i
obtained
evidence
of
the
existence
and
malignant
activity
of
a
certain
man
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
present
stage
of
the
case
i
should
not
be
justified
in
terming
him
the
emissary
of
an
eastern
power
*punct* ,
but
i
may
say
that
representations
are
shortly
to
be
made
to
that
power's
ambassador
in
london
*punct* .
*break*
he
paused
and
glanced
back
towards
the
pursuing
cab
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
little
to
fear
until
we
arrive
home
*punct* ,
he
said
calmly
*punct* .
*break*
afterwards
there
is
much
*punct* .
*break*
to
continue
*punct* :
this
man
*punct* ,
whether
a
fanatic
or
a
duly
appointed
agent
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
unquestionably
*punct* ,
the
most
malign
and
formidable
personality
existing
in
the
known
world
today
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
a
linguist
who
speaks
with
almost
equal
facility
in
any
of
the
civilized
languages
*punct* ,
and
in
most
of
the
barbaric
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
an
adept
in
all
the
arts
and
sciences
which
a
great
university
could
teach
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
also
is
an
adept
in
certain
obscure
arts
and
sciences
which
no
university
of
to-day
can
teach
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
the
brains
of
any
three
men
of
genius
*punct* .
*break*
petrie
*punct* ,
he
is
a
mental
giant
*punct* .
*break*
you
amaze
me
*punct* !
*break*
as
to
his
mission
among
men
*punct* .
*break*
why
did
m.
jules
furneaux
fall
dead
in
a
paris
opera
house
*punct* ?
*break*
because
of
heart
failure
*punct* ?
*break*
because
his
last
speech
had
shown
that
he
held
the
key
to
the
secret
of
tongking
*punct* .
*break*
what
became
of
the
grand
duke
stanislaus
*punct* ?
*break*
nothing
of
the
kind
*punct* .
*break*
he
alone
was
fully
alive
to
russia's
growing
peril
*punct* .
*break*
he
alone
knew
the
truth
about
mongolia
*punct* .
*break*
why
was
sir
crichton
davey
murdered
*punct* ?
*break*
because
*punct* ,
had
the
work
he
was
engaged
upon
ever
seen
the
light
it
would
have
shown
him
to
be
the
only
living
englishman
who
understood
the
importance
of
the
tibetan
frontiers
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
to
you
solemnly
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
that
these
are
but
a
few
*punct* .
*break*
is
there
a
man
who
would
arouse
the
west
to
a
sense
of
the
awakening
of
the
east
*punct* ,
who
would
teach
the
deaf
to
hear
*punct* ,
the
blind
to
see
*punct* ,
that
the
millions
only
await
their
leader
*punct* ?
*break*
he
will
die
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
is
only
one
phase
of
the
devilish
campaign
*punct* .
*break*
the
others
i
can
merely
surmise
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ,
this
is
almost
incredible
*punct* !
*break*
what
perverted
genius
controls
this
awful
secret
movement
*punct* ?
*break*
imagine
a
person
*punct* ,
tall
*punct* ,
lean
and
feline
*punct* ,
high-shouldered
*punct* ,
with
a
brow
like
shakespeare
and
a
face
like
satan
*punct* ,
a
close-shaven
skull
*punct* ,
and
long
*punct* ,
magnetic
eyes
of
the
true
cat-green
*punct* .
*break*
invest
him
with
all
the
cruel
cunning
of
an
entire
eastern
race
*punct* ,
accumulated
in
one
giant
intellect
*punct* ,
with
all
the
resources
of
science
past
and
present
*punct* ,
with
all
the
resources
*punct* ,
if
you
will
*punct* ,
of
a
wealthy
government
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
already
has
denied
all
knowledge
of
his
existence
*punct* .
*break*
imagine
that
awful
being
*punct* ,
and
you
have
a
mental
picture
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
the
yellow
peril
incarnate
in
one
man
*punct* .
*break*
i
sank
into
an
arm-chair
in
my
rooms
and
gulped
down
a
strong
peg
of
brandy
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
been
followed
here
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
why
did
you
make
no
attempt
to
throw
the
pursuers
off
the
track
*punct* ,
to
have
them
intercepted
*punct* ?
*break*
useless
*punct* ,
in
the
first
place
*punct* .
*break*
wherever
we
went
*punct* ,
he
would
find
us
*punct* .
*break*
and
of
what
use
to
arrest
his
creatures
*punct* ?
*break*
we
could
prove
nothing
against
them
*punct* .
*break*
further
*punct* ,
it
is
evident
that
an
attempt
is
to
be
made
upon
my
life
to-night
*punct* ,
and
by
the
same
means
that
proved
so
successful
in
the
case
of
poor
sir
crichton
*punct* .
*break*
his
square
jaw
grew
truculently
prominent
*punct* ,
and
he
leapt
stormily
to
his
feet
*punct* ,
shaking
his
clenched
fists
towards
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
the
fiendishly
clever
villain
*punct* !
*break*
i
suspected
that
sir
crichton
was
next
*punct* ,
and
i
was
right
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
came
too
late
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
that
hits
me
hard
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* .
*break*
to
think
that
i
knew
and
yet
failed
to
save
him
*punct* !
*break*
he
resumed
his
seat
*punct* ,
smoking
hard
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
has
made
the
blunder
common
to
all
men
of
unusual
genius
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
underrated
his
adversary
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
not
given
me
credit
for
perceiving
the
meaning
of
the
scented
messages
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
thrown
away
one
powerful
weapon
*punct* ,
to
get
such
a
message
into
my
hands
*punct* ,
and
he
thinks
that
once
safe
within
doors
*punct* ,
i
shall
sleep
*punct* ,
unsuspecting
*punct* ,
and
die
as
sir
crichton
died
*punct* .
*break*
but
without
the
indiscretion
of
your
charming
friend
*punct* ,
i
should
have
known
what
to
expect
when
i
receive
her
information'
*punct* ,
which
by
the
way
*punct* ,
consists
of
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
broke
in
*punct* ,
who
is
she
*punct* ?
*break*
she
is
either
fu-manchu's
daughter
*punct* ,
his
wife
*punct* ,
or
his
slave
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
inclined
to
believe
the
last
*punct* ,
for
she
has
no
will
but
his
will
*punct* ,
except
*punct* ,
with
a
quizzical
glance
*punct* ,
in
a
certain
instance
*punct* .
*break*
how
can
you
jest
with
some
awful
thing
*punct* ,
heaven
knows
what
*punct* ,
hanging
over
your
head
*punct* ?
*break*
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
perfumed
envelopes
*punct* ?
*break*
how
did
sir
crichton
die
*punct* ?
*break*
he
died
of
the
zayat
kiss
*punct* .
*break*
ask
me
what
that
is
and
i
reply
i
do
not
know
*punct* .
*break*
the
zayats
are
the
burmese
caravanserais
*punct* ,
or
rest-houses
*punct* .
*break*
along
a
certain
route
*punct* ,
upon
which
i
set
eyes
*punct* ,
for
the
first
and
only
time
*punct* ,
upon
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
travelers
who
use
them
sometimes
die
as
sir
crichton
died
*punct* ,
with
nothing
to
show
the
cause
of
death
but
a
little
mark
upon
the
neck
*punct* ,
face
*punct* ,
or
limb
*punct* ,
which
has
earned
*punct* ,
in
those
parts
*punct* ,
the
title
of
the
zayat
kiss
*punct* .
*break*
the
rest-houses
along
that
route
are
shunned
now
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
my
theory
and
i
hope
to
prove
it
to-night
*punct* ,
if
i
live
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
be
one
more
broken
weapon
in
his
fiendish
armory
*punct* ,
and
it
is
thus
*punct* ,
and
thus
only
*punct* ,
that
i
can
hope
to
crush
him
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
my
principal
reason
for
not
enlightening
dr.
cleeve
*punct* .
*break*
even
walls
have
ears
where
fu-manchu
is
concerned
*punct* ,
so
i
feigned
ignorance
of
the
meaning
of
the
mark
*punct* ,
knowing
that
he
would
be
almost
certain
to
employ
the
same
methods
upon
some
other
victim
*punct* .
*break*
i
wanted
an
opportunity
to
study
the
zayat
kiss
in
operation
*punct* ,
and
i
shall
have
one
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
scented
envelopes
*punct* ?
*break*
in
the
swampy
forests
of
the
district
i
have
referred
to
a
rare
species
of
orchid
*punct* ,
almost
green
*punct* ,
and
with
a
peculiar
scent
*punct* ,
is
sometimes
met
with
*punct* .
*break*
i
recognized
the
heavy
perfume
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
i
take
it
that
the
thing
which
kills
the
traveler
is
attracted
by
this
orchid
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
notice
that
the
perfume
clings
to
whatever
it
touches
*punct* .
*break*
i
doubt
if
it
can
be
washed
off
in
the
ordinary
way
*punct* .
*break*
after
at
least
one
unsuccessful
attempt
to
kill
sir
crichton
*punct* ,
you
recall
that
he
thought
there
was
something
concealed
in
his
study
on
a
previous
occasion?
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
hit
upon
the
perfumed
envelopes
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
have
a
supply
of
these
green
orchids
in
his
possession
*punct* ,
possibly
to
feed
the
creature
*punct* .
*break*
how
could
any
kind
of
creature
have
got
into
sir
crichton's
room
tonight
*punct* ?
*break*
you
no
doubt
observed
that
i
examined
the
grate
of
the
study
*punct* .
*break*
i
found
a
fair
quantity
of
fallen
soot
*punct* .
*break*
i
at
once
assumed
*punct* ,
since
it
appeared
to
be
the
only
means
of
entrance
*punct* ,
that
something
has
been
dropped
down
*punct* ;
and
i
took
it
for
granted
that
the
thing
*punct* ,
whatever
it
was
*punct* ,
must
still
be
concealed
either
in
the
study
or
in
the
library
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
i
had
obtained
the
evidence
of
the
groom
*punct* ,
wills
*punct* ,
i
perceived
that
the
cry
from
the
lane
or
from
the
park
was
a
signal
*punct* .
*break*
i
noted
that
the
movements
of
anyone
seated
at
the
study
table
were
visible
*punct* ,
in
shadow
*punct* ,
on
the
blind
*punct* ,
and
that
the
study
occupied
the
corner
of
a
two-storied
wing
and
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
had
a
short
chimney
*punct* .
*break*
what
did
the
signal
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
that
sir
crichton
had
leaped
up
from
his
chair
*punct* ,
and
either
had
received
the
zayat
kiss
or
had
seen
the
thing
which
someone
on
the
roof
had
lowered
down
the
straight
chimney
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
signal
to
withdraw
that
deadly
thing
*punct* .
*break*
by
means
of
the
iron
stairway
at
the
rear
of
major-general
platt-houston's
*punct* ,
i
quite
easily
*punct* ,
gained
access
to
the
roof
above
sir
crichton's
study
*punct* ,
and
i
found
this
*punct* .
*break*
out
from
his
pocket
nayland
smith
drew
a
tangled
piece
of
silk
*punct* ,
mixed
up
with
which
were
a
brass
ring
and
a
number
of
unusually
large-sized
split-shot
*punct* ,
nipped
on
in
the
manner
usual
on
a
fishing-line
*punct* .
*break*
my
theory
proven
*punct* ,
he
resumed
*punct* .
*break*
not
anticipating
a
search
on
the
roof
*punct* ,
they
had
been
careless
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
to
weight
the
line
and
to
prevent
the
creature
clinging
to
the
walls
of
the
chimney
*punct* .
*break*
directly
it
had
dropped
in
the
grate
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
by
means
of
this
ring
i
assume
that
the
weighted
line
was
withdrawn
*punct* ,
and
the
thing
was
only
held
by
one
slender
thread
*punct* ,
which
sufficed
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
to
draw
it
back
again
when
it
had
done
its
work
*punct* .
*break*
lt
might
have
got
tangled
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
but
they
reckoned
on
its
making
straight
up
the
carved
leg
of
the
writing-table
for
the
prepared
envelope
*punct* .
*break*
from
there
to
the
hand
of
sir
crichton
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
from
having
touched
the
envelope
*punct* ,
would
also
be
scented
with
the
perfume
*punct* ,
was
a
certain
move
*punct* .
*break*
i
exclaimed
*punct* ,
and
glanced
apprehensively
into
the
dusky
shadows
of
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
something
that
moves
rapidly
and
silently
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
venture
no
more
at
present
*punct* ,
but
i
think
it
works
in
the
dark
*punct* .
*break*
the
study
was
dark
*punct* ,
remember
*punct* ,
save
for
the
bright
patch
beneath
the
reading-lamp
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
observed
that
the
rear
of
this
house
is
ivy-covered
right
up
to
and
above
your
bedroom
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
make
ostentatious
preparations
to
retire
*punct* ,
and
i
think
we
may
rely
upon
fu-manchu's
servants
to
attempt
my
removal
*punct* ,
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
if
not
yours
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
my
dear
fellow
*punct* ,
it
is
a
climb
of
thirty-five
feet
at
the
very
least
*punct* .
*break*
you
remember
the
cry
in
the
back
lane
*punct* ?
*break*
it
suggested
something
to
me
*punct* ,
and
i
tested
my
idea
*punct* ,
successfully
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
cry
of
a
dacoit
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
dacoity
*punct* ,
though
quiescent
*punct* ,
is
by
no
means
extinct
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
has
dacoits
in
his
train
*punct* ,
and
probably
it
is
one
who
operates
the
zayat
kiss
*punct* ,
since
it
was
a
dacoit
who
watched
the
window
of
the
study
this
evening
*punct* .
*break*
to
such
a
man
an
ivy-covered
wall
is
a
grand
staircase
*punct* .
*break*
the
horrible
events
that
followed
are
punctuated
*punct* ,
in
my
mind
*punct* ,
by
the
striking
of
a
distant
clock
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
singular
how
trivialities
thus
assert
themselves
in
moments
of
high
tension
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
proceed
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
by
these
punctuations
*punct* ,
to
the
coming
of
the
horror
that
it
was
written
we
should
encounter
*punct* .
*break*
the
clock
across
the
common
struck
two
*punct* .
*break*
having
removed
all
traces
of
the
scent
of
the
orchid
from
our
hands
with
a
solution
of
ammonia
smith
and
i
had
followed
the
programme
laid
down
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
reach
the
rear
of
the
house
*punct* ,
by
simply
climbing
a
fence
*punct* ,
and
we
did
not
doubt
that
seeing
the
light
go
out
in
the
front
*punct* ,
our
unseen
watcher
would
proceed
to
the
back
*punct* .
*break*
the
room
was
a
large
one
*punct* ,
and
we
had
made
up
my
camp-bed
at
one
end
*punct* ,
stuffing
odds
and
ends
under
the
clothes
to
lend
the
appearance
of
a
sleeper
*punct* ,
which
device
we
also
had
adopted
in
the
case
of
the
larger
bed
*punct* .
*break*
the
perfumed
envelope
lay
upon
a
little
coffee
table
in
the
center
of
the
floor
*punct* ,
and
smith
*punct* ,
with
an
electric
pocket
lamp
*punct* ,
a
revolver
*punct* ,
and
a
brassey
beside
him
*punct* ,
sat
on
cushions
in
the
shadow
of
the
wardrobe
*punct* .
*break*
i
occupied
a
post
between
the
windows
*punct* .
*break*
no
unusual
sound
*punct* ,
so
far
*punct* ,
had
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
night
*punct* .
*break*
save
for
the
muffled
throb
of
the
rare
all-night
cars
passing
the
front
of
the
house
*punct* ,
our
vigil
had
been
a
silent
one
*punct* .
*break*
the
full
moon
bad
painted
about
the
floor
weird
shadows
of
the
clustering
ivy
*punct* ,
spreading
the
design
gradually
from
the
door
*punct* ,
across
the
room
*punct* ,
past
the
little
table
where
the
envelope
lay
*punct* ,
and
finally
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
*punct* .
*break*
the
distant
clock
struck
a
quarter-past
two
*punct* .
*break*
a
slight
breeze
stirred
the
ivy
*punct* ,
and
a
new
shadow
added
itself
to
the
extreme
edge
of
the
moon's
design
*punct* .
*break*
something
rose
*punct* ,
inch
by
inch
*punct* ,
above
the
sill
of
the
westerly
window
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
see
only
its
shadow
*punct* ,
but
a
sharp
*punct* ,
sibilant
breath
from
smith
told
me
that
he
*punct* ,
from
his
post
*punct* ,
could
see
the
cause
of
the
shadow
*punct* .
*break*
every
nerve
in
my
body
seemed
to
be
strung
tensely
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
icy
cold
*punct* ,
expectant
*punct* ,
and
prepared
for
whatever
horror
was
upon
us
*punct* .
*break*
the
shadow
became
stationary
*punct* .
*break*
the
dacoit
was
studying
the
interior
of
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
then
it
suddenly
lengthened
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
craning
my
head
to
the
left
*punct* ,
i
saw
a
lithe
*punct* ,
black-clad
form
*punct* ,
surmounted
by
a
yellow
face
*punct* ,
sketchy
in
the
moonlight
*punct* ,
pressed
against
the
window-panes
*punct* !
*break*
one
thin
*punct* ,
brown
hand
appeared
over
the
edge
of
the
lowered
sash
*punct* ,
which
it
grasped
*punct* ,
and
then
another
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
made
absolutely
no
sound
whatever
*punct* .
*break*
the
second
hand
disappeared
*punct* ,
and
reappeared
*punct* .
*break*
it
held
a
small
*punct* ,
square
box
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
very
faint
click
*punct* .
*break*
the
dacoit
swung
himself
below
the
window
with
the
agility
of
an
ape
*punct* ,
as
*punct* ,
with
a
dull
*punct* ,
muffled
thud
*punct* ,
something
dropped
upon
the
carpet
*punct* !
*break*
stand
still
*punct* ,
for
your
life
*punct* !
*break*
came
smith's
voice
*punct* ,
high-pitched
*punct* .
*break*
a
beam
of
white
leaped
out
across
the
room
and
played
full
upon
the
coffee-table
in
the
center
*punct* .
*break*
prepared
as
i
was
for
something
horrible
*punct* ,
i
know
that
i
paled
at
sight
of
the
thing
that
was
running
round
the
edge
of
the
envelope
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
an
insect
*punct* ,
full
six
inches
long
*punct* ,
and
of
a
vivid
*punct* ,
venomous
*punct* ,
red
color
*punct* !
*break*
it
had
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
great
ant
*punct* ,
with
its
long
*punct* ,
quivering
antennae
and
its
febrile
*punct* ,
horrible
vitality
*punct* ;
but
it
was
proportionately
longer
of
body
and
smaller
of
head
*punct* ,
and
had
numberless
rapidly
moving
legs
*punct* .
*break*
in
short
*punct* ,
it
was
a
giant
centipede
*punct* ,
apparently
of
the
scolopendra
group
*punct* ,
but
of
a
form
quite
new
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
these
things
i
realized
in
one
breathless
instant
*punct* ;
in
the
next
*punct* ,
smith
had
dashed
the
thing's
poisonous
life
out
with
one
straight
*punct* ,
true
blow
of
the
golf
club
*punct* !
*break*
i
leaped
to
the
window
and
threw
it
widely
open
*punct* ,
feeling
a
silk
thread
brush
my
hand
as
i
did
so
*punct* .
*break*
a
black
shape
was
dropping
*punct* ,
with
incredible
agility
from
branch
to
branch
of
the
ivy
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
without
once
offering
a
mark
for
a
revolver-shot
*punct* ,
it
merged
into
the
shadows
beneath
the
trees
of
the
garden
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
turned
and
switched
on
the
light
nayland
smith
dropped
limply
into
a
chair
*punct* ,
leaning
his
head
upon
his
hands
*punct* .
*break*
even
that
grim
courage
had
been
tried
sorely
*punct* .
*break*
never
mind
the
dacoit
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
nemesis
will
know
where
to
find
him
*punct* .
*break*
we
know
now
what
causes
the
mark
of
the
zayat
kiss
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
science
is
richer
for
our
first
brush
with
the
enemy
*punct* ,
and
the
enemy
is
poorer
*punct* ,
unless
he
has
any
more
unclassified
centipedes
*punct* .
*break*
i
understand
now
something
that
has
been
puzzling
me
since
i
heard
of
it
*punct* ,
sir
crichton's
stifled
cry
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
remember
that
he
was
almost
past
speech
*punct* ,
it
is
reasonable
to
suppose
that
his
cry
was
not
the
red
hand
*punct* !
*break*
but
the
red
ant
*punct* !
*break*
petrie
*punct* ,
to
think
that
i
failed
*punct* ,
by
less
than
an
hour
*punct* ,
to
save
him
from
such
an
end
*punct* !
*break*
boats
*punct* ,
was
recovered
from
the
thames
off
tilbury
by
the
river
police
at
six
a.m
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
supposed
that
the
man
met
with
an
accident
in
leaving
his
ship
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
passed
me
the
evening
paper
and
pointed
to
the
above
paragraph
*punct* .
*break*
for
lascar
read
dacoit
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
our
visitor
*punct* ,
who
came
by
way
of
the
ivy
*punct* ,
fortunately
for
us
*punct* ,
failed
to
follow
his
instructions
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
he
lost
the
centipede
and
left
a
clew
behind
him
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
fu-manchu
does
not
overlook
such
lapses
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
sidelight
upon
the
character
of
the
awful
being
with
whom
we
had
to
deal
*punct* .
*break*
my
very
soul
recoiled
from
bare
consideration
of
the
fate
that
would
be
ours
if
ever
we
fell
into
his
hands
*punct* .
*break*
the
telephone
bell
rang
*punct* .
*break*
i
went
out
and
found
that
inspector
weymouth
of
new
scotland
yard
had
called
us
up
*punct* .
*break*
will
mr.
nayland
smith
please
come
to
the
wapping
river
police
station
at
once
*punct* ,
was
the
message
*punct* .
*break*
peaceful
interludes
were
few
enough
throughout
that
wild
pursuit
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
certainly
something
important
*punct* ,
said
my
friend
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
if
fu-manchu
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
*punct* ,
as
we
must
presume
him
to
be
*punct* ,
probably
something
ghastly
*punct* .
*break*
a
brief
survey
of
the
time-tables
showed
us
that
there
were
no
trains
to
serve
our
haste
*punct* .
*break*
we
accordingly
chartered
a
cab
and
proceeded
east
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
throughout
the
journey
*punct* ,
talked
entertainingly
about
his
work
in
burma
*punct* .
*break*
of
intent
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
he
avoided
any
reference
to
the
circumstances
which
first
had
brought
him
in
contact
with
the
sinister
genius
of
the
yellow
movement
*punct* .
*break*
his
talk
was
rather
of
the
sunshine
of
the
east
than
of
its
shadows
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
drive
concluded
*punct* ,
and
all
too
soon
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
silence
which
neither
of
us
seemed
disposed
to
break
*punct* ,
we
entered
the
police
depot
*punct* ,
and
followed
an
officer
who
received
us
into
the
room
where
weymouth
waited
*punct* .
*break*
the
inspector
greeted
us
briefly
*punct* ,
nodding
toward
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
poor
cadby
*punct* ,
the
most
promising
lad
at
the
yard
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ;
and
his
usually
gruff
voice
had
softened
strangely
*punct* .
*break*
smith
struck
his
right
fist
into
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
and
swore
under
his
breath
*punct* ,
striding
up
and
down
the
neat
little
room
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
spoke
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
and
in
the
silence
i
could
hear
the
whispering
of
the
thames
outside
*punct* ,
of
the
thames
which
had
so
many
strange
secrets
to
tell
*punct* ,
and
now
was
burdened
with
another
*punct* .
*break*
the
body
lay
prone
upon
the
deal
table
*punct* ,
this
latest
of
the
river's
dead
*punct* ,
dressed
in
rough
sailor
garb
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
to
all
outward
seeming
*punct* ,
a
seaman
of
nondescript
nationality
*punct* ,
such
as
is
no
stranger
in
wapping
and
shadwell
*punct* .
*break*
his
dark
*punct* ,
curly
hair
clung
clammily
about
the
brown
forehead
*punct* ;
his
skin
was
stained
*punct* ,
they
told
me
*punct* .
*break*
he
wore
a
gold
ring
in
one
ear
*punct* ,
and
three
fingers
of
the
left
hand
were
missing
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
almost
the
same
with
mason
*punct* .
*break*
the
river
police
inspector
was
speaking
*punct* .
*break*
a
week
ago
*punct* ,
on
a
wednesday
*punct* ,
he
went
off
in
his
own
time
on
some
funny
business
down
st
*punct* .
*break*
george's
way
*punct* ,
and
thursday
night
the
ten-o'clock
boat
got
the
grapnel
on
him
off
hanover
hole
*punct* .
*break*
his
first
two
fingers
on
the
right
hand
were
clean
gone
*punct* ,
and
his
left
hand
was
mutilated
frightfully
*punct* .
*break*
he
paused
and
glanced
at
smith
*punct* .
*break*
that
lascar
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
he
continued
*punct* ,
that
you
came
down
to
see
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
you
remember
his
hands
*punct* ?
*break*
he
was
not
a
lascar
*punct* ,
he
said
shortly
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
dacoit
*punct* .
*break*
silence
fell
again
*punct* .
*break*
i
turned
to
the
array
of
objects
lying
on
the
table
*punct* ,
those
which
had
been
found
in
cadby's
clothing
*punct* .
*break*
none
of
them
were
noteworthy
*punct* ,
except
that
which
had
been
found
thrust
into
the
loose
neck
of
his
shirt
*punct* .
*break*
this
last
it
was
which
had
led
the
police
to
send
for
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
for
it
constituted
the
first
clew
which
had
come
to
light
pointing
to
the
authors
of
these
mysterious
tragedies
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
chinese
pigtail
*punct* .
*break*
that
alone
was
sufficiently
remarkable
*punct* ;
but
it
was
rendered
more
so
by
the
fact
that
the
plaited
queue
was
a
false
one
being
attached
to
a
most
ingenious
bald
wig
*punct* .
*break*
you're
sure
it
wasn't
part
of
a
chinese
make-up
*punct* ?
*break*
questioned
weymouth
*punct* ,
his
eye
on
the
strange
relic
*punct* .
*break*
cadby
was
clever
at
disguise
*punct* .
*break*
smith
snatched
the
wig
from
my
hands
with
a
certain
irritation
*punct* ,
and
tried
to
fit
it
on
the
dead
detective
*punct* .
*break*
too
small
by
inches
*punct* !
*break*
and
look
how
it's
padded
in
the
crown
*punct* .
*break*
this
thing
was
made
for
a
most
abnormal
head
*punct* .
*break*
he
threw
it
down
*punct* ,
and
fell
to
pacing
the
room
again
*punct* .
*break*
where
did
you
find
him
*punct* ,
exactly
*punct* ?
*break*
limehouse
reach
*punct* ,
under
commercial
dock
pier
*punct* ,
exactly
an
hour
ago
*punct* .
*break*
and
you
last
saw
him
at
eight
o'clock
last
night?
*punct* ,
to
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
eight
to
a
quarter
past
*punct* .
*break*
you
think
he
has
been
dead
nearly
twenty-four
hours
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ?
*break*
roughly
*punct* ,
twenty-four
hours
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
we
know
that
he
was
on
the
track
of
the
fu-manchu
group
*punct* ,
that
he
followed
up
some
clew
which
led
him
to
the
neighborhood
of
old
ratcliff
highway
*punct* ,
and
that
he
died
the
same
night
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
sure
that
is
where
he
was
going
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
weymouth
*punct* ;
he
was
jealous
of
giving
anything
away
*punct* ,
poor
chap
*punct* ;
it
meant
a
big
lift
for
him
if
he
pulled
the
case
off
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
expected
to
spend
last
night
in
that
district
*punct* .
*break*
he
left
the
yard
about
eight
*punct* ,
as
i've
said
*punct* ,
to
go
to
his
rooms
*punct* ,
and
dress
for
the
job
*punct* .
*break*
did
he
keep
any
record
of
his
cases
*punct* ?
*break*
he
was
most
particular
*punct* .
*break*
cadby
was
a
man
with
ambitions
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
you'll
want
to
see
his
book
*punct* .
*break*
wait
while
i
get
his
address
*punct* ;
it's
somewhere
in
brixton
*punct* .
*break*
he
went
to
the
telephone
*punct* ,
and
inspector
ryman
covered
up
the
dead
man's
face
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
was
palpably
excited
*punct* .
*break*
he
almost
succeeded
where
we
have
failed
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
he
was
hot
on
the
track
of
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
poor
mason
had
probably
blundered
on
the
scent
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
and
he
met
with
a
similar
fate
*punct* .
*break*
without
other
evidence
*punct* ,
the
fact
that
they
both
died
in
the
same
way
as
the
dacoit
would
be
conclusive
*punct* ,
for
we
know
that
fu-manchu
killed
the
dacoit
*punct* !
*break*
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
mutilated
hands
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
cadby's
death
was
from
drowning
*punct* ,
you
say
*punct* ?
*break*
there
are
no
other
marks
of
violence
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
was
a
very
strong
swimmer
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ,
interrupted
inspector
ryman
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
he
pulled
off
the
quarter-mile
championship
at
the
crystal
palace
last
year
*punct* !
*break*
cadby
wasn't
a
man
easy
to
drown
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
for
mason
*punct* ,
he
was
an
r.n.r.
*punct* ,
and
like
a
fish
in
the
water
*punct* !
*break*
smith
shrugged
his
shoulders
helplessly
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
hope
that
one
day
we
shall
know
how
they
died
*punct* ,
he
said
simply
*punct* .
*break*
weymouth
returned
from
the
telephone
*punct* .
*break*
the
address
is
no.
*punct* ,
cold
harbor
lane
*punct* ,
he
reported
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
not
be
able
to
come
along
*punct* ,
but
you
can't
miss
it
*punct* ;
it's
close
by
the
brixton
police
station
*punct* .
*break*
there's
no
family
*punct* ,
fortunately
*punct* ;
he
was
quite
alone
in
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
his
case-book
isn't
in
the
american
desk
*punct* ,
which
you'll
find
in
his
sitting-room
*punct* ;
it's
in
the
cupboard
in
the
corner
*punct* ,
top
shelf
*punct* .
*break*
here
are
his
keys
*punct* ,
all
intact
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
this
is
the
cupboard
key
*punct* .
*break*
come
on
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
we
haven't
a
second
to
waste
*punct* .
*break*
our
cab
was
waiting
*punct* ,
and
in
a
few
seconds
we
were
speeding
along
wapping
high
street
*punct* .
*break*
we
had
gone
no
more
than
a
few
hundred
yards
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
when
smith
suddenly
slapped
his
open
hand
down
on
his
knee
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
left
it
behind
*punct* !
*break*
we
must
have
it
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
the
cab
was
pulled
up
*punct* ,
and
smith
alighted
*punct* .
*break*
don't
wait
for
me
*punct* ,
he
directed
hurriedly
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
take
weymouth's
card
*punct* .
*break*
remember
where
he
said
the
book
was
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
all
we
want
*punct* .
*break*
come
straight
on
to
scotland
yard
and
meet
me
there
*punct* .
*break*
but
smith
*punct* ,
i
protested
*punct* ,
a
few
minutes
can
make
no
difference
*punct* !
*break*
do
you
suppose
fu-manchu
is
going
to
leave
evidence
like
that
lying
about
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
a
thousand
to
one
he
has
it
already
*punct* ,
but
there
is
just
a
bare
chance
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
new
aspect
of
the
situation
and
one
that
afforded
no
room
for
comment
*punct* ;
and
so
lost
in
thought
did
i
become
that
the
cab
was
outside
the
house
for
which
i
was
bound
ere
i
realized
that
we
had
quitted
the
purlieus
of
wapping
*punct* .
*break*
yet
i
had
had
leisure
to
review
the
whole
troop
of
events
which
had
crowded
my
life
since
the
return
of
nayland
smith
from
burma
*punct* .
*break*
mentally
*punct* ,
i
had
looked
again
upon
the
dead
sir
crichton
davey
*punct* ,
and
with
smith
had
waited
in
the
dark
for
the
dreadful
thing
that
had
killed
him
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
with
those
remorseless
memor
ies
jostling
in
my
mind
*punct* ,
i
was
entering
the
house
of
fu-manchu's
last
victim
*punct* ,
and
the
shadow
of
that
giant
evil
seemed
to
be
upon
it
like
a
palpable
cloud
*punct* .
*break*
cadby's
old
landlady
greeted
me
with
a
queer
mixture
of
fear
and
embarrassment
in
her
manner
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
dr.
petrie
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
and
i
regret
that
i
bring
bad
news
respecting
mr.
cadby
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
don't
tell
me
that
anything
has
happened
to
him
*punct* !
*break*
and
divining
something
of
the
mission
on
which
i
was
come
*punct* ,
for
such
sad
duty
often
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
medical
man
*punct* :
oh
*punct* ,
the
poor
*punct* ,
brave
lad
*punct* !
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
i
respected
the
dead
man's
memory
more
than
ever
from
that
hour
*punct* ,
since
the
sorrow
of
the
worthy
old
soul
was
quite
pathetic
*punct* ,
and
spoke
eloquently
for
the
unhappy
cause
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
terrible
wailing
at
the
back
of
the
house
last
night
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ,
and
i
heard
it
again
to-night
*punct* ,
a
second
before
you
knocked
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
same
when
his
mother
died
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
moment
i
paid
little
attention
to
her
words
*punct* ,
for
such
beliefs
are
common
*punct* ,
unfortunately
*punct* ;
but
when
she
was
sufficiently
composed
i
went
on
to
explain
what
i
thought
necessary
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
the
old
lady's
embarrassment
took
precedence
of
her
sorrow
*punct* ,
and
presently
the
truth
came
out
*punct* :
there's
a
*punct* ,
young
lady
*punct* ,
in
his
rooms
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
this
might
mean
little
or
might
mean
much
*punct* .
*break*
she
came
and
waited
for
him
last
night
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ,
from
ten
until
half-past
*punct* ,
and
this
morning
again
*punct* .
*break*
she
came
the
third
time
about
an
hour
ago
*punct* ,
and
has
been
upstairs
since
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
know
her
*punct* ,
mrs.
dolan
*punct* ?
*break*
mrs.
dolan
grew
embarrassed
again
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* ,
wiping
her
eyes
the
while
*punct* ,
i
do
*punct* .
*break*
and
god
knows
he
was
a
good
lad
*punct* ,
and
i
like
a
mother
to
him
*punct* ;
but
she
is
not
the
girl
i
should
have
liked
a
son
of
mine
to
take
up
with
*punct* .
*break*
at
any
other
time
*punct* ,
this
would
have
been
amusing
*punct* ;
now
*punct* ,
it
might
be
serious
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
dolan's
account
of
the
wailing
became
suddenly
significant
*punct* ,
for
perhaps
it
meant
that
one
of
fu-manchu's
dacoit
followers
was
watching
the
house
*punct* ,
to
give
warning
of
any
stranger's
approach
*punct* !
*break*
warning
to
whom
*punct* ?
*break*
it
was
unlikely
that
i
should
forget
the
dark
eyes
of
another
of
fu-manchu's
servants
*punct* .
*break*
was
that
lure
of
men
even
now
in
the
house
*punct* ,
completing
her
evil
work
*punct* ?
*break*
i
should
never
have
allowed
her
in
his
rooms
*punct* ,
began
mrs.
dolan
again
*punct* .
*break*
then
there
was
an
interruption
*punct* .
*break*
a
soft
rustling
retched
my
ears
*punct* ,
intimately
feminine
*punct* .
*break*
the
girl
was
stealing
down
*punct* !
*break*
i
leaped
out
into
the
hall
*punct* ,
and
she
turned
and
fled
blindly
before
me
*punct* ,
back
up
the
stairs
*punct* !
*break*
taking
three
steps
at
a
time
*punct* ,
i
followed
her
*punct* ,
bounded
into
the
room
above
almost
at
her
heels
*punct* ,
and
stood
with
my
back
to
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
she
cowered
against
the
desk
by
the
window
*punct* ,
a
slim
figure
in
a
clinging
silk
gown
*punct* ,
which
alone
explained
mrs.
dolan's
distrust
*punct* .
*break*
the
gaslight
was
turned
very
low
*punct* ,
and
her
hat
shadowed
her
face
*punct* ,
but
could
not
hide
its
startling
*punct* ,
beauty
*punct* ,
could
not
mar
the
brilliancy
of
the
skin
*punct* ,
nor
dim
the
wonderful
eyes
of
this
modern
delilah
*punct* .
*break*
for
it
was
she
*punct* !
*break*
so
i
came
in
time
i
said
grimly
*punct* ,
and
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
*punct* .
*break*
she
panted
at
that
*punct* ,
and
stood
facing
me
*punct* ,
leaning
back
with
her
jewel-laden
hands
clutching
the
desk
edge
*punct* .
*break*
give
me
whatever
you
have
removed
from
here
*punct* ,
i
said
sternly
*punct* ,
and
then
prepare
to
accompany
me
*punct* .
*break*
she
took
a
step
forward
*punct* ,
her
eyes
wide
with
fear
*punct* ,
her
lips
parted
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
taken
nothing
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* .
*break*
her
breast
was
heaving
tumultuously
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
let
me
go
*punct* !
*break*
please
*punct* ,
let
me
go
*punct* !
*break*
and
impulsively
she
threw
herself
forward
*punct* ,
pressing
clasped
hands
against
my
shoulder
and
looking
up
into
my
face
with
passionate
*punct* ,
pleading
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
with
some
shame
that
i
confess
how
her
charm
enveloped
me
like
a
magic
cloud
*punct* .
*break*
unfamiliar
with
the
complex
oriental
temperament
*punct* ,
i
had
laughed
at
nayland
smith
when
he
had
spoken
of
this
girl's
infatuation
*punct* .
*break*
love
in
the
east
*punct* ,
he
had
said
*punct* ,
is
like
the
conjurer's
mango-tree
*punct* ;
it
is
born
*punct* ,
grows
and
flowers
at
the
touch
of
a
hand
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
those
pleading
eyes
i
read
confirmation
of
his
words
*punct* .
*break*
her
clothes
or
her
hair
exhaled
a
faint
perfume
*punct* .
*break*
like
all
fu-manchu's
servants
*punct* ,
she
was
perfectly
chosen
for
her
peculiar
duties
*punct* .
*break*
her
beauty
was
wholly
intoxicating
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
thrust
her
away
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
no
claim
to
mercy
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
count
upon
any
*punct* .
*break*
what
have
you
taken
from
here
*punct* ?
*break*
she
grasped
the
lapels
of
my
coat
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
tell
you
all
i
can
*punct* ,
all
i
dare
*punct* ,
she
panted
eagerly
*punct* ,
fearfully
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
know
how
to
deal
with
your
friend
*punct* ,
but
with
you
i
am
lost
*punct* !
*break*
if
you
could
only
understand
you
would
not
be
so
cruel
*punct* .
*break*
her
slight
accent
added
charm
to
the
musical
voice
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
free
*punct* ,
as
your
english
women
are
*punct* .
*break*
what
i
do
i
must
do
*punct* ,
for
it
is
the
will
of
my
master
*punct* ,
and
i
am
only
a
slave
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
you
are
not
a
man
if
you
can
give
me
to
the
police
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
no
heart
if
you
can
forget
that
i
tried
to
save
you
once
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
feared
that
plea
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
in
her
own
oriental
fashion
*punct* ,
she
certainly
had
tried
to
save
me
from
a
deadly
peril
once
*punct* ,
at
the
expense
of
my
friend
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
had
feared
the
plea
*punct* ,
for
i
did
not
know
how
to
meet
it
*punct* .
*break*
how
could
i
give
her
up
*punct* ,
perhaps
to
stand
her
trial
for
murder
*punct* ?
*break*
and
now
i
fell
silent
*punct* ,
and
she
saw
why
i
was
silent
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
deserve
no
mercy
*punct* ;
i
may
be
even
as
bad
as
you
think
*punct* ;
but
what
have
you
to
do
with
the
police
*punct* ?
*break*
it
is
not
your
work
to
hound
a
woman
to
death
*punct* .
*break*
could
you
ever
look
another
woman
in
the
eyes
*punct* ,
one
that
you
loved
*punct* ,
and
know
that
she
trusted
you
*punct* ,
if
you
had
done
such
a
thing
*punct* ?
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
i
have
no
friend
in
all
the
world
*punct* ,
or
i
should
not
be
here
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
be
my
enemy
*punct* ,
my
judge
*punct* ,
and
make
me
worse
than
i
am
*punct* ;
be
my
friend
*punct* ,
and
save
me
*punct* ,
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
tremulous
lips
were
close
to
mine
*punct* ,
her
breath
fanned
my
cheek
*punct* .
*break*
have
mercy
on
me
*punct* .
*break*
at
that
moment
i
honestly
would
have
given
half
of
my
worldly
possessions
to
have
been
spared
the
decision
which
i
knew
i
must
come
to
*punct* .
*break*
after
all
*punct* ,
what
proof
had
i
that
she
was
a
willing
accomplice
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ?
*break*
furthermore
*punct* ,
she
was
an
oriental
*punct* ,
and
her
code
must
necessarily
be
different
from
mine
*punct* .
*break*
irreconcilable
as
the
thing
may
be
with
western
ideas
*punct* ,
nayland
smith
had
really
told
me
that
he
believed
the
girl
to
be
a
slave
*punct* .
*break*
then
there
remained
that
other
reason
why
i
loathed
the
idea
of
becoming
her
captor
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
almost
tantamount
to
betrayal
*punct* !
*break*
must
i
soil
my
hands
with
such
work
*punct* ?
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
her
seductive
beauty
argued
against
my
sense
of
right
*punct* .
*break*
the
jeweled
fingers
grasped
my
shoulders
nervously
*punct* ,
and
her
slim
body
quivered
against
mine
as
she
watched
me
*punct* ,
with
all
her
soul
in
her
eyes
*punct* ,
in
an
abandonment
of
pleading
despair
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
remembered
the
fate
of
the
man
in
whose
room
we
stood
*punct* .
*break*
you
lured
cadby
to
his
death
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
and
shook
her
off
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* !
*break*
she
cried
wildly
*punct* ,
clutching
at
me
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
swear
by
the
holy
name
i
did
not
*punct* !
*break*
i
did
not
*punct* !
*break*
i
watched
him
*punct* ,
spied
upon
him
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* !
*break*
but
*punct* ,
listen
*punct* :
it
was
because
he
would
not
be
warned
that
he
met
his
death
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
save
him
*punct* !
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
i
am
not
so
bad
as
that
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
tell
you
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
taken
his
notebook
and
torn
out
the
*punct* ,
last
pages
and
burnt
them
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
grate
*punct* .
*break*
the
book
was
too
big
to
steal
away
*punct* .
*break*
i
came
twice
and
could
not
find
it
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
will
you
let
me
go
*punct* ?
*break*
if
you
will
tell
me
where
and
how
to
seize
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* .
*break*
her
hands
dropped
and
she
took
a
backward
step
*punct* .
*break*
a
new
terror
was
to
be
read
in
her
face
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
not
*punct* !
*break*
i
dare
not
*punct* !
*break*
then
you
would
*punct* ,
if
you
dared
*punct* ?
*break*
she
was
watching
me
intently
*punct* .
*break*
not
if
you
would
go
to
find
him
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
with
all
that
i
thought
her
to
be
*punct* ,
the
stern
servant
of
justice
that
i
would
have
had
myself
*punct* ,
i
felt
the
hot
blood
leap
to
my
cheek
at
all
which
the
words
implied
*punct* .
*break*
she
grasped
my
arm
*punct* .
*break*
could
you
hide
me
from
him
if
i
came
to
you
*punct* ,
and
told
you
all
i
know
*punct* ?
*break*
the
authorities
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* !
*break*
her
expression
changed
*punct* .
*break*
they
can
put
me
on
the
rack
if
they
choose
*punct* ,
but
never
one
word
would
i
speak
*punct* ,
never
one
little
word
*punct* .
*break*
she
threw
up
her
head
scornfully
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
proud
glance
softened
again
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
will
speak
for
you
*punct* .
*break*
closer
she
came
*punct* ,
and
closer
*punct* ,
until
she
could
whisper
in
my
ear
*punct* .
*break*
hide
me
from
your
police
*punct* ,
from
him
*punct* ,
from
everybody
*punct* ,
and
i
will
no
longer
be
his
slave
*punct* .
*break*
my
heart
was
beating
with
painful
rapidity
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
not
counted
on
this
warring
with
a
woman
*punct* ;
moreover
*punct* ,
it
was
harder
than
i
could
have
dreamt
of
*punct* .
*break*
for
some
time
i
had
been
aware
that
by
the
charm
of
her
personality
and
the
art
of
her
pleading
she
bad
brought
me
down
from
my
judgment
seat
*punct* ,
had
made
it
all
but
impossible
for
me
to
give
her
up
to
justice
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
i
was
disarmed
*punct* ,
but
in
a
quandary
*punct* .
*break*
what
should
i
do
*punct* ?
*break*
what
could
i
do
*punct* ?
*break*
i
turned
away
from
her
and
walked
to
the
hearth
*punct* ,
in
which
some
paper
ash
lay
and
yet
emitted
a
faint
smell
*punct* .
*break*
not
more
than
ten
seconds
elapsed
*punct* ,
i
am
confident
*punct* ,
from
the
time
that
i
stepped
across
the
room
until
i
glanced
back
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
had
gone
*punct* !
*break*
as
i
leapt
to
the
door
the
key
turned
gently
from
the
outside
*punct* .
*break*
came
her
soft
whisper
*punct* ;
but
i
am
afraid
to
trust
you
*punct* ,
yet
*punct* .
*break*
be
comforted
*punct* ,
for
there
is
one
near
who
would
have
killed
you
had
i
wished
it
*punct* .
*break*
remember
*punct* ,
i
will
come
to
you
whenever
you
will
take
me
and
hide
me
*punct* .
*break*
light
footsteps
pattered
down
the
stairs
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
a
stifled
cry
from
mrs.
dolan
as
the
mysterious
visitor
ran
past
her
*punct* .
*break*
the
front
door
opened
and
closed
*punct* .
*break*
shen-yan's
is
a
dope-shop
in
one
of
the
burrows
off
the
old
ratcliff
highway
*punct* ,
said
inspector
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
singapore
charlie's
*punct* ,
they
call
it
*punct* .
*break*
it's
a
center
for
some
of
the
chinese
societies
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
but
all
sorts
of
opium-smokers
use
it
*punct* .
*break*
there
have
never
been
any
complaints
that
i
know
of
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
understand
this
*punct* .
*break*
we
stood
in
his
room
at
new
scotland
yard
*punct* ,
bending
over
a
sheet
of
foolscap
upon
which
were
arranged
some
burned
fragments
from
poor
cadby's
grate
*punct* ,
for
so
hurriedly
had
the
girl
done
her
work
that
combustion
had
not
been
complete
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
we
make
of
this
*punct* ?
*break*
said
smith
*punct* ...
hunchback
*punct* ...
lascar
went
up
*punct* ...
unlike
others
*punct* ...
not
return
*punct* ...
till
shen-yan
*punct* ,
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
name
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
turned
me
out
*punct* ...
booming
sound
*punct* ...
lascar
in
*punct* ...
mortuary
i
could
ident
*punct* ...
not
for
days
*punct* ,
or
suspici
*punct* ...
tuesday
night
in
a
different
make
*punct* ...
snatch
*punct* ...
pigtail
*punct* ...
the
pigtail
again
*punct* !
*break*
she
evidently
burned
the
torn-out
pages
all
together
*punct* ,
continued
smith
*punct* .
*break*
they
lay
flat
*punct* ,
and
this
was
in
the
middle
*punct* .
*break*
i
see
the
band
of
retributive
justice
in
that
*punct* ,
inspector
*punct* .
*break*
now
we
have
a
reference
to
a
hunchback
*punct* ,
and
what
follows
amounts
to
this
*punct* :
a
lascar
*punct* ,
amongst
several
other
persons
*punct* ,
went
up
somewhere
*punct* ,
presumably
upstairs
*punct* ,
at
shen-yan's
*punct* ,
and
did
not
come
down
again
*punct* .
*break*
cadby
*punct* ,
who
was
there
disguised
*punct* ,
noted
a
booming
sound
*punct* .
*break*
later
*punct* ,
he
identified
the
lascar
in
some
mortuary
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
no
means
of
fixing
the
date
of
this
visit
to
shen-yan's
*punct* ,
but
i
feel
inclined
to
put
down
the
lascar
as
the
dacoit
who
was
murdered
by
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
it
is
sheer
supposition
*punct* ,
however
*punct* .
*break*
but
that
cadby
meant
to
pay
another
visit
to
the
place
in
a
different
make-up
or
disguise
*punct* ,
is
evident
*punct* ,
and
that
the
tuesday
night
proposed
was
last
night
is
a
reasonable
deduction
*punct* .
*break*
the
reference
to
a
pigtail
is
principally
interesting
because
of
what
was
found
on
cadby's
body
*punct* .
*break*
inspector
weymouth
nodded
affirmatively
*punct* ,
and
smith
glanced
at
his
watch
*punct* .
*break*
exactly
ten-twenty-three
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
trouble
you
*punct* ,
inspector
*punct* ,
for
the
freedom
of
your
fancy
wardrobe
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
time
to
spend
an
hour
in
the
company
of
shen-yan's
opium
friends
*punct* .
*break*
weymouth
raised
his
eyebrows
*punct* .
*break*
it
might
be
risky
*punct* .
*break*
what
about
an
official
visit
*punct* ?
*break*
nayland
smith
laughed
*punct* .
*break*
worse
than
useless
*punct* !
*break*
by
your
own
showing
*punct* ,
the
place
is
open
to
inspection
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ;
guile
against
guile
*punct* !
*break*
we
are
dealing
with
a
chinaman
*punct* ,
with
the
incarnate
essence
of
eastern
subtlety
*punct* ,
with
the
most
stupendous
genius
that
the
modern
orient
has
produced
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
believe
in
disguises
*punct* ,
said
weymouth
*punct* ,
with
a
certain
truculence
*punct* .
*break*
it's
mostly
played
out
*punct* ,
that
game
*punct* ,
and
generally
leads
to
failure
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
if
you're
determined
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
there's
an
end
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
foster
will
make
your
face
up
*punct* .
*break*
what
disguise
do
you
propose
to
adopt
*punct* ?
*break*
a
sort
of
dago
seaman
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ;
something
like
poor
cadby
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
rely
on
my
knowledge
of
the
brutes
*punct* ,
if
i
am
sure
of
my
disguise
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
forgetting
me
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
to
me
quickly
*punct* .
*break*
petrie
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
it
is
my
business
*punct* ,
unfortunately
*punct* ,
but
it
is
no
sort
of
hobby
*punct* .
*break*
you
mean
that
you
can
no
longer
rely
upon
me
*punct* ?
*break*
i
said
angrily
*punct* .
*break*
smith
grasped
my
hand
*punct* ,
and
met
my
rather
frigid
stare
with
a
look
of
real
concern
on
his
gaunt
*punct* ,
bronzed
face
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
old
chap
*punct* ,
he
answered
*punct* ,
that
was
really
unkind
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
that
i
meant
something
totally
different
*punct* .
*break*
it's
all
right
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ;
i
said
*punct* ,
immediately
ashamed
of
my
choler
*punct* ,
and
wrung
his
hand
heartily
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
pretend
to
smoke
opium
as
well
as
another
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
be
going
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
inspector
*punct* .
*break*
as
a
result
of
this
little
passage
of
words
*punct* ,
some
twenty
minutes
later
two
dangerous-looking
seafaring
ruffians
entered
a
waiting
cab
*punct* ,
accompanied
by
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ,
and
were
driven
off
into
the
wilderness
of
london's
night
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
theatrical
business
there
was
*punct* ,
to
my
mind
*punct* ,
something
ridiculous
*punct* ,
almost
childish
*punct* ,
and
i
could
have
laughed
heartily
had
it
not
been
that
grim
tragedy
lurked
so
near
to
farce
*punct* .
*break*
the
mere
recollection
that
somewhere
at
our
journey's
end
fu-manchu
awaited
us
was
sufficient
to
sober
my
reflections
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
with
all
the
powers
represented
by
nayland
smith
pitted
against
him
*punct* ,
pursued
his
dark
schemes
triumphantly
*punct* ,
and
lurked
in
hiding
within
this
very
area
which
was
so
sedulously
patrolled
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
whom
i
had
never
seen
*punct* ,
but
whose
name
stood
for
horrors
indefinable
*punct* !
*break*
perhaps
i
was
destined
to
meet
the
terrible
chinese
doctor
to-night
*punct* .
*break*
i
ceased
to
pursue
a
train
of
thought
which
promised
to
lead
to
morbid
depths
*punct* ,
and
directed
my
attention
to
what
smith
was
saying
*punct* .
*break*
we
will
drop
down
from
wapping
and
reconnoiter
*punct* ,
as
you
say
the
place
is
close
to
the
riverside
*punct* .
*break*
then
you
can
put
us
ashore
somewhere
below
*punct* .
*break*
ryman
can
keep
the
launch
close
to
the
back
of
the
premises
*punct* ,
and
your
fellows
will
be
hanging
about
near
the
front
*punct* ,
near
enough
to
hear
the
whistle
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
assented
weymouth
*punct* ;
i've
arranged
for
that
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
are
suspected
*punct* ,
you
shall
give
the
alarm
*punct* ?
*break*
i
don't
know
*punct* ,
said
smith
thoughtfully
*punct* .
*break*
even
in
that
event
i
might
wait
awhile
*punct* .
*break*
don't
wait
too
long
*punct* ,
advised
the
inspector
*punct* .
*break*
we
shouldn't
be
much
wiser
if
your
next
appearance
was
on
the
end
of
a
grapnel
*punct* ,
somewhere
down
greenwich
reach
*punct* ,
with
half
your
fingers
missing
*punct* .
*break*
the
cab
pulled
up
outside
the
river
police
depot
*punct* ,
and
smith
and
i
entered
without
delay
*punct* ,
four
shabby-looking
fellows
who
had
been
seated
in
the
office
springing
up
to
salute
the
inspector
*punct* ,
who
followed
us
in
*punct* .
*break*
guthrie
and
lisle
*punct* ,
he
said
briskly
*punct* ,
get
along
and
find
a
dark
corner
which
commands
the
door
of
singapore
charlie's
off
the
old
highway
*punct* .
*break*
you
look
the
dirtiest
of
the
troupe
*punct* ,
guthrie
*punct* ;
you
might
drop
asleep
on
the
pavement
*punct* ,
and
lisle
can
argue
with
you
about
getting
home
*punct* .
*break*
don't
move
till
you
hear
the
whistle
inside
or
have
my
orders
*punct* ,
and
note
everybody
that
goes
in
and
comes
out
*punct* .
*break*
you
other
two
belong
to
this
division
*punct* ?
*break*
men
having
departed
*punct* ,
the
remaining
pair
saluted
again
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
you're
on
special
duty
to-night
*punct* .
*break*
you've
been
prompt
*punct* ,
but
don't
stick
your
chests
out
so
much
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
know
of
a
back
way
to
shen-yan's
*punct* ?
*break*
the
men
looked
at
one
another
*punct* ,
and
both
shook
their
heads
*punct* .
*break*
there's
an
empty
shop
nearly
opposite
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
one
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
a
broken
window
at
the
back
where
we
could
climb
in
*punct* .
*break*
then
we
could
get
through
to
the
front
and
watch
from
there
*punct* .
*break*
cried
the
inspector
*punct* .
*break*
see
you
are
not
spotted
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ;
and
if
you
hear
the
whistle
*punct* ,
don't
mind
doing
a
bit
of
damage
*punct* ,
but
be
inside
shen-yan's
like
lightning
*punct* .
*break*
otherwise
*punct* ,
wait
for
orders
*punct* .
*break*
inspector
ryman
came
in
*punct* ,
glancing
at
the
clock
*punct* .
*break*
launch
is
waiting
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
right
*punct* ,
replied
smith
thoughtfully
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
half
afraid
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
that
the
recent
alarms
may
have
scared
our
quarry
*punct* ,
your
man
*punct* ,
mason
*punct* ,
and
then
cadby
*punct* .
*break*
against
which
we
have
that
*punct* ,
so
far
as
he
is
likely
to
know
*punct* ,
there
has
been
no
clew
pointing
to
this
opium
den
*punct* .
*break*
remember
*punct* ,
he
thinks
cadby's
notes
are
destroyed
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
business
is
an
utter
mystery
to
me
*punct* ,
confessed
ryman
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
told
that
there's
some
dangerous
chinese
devil
hiding
somewhere
in
london
*punct* ,
and
that
you
expect
to
find
him
at
shen-yan's
*punct* .
*break*
supposing
he
uses
that
place
*punct* ,
which
is
possible
*punct* ,
how
do
you
know
he's
there
to-night
*punct* ?
*break*
i
don't
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* ;
but
it
is
the
first
clew
we
have
had
pointing
to
one
of
his
haunts
*punct* ,
and
time
means
precious
lives
where
dr.
fu-manchu
is
concerned
*punct* .
*break*
who
is
he
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
exactly
*punct* ,
this
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ?
*break*
i
have
only
the
vaguest
idea
*punct* ,
inspector
*punct* ;
but
he
is
no
ordinary
criminal
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
the
greatest
genius
which
the
powers
of
evil
have
put
on
earth
for
centuries
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
the
backing
of
a
political
group
whose
wealth
is
enormous
*punct* ,
and
his
mission
in
europe
is
to
pave
the
way
*punct* !
*break*
do
you
follow
me
*punct* ?
*break*
he
is
the
advance-agent
of
a
movement
so
epoch-making
that
not
one
britisher
*punct* ,
and
not
one
american
*punct* ,
in
fifty
thousand
has
ever
dreamed
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
ryman
stared
*punct* ,
but
made
no
reply
*punct* ,
and
we
went
out
*punct* ,
passing
down
to
the
breakwater
and
boarding
the
waiting
launch
*punct* .
*break*
with
her
crew
of
three
*punct* ,
the
party
numbered
seven
that
swung
out
into
the
pool
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
clearing
the
pier
*punct* ,
drew
in
again
and
hugged
the
murky
shore
*punct* .
*break*
the
night
had
been
clear
enough
hitherto
*punct* ,
but
now
came
scudding
rainbanks
to
curtain
the
crescent
moon
*punct* ,
and
anon
to
unveil
her
again
and
show
the
muddy
swirls
about
us
*punct* .
*break*
the
view
was
not
extensive
from
the
launch
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
a
deepening
of
the
near
shadows
would
tell
of
a
moored
barge
*punct* ,
or
lights
high
above
our
heads
mark
the
deck
of
a
large
vessel
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
floods
of
moonlight
gaunt
shapes
towered
above
*punct* ;
in
the
ensuing
darkness
only
the
oily
glitter
of
the
tide
occupied
the
foreground
of
the
night-piece
*punct* .
*break*
the
surrey
shore
was
a
broken
wall
of
blackness
*punct* ,
patched
with
lights
about
which
moved
hazy
suggestions
of
human
activity
*punct* .
*break*
the
bank
we
were
following
offered
a
prospect
even
more
gloomy
*punct* ,
a
dense
*punct* ,
dark
mass
*punct* ,
amid
which
*punct* ,
sometimes
*punct* ,
mysterious
half-tones
told
of
a
dock
gate
*punct* ,
or
sudden
high
lights
leapt
flaring
to
the
eye
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
out
of
the
mystery
ahead
*punct* ,
a
green
light
grew
and
crept
down
upon
us
*punct* .
*break*
a
giant
shape
loomed
up
*punct* ,
and
frowned
crushingly
upon
the
little
craft
*punct* .
*break*
a
blaze
of
light
*punct* ,
the
jangle
of
a
bell
*punct* ,
and
it
was
past
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
dancing
in
the
wash
of
one
of
the
scotch
steamers
*punct* ,
and
the
murk
had
fallen
again
*punct* .
*break*
discords
of
remote
activity
rose
above
the
more
intimate
throbbing
of
our
screw
*punct* ,
and
we
seemed
a
pigmy
company
floating
past
the
workshops
of
brobdingnagian
toilers
*punct* .
*break*
the
chill
of
the
near
water
communicated
itself
to
me
*punct* ,
and
i
felt
the
protection
of
my
shabby
garments
inadequate
against
it
*punct* .
*break*
far
over
on
the
surrey
shore
a
blue
light
*punct* ,
vaporous
*punct* ,
mysterious
*punct* ,
flicked
translucent
tongues
against
the
night's
curtain
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
weird
*punct* ,
elusive
flame
*punct* ,
leaping
*punct* ,
wavering
*punct* ,
magically
changing
from
blue
to
a
yellowed
violet
*punct* ,
rising
*punct* ,
falling
*punct* .
*break*
only
a
gasworks
*punct* ,
came
smith's
voice
*punct* ,
and
i
knew
that
he
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
had
been
watching
those
elfin
fires
*punct* .
*break*
the
simile
was
apt
*punct* ,
but
gruesome
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
of
dr.
fu-manchu
and
the
severed
fingers
*punct* ,
and
could
not
repress
a
shudder
*punct* .
*break*
on
your
left
*punct* ,
past
the
wooden
pier
*punct* !
*break*
not
where
the
lamp
is
*punct* ,
beyond
that
*punct* ;
next
to
the
dark
*punct* ,
square
building
*punct* ,
shen-yan's
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
inspector
ryman
speaking
*punct* .
*break*
drop
us
somewhere
handy
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
replied
smith
*punct* ,
and
lie
close
in
*punct* ,
with
your
ears
wide
open
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
have
to
run
for
it
*punct* ,
so
don't
go
far
away
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
tone
of
his
voice
i
knew
that
the
night
mystery
of
the
thames
had
claimed
at
least
one
other
victim
*punct* .
*break*
dead
slow
*punct* ,
came
ryman's
order
*punct* .
*break*
we'll
put
in
to
the
stone
stairs
*punct* .
*break*
a
seemingly
drunken
voice
was
droning
from
a
neighboring
alleyway
as
smith
lurched
in
hulking
fashion
to
the
door
of
a
little
shop
above
which
*punct* ,
crudely
painted
*punct* ,
were
the
words
*punct* :
shen-yan
*punct* ,
barber
*punct* .
*break*
i
shuffled
along
behind
him
*punct* ,
and
had
time
to
note
the
box
of
studs
*punct* ,
german
shaving
tackle
and
rolls
of
twist
which
lay
untidily
in
the
window
ere
smith
kicked
the
door
open
*punct* ,
clattered
down
three
wooden
steps
*punct* ,
and
pulled
himself
up
with
a
jerk
*punct* ,
seizing
my
arm
for
support
*punct* .
*break*
we
stood
in
a
bare
and
very
dirty
room
*punct* ,
which
could
only
claim
kinship
with
a
civilized
shaving-saloon
by
virtue
of
the
grimy
towel
thrown
across
the
back
of
the
solitary
chair
*punct* .
*break*
a
yiddish
theatrical
bill
of
some
kind
*punct* ,
illustrated
*punct* ,
adorned
one
of
the
walls
*punct* ,
and
another
bill
*punct* ,
in
what
may
have
been
chinese
*punct* ,
completed
the
decorations
*punct* .
*break*
from
behind
a
curtain
heavily
brocaded
with
filth
a
little
chinaman
appeared
*punct* ,
dressed
in
a
loose
smock
*punct* ,
black
trousers
and
thick-soled
slippers
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
advancing
*punct* ,
shook
his
head
vigorously
*punct* .
*break*
no
shavee
*punct* ,
no
shavee
*punct* ,
he
chattered
*punct* ,
simian
fashion
*punct* ,
squinting
from
one
to
the
other
of
us
with
his
twinkling
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
don't
you
come
none
of
it
wi
me
*punct* !
*break*
roared
smith
*punct* ,
in
a
voice
of
amazing
gruffness
*punct* ,
and
shook
an
artificially
dirtied
fist
under
the
chinaman's
nose
*punct* .
*break*
get
inside
and
gimme

mate

*break*
smokee

*break*
my
friend
bent
forward
and
glared
into
the
other's
eyes
with
a
vindictiveness
that
amazed
me
*punct* ,
unfamiliar
as
i
was
with
this
form
of
gentle
persuasion
*punct* .
*break*
kop
old
o
that
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
and
thrust
a
coin
into
the
chinaman's
yellow
paw
*punct* .
*break*
keep

waitin
an

*break*
no

began
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
smith
raised
his
fist
*punct* ,
and
yan
capitulated
*punct* .
*break*
allee
lightee
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
full
up
*punct* ,
no
loom
*punct* .
*break*
you
come
see
*punct* .
*break*
he
dived
behind
the
dirty
curtain
*punct* ,
smith
and
i
following
*punct* ,
and
ran
up
a
dark
stair
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
moment
i
found
myself
in
an
atmosphere
which
was
literally
poisonous
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
all
but
unbreathable
*punct* ,
being
loaded
with
opium
fumes
*punct* .
*break*
never
before
had
i
experienced
anything
like
it
*punct* .
*break*
every
breath
was
an
effort
*punct* .
*break*
a
tin
oil-lamp
on
a
box
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
dimly
illuminated
the
horrible
place
*punct* ,
about
the
walls
of
which
ten
or
twelve
bunks
were
ranged
and
all
of
them
occupied
*punct* .
*break*
most
of
the
occupants
were
lying
motionless
*punct* ,
but
one
or
two
were
squatting
in
their
bunks
noisily
sucking
at
the
little
metal
pipes
*punct* .
*break*
these
had
not
yet
attained
to
the
opium-smoker's
nirvana
*punct* .
*break*
no
loom
*punct* ,
samee
tella
you
*punct* ,
said
shen-yan
*punct* ,
complacently
testing
smith's
shilling
with
his
yellow
*punct* ,
decayed
teeth
*punct* .
*break*
smith
walked
to
a
corner
and
dropped
cross-legged
*punct* ,
on
the
floor
*punct* ,
pulling
me
down
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
two
pipe
quick
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
two
piecee
pipe
*punct* ,
or
plenty
heap
trouble
*punct* .
*break*
a
dreary
voice
from
one
of
the
bunks
came
*punct* :
give
im
a
pipe
*punct* ,
charlie
*punct* ,
curse
yer
*punct* !
*break*
an
stop
is
palaver
*punct* .
*break*
yan
performed
a
curious
little
shrug
*punct* ,
rather
of
the
back
than
of
the
shoulders
*punct* ,
and
shuffled
to
the
box
which
bore
the
smoky
lamp
*punct* .
*break*
holding
a
needle
in
the
flame
*punct* ,
he
dipped
it
*punct* ,
when
red-hot
*punct* ,
into
an
old
cocoa
tin
*punct* ,
and
withdrew
it
with
a
bead
of
opium
adhering
to
the
end
*punct* .
*break*
slowly
roasting
this
over
the
lamp
*punct* ,
he
dropped
it
into
the
bowl
of
the
metal
pipe
which
he
held
ready
*punct* ,
where
it
burned
with
a
spirituous
blue
flame
*punct* .
*break*
pass
it
over
*punct* ,
said
smith
huskily
*punct* ,
and
rose
on
his
knees
with
the
assumed
eagerness
of
a
slave
to
the
drug
*punct* .
*break*
yan
handed
him
the
pipe
*punct* ,
which
he
promptly
put
to
his
lips
*punct* ,
and
prepared
another
for
me
*punct* .
*break*
whatever
you
do
*punct* ,
don't
inhale
any
*punct* ,
came
smith's
whispered
injunction
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
with
a
sense
of
nausea
greater
even
than
that
occasioned
by
the
disgusting
atmosphere
of
the
den
that
i
took
the
pipe
and
pretended
to
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
taking
my
cue
from
my
friend
*punct* ,
i
allowed
my
head
gradually
to
sink
lower
and
lower
*punct* ,
until
*punct* ,
within
a
few
minutes
*punct* ,
i
sprawled
sideways
on
the
floor
*punct* ,
smith
lying
close
beside
me
*punct* .
*break*
the
ship's
sinkin'
*punct* ,
droned
a
voice
from
one
of
the
bunks
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
the
rats
*punct* .
*break*
yan
had
noiselessly
withdrawn
*punct* ,
and
i
experienced
a
curious
sense
of
isolation
from
my
fellows
*punct* ,
from
the
whole
of
the
western
world
*punct* .
*break*
my
throat
was
parched
with
the
fumes
*punct* ,
my
head
ached
*punct* .
*break*
the
vicious
atmosphere
seemed
contaminating
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
as
one
dropped
*punct* ,
somewhere
east
of
suez
*punct* ,
where
the
best
is
like
the
worst
*punct* ,
and
there
ain't
no
ten
commandments
and
a
man
can
raise
a
thirst
*punct* .
*break*
smith
began
to
whisper
softly
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
carried
it
through
successfully
so
far
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
if
you
have
observed
it
*punct* ,
but
there
is
a
stair
just
behind
you
*punct* ,
half
concealed
by
a
ragged
curtain
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
near
that
*punct* ,
and
well
in
the
dark
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
seen
nothing
suspicious
so
far
*punct* ,
or
nothing
much
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
there
was
anything
going
forward
it
would
no
doubt
be
delayed
until
we
new
arrivals
were
well
doped
*punct* .
*break*
s-sh!>
he
pressed
my
arm
to
emphasize
the
warning
*punct* .
*break*
through
my
half-closed
eyes
i
perceived
a
shadowy
form
near
the
curtain
to
which
he
had
referred
*punct* .
*break*
i
lay
like
a
log
*punct* ,
but
my
muscles
were
tensed
nervously
*punct* .
*break*
the
shadow
materialized
as
the
figure
moved
forward
into
the
room
with
a
curiously
lithe
movement
*punct* .
*break*
the
smoky
lamp
in
the
middle
of
the
place
afforded
scant
illumination
*punct* ,
serving
only
to
indicate
sprawling
shapes
*punct* ,
here
an
extended
hand
*punct* ,
brown
or
yellow
*punct* ,
there
a
sketchy
*punct* ,
corpse-like
face
*punct* ;
whilst
from
all
about
rose
obscene
sighings
and
murmurings
in
far-away
voices
*punct* ,
an
uncanny
*punct* ,
animal
chorus
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
like
a
glimpse
of
the
inferno
seen
by
some
chinese
dante
*punct* .
*break*
but
so
close
to
us
stood
the
newcomer
that
i
was
able
to
make
out
a
ghastly
parchment
face
*punct* ,
with
small
*punct* ,
oblique
eyes
*punct* ,
and
a
misshapen
head
crowned
with
a
coiled
pigtail
*punct* ,
surmounting
a
slight
*punct* ,
hunched
body
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
something
unnatural
*punct* ,
inhuman
*punct* ,
about
that
masklike
face
*punct* ,
and
something
repulsive
in
the
bent
shape
and
the
long
*punct* ,
yellow
hands
clasped
one
upon
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
from
smith's
account
*punct* ,
in
no
way
resembled
this
crouching
apparition
with
the
death's-head
countenance
and
lithe
movements
*punct* ;
but
an
instinct
of
some
kind
told
me
that
we
were
on
the
right
scent
*punct* ,
that
this
was
one
of
the
doctor's
servants
*punct* .
*break*
how
i
came
to
that
conclusion
*punct* ,
i
cannot
explain
*punct* ;
but
with
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
this
was
a
member
of
the
formidable
murder
group
*punct* ,
i
saw
the
yellow
man
creep
nearer
*punct* ,
nearer
*punct* ,
silently
*punct* ,
bent
and
peering
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
watching
us
*punct* .
*break*
of
another
circumstance
i
became
aware
*punct* ,
and
a
disquieting
circumstance
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
fewer
murmurings
and
sighings
from
the
surrounding
bunks
*punct* .
*break*
the
presence
of
the
crouching
figure
had
created
a
sudden
semi-silence
in
the
den
*punct* ,
which
could
only
mean
that
some
of
the
supposed
opium-smokers
had
merely
feigned
coma
and
the
approach
of
coma
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
lay
like
a
dead
man
*punct* ,
and
trusting
to
the
darkness
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
lay
prone
and
still
*punct* ,
but
watched
the
evil
face
bending
lower
and
lower
*punct* ,
until
it
came
within
a
few
inches
of
my
own
*punct* .
*break*
i
completely
closed
my
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
delicate
fingers
touched
my
right
eyelid
*punct* .
*break*
divining
what
was
coming
*punct* ,
i
rolled
my
eyes
up
*punct* ,
as
the
lid
was
adroitly
lifted
and
lowered
again
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
moved
away
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
saved
the
situation
*punct* !
*break*
and
noting
anew
the
hush
about
me
*punct* ,
a
hush
in
which
i
fancied
many
pairs
of
ears
listened
*punct* ,
i
was
glad
*punct* .
*break*
for
just
a
moment
i
realized
fully
how
*punct* ,
with
the
place
watched
back
and
front
*punct* ,
we
yet
were
cut
off
*punct* ,
were
in
the
hands
of
far
easterns
*punct* ,
to
some
extent
in
the
power
of
members
of
that
most
inscrutably
mysterious
race
*punct* ,
the
chinese
*punct* .
*break*
good
*punct* ,
whispered
smith
at
my
side
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
think
i
could
have
done
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
took
me
on
trust
after
that
*punct* .
*break*
what
an
awful
face
*punct* .
*break*
petrie
*punct* ,
it's
the
hunchback
of
cadby's
notes
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
i
thought
so
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
see
that
*punct* ?
*break*
i
turned
my
eyes
round
as
far
as
was
possible
*punct* .
*break*
a
man
had
scrambled
down
from
one
of
the
bunks
and
was
following
the
bent
figure
across
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
they
passed
around
us
quietly
*punct* ,
the
little
yellow
man
leading
*punct* ,
with
his
curious
*punct* ,
lithe
gait
*punct* ,
and
the
other
*punct* ,
an
impassive
chinaman
*punct* ,
following
*punct* .
*break*
the
curtain
was
raised
*punct* ,
and
i
heard
footsteps
receding
on
the
stairs
*punct* .
*break*
don't
stir
*punct* ,
whispered
smith
*punct* .
*break*
an
intense
excitement
was
clearly
upon
him
*punct* ,
and
he
communicated
it
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
who
was
the
occupant
of
the
room
above
*punct* ?
*break*
footsteps
on
the
stair
*punct* ,
and
the
chinaman
reappeared
*punct* ,
recrossed
the
floor
*punct* ,
and
went
out
*punct* .
*break*
the
little
*punct* ,
bent
man
went
over
to
another
bunk
*punct* ,
this
time
leading
up
the
stair
one
who
looked
like
a
lascar
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
see
his
right
hand
*punct* ?
*break*
they
come
here
to
report
and
to
take
orders
*punct* .
*break*
petrie
*punct* ,
dr.
fu-manchu
is
up
there
*punct* .
*break*
what
shall
we
do?
*punct* ,
softly
*punct* .
*break*
then
we
must
try
to
rush
the
stairs
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
futile
to
bring
in
the
police
first
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
sure
to
have
some
other
exit
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
give
the
word
while
the
little
yellow
devil
is
down
here
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
nearer
and
will
have
to
go
first
*punct* ,
but
if
the
hunchback
follows
*punct* ,
i
can
then
deal
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
our
whispered
colloquy
was
interrupted
by
the
return
of
the
dacoit
*punct* ,
who
recrossed
the
room
as
the
chinaman
had
done
*punct* ,
and
immediately
took
his
departure
*punct* .
*break*
a
third
man
*punct* ,
whom
smith
identified
as
a
malay
*punct* ,
ascended
the
mysterious
stairs
*punct* ,
descended
*punct* ,
and
went
out
*punct* ;
and
a
fourth
*punct* ,
whose
nationality
it
was
impossible
to
determine
*punct* ,
followed
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
as
the
softly
moving
usher
crossed
to
a
bunk
on
the
right
of
the
outer
door
*punct* ,
up
you
go
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
cried
smith
*punct* ,
for
further
delay
was
dangerous
and
further
dissimulation
useless
*punct* .
*break*
i
leaped
to
my
feet
*punct* .
*break*
snatching
my
revolver
from
the
pocket
of
the
rough
jacket
i
wore
*punct* ,
i
bounded
to
the
stair
and
went
blundering
up
in
complete
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
a
chorus
of
brutish
cries
clamored
from
behind
*punct* ,
with
a
muffled
scream
rising
above
them
all
*punct* .
*break*
but
nayland
smith
was
close
behind
as
i
raced
along
a
covered
gangway
*punct* ,
in
a
purer
air
*punct* ,
and
at
my
heels
when
i
crashed
open
a
door
at
the
end
and
almost
fell
into
the
room
beyond
*punct* .
*break*
what
i
saw
were
merely
a
dirty
table
*punct* ,
with
some
odds
and
ends
upon
it
of
which
i
was
too
excited
to
take
note
*punct* ,
an
oil-lamp
swung
by
a
brass
chain
above
*punct* ,
and
a
man
sitting
behind
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
but
from
the
moment
that
my
gaze
rested
upon
the
one
who
sat
there
*punct* ,
i
think
if
the
place
had
been
an
aladdin's
palace
i
should
have
had
no
eyes
for
any
of
its
wonders
*punct* .
*break*
he
wore
a
plain
yellow
robe
*punct* ,
of
a
hue
almost
identical
with
that
of
his
smooth
*punct* ,
hairless
countenance
*punct* .
*break*
his
hands
were
large
*punct* ,
long
and
bony
*punct* ,
and
he
held
them
knuckles
upward
*punct* ,
and
rested
his
pointed
chin
upon
their
thinness
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
great
*punct* ,
high
brow
*punct* ,
crowned
with
sparse
*punct* ,
neutral-colored
hair
*punct* .
*break*
of
his
face
*punct* ,
as
it
looked
out
at
me
over
the
dirty
table
*punct* ,
i
despair
of
writing
convincingly
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
that
of
an
archangel
of
evil
*punct* ,
and
it
was
wholly
dominated
by
the
most
uncanny
eyes
that
ever
reflected
a
human
soul
*punct* ,
for
they
were
narrow
and
long
*punct* ,
very
slightly
oblique
*punct* ,
and
of
a
brilliant
green
*punct* .
*break*
but
their
unique
horror
lay
in
a
certain
filminess
*punct* ,
it
made
me
think
of
the
membrana
nictitans
in
a
bird
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
obscuring
them
as
i
threw
wide
the
door
*punct* ,
seemed
to
lift
as
i
actually
passed
the
threshold
*punct* ,
revealing
the
eyes
in
all
their
brilliant
iridescence
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
that
i
stopped
dead
*punct* ,
one
foot
within
the
room
*punct* ,
for
the
malignant
force
of
the
man
was
something
surpassing
my
experience
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
surprised
by
this
sudden
intrusion
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
but
no
trace
of
fear
showed
upon
that
wonderful
face
*punct* ,
only
a
sort
of
pitying
contempt
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
as
i
paused
*punct* ,
he
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
*punct* ,
never
removing
his
gaze
from
mine
*punct* .
*break*
cried
smith
over
my
shoulder
*punct* ,
in
a
voice
that
was
almost
a
scream
*punct* .
*break*
shoot
him
dead
if
*punct* ,
the
conclusion
of
that
sentence
i
never
heard
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
fu-manchu
reached
down
beside
the
table
*punct* ,
and
the
floor
slipped
from
under
me
*punct* .
*break*
one
last
glimpse
i
had
of
the
fixed
green
eyes
*punct* ,
and
with
a
scream
i
was
unable
to
repress
i
dropped
*punct* ,
dropped
*punct* ,
dropped
*punct* ,
and
plunged
into
icy
water
*punct* ,
which
closed
over
my
head
*punct* .
*break*
vaguely
i
had
seen
a
spurt
of
flame
*punct* ,
had
heard
another
cry
following
my
own
*punct* ,
a
booming
sound
*punct* ,
the
trap
*punct* ,
the
flat
note
of
a
police
whistle
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
i
rose
to
the
surface
impenetrable
darkness
enveloped
me
*punct* ;
i
was
spitting
filthy
*punct* ,
oily
liquid
from
my
mouth
*punct* ,
and
fighting
down
the
black
terror
that
had
me
by
the
throat
*punct* ,
terror
of
the
darkness
about
me
*punct* ,
of
the
unknown
depths
beneath
me
*punct* ,
of
the
pit
into
which
i
was
cast
amid
stifling
stenches
and
the
lapping
of
tidal
water
*punct* .
*break*
i
cried
*punct* ...
help
*punct* !
*break*
my
voice
seemed
to
beat
back
upon
me
*punct* ,
yet
i
was
about
to
cry
out
again
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
mustering
all
my
presence
of
mind
and
all
my
failing
courage
*punct* ,
i
recognized
that
i
had
better
employment
of
my
energies
*punct* ,
and
began
to
swim
straight
ahead
*punct* ,
desperately
determined
to
face
all
the
horrors
of
this
place
*punct* ,
to
die
hard
if
die
i
must
*punct* .
*break*
a
drop
of
liquid
fire
fell
through
the
darkness
and
hissed
into
the
water
beside
me
*punct* !
*break*
i
felt
that
*punct* ,
despite
my
resolution
*punct* ,
i
was
going
mad
*punct* .
*break*
another
fiery
drop
*punct* ,
and
another
*punct* !
*break*
i
touched
a
rotting
wooden
post
and
slimy
timbers
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
reached
one
bound
of
my
watery
prison
*punct* .
*break*
more
fire
fell
from
above
*punct* ,
and
the
scream
of
hysteria
quivered
*punct* ,
unuttered
*punct* ,
in
my
throat
*punct* .
*break*
keeping
myself
afloat
with
increasing
difficulty
in
my
heavy
garments
*punct* ,
i
threw
my
head
back
and
raised
my
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
no
more
drops
fell
*punct* ,
and
no
more
drops
would
fall
*punct* ;
but
it
was
merely
a
question
of
time
for
the
floor
to
collapse
*punct* .
*break*
for
it
was
beginning
to
emit
a
dull
*punct* ,
red
glow
*punct* .
*break*
the
room
above
me
was
in
flames
*punct* !
*break*
it
was
drops
of
burning
oil
from
the
lamp
*punct* ,
finding
passage
through
the
cracks
in
the
crazy
flooring
*punct* ,
which
had
fallen
about
me
*punct* ,
for
the
death
trap
had
reclosed
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
mechanically
*punct* .
*break*
my
saturated
garments
were
dragging
me
down
*punct* ,
and
now
i
could
hear
the
flames
hungrily
eating
into
the
ancient
rottenness
overhead
*punct* .
*break*
shortly
that
cauldron
would
be
loosed
upon
my
head
*punct* .
*break*
the
glow
of
the
flames
grew
brighter
*punct* ...
and
showed
me
the
half-rotten
piles
upholding
the
building
*punct* ,
showed
me
the
tidal
mark
upon
the
slime-coated
walls
*punct* ,
showed
me
that
there
was
no
escape
*punct* !
*break*
by
some
subterranean
duct
the
foul
place
was
fed
from
the
thames
*punct* .
*break*
by
that
duct
*punct* ,
with
the
outgoing
tide
*punct* ,
my
body
would
pass
*punct* ,
in
the
wake
of
mason
*punct* ,
cadby
*punct* ,
and
many
another
victim
*punct* !
*break*
rusty
iron
rungs
were
affixed
to
one
of
the
walls
communicating
with
a
trap
*punct* ,
but
the
bottom
three
were
missing
*punct* !
*break*
brighter
and
brighter
grew
the
awesome
light
the
light
of
what
should
be
my
funeral
pyre
*punct* ,
reddening
the
oily
water
and
adding
a
new
dread
to
the
whispering
*punct* ,
clammy
horror
of
the
pit
*punct* .
*break*
but
something
it
showed
me
*punct* ...
a
projecting
beam
a
few
feet
above
the
water
*punct* ...
and
directly
below
the
iron
ladder
*punct* !
*break*
have
i
the
strength
*punct* ?
*break*
a
desire
for
laughter
claimed
me
with
sudden
*punct* ,
all
but
irresistible
force
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
what
it
portended
and
fought
it
down
*punct* ,
grimly
*punct* ,
sternly
*punct* .
*break*
my
garments
weighed
upon
me
like
a
suit
of
mail
*punct* ;
with
my
chest
aching
dully
*punct* ,
my
veins
throbbing
to
bursting
*punct* ,
i
forced
tired
muscles
to
work
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
every
stroke
an
agony
*punct* ,
approached
the
beam
*punct* .
*break*
nearer
i
swam
*punct* ...
nearer
*punct* .
*break*
its
shadow
fell
black
upon
the
water
*punct* ,
which
now
had
all
the
seeming
of
a
pool
of
blood
*punct* .
*break*
confused
sounds
*punct* ,
a
remote
uproar
*punct* ,
came
to
my
ears
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
nearly
spent
*punct* ...
i
was
in
the
shadow
of
the
beam
*punct* !
*break*
if
i
could
throw
up
one
arm
*punct* ...
a
shrill
scream
sounded
far
above
me
*punct* !
*break*
*punct* ,
that
voice
must
be
smith's!
*punct* ,
don't
touch
the
beam
*punct* !
*break*
for
god's
sake
don't
touch
the
beam
*punct* !
*break*
keep
afloat
another
few
seconds
and
i
can
get
to
you
*punct* !
*break*
another
few
seconds
*punct* !
*break*
was
that
possible
*punct* ?
*break*
i
managed
to
turn
*punct* ,
to
raise
my
throbbing
head
*punct* ;
and
i
saw
the
strangest
sight
which
that
night
yet
had
offered
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
stood
upon
the
lowest
iron
rung
*punct* ...
supported
by
the
hideous
*punct* ,
crook-backed
chinaman
*punct* ,
who
stood
upon
the
rung
above
*punct* !
*break*
i
can't
reach
him
*punct* !
*break*
it
was
as
smith
hissed
the
words
despairingly
that
i
looked
up
*punct* ,
and
saw
the
chinaman
snatch
at
his
coiled
pigtail
and
pull
it
off
*punct* !
*break*
with
it
came
the
wig
to
which
it
was
attached
*punct* ;
and
the
ghastly
yellow
mask
*punct* ,
deprived
of
its
fastenings
*punct* ,
fell
from
position
*punct* !
*break*
you
can
lower
this
to
him
*punct* !
*break*
a
cloud
of
hair
came
falling
about
the
slim
shoulders
as
the
speaker
bent
to
pass
this
strange
lifeline
to
smith
*punct* ;
and
i
think
it
was
my
wonder
at
knowing
her
for
the
girl
whom
that
day
i
had
surprised
in
cadby's
rooms
which
saved
my
life
*punct* .
*break*
for
i
not
only
kept
afloat
*punct* ,
but
kept
my
gaze
upturned
to
that
beautiful
*punct* ,
flushed
face
*punct* ,
and
my
eyes
fixed
upon
hers
*punct* ,
which
were
wild
with
fear
*punct* ...
for
me
*punct* !
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
by
some
contortion
*punct* ,
got
the
false
queue
into
my
grasp
*punct* ,
and
i
*punct* ,
with
the
strength
of
desperation
*punct* ,
by
that
means
seized
hold
upon
the
lowest
rung
*punct* .
*break*
with
my
friend's
arm
round
me
i
realized
that
exhaustion
was
even
nearer
than
i
had
supposed
*punct* .
*break*
my
last
distinct
memory
is
of
the
bursting
of
the
floor
above
and
the
big
burning
joist
hissing
into
the
pool
beneath
us
*punct* .
*break*
its
fiery
passage
*punct* ,
striated
with
light
*punct* ,
disclosed
two
sword
blades
*punct* ,
riveted
*punct* ,
edges
up
along
the
top
of
the
beam
which
i
had
striven
to
reach
*punct* .
*break*
the
severed
fingers
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ;
and
swooned
*punct* .
*break*
how
smith
got
me
through
the
trap
i
do
not
know
*punct* ,
nor
how
we
made
our
way
through
the
smoke
and
flames
of
the
narrow
passage
it
opened
upon
*punct* .
*break*
my
next
recollection
is
of
sitting
up
*punct* ,
with
my
friend's
arm
supporting
me
and
inspector
ryman
holding
a
glass
to
my
lips
*punct* .
*break*
a
bright
glare
dazzled
my
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
a
crowd
surged
about
us
*punct* ,
and
a
clangor
and
shouting
drew
momentarily
nearer
*punct* .
*break*
it's
the
engines
coming
*punct* ,
explained
smith
*punct* ,
seeing
my
bewilderment
*punct* .
*break*
shen-yan's
is
in
flames
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
your
shot
*punct* ,
as
you
fell
through
the
trap
*punct* ,
broke
the
oil-lamp
*punct* .
*break*
is
everybody
out
*punct* ?
*break*
so
far
as
we
know
*punct* .
*break*
smith
shrugged
his
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
has
seen
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
some
door
at
the
back
*punct* ,
do
you
think
he
may
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
he
said
tensely
*punct* .
*break*
not
until
i
see
him
lying
dead
before
me
shall
i
believe
it
*punct* .
*break*
then
memory
resumed
its
sway
*punct* .
*break*
i
struggled
to
my
feet
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
where
is
she
*punct* ?
*break*
where
is
she
*punct* ?
*break*
i
don't
know
*punct* ,
be
answered
*punct* .
*break*
she's
given
us
the
slip
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ,
said
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ,
as
a
fire-engine
came
swinging
round
the
corner
of
the
narrow
lane
*punct* .
*break*
so
has
mr.
singapore
charlie
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
i'm
afraid
*punct* ,
somebody
else
*punct* .
*break*
we've
got
six
or
eight
all-sorts
*punct* ,
some
awake
and
some
asleep
*punct* ,
but
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
let
em
go
again
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
smith
tells
me
that
the
girl
was
disguised
as
a
chinaman
*punct* .
*break*
i
expect
that's
why
she
managed
to
slip
away
*punct* .
*break*
i
recalled
how
i
had
been
dragged
from
the
pit
by
the
false
queue
*punct* ,
how
the
strange
discovery
which
had
brought
death
to
poor
cadby
had
brought
life
to
me
*punct* ,
and
i
seemed
to
remember
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
that
smith
had
dropped
it
as
he
threw
his
arm
about
me
on
the
ladder
*punct* .
*break*
her
mask
the
girl
might
have
retained
*punct* ,
but
her
wig
*punct* ,
i
felt
certain
*punct* ,
had
been
dropped
into
the
water
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
later
that
night
*punct* ,
when
the
brigade
still
were
playing
*punct* ,
upon
the
blackened
shell
of
what
had
been
shen-yan's
opium-shop
*punct* ,
and
smith
and
i
were
speeding
away
in
a
cab
from
the
scene
of
god
knows
how
many
crimes
*punct* ,
that
i
had
an
idea
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
did
you
bring
the
pigtail
with
you
that
was
found
on
cadby
*punct* ?
*break*
i
had
hoped
to
meet
the
owner
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
got
it
now
*punct* ?
*break*
i
met
the
owner
*punct* .
*break*
i
thrust
my
hands
deep
into
the
pockets
of
the
big
pea-jacket
lent
to
me
by
inspector
ryman
*punct* ,
leaning
back
in
my
corner
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
never
really
excel
at
this
business
*punct* ,
continued
nayland
smith
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
far
too
sentimental
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
what
it
meant
to
us
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
what
it
meant
to
the
world
*punct* ,
but
i
hadn't
the
heart
*punct* .
*break*
i
owed
her
your
life
*punct* ,
i
had
to
square
the
account
*punct* .
*break*
night
fell
on
redmoat
*punct* .
*break*
i
glanced
from
the
window
at
the
nocturne
in
silver
and
green
which
lay
beneath
me
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
west
of
the
shrubbery
*punct* ,
with
its
broken
canopy
of
elms
and
beyond
the
copper
beech
which
marked
the
center
of
its
mazes
*punct* ,
a
gap
offered
a
glimpse
of
the
waverney
where
it
swept
into
a
broad
*punct* .
*break*
faint
bird-calls
floated
over
the
water
*punct* .
*break*
these
*punct* ,
with
the
whisper
of
leaves
*punct* ,
alone
claimed
the
ear
*punct* .
*break*
ideal
rural
peace
*punct* ,
and
the
music
of
an
english
summer
evening
*punct* ;
but
to
my
eyes
*punct* ,
every
shadow
holding
fantastic
terrors
*punct* ;
to
my
ears
*punct* ,
every
sound
a
signal
of
dread
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
deathful
hand
of
fu-manchu
was
stretched
over
redmoat
*punct* ,
at
any
hour
to
loose
strange
*punct* ,
oriental
horrors
upon
its
inmates
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
joining
me
at
the
window
*punct* ,
we
had
dared
to
hope
him
dead
*punct* ,
but
we
know
now
that
he
lives
*punct* !
*break*
eltham
coughed
nervously
*punct* ,
and
i
turned
*punct* ,
leaning
my
elbow
upon
the
table
*punct* ,
and
studied
the
play
of
expression
upon
the
refined
*punct* ,
sensitive
face
of
the
clergyman
*punct* .
*break*
you
think
i
acted
rightly
in
sending
for
you
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
nayland
smith
smoked
furiously
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
eltham
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
you
see
in
me
a
man
groping
in
the
dark
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
to-day
no
nearer
to
the
conclusion
of
my
mission
than
upon
the
day
when
i
left
mandalay
*punct* .
*break*
you
offer
me
a
clew
*punct* ;
i
am
here
*punct* .
*break*
your
affair
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
stands
thus
*punct* :
a
series
of
attempted
burglaries
*punct* ,
or
something
of
the
kind
*punct* ,
has
alarmed
your
household
*punct* .
*break*
yesterday
*punct* ,
returning
from
london
with
your
daughter
*punct* ,
you
were
both
drugged
in
some
way
and
*punct* ,
occupying
a
compartment
to
yourselves
*punct* ,
you
both
slept
*punct* .
*break*
your
daughter
awoke
*punct* ,
and
saw
someone
else
in
the
carriage
*punct* ,
a
yellow-faced
man
who
held
a
case
of
instruments
in
his
hands
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ;
i
was
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
unable
to
enter
into
particulars
over
the
telephone
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
was
standing
by
one
of
the
windows
*punct* .
*break*
directly
he
observed
that
my
daughter
was
awake
*punct* ,
he
stepped
towards
her
*punct* .
*break*
what
did
he
do
with
the
case
in
his
hands
*punct* ?
*break*
she
did
not
notice
*punct* ,
or
did
not
mention
having
noticed
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
as
was
natural
*punct* ,
she
was
so
frightened
that
she
recalls
nothing
more
*punct* ,
beyond
the
fact
that
she
strove
to
arouse
me
*punct* ,
without
succeeding
*punct* ,
felt
hands
grasp
her
shoulders
*punct* ,
and
swooned
*punct* .
*break*
but
someone
used
the
emergency
cord
*punct* ,
and
stopped
the
train
*punct* .
*break*
greba
has
no
recollection
of
having
done
so
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
*punct* ,
no
yellow-faced
man
was
on
the
train
*punct* .
*break*
when
did
you
awake
*punct* ?
*break*
i
was
aroused
by
the
guard
*punct* ,
but
only
when
he
had
repeatedly
shaken
me
*punct* .
*break*
upon
reaching
great
yarmouth
you
immediately
called
up
scotland
yard
*punct* ?
*break*
you
acted
very
wisely
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
how
long
were
you
in
china
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
eltham's
start
of
surprise
was
almost
comical
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
perhaps
not
strange
that
you
should
be
aware
of
my
residence
in
china
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ;
but
my
not
having
mentioned
it
may
seem
so
*punct* .
*break*
the
fact
is
*punct* ,
his
sensitive
face
flushed
in
palpable
embarrassment
*punct* ,
i
left
china
under
what
i
may
term
an
episcopal
cloud
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
lived
in
retirement
ever
since
*punct* .
*break*
unwittingly
*punct* ,
i
solemnly
declare
to
you
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
unwittingly
*punct* ,
i
stirred
up
certain
deep-seated
prejudices
in
my
endeavors
to
do
my
duty
*punct* ,
my
duty
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
you
asked
me
how
long
i
was
in
china
*punct* ?
*break*
i
was
there
from
1896
until
1900
*punct* ,
four
years
*punct* .
*break*
i
recall
the
circumstances
*punct* ,
mr.
eltham
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* ,
with
an
odd
note
in
his
voice
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
been
endeavoring
to
think
where
i
had
come
across
the
name
*punct* ,
and
a
moment
ago
i
remembered
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
happy
to
have
met
you
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
the
clergyman
blushed
again
like
a
girl
*punct* ,
and
slightly
inclined
his
head
*punct* ,
with
its
scanty
fair
hair
*punct* .
*break*
has
redmoat
*punct* ,
as
its
name
implies
*punct* ,
a
moat
round
it
*punct* ?
*break*
i
was
unable
to
see
in
the
dusk
*punct* .
*break*
redmoat
*punct* ,
a
corruption
of
round
moat
*punct* ,
was
formerly
a
priory
*punct* ,
disestablished
by
the
eighth
henry
in
1536
*punct* .
*break*
his
pedantic
manner
was
quaint
at
times
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
moat
is
no
longer
flooded
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
we
grow
cabbages
in
part
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
refer
to
the
strategic
strength
of
the
place
*punct* ,
he
smiled
*punct* ,
but
his
manner
was
embarrassed
again
*punct* ,
it
is
considerable
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
barbed
wire
fencing
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
other
arrangements
*punct* .
*break*
you
see
*punct* ,
it
is
a
lonely
spot
*punct* ,
he
added
apologetically
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
*punct* ,
if
you
will
excuse
me
*punct* ,
we
will
resume
these
gruesome
inquiries
after
the
more
pleasant
affairs
of
dinner
*punct* .
*break*
he
left
us
*punct* .
*break*
who
is
our
host
*punct* ?
*break*
i
asked
*punct* ,
as
the
door
closed
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
wondering
what
caused
the
episcopal
cloud
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
the
deep-seated
prejudices
which
our
reverend
friend
stirred
up
culminated
in
the
boxer
risings
*punct* .
*break*
good
heavens
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* !
*break*
i
said
*punct* ;
for
i
could
not
reconcile
the
diffident
personality
of
the
clergyman
with
the
memories
which
those
words
awakened
*punct* .
*break*
he
evidently
should
be
on
our
danger
list
*punct* ,
my
friend
continued
quickly
*punct* ;
but
he
has
so
completely
effaced
himself
of
recent
years
that
i
think
it
probable
that
someone
else
has
only
just
recalled
his
existence
to
mind
*punct* .
*break*
eltham
*punct* ,
my
dear
petrie
*punct* ,
though
he
may
be
a
poor
hand
at
saving
souls
*punct* ,
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
has
saved
a
score
of
christian
women
from
death
*punct* ,
and
worse
*punct* .
*break*
eltham
*punct* ,
i
began
*punct* .
*break*
is
parson
dan'
*punct* !
*break*
rapped
smith
*punct* ,
the
fighting
missionary
*punct* ,
the
man
who
with
a
garrison
of
a
dozen
cripples
and
a
german
doctor
held
the
hospital
a
nan-yang
against
two
hundred
boxers
*punct* .
*break*
that's
who
th
rev
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
is
he
up
to
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
i
have
yet
to
find
out
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
keeping
something
back
*punct* ,
something
which
has
made
him
an
object
of
interest
to
young
china
*punct* !
*break*
during
dinner
the
matters
responsible
for
our
presence
there
did
not
hold
priority
in
the
conversation
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
this
*punct* ,
for
the
most
part
*punct* ,
consisted
in
light
talk
of
books
and
theaters
*punct* .
*break*
greba
eltham
*punct* ,
the
clergyman's
daughter
*punct* ,
was
a
charming
young
hostess
*punct* ,
and
she
*punct* ,
with
vernon
denby
*punct* ,
mr.
eltham's
nephew
*punct* ,
completed
the
party
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
the
girl's
presence
*punct* ,
in
part
*punct* ,
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
led
us
to
refrain
from
the
subject
uppermost
in
our
minds
*punct* .
*break*
these
little
pools
of
calm
dotted
along
the
torrential
course
of
the
circumstances
which
were
bearing
my
friend
and
i
onward
to
unknown
issues
form
pleasant
*punct* ,
sunny
spots
in
my
dark
recollections
*punct* .
*break*
so
i
shall
always
remember
*punct* ,
with
pleasure
*punct* ,
that
dinner-party
at
redmoat
*punct* ,
in
the
old-world
dining-room
*punct* ;
it
was
so
very
peaceful
*punct* ,
so
almost
grotesquely
calm
*punct* .
*break*
for
i
*punct* ,
within
my
very
bones
*punct* ,
felt
it
to
be
the
calm
before
the
storm
*punct* .
*break*
when
*punct* ,
later
*punct* ,
we
men
passed
to
the
library
*punct* ,
we
seemed
to
leave
that
atmosphere
behind
us
*punct* .
*break*
redmoat
*punct* ,
said
the
rev
*punct* .
*break*
eltham
*punct* ,
has
latterly
become
the
theater
of
strange
doings
*punct* .
*break*
he
stood
on
the
hearth-rug
*punct* .
*break*
a
shaded
lamp
upon
the
big
table
and
candles
in
ancient
sconces
upon
the
mantelpiece
afforded
dim
illumination
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
eltham's
nephew
*punct* ,
vernon
denby
*punct* ,
lolled
smoking
on
the
window-seat
*punct* ,
and
i
sat
near
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
paced
restlessly
up
and
down
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
some
mouths
ago
*punct* ,
almost
a
year
*punct* ,
continued
the
clergyman
*punct* ,
a
burglarious
attempt
was
made
upon
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
an
arrest
*punct* ,
and
the
man
confessed
that
he
had
been
tempted
by
my
collection
*punct* .
*break*
he
waved
his
hand
vaguely
towards
the
several
cabinets
about
the
shadowed
room
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
shortly
afterwards
that
i
allowed
my
hobby
for
*punct* ,
playing
at
forts
to
run
away
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
he
smiled
an
apology
*punct* .
*break*
i
virtually
fortified
redmoat
*punct* ,
against
trespassers
of
any
kind
*punct* ,
i
mean
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
seen
that
the
house
stands
upon
a
kind
of
large
mound
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
artificial
*punct* ,
being
the
buried
ruins
of
a
roman
outwork
*punct* ;
a
portion
of
the
ancient
castrum
*punct* .
*break*
again
he
waved
indicatively
*punct* ,
this
time
toward
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
when
it
was
a
priory
it
was
completely
isolated
and
defended
by
its
environing
moat
*punct* .
*break*
today
it
is
completely
surrounded
by
barbed-wire
fencing
*punct* .
*break*
below
this
fence
*punct* ,
on
the
east
*punct* ,
is
a
narrow
stream
*punct* ,
a
tributary
of
the
waverney
*punct* ;
on
the
north
and
west
*punct* ,
the
high
road
*punct* ,
but
nearly
twenty
feet
below
*punct* ,
the
banks
being
perpendicular
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
south
is
the
remaining
part
of
the
moat
*punct* ,
now
my
kitchen
garden
*punct* ;
but
from
there
up
to
the
level
of
the
house
is
nearly
twenty
feet
again
*punct* ,
and
the
barbed
wire
must
also
be
counted
with
*punct* .
*break*
the
entrance
*punct* ,
as
you
know
*punct* ,
is
by
the
way
of
a
kind
of
cutting
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
a
gate
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
*punct* ,
they
are
some
of
the
original
steps
of
the
priory
*punct* ,
dr.
petrie
*punct* ,
and
another
gate
at
the
head
*punct* .
*break*
he
paused
*punct* ,
and
smiled
around
upon
us
boyishly
*punct* .
*break*
my
secret
defenses
remain
to
be
mentioned
*punct* ,
he
resumed
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
opening
a
cupboard
*punct* ,
he
pointed
to
a
row
of
batteries
*punct* ,
with
a
number
of
electric
bells
upon
the
wall
behind
*punct* .
*break*
the
more
vulnerable
spots
are
connected
at
night
with
these
bells
*punct* ,
he
said
triumphantly
*punct* .
*break*
any
attempt
to
scale
the
barbed
wire
or
to
force
either
gate
would
set
two
or
more
of
these
ringing
*punct* .
*break*
a
stray
cow
raised
one
false
alarm
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* ,
and
a
careless
rook
threw
us
into
a
perfect
panic
on
another
occasion
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
so
boyish
*punct* ,
so
nervously
brisk
and
acutely
sensitive
*punct* ,
that
it
was
difficult
to
see
in
him
the
hero
of
the
nan-yang
hospital
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
only
suppose
that
he
had
treated
the
boxers
raid
in
the
same
spirit
wherein
he
met
would-be
trespassers
within
the
precincts
of
redmoat
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
been
an
escapade
*punct* ,
of
which
he
was
afterwards
ashamed
*punct* ,
as
*punct* ,
faintly
*punct* ,
he
was
ashamed
of
his
fortifications
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
rapped
smith
*punct* ,
it
was
not
the
visit
of
the
burglar
which
prompted
these
elaborate
precautions
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
eltham
coughed
nervously
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
aware
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
that
having
invoked
official
aid
*punct* ,
i
must
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
burglar
who
was
responsible
for
my
continuing
the
wire
fence
all
round
the
grounds
*punct* ,
but
the
electrical
contrivance
followed
*punct* ,
later
*punct* ,
as
a
result
of
several
disturbed
nights
*punct* .
*break*
my
servants
grew
uneasy
about
someone
who
came
*punct* ,
they
said
*punct* ,
after
dusk
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
could
describe
this
nocturnal
visitor
*punct* ,
but
certainly
we
found
traces
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
admit
that
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
i
received
what
i
may
term
a
warning
*punct* .
*break*
my
position
is
a
peculiar
one
*punct* ,
a
peculiar
one
*punct* .
*break*
my
daughter
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
saw
this
prowling
*punct* ,
person
*punct* ,
over
by
the
roman
castrum
*punct* ,
and
described
him
as
a
yellow
man
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
incident
in
the
train
following
closely
upon
this
other
*punct* ,
which
led
me
to
speak
to
the
police
*punct* ,
little
as
i
desired
to
*punct* ,
er
*punct* ,
court
publicity
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
walked
to
a
window
*punct* ,
and
looked
out
across
the
sloping
lawn
to
where
the
shadows
of
the
shrubbery
lay
*punct* .
*break*
a
dog
was
howling
dismally
somewhere
*punct* .
*break*
your
defenses
are
not
impregnable
*punct* ,
after
all
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ?
*break*
on
our
way
up
this
evening
mr.
denby
was
telling
us
about
the
death
of
his
collie
a
few
nights
ago
*punct* .
*break*
the
clergyman's
face
clouded
*punct* .
*break*
that
*punct* ,
certainly
*punct* ,
was
alarming
*punct* ,
he
confessed
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
been
in
london
for
a
few
days
*punct* ,
and
during
my
absence
vernon
came
down
*punct* ,
bringing
the
dog
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
night
of
his
arrival
it
ran
*punct* ,
barking
*punct* ,
into
the
shrubbery
yonder
*punct* ,
and
did
not
come
out
*punct* .
*break*
he
went
to
look
for
it
with
a
lantern
*punct* ,
and
found
it
lying
among
the
bushes
*punct* ,
quite
dead
*punct* .
*break*
the
poor
creature
had
been
dreadfully
beaten
about
the
head
*punct* .
*break*
the
gates
were
locked
*punct* ,
denby
interrupted
*punct* ,
and
no
one
could
have
got
out
of
the
grounds
without
a
ladder
and
someone
to
assist
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
was
so
sign
of
a
living
thing
about
*punct* .
*break*
edwards
and
i
searched
every
corner
*punct* .
*break*
how
long
has
that
other
dog
taken
to
howling
*punct* ?
*break*
only
since
rex's
death
*punct* ,
said
denby
quickly
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
my
mastiff
*punct* ,
explained
the
clergyman
*punct* ,
and
he
is
confined
in
the
yard
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
never
allowed
on
this
side
of
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
library
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
press
you
*punct* ,
mr.
eltham
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
but
what
was
the
nature
of
the
warning
to
which
you
referred
*punct* ,
and
from
whom
did
it
come
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
eltham
hesitated
for
a
long
time
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
been
so
unfortunate
*punct* ,
he
said
at
last
*punct* ,
in
my
previous
efforts
*punct* ,
that
i
feel
assured
of
your
hostile
criticism
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
contemplating
an
immediate
return
to
ho-nan
*punct* !
*break*
smith
jumped
round
upon
him
as
though
moved
by
a
spring
*punct* .
*break*
then
you
are
going
back
to
nan-yang
*punct* ?
*break*
now
i
understand
*punct* !
*break*
why
have
you
not
told
me
before
*punct* ?
*break*
that
is
the
key
for
which
i
have
vainly
been
seeking
*punct* .
*break*
your
troubles
date
from
the
time
of
your
decision
to
return
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
must
admit
it
*punct* ,
confessed
the
clergyman
diffidently
*punct* .
*break*
and
your
warning
came
from
china
*punct* ?
*break*
from
a
chinaman
*punct* ?
*break*
from
the
mandarin
*punct* ,
yen-sun-yat
*punct* .
*break*
my
good
sir
*punct* !
*break*
he
warned
you
to
abandon
your
visit
*punct* ?
*break*
and
you
reject
his
advice
*punct* ?
*break*
listen
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
smith
was
intensely
excited
now
*punct* ,
his
eyes
bright
*punct* ,
his
lean
figure
curiously
strung
up
*punct* ,
alert
*punct* .
*break*
the
mandarin
yen-sun-yat
is
one
of
the
seven
*punct* !
*break*
i
do
not
follow
you
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
china
to-day
is
not
the
china
of
98
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
huge
secret
machine
*punct* ,
and
ho-nan
one
of
its
most
important
wheels
*punct* !
*break*
but
if
*punct* ,
as
i
understand
*punct* ,
this
official
is
a
friend
of
yours
*punct* ,
believe
me
*punct* ,
he
has
saved
your
life
*punct* !
*break*
you
would
be
a
dead
man
now
if
it
were
not
for
your
friend
in
china
*punct* !
*break*
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
you
must
accept
his
counsel
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
made
his
acquaintance
*punct* ,
parson
dan
showed
through
the
surface
of
the
rev
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
replied
the
clergyman
*punct* ,
and
the
change
in
his
voice
was
startling
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
called
to
nan-yang
*punct* .
*break*
only
one
may
deter
my
going
*punct* .
*break*
the
admixture
of
deep
spiritual
reverence
with
intense
truculence
in
his
voice
was
dissimilar
from
anything
i
ever
had
heard
*punct* .
*break*
then
only
one
can
protect
you
*punct* ,
cried
smith
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
by
heaven
*punct* ,
no
man
will
be
able
to
do
so
*punct* !
*break*
your
presence
in
ho-nan
can
do
no
possible
good
at
present
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
do
harm
*punct* .
*break*
your
experience
in
1900
should
be
fresh
in
your
memory
*punct* .
*break*
hard
words
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* .
*break*
the
class
of
missionary
work
which
you
favor
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
is
injurious
to
international
peace
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
present
moment
*punct* ,
ho-nan
is
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
*punct* ;
you
would
be
the
lighted
match
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
willingly
stand
between
any
man
and
what
he
chooses
to
consider
his
duty
*punct* ,
but
i
insist
that
you
abandon
your
visit
to
the
interior
of
china
*punct* !
*break*
you
insist
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
as
your
guest
*punct* ,
i
regret
the
necessity
for
reminding
you
that
i
hold
authority
to
enforce
it
*punct* .
*break*
denby
fidgeted
uneasily
*punct* .
*break*
the
tone
of
the
conversation
was
growing
harsh
and
the
atmosphere
of
the
library
portentous
with
brewing
*punct* ,
storms
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
short
*punct* ,
silent
interval
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
what
i
had
feared
and
expected
*punct* ,
said
the
clergyman
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
my
reason
for
not
seeking
official
protection
*punct* .
*break*
the
phantom
yellow
peril
*punct* ,
said
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
to-day
materializes
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
western
world
*punct* .
*break*
the
yellow
peril'
*punct* !
*break*
you
scoff
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
and
so
do
others
*punct* .
*break*
we
take
the
proffered
right
hand
of
friendship
nor
inquire
if
the
hidden
left
holds
a
knife
*punct* !
*break*
the
peace
of
the
world
is
at
stake
*punct* ,
mr.
eltham
*punct* .
*break*
unknowingly
*punct* ,
you
tamper
with
tremendous
issues
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
eltham
drew
a
deep
breath
*punct* ,
thrusting
both
hands
in
his
pockets
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
painfully
frank
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ;
but
i
like
you
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
reconsider
my
position
and
talk
this
matter
over
again
with
you
to-morrow
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
the
storm
blew
over
*punct* .
*break*
yet
i
had
never
experienced
such
an
overwhelming
sense
of
imminent
peril
*punct* ,
of
a
sinister
presence
*punct* ,
as
oppressed
me
at
that
moment
*punct* .
*break*
the
very
atmosphere
of
redmoat
was
impregnated
with
eastern
devilry
*punct* ;
it
loaded
the
air
like
some
evil
perfume
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
*punct* ,
through
the
silence
*punct* ,
cut
a
throbbing
scream
*punct* ,
the
scream
of
a
woman
in
direst
fear
*punct* .
*break*
my
god
*punct* ,
it's
greba
*punct* !
*break*
whispered
mr.
eltham
*punct* .
*break*
in
what
order
we
dashed
down
to
the
drawing-room
i
cannot
recall
*punct* .
*break*
but
none
was
before
me
when
i
leaped
over
the
threshold
and
saw
miss
eltham
prone
by
the
french
windows
*punct* .
*break*
these
were
closed
and
bolted
*punct* ,
and
she
lay
with
hands
outstretched
in
the
alcove
which
they
formed
*punct* .
*break*
i
bent
over
her
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
was
at
my
elbow
*punct* .
*break*
get
my
bag
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
she
has
swooned
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
nothing
serious
*punct* .
*break*
her
father
*punct* ,
pale
and
wide-eyed
*punct* ,
hovered
about
me
*punct* ,
muttering
incoherently
*punct* ;
but
i
managed
to
reassure
him
*punct* ;
and
his
gratitude
when
*punct* ,
i
having
administered
a
simple
restorative
*punct* ,
the
girl
sighed
shudderingly
and
opened
her
eyes
*punct* ,
was
quite
pathetic
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
permit
no
questioning
at
that
time
*punct* ,
and
on
her
father's
arm
she
retired
to
her
own
rooms
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
some
fifteen
minutes
later
that
her
message
was
brought
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
followed
the
maid
to
a
quaint
little
octagonal
apartment
*punct* ,
and
greba
eltham
stood
before
me
*punct* ,
the
candlelight
caressing
the
soft
curves
of
her
face
and
gleaming
in
the
meshes
of
her
rich
brown
hair
*punct* .
*break*
when
she
had
answered
my
first
question
she
hesitated
in
pretty
confusion
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
anxious
to
know
what
alarmed
you
*punct* ,
miss
eltham
*punct* .
*break*
she
bit
her
lip
and
glanced
with
apprehension
towards
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
almost
afraid
to
tell
father
*punct* ,
she
began
rapidly
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
think
me
imaginative
*punct* ,
but
you
have
been
so
kind
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
two
green
eyes
*punct* !
*break*
dr.
petrie
*punct* ,
they
looked
up
at
me
from
the
steps
leading
to
the
lawn
*punct* .
*break*
and
they
shone
like
the
eyes
of
a
cat
*punct* .
*break*
the
words
thrilled
me
strangely
*punct* .
*break*
are
you
sure
it
was
not
a
cat
*punct* ,
miss
eltham
*punct* ?
*break*
the
eyes
were
too
large
*punct* ,
dr.
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
something
dreadful
*punct* ,
most
dreadful
*punct* ,
in
their
appearance
*punct* .
*break*
i
feel
foolish
and
silly
for
having
fainted
*punct* ,
twice
in
two
days
*punct* !
*break*
but
the
suspense
is
telling
upon
me
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* .
*break*
father
thinks
*punct* ,
she
was
becoming
charmingly
confidential
*punct* ,
as
a
woman
often
will
with
a
tactful
physician
*punct* ,
that
shut
up
here
we
are
safe
from
*punct* ,
whatever
threatens
us
*punct* .
*break*
i
noted
*punct* ,
with
concern
*punct* ,
a
repetition
of
the
nervous
shudder
*punct* .
*break*
but
since
our
return
someone
else
has
been
in
redmoat
*punct* !
*break*
whatever
do
you
mean
*punct* ,
miss
eltham
*punct* ?
*break*
i
don't
quite
know
what
i
do
mean
*punct* ,
dr.
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
what
does
it
all
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
vernon
has
been
explaining
to
me
that
some
awful
chinaman
is
seeking
the
life
of
mr.
nayland
smith
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
the
same
man
wants
to
kill
my
father
*punct* ,
why
has
he
not
done
so
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
afraid
you
puzzle
me
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
*punct* ,
i
must
do
so
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
the
man
in
the
train
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
have
killed
us
both
quite
easily
*punct* !
*break*
and
*punct* ,
last
night
someone
was
in
father's
room
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
room
*punct* !
*break*
i
could
not
sleep
*punct* ,
and
i
heard
something
moving
*punct* .
*break*
my
room
is
the
next
one
*punct* .
*break*
i
knocked
on
the
wall
and
woke
father
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
nothing
*punct* ;
so
i
said
it
was
the
howling
of
the
dog
that
had
frightened
me
*punct* .
*break*
how
*punct* ,
could
anyone
get
into
his
room
*punct* ?
*break*
i
cannot
imagine
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
am
not
sure
it
was
a
man
*punct* .
*break*
miss
eltham
*punct* ,
you
alarm
me
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
suspect
*punct* ?
*break*
you
must
think
me
hysterical
and
silly
*punct* ,
but
whilst
father
and
i
have
been
away
from
redmoat
perhaps
the
usual
precautions
have
been
neglected
*punct* .
*break*
is
there
any
creature
*punct* ,
any
large
creature
*punct* ,
which
could
climb
up
the
wall
to
the
window
*punct* ?
*break*
do
you
know
of
anything
with
a
long
*punct* ,
thin
body
*punct* ?
*break*
for
a
moment
i
offered
no
reply
*punct* ,
studying
the
girl's
pretty
face
*punct* ,
her
eager
*punct* ,
blue-gray
eyes
widely
opened
and
fixed
upon
mine
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
not
of
the
neurotic
type
*punct* ,
with
her
clear
complexion
and
sun-kissed
neck
*punct* ;
her
arms
*punct* ,
healthily
toned
by
exposure
to
the
country
airs
*punct* ,
were
rounded
and
firm
*punct* ,
and
she
had
the
agile
shape
of
a
young
diana
with
none
of
the
anaemic
languor
which
breeds
morbid
dreams
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
frightened
*punct* ;
yes
*punct* ,
who
would
not
have
been
*punct* ?
*break*
but
the
mere
idea
of
this
thing
which
she
believed
to
be
in
redmoat
*punct* ,
without
the
apparition
of
the
green
eyes
*punct* ,
must
have
prostrated
a
victim
of
nerves
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
seen
such
a
creature
*punct* ,
miss
eltham
*punct* ?
*break*
she
hesitated
again
*punct* ,
glancing
down
and
pressing
her
finger-tips
together
*punct* .
*break*
as
father
awoke
and
called
out
to
know
why
i
knocked
*punct* ,
i
glanced
from
my
window
*punct* .
*break*
the
moonlight
threw
half
the
lawn
into
shadow
*punct* ,
and
just
disappearing
in
this
shadow
was
something
*punct* ,
something
of
a
brown
color
*punct* ,
marked
with
sections
*punct* !
*break*
what
size
and
shape
*punct* ?
*break*
it
moved
so
quickly
i
could
form
no
idea
of
its
shape
*punct* ;
but
i
saw
quite
six
feet
of
it
flash
across
the
grass
*punct* !
*break*
did
you
hear
anything
*punct* ?
*break*
a
swishing
sound
in
the
shrubbery
*punct* ,
then
nothing
more
*punct* .
*break*
she
met
my
eyes
expectantly
*punct* .
*break*
her
confidence
in
my
powers
of
understanding
and
sympathy
was
gratifying
*punct* ,
though
i
knew
that
i
but
occupied
the
position
of
a
father-confessor
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
any
idea
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
how
it
came
about
that
you
awoke
in
the
train
yesterday
whilst
your
father
did
not
*punct* ?
*break*
we
had
coffee
at
a
refreshment-room
*punct* ;
it
must
have
been
drugged
in
some
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
scarcely
tasted
mine
*punct* ,
the
flavor
was
so
awful
*punct* ;
but
father
is
an
old
traveler
and
drank
the
whole
of
his
cupful
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
eltham's
voice
called
from
below
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
petrie
*punct* ,
said
the
girl
quickly
*punct* ,
what
do
you
think
they
want
to
do
to
him
*punct* ?
*break*
i
replied
*punct* ,
i
wish
i
knew
that
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
think
over
what
i
have
told
you
*punct* ?
*break*
for
i
do
assure
you
there
is
something
here
in
redmoat
*punct* ,
something
that
comes
and
goes
in
spite
of
father's
fortifications'
*punct* ?
*break*
caesar
knows
there
is
*punct* .
*break*
listen
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
drags
at
his
chain
so
that
i
wonder
he
does
not
break
it
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
passed
downstairs
the
howling
of
the
mastiff
sounded
eerily
through
the
house
*punct* ,
as
did
the
clank-clank
of
the
tightening
chain
as
he
threw
the
weight
of
his
big
body
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
sat
in
smith's
room
that
night
for
some
time
*punct* ,
he
pacing
the
floor
smoking
and
talking
*punct* .
*break*
eltham
has
influential
chinese
friends
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ;
but
they
dare
not
have
him
in
nan-yang
at
present
*punct* .
*break*
he
knows
the
country
as
he
knows
norfolk
*punct* ;
he
would
see
things
*punct* !
*break*
his
precautions
here
have
baffled
the
enemy
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* .
*break*
the
attempt
in
the
train
points
to
an
anxiety
to
waste
no
opportunity
*punct* .
*break*
but
whilst
eltham
was
absent
*punct* ,
he
was
getting
his
outfit
in
london
*punct* ,
by
the
way
*punct* ,
they
have
been
fixing
some
second
string
to
their
fiddle
here
*punct* .
*break*
in
case
no
opportunity
offered
before
he
returned
*punct* ,
they
provided
for
getting
at
him
here
*punct* !
*break*
but
how
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
that's
the
mystery
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
dead
dog
in
the
shrubbery
is
significant
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
think
some
emissary
of
fu-manchu
is
actually
inside
the
moat
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
impossible
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
thinking
of
secret
passages
*punct* ,
and
so
forth
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
none
*punct* .
*break*
eltham
has
measured
up
every
foot
of
the
place
*punct* .
*break*
there
isn't
a
rathole
left
unaccounted
for
*punct* ;
and
as
for
a
tunnel
under
the
moat
*punct* ,
the
house
stands
on
a
solid
mass
of
roman
masonry
*punct* ,
a
former
camp
of
hadrian's
time
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
seen
a
very
old
plan
of
the
round
moat
priory
as
it
was
called
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
entrance
and
no
exit
save
by
the
steps
*punct* .
*break*
so
how
was
the
dog
killed
*punct* ?
*break*
i
knocked
out
my
pipe
on
a
bar
of
the
grate
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
in
the
thick
of
it
here
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
always
in
the
thick
of
it
*punct* ,
replied
smith
*punct* .
*break*
our
danger
is
no
greater
in
norfolk
than
in
london
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
do
they
want
to
do
*punct* ?
*break*
that
man
in
the
train
with
the
case
of
instruments
*punct* ,
what
instruments
*punct* ?
*break*
then
the
apparition
of
the
green
eyes
to-night
*punct* .
*break*
can
they
have
been
the
eyes
of
fu-manchu
*punct* ?
*break*
is
some
peculiarly
unique
outrage
contemplated
*punct* ,
something
calling
for
the
presence
of
the
master
*punct* ?
*break*
he
may
have
to
prevent
eltham's
leaving
england
without
killing
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
probably
has
instructions
to
be
merciful
*punct* .
*break*
but
god
help
the
victim
of
chinese
mercy
*punct* !
*break*
i
went
to
my
own
room
then
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
did
not
even
undress
*punct* ,
refilling
my
pipe
and
seating
myself
at
the
open
window
*punct* .
*break*
having
looked
upon
the
awful
chinese
doctor
*punct* ,
the
memory
of
his
face
*punct* ,
with
its
filmed
green
eyes
*punct* ,
could
never
leave
me
*punct* .
*break*
the
idea
that
he
might
be
near
at
that
moment
was
a
poor
narcotic
*punct* .
*break*
the
howling
and
baying
of
the
mastiff
was
almost
continuous
*punct* .
*break*
when
all
else
in
redmoat
was
still
the
dog's
mournful
note
yet
rose
on
the
night
with
something
menacing
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
sat
looking
out
across
the
sloping
turf
to
where
the
shrubbery
showed
as
a
black
island
in
a
green
sea
*punct* .
*break*
the
moon
swam
in
a
cloudless
sky
*punct* ,
and
the
air
was
warm
and
fragrant
with
country
scents
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
in
the
shrubbery
that
denby's
collie
had
met
his
mysterious
death
*punct* ,
that
the
thing
seen
by
miss
eltham
had
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
what
uncanny
secret
did
it
hold
*punct* ?
*break*
caesar
became
silent
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
stopping
of
a
clock
will
sometimes
awaken
a
sleeper
*punct* ,
the
abrupt
cessation
of
that
distant
howling
*punct* ,
to
which
i
had
grown
accustomed
*punct* ,
now
recalled
me
from
a
world
of
gloomy
imaginings
*punct* .
*break*
i
glanced
at
my
watch
in
the
moonlight
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
twelve
minutes
past
midnight
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
replaced
it
the
dog
suddenly
burst
out
afresh
*punct* ,
but
now
in
a
tone
of
sheer
anger
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
alternately
howling
and
snarling
in
a
way
that
sounded
new
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
the
crashes
*punct* ,
as
he
leapt
to
the
end
of
his
chain
*punct* ,
shook
the
building
in
which
he
was
confined
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
as
i
stood
up
to
lean
from
the
window
and
commanded
a
view
of
the
corner
of
the
house
that
he
broke
loose
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
hoarse
bay
he
took
that
decisive
leap
*punct* ,
and
i
heard
his
heavy
body
fall
against
the
wooden
wall
*punct* .
*break*
there
followed
a
strange
*punct* ,
guttural
cry
*punct* ...
and
the
growling
of
the
dog
died
away
at
the
rear
of
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
out
*punct* !
*break*
but
that
guttural
note
had
not
come
from
the
throat
of
a
dog
*punct* .
*break*
of
what
was
he
in
pursuit
*punct* ?
*break*
at
which
point
his
mysterious
quarry
entered
the
shrubbery
i
do
not
know
*punct* .
*break*
i
only
know
that
i
saw
absolutely
nothing
*punct* ,
until
caesar's
lithe
shape
was
streaked
across
the
lawn
*punct* ,
and
the
great
creature
went
crashing
into
the
undergrowth
*punct* .
*break*
then
a
faint
sound
above
and
to
my
right
told
me
that
i
was
not
the
only
spectator
of
the
scene
*punct* .
*break*
i
leaned
farther
from
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
is
that
you
*punct* ,
miss
eltham
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
dr.
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
so
glad
you
are
awake
*punct* .
*break*
can
we
do
nothing
to
help
*punct* ?
*break*
caesar
will
be
killed
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
see
what
he
went
after
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
she
called
back
*punct* ,
and
drew
her
breath
sharply
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
strange
figure
went
racing
across
the
grass
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
that
of
a
man
in
a
blue
dressing-gown
*punct* ,
who
held
a
lantern
high
before
him
*punct* ,
and
a
revolver
in
his
right
hand
*punct* .
*break*
coincident
with
my
recognition
of
mr.
eltham
he
leaped
*punct* ,
plunging
into
the
shrubbery
in
the
wake
of
the
dog
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
night
held
yet
another
surprise
*punct* ;
for
nayland
smith's
voice
came
*punct* :
come
back
*punct* !
*break*
come
back
*punct* ,
eltham
*punct* !
*break*
i
ran
out
into
the
passage
and
downstairs
*punct* .
*break*
the
front
door
was
open
*punct* .
*break*
a
terrible
conflict
waged
in
the
shrubbery
*punct* ,
between
the
mastiff
and
something
else
*punct* .
*break*
passing
round
to
the
lawn
*punct* ,
i
met
smith
fully
dressed
*punct* .
*break*
he
just
had
dropped
from
a
first-floor
window
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
is
mad
*punct* !
*break*
heaven
knows
what
lurks
there
*punct* !
*break*
he
should
not
have
gone
alone
*punct* !
*break*
together
we
ran
towards
the
dancing
light
of
eltham's
lantern
*punct* .
*break*
the
sounds
of
conflict
ceased
suddenly
*punct* .
*break*
stumbling
over
stumps
and
lashed
by
low-sweeping
branches
*punct* ,
we
struggled
forward
to
where
the
clergyman
knelt
amongst
the
bushes
*punct* .
*break*
he
glanced
up
with
tears
in
his
eyes
*punct* ,
as
was
revealed
by
the
dim
light
*punct* .
*break*
the
body
of
the
dog
lay
at
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
pitiable
to
think
that
the
fearless
brute
should
have
met
his
death
in
such
a
fashion
*punct* ,
and
when
i
bent
and
examined
him
i
was
glad
to
find
traces
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
drag
him
out
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
not
dead
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
and
hurry
*punct* ,
rapped
smith
*punct* ,
peering
about
him
right
and
left
*punct* .
*break*
so
we
three
hurried
from
that
haunted
place
*punct* ,
dragging
the
dog
with
us
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
not
molested
*punct* .
*break*
no
sound
disturbed
the
now
perfect
stillness
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
lawn
edge
we
came
upon
denby
*punct* ,
half
dressed
*punct* ;
and
almost
immediately
edwards
the
gardener
also
appeared
*punct* .
*break*
the
white
faces
of
the
house
servants
showed
at
one
window
*punct* ,
and
miss
eltham
called
to
me
from
her
room
*punct* :
is
he
dead
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* ;
only
stunned
*punct* .
*break*
we
carried
the
dog
round
to
the
yard
*punct* ,
and
i
examined
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
been
struck
by
some
heavy
blunt
instrument
*punct* ,
but
the
skull
was
not
broken
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
hard
to
kill
a
mastiff
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
attend
to
him
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ?
*break*
we
must
see
that
the
villain
does
not
escape
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
was
grim
and
set
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
a
different
man
from
the
diffident
clergyman
we
knew
*punct* :
this
was
parson
dan
again
*punct* .
*break*
i
accepted
the
care
of
the
canine
patient
*punct* ,
and
eltham
with
the
others
went
off
for
more
lights
to
search
the
shrubbery
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
was
washing
a
bad
wound
between
the
mastiff's
ears
*punct* ,
miss
eltham
joined
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
sound
of
her
voice
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
rather
than
my
more
scientific
ministration
*punct* ,
which
recalled
caesar
to
life
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
as
she
entered
*punct* ,
his
tail
wagged
feebly
*punct* ,
and
a
moment
later
he
struggled
to
his
feet
*punct* ,
one
of
which
was
injured
*punct* .
*break*
having
provided
for
his
immediate
needs
*punct* ,
i
left
him
in
charge
of
his
young
mistress
and
joined
the
search
party
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
entered
the
shrubbery
from
four
points
and
drawn
blank
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
absolutely
nothing
there
*punct* ,
and
no
one
can
possibly
have
left
the
grounds
*punct* ,
said
eltham
amazedly
*punct* .
*break*
we
stood
on
the
lawn
looking
at
one
another
*punct* ,
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
angry
but
thoughtful
*punct* ,
tugging
at
the
lobe
of
his
left
ear
*punct* ,
as
was
his
habit
in
moments
of
perplexity
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
first
coming
of
light
*punct* ,
eltham
*punct* ,
smith
and
i
tested
the
electrical
contrivances
from
every
point
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
in
perfect
order
*punct* .
*break*
it
became
more
and
more
incomprehensible
how
anyone
could
have
entered
and
quitted
redmoat
during
the
night
*punct* .
*break*
the
barbed-wire
fencing
was
intact
*punct* ,
and
bore
no
signs
of
having
been
tampered
with
*punct* .
*break*
smith
and
i
undertook
an
exhaustive
examination
of
the
shrubbery
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
spot
where
we
had
found
the
dog
*punct* ,
some
five
paces
to
the
west
of
the
copper
beech
*punct* ,
the
grass
and
weeds
were
trampled
and
the
surrounding
laurels
and
rhododendrons
bore
evidence
of
a
struggle
*punct* ,
but
no
human
footprint
could
be
found
*punct* .
*break*
the
ground
is
dry
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* .
*break*
we
cannot
expect
much
*punct* .
*break*
in
my
opinion
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
someone
tried
to
get
at
caesar
*punct* ;
his
presence
is
dangerous
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
his
rage
he
broke
loose
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
so
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
agreed
smith
*punct* .
*break*
but
why
did
this
person
make
for
here
*punct* ?
*break*
and
how
*punct* ,
having
mastered
the
dog
*punct* ,
get
out
of
redmoat
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
open
to
admit
the
possibility
of
someone's
getting
in
during
the
day
whilst
the
gates
are
open
*punct* ,
and
hiding
until
dusk
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
in
the
name
of
all
that's
wonderful
does
he
get
out
*punct* ?
*break*
he
must
possess
the
attributes
of
a
bird
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
of
greba
eltham's
statements
*punct* ,
reminding
my
friend
of
her
description
of
the
thing
which
she
had
seen
passing
into
this
strangely
haunted
shrubbery
*punct* .
*break*
that
line
of
speculation
soon
takes
us
out
of
our
depth
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
stick
to
what
we
can
understand
*punct* ,
and
that
may
help
us
to
a
clearer
idea
of
what
*punct* ,
at
present
*punct* ,
is
incomprehensible
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
2
*punct* ,
i
know
this
official
for
one
of
the
yellow
group
represented
in
england
by
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
3
*punct* ,
several
attempts
*punct* ,
of
which
we
know
but
little
*punct* ,
to
get
at
eltham
are
frustrated
*punct* ,
presumably
by
his
curious
defenses
*punct* .
*break*
an
attempt
in
a
train
fails
owing
to
miss
eltham's
distaste
for
refreshment-room
coffee
*punct* .
*break*
an
attempt
here
fails
owing
to
her
insomnia
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
4
*punct* ,
during
eltham's
absence
from
redmoat
certain
preparations
are
made
for
his
return
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
the
clearing
up
of
my
fourth
point
*punct* ,
id
est
*punct* ,
the
discovery
of
the
nature
of
these
preparations
*punct* ,
becomes
our
immediate
concern
*punct* .
*break*
the
prime
object
of
these
preparations
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
was
to
enable
someone
to
gain
access
to
eltham's
room
*punct* .
*break*
the
other
events
are
incidental
*punct* .
*break*
the
dogs
had
to
be
got
rid
of
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ;
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
miss
eltham's
wakefulness
saved
her
father
a
second
time
*punct* .
*break*
but
from
what
*punct* ?
*break*
for
heaven's
sake
*punct* ,
from
what
*punct* ?
*break*
smith
glanced
about
into
the
light-patched
shadows
*punct* .
*break*
from
a
visit
by
someone
*punct* ,
perhaps
by
fu-manchu
himself
*punct* ,
he
said
in
a
hushed
voice
*punct* .
*break*
the
object
of
that
visit
i
hope
we
may
never
learn
*punct* ;
for
that
would
mean
that
it
had
been
achieved
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
i
do
not
altogether
understand
you
*punct* ;
but
do
you
think
he
has
some
incredible
creature
hidden
here
somewhere
*punct* ?
*break*
it
would
be
like
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
begin
to
suspect
the
most
formidable
creature
in
the
known
world
to
be
hidden
here
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
fu-manchu
is
somewhere
inside
redmoat
*punct* !
*break*
our
conversation
was
interrupted
at
this
point
by
denby
*punct* ,
who
came
to
report
that
he
had
examined
the
moat
*punct* ,
the
roadside
*punct* ,
and
the
bank
of
the
stream
*punct* ,
but
found
no
footprints
or
clew
of
any
kind
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
left
the
grounds
of
redmoat
last
night
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
and
his
voice
had
awe
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
that
day
dragged
slowly
on
*punct* .
*break*
a
party
of
us
scoured
the
neighborhood
for
traces
of
strangers
*punct* ,
examining
every
foot
of
the
roman
ruin
hard
by
*punct* ;
but
vainly
*punct* .
*break*
may
not
your
presence
here
induce
fu-manchu
to
abandon
his
plans
*punct* ?
*break*
i
asked
smith
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
not
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* .
*break*
you
see
*punct* ,
unless
we
can
prevail
upon
him
*punct* ,
eltham
sails
in
a
fortnight
*punct* .
*break*
so
the
doctor
has
no
time
to
waste
*punct* .
*break*
furthermore
*punct* ,
i
have
an
idea
that
his
arrangements
are
of
such
a
character
that
they
must
go
forward
*punct* .
*break*
he
might
turn
aside
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
to
assassinate
me
*punct* ,
if
opportunity
arose
*punct* !
*break*
but
we
know
*punct* ,
from
experience
*punct* ,
that
he
permits
nothing
to
interfere
with
his
schemes
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
few
states
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
which
exact
so
severe
a
toll
from
one's
nervous
system
as
the
anticipation
of
calamity
*punct* .
*break*
all
anticipation
is
keener
*punct* ,
be
it
of
joy
or
pain
*punct* ,
than
the
reality
whereof
it
is
a
mental
forecast
*punct* ;
but
that
inactive
waiting
at
redmoat
*punct* ,
for
the
blow
which
we
knew
full
well
to
be
pending
exceeded
in
its
nerve
taxation
*punct* ,
anything
*punct* ,
i
hitherto
had
experienced
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
as
one
bound
upon
an
aztec
altar
*punct* ,
with
the
priest's
obsidian
knife
raised
above
my
breast
*punct* !
*break*
secret
and
malign
forces
throbbed
about
us
*punct* ;
forces
against
which
we
had
no
armor
*punct* .
*break*
dreadful
as
it
was
*punct* ,
i
count
it
a
mercy
that
the
climax
was
reached
so
quickly
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
came
suddenly
enough
*punct* ;
for
there
in
that
quiet
norfolk
home
we
found
ourselves
at
hand
grips
with
one
of
the
mysterious
horrors
which
characterized
the
operations
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
upon
us
before
we
realized
it
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
incidental
music
to
the
dramas
of
real
life
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
sat
on
the
little
terrace
in
the
creeping
twilight
*punct* ,
i
remember
thinking
how
the
peace
of
the
scene
gave
the
lie
to
my
fears
that
we
bordered
upon
tragic
things
*punct* .
*break*
then
caesar
*punct* ,
who
had
been
a
docile
patient
all
day
*punct* ,
began
howling
again
*punct* ;
and
i
saw
greba
eltham
shudder
*punct* .
*break*
i
caught
smith's
eye
*punct* ,
and
was
about
to
propose
our
retirement
indoors
*punct* ,
when
the
party
was
broken
up
in
more
turbulent
fashion
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
it
was
the
presence
of
the
girl
which
prompted
denby
to
the
rash
act
*punct* ,
a
desire
personally
to
distinguish
himself
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
i
recalled
afterwards
*punct* ,
his
gaze
had
rarely
left
the
shrubbery
since
dusk
*punct* ,
save
to
seek
her
face
*punct* ,
and
now
he
leaped
wildly
to
his
feet
*punct* ,
overturning
his
chair
*punct* ,
and
dashed
across
the
grass
to
the
trees
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
see
it
*punct* ?
*break*
did
you
see
it
*punct* ?
*break*
he
evidently
carried
a
revolver
*punct* .
*break*
for
from
the
edge
of
the
shrubbery
a
shot
sounded
*punct* ,
and
in
the
flash
we
saw
denby
with
the
weapon
raised
*punct* .
*break*
greba
*punct* ,
go
in
and
fasten
the
windows
*punct* ,
cried
eltham
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
will
you
enter
the
bushes
from
the
west
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
petrie
*punct* ,
east
*punct* .
*break*
edwards
*punct* ,
edwards
*punct* ,
and
he
was
off
across
the
lawn
with
the
nervous
activity
of
a
cat
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
made
off
in
an
opposite
direction
i
heard
the
gardener's
voice
from
the
lower
gate
*punct* ,
and
i
saw
eltham's
plan
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
to
surround
the
shrubbery
*punct* .
*break*
two
more
shots
and
two
flashes
from
the
dense
heart
of
greenwood
*punct* .
*break*
then
a
loud
cry
*punct* ,
i
thought
*punct* ,
from
denby
*punct* ,
and
a
second
*punct* ,
muffled
one
*punct* .
*break*
following
*punct* ,
silence
*punct* ,
only
broken
by
the
howling
of
the
mastiff
*punct* .
*break*
i
sprinted
through
the
rose
garden
*punct* ,
leaped
heedlessly
over
a
bed
of
geranium
and
heliotrope
*punct* ,
and
plunged
in
among
the
bushes
and
under
the
elms
*punct* .
*break*
away
on
the
left
i
heard
edwards
shouting
*punct* ,
and
eltham's
answering
voice
*punct* .
*break*
i
cried
*punct* ,
and
yet
louder
*punct* :
denby
*punct* !
*break*
but
the
silence
fell
again
*punct* .
*break*
dusk
was
upon
redmoat
now
*punct* ,
but
from
sitting
in
the
twilight
my
eyes
had
grown
accustomed
to
gloom
*punct* ,
and
i
could
see
fairly
well
what
lay
before
me
*punct* .
*break*
not
daring
to
think
what
might
lurk
above
*punct* ,
below
*punct* ,
around
me
*punct* ,
i
pressed
on
into
the
midst
of
the
thicket
*punct* .
*break*
came
eltham's
voice
from
one
side
*punct* .
*break*
bear
more
to
the
right
*punct* ,
edwards
*punct* ,
i
heard
nayland
smith
cry
directly
ahead
of
me
*punct* .
*break*
with
an
eerie
and
indescribable
sensation
of
impending
disaster
upon
me
*punct* ,
i
thrust
my
way
through
to
a
gray
patch
which
marked
a
break
in
the
elmen
roof
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
foot
of
the
copper
beech
i
almost
fell
over
eltham
*punct* .
*break*
then
smith
plunged
into
view
*punct* .
*break*
lastly
*punct* ,
edwards
the
gardener
rounded
a
big
rhododendron
and
completed
the
party
*punct* .
*break*
we
stood
quite
still
for
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
a
faint
breeze
whispered
through
the
beech
leaves
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
he
*punct* ?
*break*
i
cannot
remember
who
put
it
into
words
*punct* ;
i
was
too
dazed
with
amazement
to
notice
*punct* .
*break*
then
eltham
began
shouting
*punct* :
vernon
*punct* !
*break*
his
voice
pitched
higher
upon
each
repetition
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
something
horrible
about
that
vain
calling
*punct* ,
under
the
whispering
beech
*punct* ,
with
shrubs
banked
about
us
cloaking
god
alone
could
know
what
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
back
of
the
house
came
caesar's
faint
reply
*punct* .
*break*
every
lamp
you
have
*punct* !
*break*
off
we
went
*punct* ,
dodging
laurels
and
privets
*punct* ,
and
poured
out
on
to
the
lawn
*punct* ,
a
disordered
company
*punct* .
*break*
eltham's
face
was
deathly
pale
*punct* ,
and
his
jaw
set
hard
*punct* .
*break*
he
met
my
eye
*punct* .
*break*
god
forgive
me
*punct* !
*break*
i
could
do
murder
to-night
*punct* !
*break*
he
was
a
man
composed
of
strange
perplexities
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
an
age
before
the
lights
were
found
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
last
we
returned
to
the
bushes
*punct* ,
really
after
a
very
brief
delay
*punct* ;
and
ten
minutes
sufficed
us
to
explore
the
entire
shrubbery
*punct* ,
for
it
was
not
extensive
*punct* .
*break*
we
found
his
revolver
*punct* ,
but
there
was
no
one
there
*punct* ,
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
all
stood
again
on
the
lawn
*punct* ,
i
thought
that
i
had
never
seen
smith
so
haggard
*punct* .
*break*
what
in
heaven's
name
can
we
do
*punct* ?
*break*
what
does
it
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
he
expected
no
answer
*punct* ;
for
there
was
none
to
offer
one
*punct* .
*break*
everywhere
*punct* ,
said
eltham
hoarsely
*punct* .
*break*
he
ran
off
into
the
rose
garden
*punct* ,
and
began
beating
about
among
the
flowers
like
a
madman
*punct* ,
muttering
*punct* :
vernon
*punct* !
*break*
for
close
upon
an
hour
we
all
searched
*punct* .
*break*
we
searched
every
square
yard
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
within
the
wire
fencing
*punct* ,
and
found
no
trace
*punct* .
*break*
miss
eltham
slipped
out
in
the
confusion
*punct* ,
and
joined
with
the
rest
of
us
in
that
frantic
hunt
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
the
servants
assisted
too
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
group
terrified
and
awestricken
which
came
together
again
on
the
terrace
*punct* .
*break*
one
and
then
another
would
give
up
*punct* ,
until
only
eltham
and
smith
were
missing
*punct* .
*break*
then
they
came
back
together
from
examining
the
steps
to
the
lower
gate
*punct* .
*break*
eltham
dropped
on
to
a
rustic
seat
*punct* ,
and
sank
his
head
in
his
hands
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
paced
up
and
down
like
a
newly
caged
animal
*punct* ,
snapping
his
teeth
together
and
tugging
at
his
ear
*punct* .
*break*
possessed
by
some
sudden
idea
*punct* ,
or
pressed
to
action
by
his
tumultuous
thoughts
*punct* ,
he
snatched
up
a
lantern
and
strode
silently
off
across
the
grass
and
to
the
shrubbery
once
more
*punct* .
*break*
i
followed
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
his
idea
was
that
he
might
surprise
anyone
who
lurked
there
*punct* .
*break*
he
surprised
himself
*punct* ,
and
all
of
us
*punct* .
*break*
for
right
at
the
margin
he
tripped
and
fell
flat
*punct* .
*break*
i
ran
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
fallen
over
the
body
of
denby
*punct* ,
which
lay
there
*punct* !
*break*
denby
had
not
been
there
a
few
moments
before
*punct* ,
and
how
he
came
to
be
there
now
we
dared
not
conjecture
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
eltham
joined
us
*punct* ,
uttered
one
short
*punct* ,
dry
sob
*punct* ,
and
dropped
upon
his
knees
*punct* .
*break*
then
we
were
carrying
denby
back
to
the
house
*punct* ,
with
the
mastiff
howling
a
marche
funebre
*punct* .
*break*
we
laid
him
on
the
grass
where
it
sloped
down
from
the
terrace
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith's
haggard
face
was
terrible
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
stark
horror
of
the
thing
inspired
him
to
that
*punct* ,
which
conceived
earlier
*punct* ,
had
saved
denby
*punct* .
*break*
twisting
suddenly
to
eltham
*punct* ,
he
roared
in
a
voice
audible
beyond
the
river
*punct* :
heavens
*punct* !
*break*
we
are
fools
*punct* !
*break*
loose
the
dog
*punct* !
*break*
but
the
dog
*punct* ,
i
began
*punct* .
*break*
smith
clapped
his
hand
over
my
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
he's
crippled
*punct* ,
he
whispered
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
anything
human
lurks
there
*punct* ,
the
dog
will
lead
us
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
if
a
man
is
there
*punct* ,
he
will
fly
*punct* !
*break*
why
did
we
not
think
of
it
before
*punct* .
*break*
fools
*punct* ,
fools
*punct* !
*break*
he
raised
his
voice
again
*punct* .
*break*
keep
him
on
leash
*punct* ,
edwards
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
lead
us
*punct* .
*break*
the
scheme
succeeded
*punct* .
*break*
edwards
barely
had
started
on
his
errand
when
bells
began
ridging
inside
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
snapped
eltham
*punct* ,
and
rushed
indoors
*punct* .
*break*
a
moment
later
he
was
out
again
*punct* ,
his
eyes
gleaming
madly
*punct* .
*break*
above
the
moat
*punct* ,
he
panted
*punct* .
*break*
and
we
were
off
en
masse
round
the
edge
of
the
trees
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
dark
above
the
moat
*punct* ;
but
not
so
dark
as
to
prevent
our
seeing
a
narrow
ladder
of
thin
bamboo
joints
and
silken
cord
hanging
by
two
hooks
from
the
top
of
the
twelve-foot
wire
fence
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
sound
*punct* .
*break*
down
the
steps
*punct* !
*break*
we
all
ran
our
best
and
swiftest
*punct* .
*break*
but
eltham
outran
us
*punct* .
*break*
like
a
fury
he
tore
at
bolts
and
bars
*punct* ,
and
like
a
fury
sprang
out
into
the
road
*punct* .
*break*
straight
and
white
it
showed
to
the
acclivity
by
the
roman
ruin
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
living
thing
moved
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
distant
baying
of
the
dog
was
borne
to
our
ears
*punct* .
*break*
he's
crippled
*punct* ,
hissed
smith
*punct* .
*break*
without
him
*punct* ,
as
well
pursue
a
shadow
*punct* !
*break*
a
few
hours
later
the
shrubbery
yielded
up
its
secret
*punct* ,
a
simple
one
enough
*punct* :
a
big
cask
sunk
in
a
pit
*punct* ,
with
a
laurel
shrub
cunningly
affixed
to
its
movable
lid
*punct* ,
which
was
further
disguised
with
tufts
of
grass
*punct* .
*break*
a
slender
bamboo-jointed
rod
lay
near
the
fence
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
a
hook
on
the
top
*punct* ,
and
was
evidently
used
for
attaching
the
ladder
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
end
of
this
ladder
which
miss
eltham
saw
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* ,
as
he
trailed
it
behind
him
into
the
shrubbery
when
she
interrupted
him
in
her
fathers
room
*punct* .
*break*
he
and
whomever
he
had
with
him
doubtless
slipped
in
during
the
daytime
*punct* ,
whilst
eltham
was
absent
in
london
*punct* ,
bringing
the
prepared
cask
and
all
necessary
implements
with
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
concealed
themselves
somewhere
*punct* ,
probably
in
the
shrubbery
*punct* ,
and
during
the
night
made
the
cache
*punct* .
*break*
the
excavated
earth
would
be
disposed
of
on
the
flower-beds
*punct* ;
the
dummy
bush
they
probably
had
ready
*punct* .
*break*
you
see
*punct* ,
the
problem
of
getting
in
was
never
a
big
one
*punct* .
*break*
but
owing
to
the
defenses
it
was
impossible
*punct* ,
whilst
eltham
was
in
residence
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
to
get
out
after
dark
*punct* .
*break*
for
fu-manchu's
purposes
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
a
working-base
inside
redmoat
was
essential
*punct* .
*break*
his
servant
*punct* ,
for
he
needed
assistance
*punct* ,
must
have
been
in
hiding
somewhere
outside
*punct* ;
heaven
knows
where
*punct* !
*break*
during
the
day
they
could
come
or
go
by
the
gates
*punct* ,
as
we
have
already
noted
*punct* .
*break*
you
think
it
was
the
doctor
himself
*punct* ?
*break*
it
seems
possible
*punct* .
*break*
whom
else
has
eyes
like
the
eyes
miss
eltham
saw
from
the
window
last
night
*punct* ?
*break*
then
remains
to
tell
the
nature
of
the
outrage
whereby
fu-manchu
had
planned
to
prevent
eltham's
leaving
england
for
china
*punct* .
*break*
this
we
learned
from
denby
*punct* .
*break*
for
denby
was
not
dead
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
easy
to
divine
that
he
had
stumbled
upon
the
fiendish
visitor
at
the
very
entrance
to
his
burrow
*punct* ;
had
been
stunned
*punct* ,
judging
from
the
evidence
*punct* ,
with
a
sand-bag
*punct* ,
and
dragged
down
into
the
cache
*punct* ,
to
which
he
must
have
lain
in
such
dangerous
proximity
as
to
render
detection
of
the
dummy
bush
possible
in
removing
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
quickest
expedient
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
had
been
to
draw
him
beneath
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
search
of
the
shrubbery
was
concluded
*punct* ,
his
body
had
been
borne
to
the
edge
of
the
bushes
and
laid
where
we
found
it
*punct* .
*break*
why
his
life
had
been
spared
*punct* ,
i
cannot
conjecture
*punct* ,
but
provision
had
been
made
against
his
recovering
consciousness
and
revealing
the
secret
of
the
shrubbery
*punct* .
*break*
the
ruse
of
releasing
the
mastiff
alone
had
terminated
the
visit
of
the
unbidden
guest
within
redmoat
*punct* .
*break*
denby
made
a
very
slow
recovery
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
even
when
convalescent
*punct* ,
consciously
added
not
one
fact
to
those
we
already
had
collated
*punct* ;
his
memory
had
completely
deserted
him
*punct* !
*break*
this
*punct* ,
in
my
opinion
*punct* ,
as
in
those
of
the
several
specialists
consulted
*punct* ,
was
due
*punct* ,
not
to
the
blow
on
the
head
*punct* ,
but
to
the
presence
*punct* ,
slightly
below
and
to
the
right
of
the
first
cervical
curve
of
the
spine
*punct* ,
of
a
minute
puncture
*punct* ,
undoubtedly
caused
by
a
hypodermic
syringe
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
unconsciously
*punct* ,
poor
denby
furnished
the
last
link
in
the
chain
*punct* ;
for
undoubtedly
*punct* ,
by
means
of
this
operation
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
had
designed
to
efface
from
eltham's
mind
his
plans
of
return
to
ho-nan
*punct* .
*break*
the
nature
of
the
fluid
which
could
produce
such
mental
symptoms
was
a
mystery
*punct* ,
a
mystery
which
defied
western
science
*punct* :
one
of
the
many
strange
secrets
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
since
nayland
smith's
return
from
burma
i
had
rarely
taken
up
a
paper
without
coming
upon
evidences
of
that
seething
which
had
cast
up
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
whether
*punct* ,
hitherto
*punct* ,
such
items
had
escaped
my
attention
or
had
seemed
to
demand
no
particular
notice
*punct* ,
or
whether
they
now
became
increasingly
numerous
*punct* ,
i
was
unable
to
determine
*punct* .
*break*
one
evening
*punct* ,
some
little
time
after
our
sojourn
in
norfolk
*punct* ,
in
glancing
through
a
number
of
papers
which
i
had
brought
in
with
me
*punct* ,
i
chanced
upon
no
fewer
than
four
items
of
news
bearing
more
or
less
directly
upon
the
grim
business
which
engaged
my
friend
and
i
*punct* .
*break*
no
white
man
*punct* ,
i
honestly
believe
*punct* ,
appreciates
the
unemotional
cruelty
of
the
chinese
*punct* .
*break*
throughout
the
time
that
dr.
fu-manchu
remained
in
england
*punct* ,
the
press
preserved
a
uniform
silence
upon
the
subject
of
his
existence
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
due
to
nayland
smith
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
a
result
*punct* ,
i
feel
assured
that
my
account
of
the
chinaman's
deeds
will
*punct* ,
in
many
quarters
*punct* ,
meet
with
an
incredulous
reception
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
been
at
work
*punct* ,
earlier
in
the
evening
*punct* ,
upon
the
opening
chapters
of
this
chronicle
*punct* ,
and
i
had
realized
how
difficult
it
would
be
for
my
reader
*punct* ,
amid
secure
and
cozy
surroundings
*punct* ,
to
credit
any
human
being
*punct* ,
with
a
callous
villainy
great
enough
to
conceive
and
to
put
into
execution
such
a
death
pest
as
that
directed
against
sir
crichton
davey
*punct* .
*break*
one
would
expect
god's
worst
man
to
shrink
from
employing
*punct* ,
against
however
vile
an
enemy
*punct* ,
such
an
instrument
as
the
zayat
kiss
*punct* .
*break*
so
thinking
*punct* ,
my
eye
was
caught
by
the
following:
*punct* ,
express
correspondent
new
york
*punct* .
*break*
secret
service
men
of
the
united
states
government
are
searching
the
south
sea
islands
for
a
certain
hawaiian
from
the
island
of
maui
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
it
is
believed
*punct* ,
has
been
selling
poisonous
scorpions
to
chinese
in
honolulu
anxious
to
get
rid
of
their
children
*punct* .
*break*
infanticide
*punct* ,
by
scorpion
and
otherwise
*punct* ,
among
the
chinese
*punct* ,
has
increased
so
terribly
that
the
authorities
have
started
a
searching
inquiry
*punct* ,
which
has
led
to
the
hunt
for
the
scorpion
dealer
of
maui
*punct* .
*break*
practically
all
the
babies
that
die
mysteriously
are
unwanted
girls
*punct* ,
and
in
nearly
every
case
the
parents
promptly
ascribe
the
death
to
the
bite
of
a
scorpion
*punct* ,
and
are
ready
to
produce
some
more
or
less
poisonous
insect
in
support
of
the
statement
*punct* .
*break*
the
authorities
have
no
doubt
that
infanticide
by
scorpion
bite
is
a
growing
practice
*punct* ,
and
orders
have
been
given
to
hunt
down
the
scorpion
dealer
at
any
cost
*punct* .
*break*
is
it
any
matter
for
wonder
that
such
a
people
had
produced
a
fu-manchu
*punct* ?
*break*
i
pasted
the
cutting
into
a
scrap-book
*punct* ,
determined
that
*punct* ,
if
i
lived
to
publish
my
account
of
those
days
*punct* ,
i
would
quote
it
therein
as
casting
a
sidelight
upon
chinese
character
*punct* .
*break*
a
reuter
message
to
the
globe
and
a
paragraph
in
the
star
also
furnished
work
for
my
scissors
*punct* .
*break*
here
were
evidences
of
the
deep-seated
unrest
*punct* ,
the
secret
turmoil
*punct* ,
which
manifested
itself
so
far
from
its
center
as
peaceful
england
in
the
person
of
the
sinister
doctor
*punct* .
*break*
hong

*punct* ,
friday

*break*
li
hon
hung
*punct* ,
the
chinaman
who
fired
at
the
governor
yesterday
*punct* ,
was
charged
before
the
magistrate
with
shooting
at
him
with
intent
to
kill
*punct* ,
which
is
equivalent
to
attempted
murder
*punct* .
*break*
the
prisoner
*punct* ,
who
was
not
defended
*punct* ,
pleaded
guilty

*break*
the
assistant
crown

asked

which
was
granted
*punct* .
*break*
snapshots
taken
by
the
spectators
of
the
outrage
yesterday
disclosed
the
presence
of
an
accomplice
*punct* ,
also
armed
with
a
revolver
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
reported
that
this
man

who
was
arrested
last

was
in
possession
of
incriminating

the

*break*
in
a
report
prepared
by
the
accomplice
for
dispatch
to

*punct* ,
also
found
on
his
person
*punct* ,
he
expressed
regret
that
the
attempt
had
failed.
*punct* ,
reuter
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
officially
reported
in

*break*
petersburg
that
a
force
of
chinese
soldiers
and
villagers
surrounded
the
house
of
a
russian
subject
named
said
effendi
*punct* ,
near
khotan
*punct* ,
in
chinese
turkestan
*punct* .
*break*
they
fired
at
the
house
and
set
it
in
flames
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
in
the
house
about
100
russians
*punct* ,
many
of
whom
were
killed
*punct* .
*break*
the
russian
government
has
instructed
its

*punct* ,
reuter
*punct* .
*break*
finally
*punct* ,
in
a
personal
column
*punct* ,
i
found
the
following:
*punct* ,
ho-nan
*punct* .
*break*
have
abandoned
visit.
*punct* ,
eltham
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
just
pasted
it
into
my
book
when
nayland
smith
came
in
and
threw
himself
into
an
arm-chair
*punct* ,
facing
me
across
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
i
showed
him
the
cutting
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
glad
*punct* ,
for
eltham's
sake
*punct* ,
and
for
the
girl's
*punct* ,
was
his
comment
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
marks
another
victory
for
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
why
is
retribution
delayed
*punct* !
*break*
smith's
darkly
tanned
face
had
grown
leaner
than
ever
since
he
bad
begun
his
fight
with
the
most
uncanny
opponent
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
against
whom
a
man
ever
had
pitted
himself
*punct* .
*break*
he
stood
up
and
began
restlessly
to
pace
the
room
*punct* ,
furiously
stuffing
tobacco
into
his
briar
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
seen
sir
lionel
barton
*punct* ,
he
said
abruptly
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
to
put
the
whole
thing
in
a
nutshell
*punct* ,
he
has
laughed
at
me
*punct* !
*break*
during
the
months
that
i
have
been
wondering
where
he
had
gone
to
he
has
been
somewhere
in
egypt
*punct* .
*break*
he
certainly
bears
a
charmed
life
*punct* ,
for
on
the
evidence
of
his
letter
to
the
times
he
has
seen
things
in
tibet
which
fu-manchu
would
have
the
west
blind
to
*punct* ;
in
fact
*punct* ,
i
think
he
has
found
a
new
keyhole
to
the
gate
of
the
indian
empire
*punct* !
*break*
long
ago
we
had
placed
the
name
of
sir
lionel
barton
upon
the
list
of
those
whose
lives
stood
between
fu-manchu
and
the
attainment
of
his
end
*punct* .
*break*
orientalist
and
explorer
*punct* ,
the
fearless
traveler
who
first
had
penetrated
to
lhassa
*punct* ,
who
thrice
*punct* ,
as
a
pilgrim
*punct* ,
had
entered
forbidden
mecca
*punct* ,
he
now
had
turned
his
attention
again
to
tibet
*punct* ,
thereby
signing
his
own
death-warrant
*punct* .
*break*
that
he
has
reached
england
alive
is
a
hopeful
sign
*punct* ?
*break*
smith
shook
his
head
*punct* ,
and
lighted
the
blackened
briar
*punct* .
*break*
england
at
present

replied
*punct* .
*break*
the
spider
will
be
waiting
*punct* .
*break*
petrie
*punct* ,
i
sometimes
despair
*punct* .
*break*
sir
lionel
is
an
impossible
man
to
shepherd
*punct* .
*break*
you
ought
to
see
his
house
at
finchley
*punct* .
*break*
a
low
*punct* ,
squat
place
completely
hemmed
in
by
trees
*punct* .
*break*
damp
as
a
swamp
*punct* ;
smells
like
a
jungle
*punct* .
*break*
he
only
arrived
to-day
*punct* ,
and
he
is
working
and
eating
*punct* ,
and
sleeping
i
expect
*punct* ,
in
a
study
that
looks
like
an
earthquake
at
sotheby's
auction-rooms
*punct* .
*break*
the
rest
of
the
house
is
half
a
menagerie
and
half
a
circus
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
a
bedouin
groom
*punct* ,
a
chinese
body-servant
*punct* ,
and
heaven
only
knows
what
other
strange
people
*punct* !
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
saw
him
*punct* ;
a
squinting
cantonese
he
calls
kwee
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
like
him
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
there
is
a
secretary
known
as
strozza
*punct* ,
who
has
an
unpleasant
face
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
a
fine
linguist
*punct* ,
i
understand
*punct* ,
and
is
engaged
upon
the
spanish
notes
for
barton's
forthcoming
book
on
the
mayapan
temples
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
way
*punct* ,
all
sir
lionel's
baggage
disappeared
from
the
landing-stage
*punct* ,
including
his
tibetan
notes
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
argues
that
he
has
crossed
tibet
from
the
kuen-lun
to
the
himalayas
without
being
assassinated
*punct* ,
and
therefore
that
it
is
unlikely
he
will
meet
with
that
fate
in
london
*punct* .
*break*
i
left
him
dictating
the
book
from
memory
*punct* ,
at
the
rate
of
about
two
hundred
words
a
minute
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
wasting
no
time
*punct* .
*break*
in
addition
to
the
yucatan
book
and
the
work
on
tibet
*punct* ,
he
has
to
read
a
paper
at
the
institute
next
week
about
some
tomb
he
has
unearthed
in
egypt
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
came
away
*punct* ,
a
van
drove
up
from
the
docks
and
a
couple
of
fellows
delivered
a
sarcophagus
as
big
as
a
boat
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
unique
*punct* ,
according
to
sir
lionel
*punct* ,
and
will
go
to
the
british
museum
after
he
has
examined
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
crams
six
months
work
into
six
weeks
*punct* ;
then
he
is
off
again
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
propose
to
do
*punct* ?
*break*
what
can
i
do
*punct* ?
*break*
i
know
that
fu-manchu
will
make
an
attempt
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
doubt
it
*punct* .
*break*
that
house
gave
me
the
shudders
*punct* .
*break*
no
sunlight
*punct* ,
i'll
swear
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
can
ever
penetrate
to

rooms
*punct* ,
and
when
i
arrived
this
afternoon
clouds
of
gnats
floated
like
motes
wherever
a
stray
beam
filtered
through
the
trees

the
avenue
*punct* .
*break*
there's
a
steamy
smell
about
the
place
that
is
almost
malarious
*punct* ,
and
the
whole
of
the
west
front
is
covered
with
a
sort
of
monkey-creeper
*punct* ,
which
he
has
imported
at
some
time
or
other
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
a
close
*punct* ,
exotic
perfume
that
is
quite
in
the
picture
*punct* .
*break*
i
tell
you
*punct* ,
the
place
was
made
for
murder
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
taken
any
precautions
*punct* ?
*break*
i
called
at
scotland
yard
and
sent
a
man
down
to
watch
the
house
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
helplessly
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
sir
lionel
like
*punct* ?
*break*
a
madman
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
a
tall
*punct* ,
massive
man
*punct* ,
wearing
a
dirty
dressing-gown
of
neutral
color
*punct* ;
a
man
with
untidy
gray
hair
and
a
bristling
mustache
*punct* ,
keen
blue
eyes
*punct* ,
and
a
brown
skin
*punct* ;
who
wears
a
short
beard
or
rarely
shaves
*punct* ,
i
don't
know
which
*punct* .
*break*
i
left
him
striding
about
among
the
thousand
and
one
curiosities
of
that
incredible
room
*punct* ,
picking
his
way
through
his
antique
furniture
*punct* ,
works
of
reference
*punct* ,
manuscripts
*punct* ,
mummies
*punct* ,
spears
*punct* ,
pottery
and
what
not
*punct* ,
sometimes
kicking
a
book
from
his
course
*punct* ,
or
stumbling
over
a
stuffed
crocodile
or
a
mexican
mask
*punct* ,
alternately
dictating
and
conversing
*punct* .
*break*
for
some
time
we
were
silent
*punct* .
*break*
smith
i
said
*punct* ,
we
are
making
no
headway
in
this
business
*punct* .
*break*
with
all
the
forces
arrayed
against
him
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
still
eludes
us
*punct* ,
still
pursues
his
devilish
*punct* ,
inscrutable
way
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
nodded
*punct* .
*break*
and
we
don't
know
all
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
we
mark
such
and
such
a
man
as
one
alive
to
the
yellow
peril
*punct* ,
and
we
warn
him
*punct* ,
if
we
have
time
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
he
escapes
*punct* ;
perhaps
he
does
not
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
do
we
know
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
of
those
others
who
may
die
every
week
by
his
murderous
agency
*punct* ?
*break*
we
cannot
know
everyone
who
has
read
the
riddle
of
china
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
see
a
report
of
someone
found
drowned
*punct* ,
of
an
apparent
suicide
*punct* ,
of
a
sudden
*punct* ,
though
seemingly
natural
death
*punct* ,
without
wondering
*punct* .
*break*
i
tell
you
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
is
omnipresent
*punct* ;
his
tentacles
embrace
everything
*punct* .
*break*
i
said
that
sir
lionel
must
bear
a
charmed
life
*punct* .
*break*
he
glanced
at
his
watch
*punct* .
*break*
nearly
eleven
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
but
sleep
seems
a
waste
of
time
*punct* ,
apart
from
its
dangers
*punct* .
*break*
we
heard
a
bell
ring
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
moments
later
followed
a
knock
at
the
room
door
*punct* .
*break*
a
girl
entered
with
a
telegram
addressed
to
smith
*punct* .
*break*
his
jaw
looked
very
square
in
the
lamplight
*punct* ,
and
his
eyes
shone
like
steel
as
he
took
it
from
her
and
opened
the
envelope
*punct* .
*break*
he
glanced
at
the
form
*punct* ,
stood
up
and
passed
it
to
me
*punct* ,
reaching
for
his
hat
*punct* ,
which
lay
upon
my
writing-table
*punct* .
*break*
god
help
us
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
this
was
the
message
*punct* :
sir
lionel
barton
murdered
*punct* .
*break*
meet
me
at
his
house
at
once.
*punct* ,
weymouth
*punct* ,
inspector
*punct* .
*break*
although
we
avoided
all
unnecessary
delay
*punct* ,
it
was
close
upon
midnight
when
our
cab
swung
round
into
a
darkly
shadowed
avenue
*punct* ,
at
the
farther
end
of
which
*punct* ,
as
seen
through
a
tunnel
*punct* ,
the
moonlight
glittered
upon
the
windows
of
rowan
house
*punct* ,
sir
lionel
barton's
home
*punct* .
*break*
stepping
out
before
the
porch
of
the
long
*punct* ,
squat
building
*punct* ,
i
saw
that
it
was
banked
in
*punct* ,
as
smith
had
said
*punct* ,
by
trees
and
shrubs
*punct* .
*break*
the
facade
showed
mantled
in
the
strange
exotic
creeper
which
he
had
mentioned
*punct* ,
and
the
air
was
pungent
with
an
odor
of
decaying
vegetation
*punct* ,
with
which
mingled
the
heavy
perfume
of
the
little
nocturnal
red
flowers
which
bloomed
luxuriantly
upon
the
creeper
*punct* .
*break*
the
place
looked
a
veritable
wilderness
*punct* ,
and
when
we
were
admitted
to
the
hall
by
inspector
weymouth
i
saw
that
the
interior
was
in
keeping
with
the
exterior
*punct* ,
for
the
hall
was
constructed
from
the
model
of
some
apartment
in
an
assyrian
temple
*punct* ,
and
the
squat
columns
*punct* ,
the
low
seats
*punct* ,
the
hangings
*punct* ,
all
were
eloquent
of
neglect
*punct* ,
being
thickly
dust-coated
*punct* .
*break*
the
musty
smell
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
was
almost
as
pronounced
here
as
outside
*punct* ,
beneath
the
trees
*punct* .
*break*
to
a
library
*punct* ,
whose
contents
overflowed
in
many
literary
torrents
upon
the
floor
*punct* ,
the
detective
conducted
us
*punct* .
*break*
i
cried
*punct* ,
what's
that
*punct* ?
*break*
something
leaped
from
the
top
of
the
bookcase
*punct* ,
ambled
silently
across
the
littered
carpet
*punct* ,
and
passed
from
the
library
like
a
golden
streak
*punct* .
*break*
i
stood
looking
after
it
with
startled
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
inspector
weymouth
laughed
dryly
*punct* .
*break*
it's
a
young
puma
*punct* ,
or
a
civet-cat
*punct* ,
or
something
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
this
house
is
full
of
surprises
*punct* ,
and
mysteries
*punct* .
*break*
his
voice
was
not
quite
steady
*punct* ,
i
thought
*punct* ,
and
he
carefully
closed
the
door
ere
proceeding
further
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
he
*punct* ?
*break*
asked
nayland
smith
harshly
*punct* .
*break*
how
was
it
done
*punct* ?
*break*
weymouth
sat
down
and
lighted
a
cigar
which
i
offered
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
you
would
like
to
hear
what
led
up
to
it
*punct* ,
so
far
as
we
know
*punct* ,
before
seeing
him
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
continued
the
inspector
*punct* ,
the
man
you
arranged
to
send
down
from
the
yard
got
here
all
right
and
took
up
a
post
in
the
road
outside
*punct* ,
where
he
could
command
a
good
view
of
the
gates
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
and
heard
nothing
*punct* ,
until
going
on
for
half-past
ten
*punct* ,
when
a
young
lady
turned
up
and
went
in
*punct* .
*break*
a
young
lady
*punct* ?
*break*
miss
edmonds
*punct* ,
sir
lionel's
shorthand
typist
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
found
*punct* ,
after
getting
home
*punct* ,
that
her
bag
*punct* ,
with
her
purse
in
*punct* ,
was
missing
*punct* ,
and
she
came
back
to
see
if
she
had
left
it
here
*punct* .
*break*
she
gave
the
alarm
*punct* .
*break*
my
man
heard
the
row
from
the
road
and
came
in
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
ran
out
and
rang
us
up
*punct* .
*break*
i
immediately
wired
for
you
*punct* .
*break*
he
heard
the
row
*punct* ,
you
say
*punct* .
*break*
miss
edmonds
went
into
violent
hysterics
*punct* !
*break*
smith
was
pacing
the
room
now
in
tense
excitement
*punct* .
*break*
describe
what
he
saw
when
he
came
in
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
a
negro
footman
*punct* ,
there
isn't
an
englishman
in
the
house
*punct* ,
trying
to
pacify
the
girl
out
in
the
hall
yonder
*punct* ,
and
a
malay
and
another
colored
man
beating
their
foreheads
and
howling
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
sense
to
be
got
out
of
any
of
them
*punct* ,
so
he
started
to
investigate
for
himself
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
taken
the
bearings
of
the
place
earlier
in
the
evening
*punct* ,
and
from
the
light
in
a
window
on
the
ground
floor
had
located
the
study
*punct* ;
so
he
set
out
to
look
for
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
found
it
*punct* ,
it
was
locked
from
the
inside
*punct* .
*break*
he
went
out
and
round
to
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
there's
no
blind
*punct* ,
and
from
the
shrubbery
you
can
see
into
the
lumber-room
known
as
the
study
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
in
*punct* ,
as
apparently
miss
edmonds
had
done
before
him
*punct* .
*break*
what
he
saw
accounted
for
her
hysterics
*punct* .
*break*
both
smith
and
i
were
hanging
upon
his
words
*punct* .
*break*
all
amongst
the
rubbish
on
the
floor
a
big
egyptian
mummy
case
was
lying
on
its
side
*punct* ,
and
face
downwards
*punct* ,
with
his
arms
thrown
across
it
*punct* ,
lay
sir
lionel
barton
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
only
a
shaded
reading-lamp
alight
*punct* ,
and
it
stood
on
a
chair
*punct* ,
shining
right
down
on
him
*punct* ;
it
made
a
patch
of
light
on
the
floor
*punct* ,
you
understand
*punct* .
*break*
the
inspector
indicated
its
extent
with
his
bands
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
as
the
man
smashed
the
glass
and
got
the
window
open
*punct* ,
and
was
just
climbing
in
*punct* ,
he
saw
something
else
*punct* ,
so
he
says
*punct* .
*break*
what
did
he
see
*punct* ?
*break*
demanded
smith
shortly
*punct* .
*break*
a
sort
of
green
mist
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
he
says
it
seemed
to
be
alive
*punct* .
*break*
it
moved
over
the
floor
*punct* ,
about
a
foot
from
the
ground
*punct* ,
going
away
from
him
and
towards
a
curtain
at
the
other
end
of
the
study
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
speaker
*punct* .
*break*
where
did
he
first
see
this
green
mist
*punct* ?
*break*
he
says
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
that
he
thinks
it
came
from
the
mummy
case
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ;
go
on
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
to
his
credit
that
he
climbed
into
the
room
after
seeing
a
thing
like
that
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
the
body
over
*punct* ,
and
sir
lionel
looked
horrible
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
quite
dead
*punct* .
*break*
then
croxted
*punct* ,
that's
the
man's
name
*punct* ,
went
over
to
this
curtain
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
glass
door
*punct* ,
shut
*punct* .
*break*
he
opened
it
*punct* ,
and
it
gave
on
a
conservatory
*punct* ,
a
place
stacked
from
the
tiled
floor
to
the
glass
roof
with
more
rubbish
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
dark
inside
*punct* ,
but
enough
light
came
from
the
study
*punct* ,
it's
really
a
drawing-room
*punct* ,
by
the
way
*punct* ,
as
he'd
turned
all
the
lamps
on
*punct* ,
to
give
him
another
glimpse
of
this
green
*punct* ,
crawling
mist
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
three
steps
to
go
down
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
steps
lay
a
dead
chinaman
*punct* .
*break*
a
dead
chinaman
*punct* !
*break*
a
dead
chinaman
*punct* .
*break*
doctor
seen
them
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ;
a
local
man
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
out
of
his
depth
*punct* ,
i
could
see
*punct* .
*break*
contradicted
himself
three
times
*punct* .
*break*
but
there's
no
need
for
another
opinion
*punct* ,
until
we
get
the
coroner's
*punct* .
*break*
croxted
was
taken
ill
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
and
had
to
be
sent
home
in
a
cab
*punct* .
*break*
what
ails
him
*punct* ?
*break*
detective-inspector
weymouth
raised
his
eyebrows
and
carefully
knocked
the
ash
from
his
cigar
*punct* .
*break*
he
held
out
until
i
came
*punct* ,
gave
me
the
story
*punct* ,
and
then
fainted
right
away
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
that
something
in
the
conservatory
seemed
to
get
him
by
the
throat
*punct* .
*break*
did
he
mean
that
literally
*punct* ?
*break*
i
couldn't
say
*punct* .
*break*
we
had
to
send
the
girl
home
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
was
pulling
thoughtfully
at
the
lobe
of
his
left
ear
*punct* .
*break*
got
any
theory
*punct* ?
*break*
weymouth
shrugged
his
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
not
one
that
includes
the
green
mist
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
shall
we
go
in
now
*punct* ?
*break*
we
crossed
the
assyrian
hall
*punct* ,
where
the
members
of
that
strange
household
were
gathered
in
a
panic-stricken
group
*punct* .
*break*
they
numbered
four
*punct* .
*break*
two
of
them
were
negroes
*punct* ,
and
two
easterns
of
some
kind
*punct* .
*break*
i
missed
the
chinaman
*punct* ,
kwee
*punct* ,
of
whom
smith
had
spoken
*punct* ,
and
the
italian
secretary
*punct* ;
and
from
the
way
in
which
my
friend
peered
about
the
shadows
of
the
hall
i
divined
that
he
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
wondered
at
their
absence
*punct* .
*break*
we
entered
sir
lionel's
study
*punct* ,
an
apartment
which
i
despair
of
describing
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith's
words
*punct* ,
an
earthquake
at
sotheby's
auction-rooms
*punct* ,
leaped
to
my
mind
at
once
*punct* ;
for
the
place
was
simply
stacked
with
curious
litter
*punct* ,
loot
of
africa
*punct* ,
mexico
and
persia
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
clearing
by
the
hearth
a
gas
stove
stood
upon
a
packing-case
*punct* ,
and
about
it
lay
a
number
of
utensils
for
camp
cookery
*punct* .
*break*
the
odor
of
rotting
vegetation
*punct* ,
mingled
with
the
insistent
perfume
of
the
strange
night-blooming
flowers
*punct* ,
was
borne
in
through
the
open
window
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
center
of
the
floor
*punct* ,
beside
an
overturned
sarcophagus
*punct* ,
lay
a
figure
in
a
neutral-colored
dressing-gown
*punct* ,
face
downwards
*punct* ,
and
arms
thrust
forward
and
over
the
side
of
the
ancient
egyptian
mummy
case
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend
advanced
and
knelt
beside
the
dead
man
*punct* .
*break*
smith
sprang
upright
and
turned
with
an
extraordinary
expression
to
inspector
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
not
know
sir
lionel
barton
by
sight
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
began
weymouth
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
this
is
not
sir
lionel
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
strozza
*punct* ,
the
secretary
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
the
other
*punct* ,
the
chinaman
*punct* ,
quick
*punct* !
*break*
i
have
had
him
left
where
he
was
found
*punct* ,
on
the
conservatory
steps
*punct* ,
said
the
inspector
*punct* .
*break*
smith
ran
across
the
room
to
where
*punct* ,
beyond
the
open
door
*punct* ,
a
glimpse
might
be
obtained
of
stacked-up
curiosities
*punct* .
*break*
holding
back
the
curtain
to
allow
more
light
to
penetrate
*punct* ,
he
bent
forward
over
a
crumpled-up
figure
which
lay
upon
the
steps
below
*punct* .
*break*
he
cried
aloud
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
sir
lionel's
servant
*punct* ,
kwee
*punct* .
*break*
weymouth
and
i
looked
at
one
another
across
the
body
of
the
italian
*punct* ;
then
our
eyes
turned
together
to
where
my
friend
*punct* ,
grim-faced
*punct* ,
stood
over
the
dead
chinaman
*punct* .
*break*
a
breeze
whispered
through
the
leaves
*punct* ;
a
great
wave
of
exotic
perfume
swept
from
the
open
window
towards
the
curtained
doorway
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
breath
of
the
east
*punct* ,
that
stretched
out
a
yellow
hand
to
the
west
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
symbolic
of
the
subtle
*punct* ,
intangible
power
manifested
in
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
as
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
lean
*punct* ,
agile
*punct* ,
bronzed
with
the
suns
of
burma
*punct* ,
was
symbolic
of
the
clean
british
efficiency
which
sought
to
combat
the
insidious
enemy
*punct* .
*break*
one
thing
is
evident
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* :
no
one
in
the
house
*punct* ,
strozza
excepted
*punct* ,
knew
that
sir
lionel
was
absent
*punct* .
*break*
how
do
you
arrive
at
that
*punct* ?
*break*
the
servants
*punct* ,
in
the
hall
*punct* ,
are
bewailing
him
as
dead
*punct* .
*break*
if
they
had
seen
him
go
out
they
would
know
that
it
must
be
someone
else
who
lies
here
*punct* .
*break*
what
about
the
chinaman
*punct* ?
*break*
since
there
is
no
other
means
of
entrance
to
the
conservatory
save
through
the
study
*punct* ,
kwee
must
have
hidden
himself
there
at
some
time
when
his
master
was
absent
from
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
croxted
found
the
communicating
door
closed
*punct* .
*break*
what
killed
the
chinaman
*punct* ?
*break*
both
miss
edmonds
and
croxted
found
the
study
door
locked
from
the
inside
*punct* .
*break*
what
killed
strozza
*punct* ?
*break*
you
will
have
noted
*punct* ,
continued
the
inspector
*punct* ,
that
the
secretary
is
wearing
sir
lionel's
dressing-gown
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
seeing
him
in
that
*punct* ,
as
she
looked
in
at
the
window
*punct* ,
which
led
miss
edmonds
to
mistake
him
for
her
employer
*punct* ,
and
consequently
to
put
us
on
the
wrong
scent
*punct* .
*break*
he
wore
it
in
order
that
anybody
looking
in
at
the
window
would
be
sure
to
make
that
mistake
*punct* ,
rapped
smith
*punct* .
*break*
because
he
came
here
for
a
felonious
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
smith
stooped
and
took
up
several
tools
from
the
litter
on
the
floor
*punct* .
*break*
there
lies
the
lid
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
to
open
the
sarcophagus
*punct* .
*break*
it
contained
the
mummy
of
some
notable
person
who
flourished
under
meneptah
ii
*punct* ;
and
sir
lionel
told
me
that
a
number
of
valuable
ornaments
and
jewels
probably
were
secreted
amongst
the
wrappings
*punct* .
*break*
he
proposed
to
open
the
thing
and
to
submit
the
entire
contents
to
examination
to-night
*punct* .
*break*
he
evidently
changed
his
mind
*punct* ,
fortunately
for
himself
*punct* .
*break*
i
ran
my
fingers
through
my
hair
in
perplexity
*punct* .
*break*
then
what
has
become
of
the
mummy
*punct* ?
*break*
nayland
smith
laughed
dryly
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
vanished
in
the
form
of
a
green
vapor
apparently
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
strozza's
face
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
the
body
over
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
used
as
i
was
to
such
spectacles
*punct* ,
the
contorted
features
of
the
italian
filled
me
with
horror
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ,
suggestive
were
they
of
a
death
more
than
ordinarily
violent
*punct* .
*break*
i
pulled
aside
the
dressing-gown
and
searched
the
body
for
marks
*punct* ,
but
failed
to
find
any
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
crossed
the
room
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
assisted
by
the
detective
*punct* ,
carried
kwee
*punct* ,
the
chinaman
*punct* ,
into
the
study
and
laid
him
fully
in
the
light
*punct* .
*break*
his
puckered
yellow
face
presented
a
sight
even
more
awful
than
the
other
*punct* ,
and
his
blue
lips
were
drawn
back
*punct* ,
exposing
both
upper
and
lower
teeth
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
no
marks
of
violence
*punct* ,
but
his
limbs
*punct* ,
like
strozza's
*punct* ,
had
been
tortured
during
his
mortal
struggles
into
unnatural
postures
*punct* .
*break*
the
breeze
was
growing
higher
*punct* ,
and
pungent
odor-waves
from
the
damp
shrubbery
*punct* ,
bearing
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
the
oppressive
sweetness
of
the
creeping
*punct* ,
plant
*punct* ,
swept
constantly
through
the
open
window
*punct* .
*break*
inspector
weymouth
carefully
relighted
his
cigar
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
with
you
this
far
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
strozza
*punct* ,
knowing
sir
lionel
to
be
absent
*punct* ,
locked
himself
in
here
to
rifle
the
mummy
case
*punct* ,
for
croxted
*punct* ,
entering
by
way
of
the
window
*punct* ,
found
the
key
on
the
inside
*punct* .
*break*
strozza
didn't
know
that
the
chinaman
was
hidden
in
the
conservatory
*punct* ,
and
kwee
did
not
dare
to
show
himself
*punct* ,
because
he
too
was
there
for
some
mysterious
reason
of
his
own
*punct* ,
interrupted
smith
*punct* .
*break*
having
got
the
lid
off
*punct* ,
something,
*punct* ,
somebody
*punct* ,
suppose
we
say
the
mummy
*punct* ?
*break*
weymouth
laughed
uneasily
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
something
that
vanished
from
a
locked
room
without
opening
the
door
or
the
window
killed
strozza
*punct* .
*break*
and
something
which
*punct* ,
having
killed
strozza
*punct* ,
next
killed
the
chinaman
*punct* ,
apparently
without
troubling
to
open
the
door
behind
which
he
lay
concealed
*punct* ,
smith
continued
*punct* .
*break*
for
once
in
a
way
*punct* ,
inspector
*punct* ,
dr.
fu-manchu
has
employed
an
ally
which
even
his
giant
will
was
incapable
entirely
to
subjugate
*punct* .
*break*
what
blind
force
*punct* ,
what
terrific
agent
of
death
*punct* ,
had
he
confined
in
that
sarcophagus
*punct* !
*break*
you
think
this
is
the
work
of
fu-manchu
*punct* ?
*break*
if
you
are
correct
*punct* ,
his
power
indeed
is
more
than
human
*punct* .
*break*
something
in
my
voice
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
brought
smith
right
about
*punct* .
*break*
he
surveyed
me
curiously
*punct* .
*break*
can
you
doubt
it
*punct* ?
*break*
the
presence
of
a
concealed
chinaman
surely
is
sufficient
*punct* .
*break*
kwee
*punct* ,
i
feel
assured
*punct* ,
was
one
of
the
murder
group
*punct* ,
though
probably
he
had
only
recently
entered
that
mysterious
service
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
unarmed
*punct* ,
or
i
should
feel
disposed
to
think
that
his
part
was
to
assassinate
sir
lionel
whilst
*punct* ,
unsuspecting
the
presence
of
a
hidden
enemy
*punct* ,
he
was
at
work
here
*punct* .
*break*
strozza's
opening
the
sarcophagus
clearly
spoiled
the
scheme
*punct* .
*break*
and
led
to
the
death
*punct* ,
of
a
servant
of
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
at
a
loss
to
account
for
that
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
think
that
the
sarcophagus
entered
into
the
scheme
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
my
friend
looked
at
me
in
evident
perplexity
*punct* .
*break*
you
mean
that
its
arrival
at
the
time
when
a
creature
of
the
doctor
*punct* ,
kwee
*punct* ,
was
concealed
here
*punct* ,
may
have
been
a
coincidence
*punct* ?
*break*
i
nodded
*punct* ;
and
smith
bent
over
the
sarcophagus
*punct* ,
curiously
examining
the
garish
paintings
with
which
it
was
decorated
inside
and
out
*punct* .
*break*
it
lay
sideways
upon
the
floor
*punct* ,
and
seizing
it
by
its
edge
*punct* ,
he
turned
it
over
*punct* .
*break*
heavy
*punct* ,
he
muttered
*punct* ;
but
strozza
must
have
capsized
it
as
he
fell
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
not
have
laid
it
on
its
side
to
remove
the
lid
*punct* .
*break*
he
bent
farther
forward
*punct* ,
catching
at
a
piece
of
twine
*punct* ,
and
out
of
the
mummy
case
pulled
a
rubber
stopper
or
cork
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
stuck
in
a
hole
level
with
the
floor
of
the
thing
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
a
disgusting
smell
*punct* .
*break*
i
took
it
from
his
hands
*punct* ,
and
was
about
to
examine
it
*punct* ,
when
a
loud
voice
sounded
outside
in
the
hall
*punct* .
*break*
the
door
was
thrown
open
*punct* ,
and
a
big
man
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
despite
the
warmth
of
the
weather
*punct* ,
wore
a
fur-lined
overcoat
*punct* ,
rushed
impetuously
into
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
cried
smith
eagerly
*punct* .
*break*
i
warned
you
*punct* !
*break*
and
see
*punct* ,
you
have
had
a
very
narrow
escape
*punct* .
*break*
sir
lionel
barton
glanced
at
what
lay
upon
the
floor
*punct* ,
then
from
smith
to
myself
*punct* ,
and
from
me
to
inspector
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
he
dropped
into
one
of
the
few
chairs
unstacked
with
books
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
with
emotion
*punct* ,
what
does
this
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
tell
me
*punct* ,
quickly
*punct* .
*break*
in
brief
terms
smith
detailed
the
happenings
of
the
night
*punct* ,
or
so
much
as
he
knew
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
sir
lionel
barton
listened
*punct* ,
sitting
quite
still
the
while
*punct* ,
an
unusual
repose
in
a
man
of
such
evidently
tremendous
nervous
activity
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
for
the
jewels
*punct* ,
he
said
slowly
*punct* ,
when
smith
was
finished
*punct* ;
and
his
eyes
turned
to
the
body
of
the
dead
italian
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
wrong
to
submit
him
to
the
temptation
*punct* .
*break*
god
knows
what
kwee
was
doing
in
hiding
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
he
had
come
to
murder
me
*punct* ,
as
you
surmise
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
though
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
i
don't
think
this
is
the
handiwork
of
your
chinese
doctor
*punct* .
*break*
he
fixed
his
gaze
upon
the
sarcophagus
*punct* .
*break*
smith
stared
at
him
in
surprise
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
mean
*punct* ,
sir
lionel
*punct* ?
*break*
the
famous
traveler
continued
to
look
towards
the
sarcophagus
with
something
in
his
blue
eyes
that
might
have
been
dread
*punct* .
*break*
i
received
a
wire
from
professor
rembold
to-night
*punct* ,
he
continued
*punct* .
*break*
you
were
correct
in
supposing
that
no
one
but
strozza
knew
of
my
absence
*punct* .
*break*
i
dressed
hurriedly
and
met
the
professor
at
the
traveler's
*punct* .
*break*
he
knew
that
i
was
to
read
a
paper
next
week
upon
*punct* ,
again
he
looked
toward
the
mummy
case
*punct* ,
the
tomb
of
mekara
*punct* ;
and
he
knew
that
the
sarcophagus
had
been
brought
*punct* ,
untouched
*punct* ,
to
england
*punct* .
*break*
he
begged
me
not
to
open
it
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
was
studying
the
speaker's
face
*punct* .
*break*
what
reason
did
he
give
for
so
extraordinary
a
request
*punct* ?
*break*
sir
lionel
barton
hesitated
*punct* .
*break*
one
*punct* ,
he
replied
at
last
*punct* ,
which
amused
me
*punct* ,
at
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
inform
you
that
mekara
*punct* ,
whose
tomb
my
agent
had
discovered
during
my
absence
in
tibet
*punct* ,
and
to
enter
which
i
broke
my
return
journey
to
alexandria
*punct* ,
was
a
high
priest
and
first
prophet
of
amen
*punct* ,
under
the
pharaoh
of
the
exodus
*punct* ;
in
short
*punct* ,
one
of
the
magicians
who
contested
in
magic
arts
with
moses
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
the
discovery
unique
*punct* ,
until
professor
rembold
furnished
me
with
some
curious
particulars
respecting
the
death
of
m.
page
le
roi
*punct* ,
the
french
egyptologist
*punct* ,
particulars
new
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
we
listened
in
growing
surprise
*punct* ,
scarcely
knowing
to
what
this
tended
*punct* .
*break*
m.
le
roi
*punct* ,
continued
barton
*punct* ,
discovered
*punct* ,
but
kept
secret
*punct* ,
the
tomb
of
amenti
*punct* ,
another
of
this
particular
brotherhood
*punct* .
*break*
it
appears
that
he
opened
the
mummy
case
on
the
spot
*punct* ,
these
priests
were
of
royal
line
*punct* ,
and
are
buried
in
the
valley
of
biban-le-moluk
*punct* .
*break*
his
fellah
and
arab
servants
deserted
him
for
some
reason
*punct* ,
on
seeing
the
mummy
case
*punct* ,
and
he
was
found
dead
*punct* ,
apparently
strangled
*punct* ,
beside
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
matter
was
hushed
up
by
the
egyptian
government
*punct* .
*break*
rembold
could
not
explain
why
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
begged
of
me
not
to
open
the
sarcophagus
of
mekara
*punct* .
*break*
a
silence
fell
*punct* .
*break*
the
strange
facts
regarding
the
sudden
death
of
page
le
roi
*punct* ,
which
i
now
heard
for
the
first
time
*punct* ,
had
impressed
me
unpleasantly
*punct* ,
coming
from
a
man
of
sir
lionel
barton's
experience
and
reputation
*punct* .
*break*
how
long
had
it
lain
in
the
docks
*punct* ?
*break*
for
two
days
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
a
superstitious
man
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
but
neither
is
professor
rembold
*punct* ,
and
now
that
i
know
the
facts
respecting
page
le
roi
*punct* ,
i
can
find
it
in
my
heart
to
thank
god
that
i
did
not
see
*punct* ...
whatever
came
out
of
that
sarcophagus
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
stared
him
hard
in
the
face
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
glad
you
did
not
*punct* ,
sir
lionel
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ;
for
whatever
the
priest
mekara
has
to
do
with
the
matter
*punct* ,
by
means
of
his
sarcophagus
*punct* ,
dr.
fu-manchu
has
made
his
first
attempt
upon
your
life
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
failed
*punct* ,
but
i
hope
you
will
accompany
me
from
here
to
a
hotel
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
not
fall
twice
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
night
following
that
of
the
double
tragedy
at
rowan
house
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
with
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ,
was
engaged
in
some
mysterious
inquiry
at
the
docks
*punct* ,
and
i
had
remained
at
home
to
resume
my
strange
chronicle
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
why
should
i
not
confess
it?
*punct* ,
my
memories
had
frightened
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
arranging
my
notes
respecting
the
case
of
sir
lionel
barton
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
hopelessly
incomplete
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
i
had
jotted
down
the
following
queries:

1
*punct* ,
did
any
true
parallel
exist
between
the
death
of
m.
page

and
the
death
of
kwee

the
chinaman

how
had
the
murderer
escaped

the
green
mist
a
mere
subjective
hallucination
*punct* ,
a
figment
of
croxted's
imagination
*punct* ,
or
had
he
actually
seen
it
*punct* ?
*break*
until
these
questions
were
satisfactorily
answered
*punct* ,
further
progress
was
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
frankly
admitted
that
he
was
out
of
his
depth
*punct* .
*break*
it
looks
*punct* ,
on
the
face
of
it
*punct* ,
more
like
a
case
for
the
psychical
research
people
than
for
a
plain
civil
servant
*punct* ,
lately
of
mandalay
*punct* ,
he
had
said
only
that
morning
*punct* .
*break*
sir
lionel
barton
really
believes
that
supernatural
agencies
were
brought
into
operation
by
the
opening
of
the
high
priest's
coffin
*punct* .
*break*
for
my
part
*punct* ,
even
if
i
believed
the
same
*punct* ,
i
should
still
maintain
that
dr.
fu-manchu
controlled
those
manifestations
*punct* .
*break*
but
reason
it
out
for
yourself
and
see
if
we
arrive
at
any
common
center
*punct* .
*break*
don't
work
so
much
upon
the
datum
of
the
green
mist
*punct* ,
but
keep
to
the
facts
which
are
established
*punct* .
*break*
i
commenced
to
knock
out
my
pipe
in
the
ash-tray
*punct* ;
then
paused
*punct* ,
pipe
in
hand
*punct* .
*break*
the
house
was
quite
still
*punct* ,
for
my
landlady
and
all
the
small
household
were
out
*punct* .
*break*
above
the
noise
of
the
passing
tramcar
i
thought
i
had
heard
the
hall
door
open
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
ensuing
silence
i
sat
and
listened
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
sound
*punct* .
*break*
i
slipped
my
hand
into
the
table
drawer
*punct* ,
took
out
my
revolver
*punct* ,
and
stood
up
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
sound
*punct* .
*break*
someone
or
something
was
creeping
upstairs
in
the
dark
*punct* !
*break*
familiar
with
the
ghastly
media
employed
by
the
chinaman
*punct* ,
i
was
seized
with
an
impulse
to
leap
to
the
door
*punct* ,
shut
and
lock
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
rustling
sound
proceeded
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
from
immediately
outside
my
partially
opened
door
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
not
the
time
to
close
it
*punct* ;
knowing
somewhat
of
the
horrors
at
the
command
of
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
i
had
not
the
courage
to
open
it
*punct* .
*break*
my
heart
leaping
wildly
*punct* ,
and
my
eyes
upon
that
bar
of
darkness
with
its
gruesome
potentialities
*punct* ,
i
waited
*punct* ,
waited
for
whatever
was
to
come
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
twelve
seconds
passed
in
silence
*punct* .
*break*
answer
*punct* ,
or
i
fire
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
came
a
soft
voice
*punct* ,
thrillingly
musical
*punct* .
*break*
put
it
down
*punct* ,
that
pistol
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
speak
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
the
door
was
pushed
op
en
*punct* ,
and
there
entered
a
slim
figure
wrapped
in
a
hooded
cloak
*punct* .
*break*
my
hand
fell
*punct* ,
and
i
stood
*punct* ,
stricken
to
silence
*punct* ,
looking
into
the
beautiful
dark
eyes
of
dr.
fu-manchu's
messenger
*punct* ,
if
her
own
statement
could
be
credited
*punct* ,
slave
*punct* .
*break*
on
two
occasions
this
girl
*punct* ,
whose
association
with
the
doctor
was
one
of
the
most
profound
mysteries
of
the
case
*punct* ,
had
risked
*punct* ,
i
cannot
say
what
*punct* ;
unnameable
punishment
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
to
save
me
from
death
*punct* ;
in
both
cases
from
a
terrible
death
*punct* .
*break*
for
what
was
she
come
now
*punct* ?
*break*
her
lips
slightly
parted
*punct* ,
she
stood
*punct* ,
holding
her
cloak
about
her
*punct* ,
and
watching
me
with
great
passionate
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
how
*punct* ,
i
began
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
shook
her
head
impatiently
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
a
duplicate
key
of
the
house
door
*punct* ,
was
her
amazing
statement
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
never
betrayed
a
secret
of
my
master
before
*punct* ,
but
you
must
arrange
to
replace
the
lock
*punct* .
*break*
she
came
forward
and
rested
her
slim
hands
confidingly
upon
my
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
come
again
to
ask
you
to
take
me
away
from
him
*punct* ,
she
said
simply
*punct* .
*break*
and
she
lifted
her
face
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
her
words
struck
a
chord
in
my
heart
which
sang
with
strange
music
*punct* ,
with
music
so
barbaric
that
*punct* ,
frankly
*punct* ,
i
blushed
to
find
it
harmony
*punct* .
*break*
have
i
said
that
she
was
beautiful
*punct* ?
*break*
it
can
convey
no
faint
conception
of
her
*punct* .
*break*
with
her
pure
*punct* ,
fair
skin
*punct* ,
eyes
like
the
velvet
darkness
of
the
east
*punct* ,
and
red
lips
so
tremulously
near
to
mine
*punct* ,
she
was
the
most
seductively
lovely
creature
i
ever
had
looked
upon
*punct* .
*break*
in
that
electric
moment
my
heart
went
out
in
sympathy
to
every
man
who
had
bartered
honor
*punct* ,
country
*punct* ,
all
for
a
woman's
kiss
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
see
that
you
are
placed
under
proper
protection
*punct* ,
i
said
firmly
*punct* ,
but
my
voice
was
not
quite
my
own
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
quite
absurd
to
talk
of
slavery
here
in
england
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
a
free
agent
*punct* ,
or
you
could
not
be
here
now
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
fu-manchu
cannot
control
your
actions
*punct* .
*break*
she
cried
*punct* ,
casting
back
her
head
scornfully
*punct* ,
and
releasing
a
cloud
of
hair
*punct* ,
through
whose
softness
gleamed
a
jeweled
head-dress
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
know
what
it
means
to
have
been
a
slave
*punct* ?
*break*
here
*punct* ,
in
your
free
england
*punct* ,
do
you
know
what
it
means
*punct* ,
the
razzia
*punct* ,
the
desert
journey
*punct* ,
the
whips
of
the
drivers
*punct* ,
the
house
of
the
dealer
*punct* ,
the
shame
*punct* .
*break*
how
beautiful
she
was
in
her
indignation
*punct* !
*break*
slavery
is
put
down
*punct* ,
you
imagine
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ?
*break*
you
do
not
believe
that
to-day
*punct* ,
to-day
*punct* ,
twenty-five
english
sovereigns
will
buy
a
galla
girl
*punct* ,
who
is
brown
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
whisper
*punct* ,
two
hundred
and
fifty
a
circassian
*punct* ,
who
is
white
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
there
is
no
slavery
*punct* !
*break*
then
what
am
i
*punct* ?
*break*
she
threw
open
her
cloak
*punct* ,
and
it
is
a
literal
fact
that
i
rubbed
my
eyes
*punct* ,
half
believing
that
i
dreamed
*punct* .
*break*
for
beneath
*punct* ,
she
was
arrayed
in
gossamer
silk
which
more
than
indicated
the
perfect
lines
of
her
slim
shape
*punct* ;
wore
a
jeweled
girdle
and
barbaric
ornaments
*punct* ;
was
a
figure
fit
for
the
walled
gardens
of
stamboul
*punct* ,
a
figure
amazing
*punct* ,
incomprehensible
*punct* ,
in
the
prosaic
setting
of
my
rooms
*punct* .
*break*
to-night
i
had
no
time
to
make
myself
an
english
miss
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* ,
wrapping
her
cloak
quickly
about
her
*punct* .
*break*
you
see
me
as
i
am
*punct* .
*break*
her
garments
exhaled
a
faint
perfume
*punct* ,
and
it
reminded
me
of
another
meeting
i
had
had
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
into
the
challenging
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
your
request
is
but
a
pretense
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
why
do
you
keep
the
secrets
of
that
man
*punct* ,
when
they
mean
death
to
so
many
*punct* ?
*break*
i
have
seen
my
own
sister
die
of
fever
in
the
desert
*punct* ,
seen
her
thrown
like
carrion
into
a
hole
in
the
sand
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
seen
men
flogged
until
they
prayed
for
death
as
a
boon
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
known
the
lash
myself
*punct* .
*break*
what
does
it
matter
*punct* ?
*break*
she
shocked
me
inexpressibly
*punct* .
*break*
enveloped
in
her
cloak
again
*punct* ,
and
with
only
her
slight
accent
to
betray
her
*punct* ,
it
was
dreadful
to
hear
such
words
from
a
girl
who
*punct* ,
save
for
her
singular
type
of
beauty
*punct* ,
might
have
been
a
cultured
european
*punct* .
*break*
prove
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
that
you
really
wish
to
leave
this
man's
service
*punct* .
*break*
tell
me
what
killed
strozza
and
the
chinaman
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
that
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
you
will
carry
me
off
*punct* ,
she
clutched
me
nervously
*punct* ,
so
that
i
am
helpless
*punct* ,
lock
me
up
so
that
i
cannot
escape
*punct* ,
beat
me
*punct* ,
if
you
like
*punct* ,
i
will
tell
you
all
i
do
know
*punct* .
*break*
while
he
is
my
master
i
will
never
betray
him
*punct* .
*break*
tear
me
from
him
*punct* ,
by
force
*punct* ,
do
you
understand
*punct* ,
by
force
*punct* ,
and
my
lips
will
be
sealed
no
longer
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
do
not
understand
*punct* ,
with
your
proper
authorities'
*punct* ,
your
police
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
i
have
said
enough
*punct* .
*break*
a
clock
across
the
common
began
to
strike
*punct* .
*break*
the
girl
started
and
laid
her
hands
upon
my
shoulders
again
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
tears
glittering
among
the
curved
black
lashes
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
not
understand
*punct* ,
she
whispered
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
will
you
never
understand
and
release
me
from
him
*punct* !
*break*
i
must
go
*punct* .
*break*
already
i
have
remained
too
long
*punct* .
*break*
go
out
without
delay
*punct* .
*break*
remain
out
*punct* ,
at
a
hotel
*punct* ,
where
you
will
*punct* ,
but
do
not
stay
here
*punct* .
*break*
and
nayland
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
what
is
he
to
me
*punct* ,
this
nayland
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
why
will
you
not
unseal
my
lips
*punct* ?
*break*
you
are
in
danger
*punct* ,
you
hear
me
*punct* ,
in
danger
*punct* !
*break*
go
away
from
here
to-night
*punct* .
*break*
she
dropped
her
hands
and
ran
from
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
open
doorway
she
turned
*punct* ,
stamping
her
foot
passionately
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
hands
and
arms
*punct* ,
she
cried
*punct* ,
and
yet
you
let
me
go
*punct* .
*break*
be
warned
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ;
fly
from
here
*punct* ,
she
broke
off
with
something
that
sounded
like
a
sob
*punct* .
*break*
i
made
no
move
to
stay
her
*punct* ,
this
beautiful
accomplice
of
the
arch-murderer
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
her
light
footsteps
paltering
down
the
stairs
*punct* ,
i
heard
her
open
and
close
the
door
*punct* ,
the
door
of
which
dr.
fu-manchu
held
the
key
*punct* .
*break*
still
i
stood
where
she
had
parted
from
me
*punct* ,
and
was
so
standing
when
a
key
grated
in
the
lock
and
nayland
smith
came
running
up
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
see
her
*punct* ?
*break*
but
his
face
showed
that
he
had
not
done
so
*punct* ,
and
rapidly
i
told
him
of
my
strange
visitor
*punct* ,
of
her
words
*punct* ,
of
her
warning
*punct* .
*break*
how
can
she
have
passed
through
london
in
that
costume
*punct* ?
*break*
i
cried
in
bewilderment
*punct* .
*break*
where
can
she
have
come
from
*punct* ?
*break*
smith
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
began
to
stuff
broad-cut
mixture
into
the
familiar
cracked
briar
*punct* .
*break*
she
might
have
traveled
in
a
car
or
in
a
cab
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ;
and
undoubtedly
she
came
direct
from
the
house
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
you
should
have
detained
her
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
the
third
time
we
have
had
that
woman
in
our
power
*punct* ,
the
third
time
we
have
let
her
go
free
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* ,
i
couldn't
*punct* .
*break*
she
came
of
her
own
free
will
to
give
me
a
warning
*punct* .
*break*
she
disarms
me
*punct* .
*break*
because
you
can
see
she
is
in
love
with
you
*punct* ?
*break*
he
suggested
*punct* ,
and
burst
into
one
of
his
rare
laughs
when
the
angry
flush
rose
to
my
cheek
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
*punct* ,
petrie
why
pretend
to
be
blind
to
it
*punct* ?
*break*
you
don't
know
the
oriental
mind
as
i
do
*punct* ;
but
i
quite
understand
the
girl's
position
*punct* .
*break*
she
fears
the
english
authorities
*punct* ,
but
would
submit
to
capture
by
you
*punct* !
*break*
if
you
would
only
seize
her
by
the
hair
*punct* ,
drag
her
to
some
cellar
*punct* ,
hurl
her
down
and
stand
over
her
with
a
whip
*punct* ,
she
would
tell
you
everything
she
knows
*punct* ,
and
salve
her
strange
eastern
conscience
with
the
reflection
that
speech
was
forced
from
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
joking
*punct* ;
it
is
so
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* .
*break*
and
she
would
adore
you
for
your
savagery
*punct* ,
deeming
you
forceful
and
strong
*punct* !
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
be
serious
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
what
her
warning
meant
before
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
guess
what
it
means
now
*punct* ,
he
rapped
*punct* .
*break*
someone
was
furiously
ringing
the
bell
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
at
home
*punct* ?
*break*
said
my
friend
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
go
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
i
know
what
it
is
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
minutes
later
he
returned
*punct* ,
carrying
a
large
square
package
*punct* .
*break*
from
weymouth
*punct* ,
he
explained
*punct* ,
by
district
messenger
*punct* .
*break*
i
left
him
behind
at
the
docks
*punct* ,
and
he
arranged
to
forward
any
evidence
which
subsequently
he
found
*punct* .
*break*
this
will
be
fragments
of
the
mummy
*punct* .
*break*
you
think
the
mummy
was
abstracted
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
at
the
docks
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
of
it
*punct* ;
and
somebody
else
was
in
the
sarcophagus
when
it
reached
rowan
house
*punct* .
*break*
a
sarcophagus
*punct* ,
i
find
*punct* ,
is
practically
airtight
*punct* ,
so
that
the
use
of
the
rubber
stopper
becomes
evident
*punct* ,
ventilation
*punct* .
*break*
how
this
person
killed
strozza
i
have
yet
to
learn
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
how
he
escaped
from
a
locked
room
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
about
the
green
mist
*punct* ?
*break*
nayland
smith
spread
his
hands
in
a
characteristic
gesture
*punct* .
*break*
the
green
mist
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
can
be
explained
in
several
ways
*punct* .
*break*
remember
*punct* ,
we
have
only
one
man's
word
that
it
existed
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
at
best
a
confusing
datum
to
which
we
must
not
attach
a
fictitious
importance
*punct* .
*break*
he
threw
the
wrappings
on
the
floor
and
tugged
at
a
twine
loop
in
the
lid
of
the
square
box
*punct* ,
which
now
stood
upon
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
the
lid
came
away
*punct* ,
bringing
with
it
a
lead
lining
*punct* ,
such
as
is
usual
in
tea-chests
*punct* .
*break*
this
lining
was
partially
attached
to
one
side
of
the
box
*punct* ,
so
that
the
action
of
removing
the
lid
at
once
raised
and
tilted
it
*punct* .
*break*
then
happened
a
singular
thing
*punct* .
*break*
out
over
the
table
billowed
a
sort
of
yellowish-green
cloud
*punct* ,
an
oily
vapor
*punct* ,
and
an
inspiration
*punct* ,
it
was
nothing
less
*punct* ,
born
of
a
memory
and
of
some
words
of
my
beautiful
visitor
*punct* ,
came
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
run
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* !
*break*
the
door
*punct* ,
for
your
life
*punct* !
*break*
fu-manchu
sent
that
box
*punct* !
*break*
i
threw
my
arms
round
him
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
bent
forward
the
moving
vapor
rose
almost
to
his
nostrils
*punct* .
*break*
i
dragged
him
back
and
all
but
pitched
him
out
on
to
the
landing
*punct* .
*break*
we
entered
my
bedroom
*punct* ,
and
there
*punct* ,
as
i
turned
on
the
light
*punct* ,
i
saw
that
smith's
tanned
face
was
unusually
drawn
*punct* ,
and
touched
with
pallor
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
poisonous
gas
*punct* !
*break*
i
said
hoarsely
*punct* ;
in
many
respects
identical
with
chlorine
*punct* ,
but
having
unique
properties
which
prove
it
to
be
something
else
*punct* ,
god
and
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
alone
know
what
*punct* !
*break*
it
is
the
fumes
of
chlorine
that
kill
the
men
in
the
bleaching
powder
works
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
been
blind
*punct* ,
i
particularly
*punct* .
*break*
don't
you
see
*punct* ?
*break*
there
was
no
one
in
the
sarcophagus
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ,
but
there
was
enough
of
that
fearful
stuff
to
have
suffocated
a
regiment
*punct* !
*break*
smith
clenched
his
fists
convulsively
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
*punct* ,
how
can
i
hope
to
deal
with
the
author
of
such
a
scheme
*punct* ?
*break*
i
see
the
whole
plan
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
reckon
on
the
mummy
case
being
overturned
*punct* ,
and
kwee's
part
was
to
remove
the
plug
with
the
aid
of
the
string
*punct* ,
after
sir
lionel
had
been
suffocated
*punct* .
*break*
the
gas
*punct* ,
i
take
it
*punct* ,
is
heavier
than
air
*punct* .
*break*
chlorine
gas
has
a
specific
gravity
of
2.470
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ;
two
and
a
half
times
heavier
than
air
*punct* .
*break*
you
can
pour
it
from
jar
to
jar
like
a
liquid
*punct* ,
if
you
are
wearing
a
chemist's
mask
*punct* .
*break*
in
these
respects
this
stuff
appears
to
be
similar
*punct* ;
the
points
of
difference
would
not
interest
you
*punct* .
*break*
the
sarcophagus
would
have
emptied
through
the
vent
*punct* ,
and
the
gas
have
dispersed
*punct* ,
with
no
clew
remaining
*punct* ,
except
the
smell
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
smell
it
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
on
the
stopper
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
was
unfamiliar
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
remember
that
you
were
prevented
from
doing
so
by
the
arrival
of
sir
lionel
*punct* ?
*break*
the
scent
of
those
infernal
flowers
must
partially
have
drowned
it
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
poor
*punct* ,
misguided
strozza
inhaled
the
stuff
*punct* ,
capsized
the
case
in
his
fall
*punct* ,
and
all
the
gas
*punct* ,
went
pouring
under
the
conservatory
door
*punct* ,
and
down
the
steps
*punct* ,
where
kwee
was
crouching
*punct* .
*break*
croxted's
breaking
the
window
created
sufficient
draught
to
disperse
what
little
remained
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
have
settled
on
the
floor
now
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
go
and
open
both
windows
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
raised
his
haggard
face
*punct* .
*break*
he
evidently
made
more
than
was
necessary
to
dispatch
sir
lionel
barton
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ;
and
contemptuously
*punct* ,
you
note
the
attitude
*punct* ,
petrie?
*punct* ,
contemptuously
devoted
the
surplus
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
his
contempt
is
justified
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
a
child
striving
to
cope
with
a
mental
giant
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
by
no
wit
of
mine
that
dr.
fu-manchu
scores
a
double
failure
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
tell
you
*punct* ,
now
of
a
strange
dream
which
i
dreamed
*punct* ,
and
of
the
stranger
things
to
which
i
awakened
*punct* .
*break*
since
*punct* ,
out
of
a
blank
*punct* ,
a
void
*punct* ,
this
vision
burst
in
upon
my
mind
*punct* ,
i
cannot
do
better
than
relate
it
*punct* ,
without
preamble
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
thus
*punct* :
i
dreamed
that
i
lay
writhing
on
the
floor
in
agony
indescribable
*punct* .
*break*
my
veins
were
filled
with
liquid
fire
*punct* ,
and
but
that
stygian
darkness
was
about
me
*punct* ,
i
told
myself
that
i
must
have
seen
the
smoke
arising
from
my
burning
body
*punct* .
*break*
this
*punct* ,
i
thought
*punct* ,
was
death
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
a
cooling
shower
descended
upon
me
*punct* ,
soaked
through
skin
and
tissue
to
the
tortured
arteries
and
quenched
the
fire
within
*punct* .
*break*
panting
*punct* ,
but
free
from
pain
*punct* ,
i
lay
*punct* ,
exhausted
*punct* .
*break*
strength
gradually
returning
to
me
*punct* ,
i
tried
to
rise
*punct* ;
but
the
carpet
felt
so
singularly
soft
that
it
offered
me
no
foothold
*punct* .
*break*
i
waded
and
plunged
like
a
swimmer
treading
water
*punct* ;
and
all
about
me
rose
impenetrable
walls
of
darkness
*punct* ,
darkness
all
but
palpable
*punct* .
*break*
i
wondered
why
i
could
not
see
the
windows
*punct* .
*break*
the
horrible
idea
flashed
to
my
mind
that
i
was
become
blind
*punct* !
*break*
somehow
i
got
upon
my
feet
*punct* ,
and
stood
swaying
dizzily
*punct* .
*break*
i
became
aware
of
a
heavy
perfume
*punct* ,
and
knew
it
for
some
kind
of
incense
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
a
dim
light
was
born
*punct* ,
at
an
immeasurable
distance
away
*punct* .
*break*
it
grew
steadily
in
brilliance
*punct* .
*break*
it
spread
like
a
bluish-red
stain
*punct* ,
like
a
liquid
*punct* .
*break*
it
lapped
up
the
darkness
and
spread
throughout
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
was
not
my
room
*punct* !
*break*
nor
was
it
any
room
known
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
an
apartment
of
such
size
that
its
dimensions
filled
me
with
a
kind
of
awe
such
as
i
never
had
known
*punct* :
the
awe
of
walled
vastness
*punct* .
*break*
its
immense
extent
produced
a
sensation
of
sound
*punct* .
*break*
its
hugeness
had
a
distinct
note
*punct* .
*break*
tapestries
covered
the
four
walls
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
door
visible
*punct* .
*break*
these
tapestries
were
magnificently
figured
with
golden
dragons
*punct* ;
and
as
the
serpentine
bodies
gleamed
and
shimmered
in
the
increasing
radiance
*punct* ,
each
dragon
*punct* ,
i
thought
*punct* ,
intertwined
its
glittering
coils
more
closely
with
those
of
another
*punct* .
*break*
the
carpet
was
of
such
richness
that
i
stood
knee-deep
in
its
pile
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
was
fashioned
all
over
with
golden
dragons
*punct* ;
and
they
seemed
to
glide
about
amid
the
shadows
of
the
design
*punct* ,
stealthily
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
*punct* ,
for
hall
it
was
*punct* ,
a
huge
table
with
dragons
legs
stood
solitary
amid
the
luxuriance
of
the
carpet
*punct* .
*break*
it
bore
scintillating
globes
*punct* ,
and
tubes
that
held
living
organisms
*punct* ,
and
books
of
a
size
and
in
such
bindings
as
i
never
had
imagined
*punct* ,
with
instruments
of
a
type
unknown
to
western
science
*punct* ,
a
heterogeneous
litter
quite
indescribable
*punct* ,
which
overflowed
on
to
the
floor
*punct* ,
forming
an
amazing
oasis
in
a
dragon-haunted
desert
of
carpet
*punct* .
*break*
a
lamp
hung
above
this
table
*punct* ,
suspended
by
golden
chains
from
the
ceiling-which
was
so
lofty
that
*punct* ,
following
the
chains
upward
*punct* ,
my
gaze
lost
itself
in
the
purple
shadows
above
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
chair
piled
high
with
dragon-covered
cushions
a
man
sat
behind
this
table
*punct* .
*break*
the
light
from
the
swinging
lamp
fell
fully
upon
one
side
of
his
face
*punct* ,
as
he
leaned
forward
amid
the
jumble
of
weird
objects
*punct* ,
and
left
the
other
side
in
purplish
shadow
*punct* .
*break*
from
a
plain
brass
bowl
upon
the
corner
of
the
huge
table
smoke
writhed
aloft
and
at
times
partially
obscured
that
dreadful
face
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
instant
that
my
eyes
were
drawn
to
the
table
and
to
the
man
who
sat
there
*punct* ,
neither
the
incredible
extent
of
the
room
*punct* ,
nor
the
nightmare
fashion
of
its
mural
decorations
*punct* ,
could
reclaim
my
attention
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
eyes
only
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
for
it
was
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
something
of
the
delirium
which
had
seemed
to
fill
my
veins
with
fire
*punct* ,
to
people
the
walls
with
dragons
*punct* ,
and
to
plunge
me
knee-deep
in
the
carpet
*punct* ,
left
me
*punct* .
*break*
those
dreadful
*punct* ,
filmed
green
eyes
acted
somewhat
like
a
cold
douche
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
*punct* ,
without
removing
my
gaze
from
the
still
face
*punct* ,
that
the
walls
no
longer
lived
*punct* ,
but
were
merely
draped
in
exquisite
chinese
dragon
tapestry
*punct* .
*break*
the
rich
carpet
beneath
my
feet
ceased
to
be
as
a
jungle
and
became
a
normal
carpet
*punct* ,
extraordinarily
rich
*punct* ,
but
merely
a
carpet
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
sense
of
vastness
nevertheless
remained
*punct* ,
with
the
uncomfortable
knowledge
that
the
things
upon
the
table
and
overflowing
about
it
were
all
*punct* ,
or
nearly
all
*punct* ,
of
a
fashion
strange
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
and
almost
instantaneously
*punct* ,
the
comparative
sanity
which
i
had
temporarily
experienced
began
to
slip
from
me
again
*punct* ;
for
the
smoke
faintly
penciled
through
the
air
*punct* ,
from
the
burning
perfume
on
the
table
*punct* ,
grew
in
volume
*punct* ,
thickened
*punct* ,
and
wafted
towards
me
in
a
cloud
of
gray
horror
*punct* .
*break*
it
enveloped
me
*punct* ,
clammily
*punct* .
*break*
dimly
*punct* ,
through
its
oily
wreaths
*punct* ,
i
saw
the
immobile
yellow
face
of
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
and
my
stupefied
brain
acclaimed
him
a
sorcerer
*punct* ,
against
whom
unwittingly
we
had
pitted
our
poor
human
wits
*punct* .
*break*
the
green
eyes
showed
filmy
through
the
fog
*punct* .
*break*
an
intense
pain
shot
through
my
lower
limbs
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
catching
my
breath
*punct* ,
i
looked
down
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
did
so
*punct* ,
the
points
of
the
red
slippers
which
i
dreamed
that
i
wore
increased
in
length
*punct* ,
curled
sinuously
upward
*punct* ,
twined
about
my
throat
and
choked
the
breath
from
my
body
*punct* !
*break*
came
an
interval
*punct* ,
and
then
a
dawning
like
consciousness
*punct* ;
but
it
was
a
false
consciousness
*punct* ,
since
it
brought
with
it
the
idea
that
my
head
lay
softly
pillowed
and
that
a
woman's
hand
caressed
my
throbbing
forehead
*punct* .
*break*
confusedly
*punct* ,
as
though
in
the
remote
past
*punct* ,
i
recalled
a
kiss
*punct* ,
and
the
recollection
thrilled
me
strangely
*punct* .
*break*
dreamily
content
i
lay
*punct* ,
and
a
voice
stole
to
my
ears
*punct* :
they
are
killing
him
*punct* !
*break*
they
are
killing
him
*punct* !
*break*
do
you
not
understand
*punct* ?
*break*
in
my
dazed
condition
*punct* ,
i
thought
that
it
was
i
who
had
died
*punct* ,
and
that
this
musical
girl-voice
was
communicating
to
me
the
fact
of
my
own
dissolution
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
was
conscious
of
no
interest
in
the
matter
*punct* .
*break*
for
hours
and
hours
*punct* ,
i
thought
*punct* ,
that
soothing
hand
caressed
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
once
raised
my
heavy
lids
*punct* ,
until
there
came
a
resounding
crash
that
seemed
to
set
my
very
bones
vibrating
*punct* ,
a
metallic
*punct* ,
jangling
crash
*punct* ,
as
the
fall
of
heavy
chains
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
that
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
i
half
opened
my
eyes
*punct* ,
and
that
in
the
dimness
i
had
a
fleeting
glimpse
of
a
figure
clad
in
gossamer
silk
*punct* ,
with
arms
covered
with
barbaric
bangles
and
slim
ankles
surrounded
by
gold
bands
*punct* .
*break*
the
girl
was
gone
*punct* ,
even
as
i
told
myself
that
she
was
an
houri
*punct* ,
and
that
i
*punct* ,
though
a
christian
*punct* ,
had
been
consigned
by
some
error
to
the
paradise
of
mohammed
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
a
complete
blank
*punct* .
*break*
my
head
throbbed
madly
*punct* ;
my
brain
seemed
to
be
clogged
*punct* ,
inert
*punct* ;
and
though
my
first
*punct* ,
feeble
movement
was
followed
by
the
rattle
of
a
chain
*punct* ,
some
moments
more
elapsed
ere
i
realized
that
the
chain
was
fastened
to
a
steel
collar
*punct* ,
that
the
steel
collar
was
clasped
about
my
neck
*punct* .
*break*
i
moaned
weakly
*punct* .
*break*
i
muttered
*punct* ,
where
are
you
*punct* ?
*break*
on
to
my
knees
i
struggled
*punct* ,
and
the
pain
on
the
top
of
my
skull
grew
all
but
insupportable
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
coming
back
to
me
now
*punct* ;
how
nayland
smith
and
i
had
started
for
the
hotel
to
warn
graham
guthrie
*punct* ;
how
*punct* ,
as
we
passed
up
the
steps
from
the
embankment
and
into
essex
street
*punct* ,
we
saw
the
big
motor
standing
before
the
door
of
one
of
the
offices
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
recall
coming
up
level
with
the
car
*punct* ,
a
modern
limousine
*punct* ;
but
my
mind
retained
no
impression
of
our
having
passed
it
*punct* ,
only
a
vague
memory
of
a
rush
of
footsteps
*punct* ,
a
blow
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
my
vision
of
the
hall
of
dragons
*punct* ,
and
now
this
real
awakening
to
a
worse
reality
*punct* .
*break*
groping
in
the
darkness
*punct* ,
my
hands
touched
a
body
that
lay
close
beside
me
*punct* .
*break*
my
fingers
sought
and
found
the
throat
*punct* ,
sought
and
found
the
steel
collar
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
groaned
*punct* ;
and
i
shook
the
still
form
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ,
speak
to
me
*punct* !
*break*
could
he
be
dead
*punct* ?
*break*
was
this
the
end
of
his
gallant
fight
with
dr.
fu-manchu
and
the
murder
group
*punct* ?
*break*
if
so
*punct* ,
what
did
the
future
hold
for
me
*punct* ,
what
had
i
to
face
*punct* ?
*break*
he
stirred
beneath
my
trembling
hands
*punct* .
*break*
i
muttered
*punct* ,
and
i
cannot
deny
that
my
joy
was
tainted
with
selfishness
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
waking
in
that
impenetrable
darkness
*punct* ,
and
yet
obsessed
with
the
dream
i
had
dreamed
*punct* ,
i
had
known
what
fear
meant
*punct* ,
at
the
realization
that
alone
*punct* ,
chained
*punct* ,
i
must
face
the
dreadful
chinese
doctor
in
the
flesh
*punct* .
*break*
smith
began
incoherent
mutterings
*punct* .
*break*
sand-bagged!
*punct* ...
look
out
*punct* ,
petrie!
*punct* ...
he
has
us
at
last!
*punct* ...
oh
*punct* ,
heavens!
*punct* ...
he
struggled
on
to
his
knees
*punct* ,
clutching
at
my
hand
*punct* .
*break*
all
right
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
both
alive
*punct* !
*break*
so
let's
be
thankful
*punct* .
*break*
a
moment's
silence
*punct* ,
a
groan
*punct* ,
then
*punct* :
petrie
*punct* ,
i
have
dragged
you
into
this
*punct* .
*break*
god
forgive
me
*punct* ,
dry
up
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ,
i
said
slowly
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
not
a
child
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
question
of
being
dragged
into
the
matter
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
here
*punct* ;
and
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
*punct* ,
i'm
glad
i
am
here
*punct* !
*break*
he
grasped
my
hand
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
two
chinese
*punct* ,
in
european
clothes
*punct* ,
lord
*punct* ,
how
my
head
throbs!
*punct* ,
in
that
office
door
*punct* .
*break*
they
sand-bagged
us
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
think
of
it!
*punct* ,
in
broad
daylight
*punct* ,
within
hail
of
the
strand
*punct* !
*break*
we
were
rushed
into
the
car
*punct* ,
and
it
was
all
over
*punct* ,
before
*punct* ,
his
voice
grew
faint
*punct* .
*break*
they
gave
me
an
awful
knock
*punct* !
*break*
why
have
we
been
spared
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
do
you
think
he
is
saving
us
for
*punct* ,
don't
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
if
you
had
been
in
china
*punct* ,
if
you
had
seen
what
i
have
seen
*punct* ,
footsteps
sounded
on
the
flagged
passage
*punct* .
*break*
a
blade
of
light
crept
across
the
floor
towards
us
*punct* .
*break*
my
brain
was
growing
clearer
*punct* .
*break*
the
place
had
a
damp
*punct* ,
earthen
smell
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
slimy
*punct* ,
some
noisome
cellar
*punct* .
*break*
a
door
was
thrown
open
and
a
man
entered
*punct* ,
carrying
a
lantern
*punct* .
*break*
its
light
showed
my
surmise
to
be
accurate
*punct* ,
showed
the
slime-coated
walls
of
a
dungeon
some
fifteen
feet
square
*punct* ,
shone
upon
the
long
yellow
robe
of
the
man
who
stood
watching
us
*punct* ,
upon
the
malignant
*punct* ,
intellectual
countenance
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
they
were
face
to
face
*punct* ,
the
head
of
the
great
yellow
movement
*punct* ,
and
the
man
who
fought
on
behalf
of
the
entire
white
race
*punct* .
*break*
how
can
i
paint
the
individual
who
now
stood
before
us
*punct* ,
perhaps
the
greatest
genius
of
modern
times
*punct* ?
*break*
of
him
it
had
been
fitly
said
that
he
had
a
brow
like
shakespeare
and
a
face
like
satan
*punct* .
*break*
something
serpentine
*punct* ,
hypnotic
*punct* ,
was
in
his
very
presence
*punct* .
*break*
smith
drew
one
sharp
breath
*punct* ,
and
was
silent
*punct* .
*break*
together
*punct* ,
chained
to
the
wall
*punct* ,
two
mediaeval
captives
*punct* ,
living
mockeries
of
our
boasted
modern
security
*punct* ,
we
crouched
before
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
forward
with
an
indescribable
gait
*punct* ,
cat-like
yet
awkward
*punct* ,
carrying
his
high
shoulders
almost
hunched
*punct* .
*break*
he
placed
the
lantern
in
a
niche
in
the
wall
*punct* ,
never
turning
away
the
reptilian
gaze
of
those
eyes
which
must
haunt
my
dreams
forever
*punct* .
*break*
they
possessed
a
viridescence
which
hitherto
i
had
supposed
possible
only
in
the
eye
of
the
cat
*punct* ,
and
the
film
intermittently
clouded
their
brightness
*punct* ,
but
i
can
speak
of
them
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
never
supposed
*punct* ,
prior
to
meeting
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
that
so
intense
a
force
of
malignancy
could
radiate
*punct* ,
from
any
human
being
*punct* .
*break*
his
english
was
perfect
*punct* ,
though
at
times
his
words
were
oddly
chosen
*punct* ;
his
delivery
alternately
was
guttural
and
sibilant
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
smith
and
dr.
petrie
*punct* ,
your
interference
with
my
plans
has
gone
too
far
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
seriously
turned
my
attention
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
he
displayed
his
teeth
*punct* ,
small
and
evenly
separated
*punct* ,
but
discolored
in
a
way
that
was
familiar
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
studied
his
eyes
with
a
new
professional
interest
*punct* ,
which
even
the
extremity
of
our
danger
could
not
wholly
banish
*punct* .
*break*
their
greenness
seemed
to
be
of
the
iris
*punct* ;
the
pupil
was
oddly
contracted
*punct* ,
a
pin-point
*punct* .
*break*
smith
leaned
his
back
against
the
wall
with
assumed
indifference
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
presumed
*punct* ,
continued
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
to
meddle
with
a
world-change
*punct* .
*break*
poor
spiders
*punct* ,
caught
in
the
wheels
of
the
inevitable
*punct* !
*break*
you
have
linked
my
name
with
the
futility
of
the
young
china
movement
*punct* ,
the
name
of
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
you
are
an
incompetent
meddler
*punct* ,
i
despise
you
*punct* !
*break*
dr.
petrie
*punct* ,
you
are
a
fool
*punct* ,
i
am
sorry
for
you
*punct* !
*break*
he
rested
one
bony
hand
on
his
hip
*punct* ,
narrowing
the
long
eyes
as
he
looked
down
on
us
*punct* .
*break*
the
purposeful
cruelty
of
the
man
was
inherent
*punct* ;
it
was
entirely
untheatrical
*punct* .
*break*
still
smith
remained
silent
*punct* .
*break*
so
i
am
determined
to
remove
you
from
the
scene
of
your
blunders
*punct* !
*break*
opium
will
very
shortly
do
the
same
for
you
*punct* !
*break*
i
rapped
at
him
savagely
*punct* .
*break*
without
emotion
he
turned
the
narrowed
eyes
upon
me
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
a
matter
of
opinion
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
have
lacked
the
opportunities
which
have
been
mine
for
studying
that
subject
*punct* ,
and
in
any
event
i
shall
not
be
privileged
to
enjoy
your
advice
in
the
future
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
not
long
outlive
me
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* .
*break*
and
our
deaths
will
not
profit
you
*punct* ,
incidentally
*punct* ;
because
*punct* ,
smith's
foot
touched
mine
*punct* .
*break*
inquired
fu-manchu
softly
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
smith
is
so
prudent
*punct* !
*break*
he
is
thinking
that
i
have
files
*punct* !
*break*
he
pronounced
the
word
in
a
way
that
made
me
shudder
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
smith
has
seen
a
wire
jacket
*punct* !
*break*
have
you
ever
seen
a
wire
jacket
*punct* ?
*break*
as
a
surgeon
its
functions
would
interest
you
*punct* !
*break*
i
stifled
a
cry
that
rose
to
my
lips
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
with
a
shrill
whistling
sound
*punct* ,
a
small
shape
came
bounding
into
the
dimly
lit
vault
*punct* ,
then
shot
upward
*punct* .
*break*
a
marmoset
landed
on
the
shoulder
of
dr.
fu-manchu
and
peered
grotesquely
into
the
dreadful
yellow
face
*punct* .
*break*
the
doctor
raised
his
bony
hand
and
fondled
the
little
creature
*punct* ,
crooning
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
my
pets
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
suddenly
opening
his
eyes
fully
so
that
they
blazed
like
green
lamps
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
others
*punct* ,
equally
useful
*punct* .
*break*
my
scorpions
*punct* ,
have
you
met
my
scorpions
*punct* ?
*break*
my
pythons
and
hamadryads
*punct* ?
*break*
then
there
are
my
fungi
and
my
tiny
allies
*punct* ,
the
bacilli
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
a
collection
in
my
laboratory
quite
unique
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
ever
visited
molokai
*punct* ,
the
leper
island
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ?
*break*
but
mr.
nayland
smith
will
be
familiar
with
the
asylum
at
rangoon
*punct* !
*break*
and
we
must
not
forget
my
black
spiders
*punct* ,
with
their
diamond
eyes
*punct* ,
my
spiders
*punct* ,
that
sit
in
the
dark
and
watch
*punct* ,
then
leap
*punct* !
*break*
he
raised
his
lean
hands
*punct* ,
so
that
the
sleeve
of
the
robe
fell
back
to
the
elbow
*punct* ,
and
the
ape
dropped
*punct* ,
chattering
*punct* ,
to
the
floor
and
ran
from
the
cellar
*punct* .
*break*
o
god
of
cathay
*punct* !
*break*
he
cried
*punct* ,
by
what
death
shall
these
die
*punct* ,
these
miserable
ones
who
would
bind
thine
empire
*punct* ,
which
is
boundless
*punct* !
*break*
like
some
priest
of
tezcat
he
stood
*punct* ,
his
eyes
upraised
to
the
roof
*punct* ,
his
lean
body
quivering
*punct* ,
a
sight
to
shock
the
most
unimpressionable
mind
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
mad
*punct* !
*break*
i
whispered
to
smith
*punct* .
*break*
god
help
us
*punct* ,
the
man
is
a
dangerous
homicidal
maniac
*punct* !
*break*
nayland
smith's
tanned
face
was
very
drawn
*punct* ,
but
he
shook
his
head
grimly
*punct* .
*break*
dangerous
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
i
agree
*punct* ,
he
muttered
*punct* ;
his
existence
is
a
danger
to
the
entire
white
race
which
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
we
are
powerless
to
avert
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
fu-manchu
recovered
himself
*punct* ,
took
up
the
lantern
and
*punct* ,
turning
abruptly
*punct* ,
walked
to
the
door
*punct* ,
with
his
awkward
*punct* ,
yet
feline
gait
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
threshold
be
looked
back
*punct* .
*break*
you
would
have
warned
mr.
graham
guthrie
*punct* ?
*break*
he
said
*punct* ,
in
a
soft
voice
*punct* .
*break*
to-night
*punct* ,
at
half-past
twelve
*punct* ,
mr.
graham
guthrie
dies
*punct* !
*break*
smith
sat
silent
and
motionless
*punct* ,
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
speaker
*punct* .
*break*
you
were
in
rangoon
in
1908
*punct* ?
*break*
continued
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
you
remember
the
call
*punct* ?
*break*
from
somewhere
above
us
*punct* ,
i
could
not
determine
the
exact
direction
*punct* ,
came
a
low
*punct* ,
wailing
cry
*punct* ,
an
uncanny
thing
of
falling
cadences
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
in
that
dismal
vault
*punct* ,
with
the
sinister
yellow-robed
figure
at
the
door
*punct* ,
seemed
to
pour
ice
into
my
veins
*punct* .
*break*
its
effect
upon
smith
was
truly
extraordinary
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
showed
grayly
in
the
faint
light
*punct* ,
and
i
heard
him
draw
a
hissing
breath
through
clenched
teeth
*punct* .
*break*
it
calls
for
you
*punct* !
*break*
at
half-past
twelve
it
calls
for
graham
guthrie
*punct* !
*break*
the
door
closed
and
darkness
mantled
us
again
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
what
was
that
*punct* ?
*break*
the
horrors
about
us
were
playing
havoc
with
my
nerves
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
call
of
siva
*punct* !
*break*
replied
smith
hoarsely
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
who
uttered
it
*punct* ?
*break*
what
does
it
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
i
don't
know
what
it
is
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
nor
who
utters
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
means
death
*punct* !
*break*
there
may
be
some
who
could
have
lain
*punct* ,
chained
to
that
noisome
cell
*punct* ,
and
felt
no
fear
*punct* ,
no
dread
of
what
the
blackness
might
hold
*punct* .
*break*
i
confess
that
i
am
not
one
of
these
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
that
nayland
smith
and
i
stood
in
the
path
of
the
most
stupendous
genius
who
in
the
world's
history
had
devoted
his
intellect
to
crime
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
that
the
enormous
wealth
of
the
political
group
backing
dr.
fu-manchu
rendered
him
a
menace
to
europe
and
to
america
greater
than
that
of
the
plague
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
scientist
trained
at
a
great
university
*punct* ,
an
explorer
of
nature's
secrets
*punct* ,
who
had
gone
farther
into
the
unknown
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
than
any
living
man
*punct* .
*break*
his
mission
was
to
remove
all
obstacles
*punct* ,
human
obstacles
*punct* ,
from
the
path
of
that
secret
movement
which
was
progressing
in
the
far
east
*punct* .
*break*
smith
and
i
were
two
such
obstacles
*punct* ;
and
of
all
the
horrible
devices
at
his
command
*punct* ,
i
wondered
*punct* ,
and
my
tortured
brain
refused
to
leave
the
subject
*punct* ,
by
which
of
them
were
we
doomed
to
be
dispatched
*punct* ?
*break*
even
at
that
very
moment
some
venomous
centipede
might
be
wriggling
towards
me
over
the
slime
of
the
stones
*punct* ,
some
poisonous
spider
be
preparing
to
drop
from
the
roof
*punct* !
*break*
fu-manchu
might
have
released
a
serpent
in
the
cellar
*punct* ,
or
the
air
be
alive
with
microbes
of
a
loathsome
disease
*punct* !
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
scarcely
recognizing
my
own
voice
*punct* ,
i
can't
bear
this
suspense
*punct* .
*break*
he
intends
to
kill
us
*punct* ,
that
is
certain
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
don't
worry
*punct* ,
came
the
reply
*punct* ;
he
intends
to
learn
our
plans
first
*punct* .
*break*
you
heard
him
speak
of
his
files
and
of
his
wire
jacket
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
my
god
*punct* !
*break*
i
groaned
*punct* ;
can
this
be
england
*punct* ?
*break*
smith
laughed
dryly
*punct* ,
and
i
heard
him
fumbling
with
the
steel
collar
about
his
neck
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
one
great
hope
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
since
you
share
my
captivity
*punct* ,
but
we
must
neglect
no
minor
chance
*punct* .
*break*
try
with
your
pocket-knife
if
you
can
force
the
lock
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
trying
to
break
this
one
*punct* .
*break*
truth
to
tell
*punct* ,
the
idea
had
not
entered
my
half-dazed
mind
*punct* ,
but
i
immediately
acted
upon
my
friend's
suggestion
*punct* ,
setting
to
work
with
the
small
blade
of
my
knife
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
so
engaged
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
having
snapped
one
blade
*punct* ,
was
about
to
open
another
*punct* ,
when
a
sound
arrested
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
came
from
beneath
my
feet
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
whispered
*punct* ,
listen
*punct* !
*break*
the
scraping
and
clicking
which
told
of
smith's
efforts
ceased
*punct* .
*break*
motionless
*punct* ,
we
sat
in
that
humid
darkness
and
listened
*punct* .
*break*
something
was
moving
beneath
the
stones
of
the
cellar
*punct* .
*break*
i
held
my
breath
*punct* ;
every
nerve
in
my
body
was
strung
up
*punct* .
*break*
a
line
of
light
showed
a
few
feet
from
where
we
lay
*punct* .
*break*
it
widened
*punct* ,
became
an
oblong
*punct* .
*break*
a
trap
was
lifted
*punct* ,
and
within
a
yard
of
me
*punct* ,
there
rose
a
dimly
seen
head
*punct* .
*break*
horror
i
had
expected
*punct* ,
and
death
*punct* ,
or
worse
*punct* .
*break*
instead
*punct* ,
i
saw
a
lovely
face
*punct* ,
crowned
with
a
disordered
mass
of
curling
hair
*punct* ;
i
saw
a
white
arm
upholding
the
stone
slab
*punct* ,
a
shapely
arm
clasped
about
the
elbow
by
a
broad
gold
bangle
*punct* .
*break*
the
girl
climbed
into
the
cellar
and
placed
the
lantern
on
the
stone
floor
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
dim
light
she
was
unreal
*punct* ,
a
figure
from
an
opium
vision
*punct* ,
with
her
clinging
silk
draperies
and
garish
jewelry
*punct* ,
with
her
feet
encased
in
little
red
slippers
*punct* .
*break*
in
short
*punct* ,
this
was
the
houri
of
my
vision
*punct* ,
materialized
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
we
were
in
modern
*punct* ,
up-to-date
england
*punct* ;
easy
to
dream
that
we
were
the
captives
of
a
caliph
*punct* ,
in
a
dungeon
in
old
bagdad
*punct* .
*break*
my
prayers
are
answered
*punct* ,
said
smith
softly
*punct* .
*break*
she
has
come
to
save
you
*punct* .
*break*
warned
the
girl
*punct* ,
and
her
wonderful
eyes
opened
widely
*punct* ,
fearfully
*punct* .
*break*
a
sound
and
he
will
kill
us
all
*punct* .
*break*
she
bent
over
me
*punct* ;
a
key
jarred
in
the
lock
which
had
broken
my
penknife
*punct* ,
and
the
collar
was
off
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
rose
to
my
feet
the
girl
turned
and
released
smith
*punct* .
*break*
she
raised
the
lantern
above
the
trap
*punct* ,
and
signed
to
us
to
descend
the
wooden
steps
which
its
light
revealed
*punct* .
*break*
your
knife
*punct* ,
she
whispered
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
leave
it
on
the
floor
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
think
you
forced
the
locks
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
stepping
gingerly
*punct* ,
disappeared
into
the
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
i
rapidly
followed
*punct* .
*break*
last
of
all
came
our
mysterious
friend
*punct* ,
a
gold
band
about
one
of
her
ankles
gleaming
in
the
rays
of
the
lantern
which
she
carried
*punct* .
*break*
we
stood
in
a
low-arched
passage
*punct* .
*break*
tie
your
handkerchiefs
over
your
eyes
and
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
*punct* ,
she
ordered
*punct* .
*break*
neither
of
us
hesitated
to
obey
her
*punct* .
*break*
blind-folded
*punct* ,
i
allowed
her
to
lead
me
*punct* ,
and
smith
rested
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
in
that
order
we
proceeded
*punct* ,
and
came
to
stone
steps
*punct* ,
which
we
ascended
*punct* .
*break*
keep
to
the
wall
on
the
left
*punct* ,
came
a
whisper
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
danger
on
the
right
*punct* .
*break*
with
my
free
hand
i
felt
for
and
found
the
wall
*punct* ,
and
we
pressed
forward
*punct* .
*break*
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
through
which
we
were
passing
was
steamy
*punct* ,
and
loaded
with
an
odor
like
that
of
exotic
plant
life
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
faint
animal
scent
crept
to
my
nostrils
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
and
there
was
a
subdued
stir
about
me
*punct* ,
infinitely
suggestive
*punct* ,
mysterious
*punct* .
*break*
now
my
feet
sank
in
a
soft
carpet
*punct* ,
and
a
curtain
brushed
my
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
a
gong
sounded
*punct* .
*break*
the
din
of
distant
drumming
came
to
my
ears
*punct* .
*break*
where
in
heaven's
name
are
we
*punct* ?
*break*
hissed
smith
in
my
ear
*punct* ;
that
is
a
tom-tom
*punct* !
*break*
the
little
hand
grasping
mine
quivered
nervously
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
near
a
door
or
a
window
*punct* ,
for
a
breath
of
perfume
was
wafted
through
the
air
*punct* ;
and
it
reminded
me
of
my
other
meetings
with
the
beautiful
woman
who
was
now
leading
us
from
the
house
of
fu-manchu
*punct* ;
who
*punct* ,
with
her
own
lips
*punct* ,
had
told
me
that
she
was
his
slave
*punct* .
*break*
through
the
horrible
phantasmagoria
she
flitted
*punct* ,
a
seductive
vision
*punct* ,
her
piquant
loveliness
standing
out
richly
in
its
black
setting
of
murder
and
devilry
*punct* .
*break*
not
once
*punct* ,
but
a
thousand
times
*punct* ,
i
had
tried
to
reason
out
the
nature
of
the
tie
which
bound
her
to
the
sinister
doctor
*punct* .
*break*
down
a
thickly
carpeted
stair
we
went
*punct* .
*break*
our
guide
opened
a
door
*punct* ,
and
led
us
along
a
passage
*punct* .
*break*
another
door
was
opened
*punct* ;
and
we
were
in
the
open
air
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
girl
never
tarried
*punct* ,
pulling
me
along
a
graveled
path
*punct* ,
with
a
fresh
breeze
blowing
in
my
face
*punct* ,
and
along
until
*punct* ,
unmistakably
*punct* ,
i
stood
upon
the
river
bank
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
planking
creaked
to
our
tread
*punct* ;
and
looking
downward
beneath
the
handkerchief
*punct* ,
i
saw
the
gleam
of
water
beneath
my
feet
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
warned
*punct* ,
and
found
myself
stepping
into
a
narrow
boat
*punct* ,
a
punt
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
followed
*punct* ,
and
the
girl
pushed
the
punt
off
and
poled
out
into
the
stream
*punct* .
*break*
my
brain
was
fevered
*punct* ;
i
scarce
knew
if
i
dreamed
and
was
waking
*punct* ,
or
if
the
reality
ended
with
my
imprisonment
in
the
clammy
cellar
and
this
silent
escape
*punct* ,
blindfolded
*punct* ,
upon
the
river
with
a
girl
for
our
guide
who
might
have
stepped
out
of
the
pages
of
the
arabian
nights
were
fantasy
*punct* ,
the
mockery
of
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
i
began
seriously
to
doubt
if
this
stream
whereon
we
floated
*punct* ,
whose
waters
plashed
and
tinkled
about
us
*punct* ,
were
the
thames
*punct* ,
the
tigris
*punct* ,
or
the
styx
*punct* .
*break*
the
punt
touched
a
bank
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
hear
a
clock
strike
in
a
few
minutes
*punct* ,
said
the
girl
*punct* ,
with
her
soft
*punct* ,
charming
accent
*punct* ,
but
i
rely
upon
your
honor
not
to
remove
the
handkerchiefs
until
then
*punct* .
*break*
you
owe
me
this
*punct* .
*break*
said
smith
fervently
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
him
scrambling
to
the
bank
*punct* ,
and
a
moment
later
a
soft
hand
was
placed
in
mine
*punct* ,
and
i
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
was
guided
on
to
terra
firma
*punct* .
*break*
arrived
on
the
bank
*punct* ,
i
still
held
the
girl's
hand
*punct* ,
drawing
her
towards
me
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
not
go
back
*punct* ,
i
whispered
*punct* .
*break*
we
will
take
care
of
you
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
not
return
to
that
place
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
go
*punct* !
*break*
when
*punct* ,
once
*punct* ,
i
asked
you
to
take
me
from
him
*punct* ,
you
spoke
of
police
protection
*punct* ;
that
was
your
answer
*punct* ,
police
protection
*punct* !
*break*
you
would
let
them
lock
me
up
*punct* ,
imprison
me
*punct* ,
and
make
me
betray
him
*punct* !
*break*
she
wrenched
herself
free
*punct* .
*break*
how
little
you
understand
me
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
one
day
you
will
know
*punct* !
*break*
until
the
clock
strikes
*punct* !
*break*
she
was
gone
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
the
creak
of
the
punt
*punct* ,
the
drip
of
the
water
from
the
pole
*punct* .
*break*
fainter
it
grew
*punct* ,
and
fainter
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
her
secret
*punct* ?
*break*
muttered
smith
*punct* ,
beside
me
*punct* .
*break*
why
does
she
cling
to
that
monster
*punct* ?
*break*
the
distant
sound
died
away
entirely
*punct* .
*break*
a
clock
began
to
strike
*punct* ;
it
struck
the
half-hour
*punct* .
*break*
in
an
instant
my
handkerchief
was
off
*punct* ,
and
so
was
smith's
*punct* .
*break*
we
stood
upon
a
towing-path
*punct* .
*break*
away
to
the
left
the
moon
shone
upon
the
towers
and
battlements
of
an
ancient
fortress
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
windsor
castle
*punct* .
*break*
half-past
ten
*punct* ,
cried
smith
*punct* .
*break*
two
hours
to
save
graham
guthrie
*punct* !
*break*
we
had
exactly
fourteen
minutes
in
which
to
catch
the
last
train
to
waterloo
*punct* ;
and
we
caught
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
sank
into
a
corner
of
the
compartment
in
a
state
bordering
upon
collapse
*punct* .
*break*
neither
of
us
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
could
have
managed
another
twenty
yards
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
lesser
stake
than
a
human
life
at
issue
*punct* ,
i
doubt
if
we
should
have
attempted
that
dash
to
windsor
station
*punct* .
*break*
due
at
waterloo
at
eleven-fifty-one
*punct* ,
panted
smith
*punct* .
*break*
that
gives
us
thirty-nine
minutes
to
get
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
and
reach
his
hotel
*punct* .
*break*
where
in
heaven's
name
is
that
house
situated
*punct* ?
*break*
did
we
come
up
or
down
stream
*punct* ?
*break*
i
couldn't
determine
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
it
stands
close
to
the
riverside
*punct* .
*break*
it
should
be
merely
a
question
of
time
to
identify
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
set
scotland
yard
to
work
immediately
*punct* ;
but
i
am
hoping
for
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
our
escape
will
warn
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
said
no
more
for
a
time
*punct* ,
sitting
wiping
the
perspiration
from
my
forehead
and
watching
my
friend
load
his
cracked
briar
with
the
broadcut
latakia
mixture
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
said
at
last
*punct* ,
what
was
that
horrible
wailing
we
heard
*punct* ,
and
what
did
fu-manchu
mean
when
he
referred
to
rangoon
*punct* ?
*break*
i
noticed
how
it
affected
you
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend
nodded
and
lighted
his
pipe
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
ghastly
business
there
in
1908
or
early
in
1909
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* :
an
utterly
mysterious
epidemic
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
beastly
wailing
was
associated
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
in
what
way
*punct* ?
*break*
and
what
do
you
mean
by
an
epidemic
*punct* ?
*break*
it
began
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
at
the
palace
mansions
hotel
*punct* ,
in
the
cantonments
*punct* .
*break*
a
young
american
*punct* ,
whose
name
i
cannot
recall
*punct* ,
was
staying
there
on
business
connected
with
some
new
iron
buildings
*punct* .
*break*
one
night
he
went
to
his
room
*punct* ,
locked
the
door
*punct* ,
and
jumped
out
of
the
window
into
the
courtyard
*punct* .
*break*
broke
his
neck
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
were
singular
features
in
the
case
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
his
revolver
lay
beside
him
*punct* ,
fully
loaded
*punct* !
*break*
in
the
courtyard
*punct* ?
*break*
in
the
courtyard
*punct* !
*break*
was
it
murder
by
any
chance
*punct* ?
*break*
smith
shrugged
his
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
his
door
was
found
locked
from
the
inside
*punct* ;
had
to
be
broken
in
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
wailing
business
*punct* ?
*break*
that
began
later
*punct* ,
or
was
only
noticed
later
*punct* .
*break*
a
french
doctor
*punct* ,
named
lafitte
*punct* ,
died
in
exactly
the
same
way
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
same
place
*punct* ?
*break*
at
the
same
hotel
*punct* ;
but
he
occupied
a
different
room
*punct* .
*break*
here
is
the
extraordinary
part
of
the
affair
*punct* :
a
friend
shared
the
room
with
him
*punct* ,
and
actually
saw
him
go
*punct* !
*break*
saw
him
leap
from
the
window
*punct* ?
*break*
the
friend
*punct* ,
an
englishman
*punct* ,
was
aroused
by
the
uncanny
wailing
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
in
rangoon
at
the
time
*punct* ,
so
that
i
know
more
of
the
case
of
lafitte
than
of
that
of
the
american
*punct* .
*break*
i
spoke
to
the
man
about
it
personally
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
an
electrical
engineer
*punct* ,
edward
martin
*punct* ,
and
he
told
me
that
the
cry
seemed
to
come
from
above
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
to
come
from
above
when
we
heard
it
at
fu-manchu's
house
*punct* .
*break*
martin
sat
up
in
bed
*punct* ,
it
was
a
clear
moonlight
night
*punct* ,
the
sort
of
moonlight
you
get
in
burma
*punct* .
*break*
lafitte
*punct* ,
for
some
reason
*punct* ,
had
just
gone
to
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
his
friend
saw
him
look
out
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
moment
with
a
dreadful
scream
*punct* ,
he
threw
himself
forward
*punct* ,
and
crashed
down
into
the
courtyard
*punct* !
*break*
martin
ran
to
the
window
and
looked
down
*punct* .
*break*
lafitte's
scream
had
aroused
the
place
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
account
for
the
occurrence
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
balcony
*punct* ,
no
ledge
*punct* ,
by
means
of
which
anyone
could
reach
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
did
you
come
to
recognize
the
cry
*punct* ?
*break*
i
stopped
at
the
palace
mansions
for
some
time
*punct* ;
and
one
night
this
uncanny
howling
aroused
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
it
quite
distinctly
*punct* ,
and
am
never
likely
to
forget
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
followed
by
a
hoarse
yell
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
in
the
next
room
*punct* ,
an
orchid
hunter
*punct* ,
had
gone
the
same
way
as
the
others
*punct* !
*break*
did
you
change
your
quarters
*punct* ?
*break*
fortunately
for
the
reputation
of
the
hotel
*punct* ,
a
first-class
establishment
*punct* ,
several
similar
cases
occurred
elsewhere
*punct* ,
both
in
rangoon
*punct* ,
in
prome
and
in
moulmein
*punct* .
*break*
a
story
got
about
the
native
quarter
*punct* ,
and
was
fostered
by
some
mad
fakir
*punct* ,
that
the
god
siva
was
reborn
and
that
the
cry
was
his
call
for
victims
*punct* ;
a
ghastly
story
*punct* ,
which
led
to
an
outbreak
of
dacoity
and
gave
the
district
superintendent
no
end
of
trouble
*punct* .
*break*
was
there
anything
unusual
about
the
bodies
*punct* ?
*break*
they
all
developed
marks
after
death
*punct* ,
as
though
they
had
been
strangled
*punct* !
*break*
the
marks
were
said
all
to
possess
a
peculiar
form
*punct* ,
though
it
was
not
appreciable
to
my
eye
*punct* ;
and
this
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
was
declared
to
be
the
five
heads
of
siva
*punct* .
*break*
were
the
deaths
confined
to
europeans
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
no
*punct* .
*break*
several
burmans
and
others
died
in
the
same
way
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
there
was
a
theory
that
the
victims
had
contracted
leprosy
and
committed
suicide
as
a
result
*punct* ;
but
the
medical
evidence
disproved
that
*punct* .
*break*
the
call
of
siva
became
a
perfect
nightmare
throughout
burma
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
ever
hear
it
again
*punct* ,
before
this
evening
*punct* ?
*break*
i
beard
it
on
the
upper
irrawaddy
one
clear
*punct* ,
moonlight
night
*punct* ,
and
a
colassie
*punct* ,
a
deck-hand
*punct* ,
leaped
from
the
top
deck
of
the
steamer
aboard
which
i
was
traveling
*punct* !
*break*
but
brought
what
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
i
cried
*punct* ,
in
perplexity
*punct* .
*break*
what
has
he
brought
*punct* ?
*break*
an
evil
spirit
*punct* ?
*break*
a
mental
disease
*punct* ?
*break*
what
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
what
can
it
be
*punct* ?
*break*
a
new
agent
of
death
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
something
born
in
a
plague-spot
of
burma
*punct* ,
the
home
of
much
that
is
unclean
and
much
that
is
inexplicable
*punct* .
*break*
heaven
grant
that
we
be
in
time
*punct* ,
and
are
able
to
save
guthrie
*punct* .
*break*
the
train
was
late
*punct* ,
and
as
our
cab
turned
out
of
waterloo
station
and
began
to
ascend
to
the
bridge
*punct* ,
from
a
hundred
steeples
rang
out
the
gongs
of
midnight
*punct* ,
the
bell
of
st
*punct* .
*break*
paul's
raised
above
them
all
to
vie
with
the
deep
voice
of
big
ben
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
out
from
the
cab
window
across
the
river
to
where
*punct* ,
towering
above
the
embankment
*punct* ,
that
place
of
a
thousand
tragedies
*punct* ,
the
light
of
some
of
london's
greatest
caravanserais
formed
a
sort
of
minor
constellation
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
subdued
blaze
that
showed
the
public
supper-rooms
i
looked
up
to
the
hundreds
of
starry
points
marking
the
private
apartments
of
those
giant
inns
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
how
each
twinkling
window
denoted
the
presence
of
some
bird
of
passage
*punct* ,
some
wanderer
temporarily
abiding
in
our
midst
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
floor
piled
upon
floor
above
the
chattering
throngs
*punct* ,
were
these
less
gregarious
units
*punct* ,
each
something
of
a
mystery
to
his
fellow-guests
*punct* ,
each
in
his
separate
cell
*punct* ;
and
each
as
remote
from
real
human
companionship
as
if
that
cell
were
fashioned
*punct* ,
not
in
the
bricks
of
london
*punct* ,
but
in
the
rocks
of
hindustan
*punct* !
*break*
in
one
of
those
rooms
graham
guthrie
might
at
that
moment
be
sleeping
*punct* ,
all
unaware
that
he
would
awake
to
the
call
of
siva
*punct* ,
to
the
summons
of
death
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
neared
the
strand
*punct* ,
smith
stopped
the
cab
*punct* ,
discharging
the
man
outside
sotheby's
auction-rooms
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
the
doctor's
watch-dogs
may
be
in
the
foyer
*punct* ,
he
said
thoughtfully
*punct* ,
and
it
might
spoil
everything
if
we
were
seen
to
go
to
guthrie's
rooms
*punct* .
*break*
there
must
be
a
back
entrance
to
the
kitchens
*punct* ,
and
so
on
*punct* ?
*break*
there
is
*punct* ,
i
replied
quickly
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
seen
the
vans
delivering
there
*punct* .
*break*
but
have
we
time
*punct* ?
*break*
we
walked
up
the
strand
and
hurried
westward
*punct* .
*break*
into
that
narrow
court
*punct* ,
with
its
iron
posts
and
descending
steps
*punct* ,
upon
which
opens
a
well-known
wine-cellar
*punct* ,
we
turned
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
going
parallel
with
the
strand
*punct* ,
but
on
the
embankment
level
*punct* ,
we
ran
round
the
back
of
the
great
hotel
*punct* ,
and
came
to
double
doors
which
were
open
*punct* .
*break*
an
arc
lamp
illuminated
the
interior
and
a
number
of
men
were
at
work
among
the
casks
*punct* ,
crates
and
packages
stacked
about
the
place
*punct* .
*break*
cried
a
man
in
a
white
overall
*punct* ,
where
d'you
think
you're
going
*punct* ?
*break*
smith
grasped
him
by
the
arm
*punct* .
*break*
i
want
to
get
to
the
public
part
of
the
hotel
without
being
seen
from
the
entrance
hall
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
please
lead
the
way
*punct* ?
*break*
here
*punct* ,
began
the
other
*punct* ,
staring
*punct* .
*break*
don't
waste
time
*punct* !
*break*
snapped
my
friend
*punct* ,
in
that
tone
of
authority
which
he
knew
so
well
how
to
assume
*punct* .
*break*
it's
a
matter
of
life
and
death
*punct* .
*break*
lead
the
way
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* !
*break*
police
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
asked
the
man
civilly
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* ;
hurry
*punct* !
*break*
off
went
our
guide
without
further
demur
*punct* .
*break*
skirting
sculleries
*punct* ,
kitchens
*punct* ,
laundries
and
engine-rooms
*punct* ,
he
led
us
through
those
mysterious
labyrinths
which
have
no
existence
for
the
guest
above
*punct* ,
but
which
contain
the
machinery
that
renders
these
modern
khans
the
aladdin's
palaces
they
are
*punct* .
*break*
on
a
second-floor
landing
we
met
a
man
in
a
tweed
suit
*punct* ,
to
whom
our
cicerone
presented
us
*punct* .
*break*
glad
i
met
you
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
two
gentlemen
from
the
police
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
regarded
us
haughtily
with
a
suspicious
smile
*punct* .
*break*
who
are
you
*punct* ?
*break*
you're
not
from
scotland
yard
*punct* ,
at
any
rate
*punct* !
*break*
smith
pulled
out
a
card
and
thrust
it
into
the
speaker's
hand
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
are
the
hotel
detective
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
take
us
without
delay
to
mr.
graham
guthrie
*punct* .
*break*
a
marked
change
took
place
in
the
other's
demeanor
on
glancing
at
the
card
in
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
excuse
me
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
he
said
deferentially
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
i
didn't
know
who
i
was
speaking
to
*punct* .
*break*
we
all
have
instructions
to
give
you
every
assistance
*punct* .
*break*
is
mr.
guthrie
in
his
room
*punct* ?
*break*
he's
been
in
his
room
for
some
time
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
want
to
get
there
without
being
seen
*punct* ?
*break*
we
can
join
the
lift
on
the
third
floor
*punct* .
*break*
off
we
went
again
*punct* ,
with
our
new
guide
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
lift
*punct* :
have
you
noticed
anything
suspicious
about
the
place
to-night
*punct* ?
*break*
was
the
startling
reply
*punct* .
*break*
that
accounts
for
your
finding
me
where
you
did
*punct* .
*break*
my
usual
post
is
in
the
lobby
*punct* .
*break*
but
about
eleven
o'clock
*punct* ,
when
the
theater
people
began
to
come
in
i
had
a
hazy
sort
of
impression
that
someone
or
something
slipped
past
in
the
crowd
*punct* ,
something
that
had
no
business
in
the
hotel
*punct* .
*break*
we
got
out
of
the
lift
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
quite
follow
you
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
thought
you
saw
something
entering
*punct* ,
you
must
have
formed
a
more
or
less
definite
impression
regarding
it
*punct* .
*break*
that's
the
funny
part
of
the
business
*punct* ,
answered
the
man
doggedly
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
i
stood
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
could
have
sworn
that
there
was
something
crawling
up
behind
a
party
*punct* ,
two
ladies
and
two
gentlemen
*punct* .
*break*
a
dog
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ?
*break*
it
didn't
strike
me
as
being
a
dog
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
anyway
*punct* ,
when
the
party
passed
me
*punct* ,
there
was
nothing
there
*punct* .
*break*
mind
you
*punct* ,
whatever
it
was
*punct* ,
it
hadn't
come
in
by
the
front
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
made
inquiries
everywhere
*punct* ,
but
without
result
*punct* .
*break*
he
stopped
abruptly
*punct* .
*break*
189
*punct* ,
mr.
guthrie's
door
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
came
a
muffled
voice
*punct* ;
what
do
you
want
*punct* ?
*break*
open
the
door
*punct* !
*break*
don't
delay
*punct* ;
it
is
important
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
to
the
hotel
detective
*punct* .
*break*
stay
right
there
where
you
can
watch
the
stairs
and
the
lift
*punct* ,
he
instructed
*punct* ;
and
note
everyone
and
everything
that
passes
this
door
*punct* .
*break*
but
whatever
you
see
or
hear
*punct* ,
do
nothing
without
my
orders
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
moved
off
*punct* ,
and
the
door
was
opened
*punct* .
*break*
smith
whispered
in
my
ear
*punct* :
some
creature
of
dr.
fu-manchu
is
in
the
hotel
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
graham
guthrie
*punct* ,
british
resident
in
north
bhutan
*punct* ,
was
a
big
*punct* ,
thick-set
man
*punct* ,
gray-haired
and
florid
*punct* ,
with
widely
opened
eyes
of
the
true
fighting
blue
*punct* ,
a
bristling
mustache
and
prominent
shaggy
brows
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
introduced
himself
tersely
*punct* ,
proffering
his
card
and
an
open
letter
*punct* .
*break*
those
are
my
credentials
*punct* ,
mr.
guthrie
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ;
so
no
doubt
you
will
realize
that
the
business
which
brings
me
and
my
friend
*punct* ,
dr.
petrie
*punct* ,
here
at
such
an
hour
is
of
the
first
importance
*punct* .
*break*
he
switched
off
the
light
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
time
for
ceremony
*punct* ,
he
explained
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
now
twenty-five
minutes
past
twelve
*punct* .
*break*
at
half-past
an
attempt
will
be
made
upon
your
life
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
said
the
other
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
arrayed
in
his
pajamas
*punct* ,
was
seated
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
*punct* ,
you
alarm
me
very
greatly
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
mention
that
i
was
advised
of
your
presence
in
england
this
morning
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
know
anything
respecting
the
person
called
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ?
*break*
only
what
i
was
told
to-day
*punct* ,
that
he
is
the
agent
of
an
advanced
political
group
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
opposed
to
his
interests
that
you
should
return
to
bhutan
*punct* .
*break*
a
more
gullible
agent
would
be
preferable
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
*punct* ,
unless
you
implicitly
obey
my
instructions
*punct* ,
you
will
never
leave
england
*punct* !
*break*
graham
guthrie
breathed
quickly
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
growing
more
used
to
the
gloom
*punct* ,
and
i
could
dimly
discern
him
*punct* ,
his
face
turned
towards
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
whilst
with
his
hand
he
clutched
the
bed-rail
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
visit
as
ours
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
must
have
shaken
the
nerve
of
any
man
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
surely
i
am
safe
enough
here
*punct* !
*break*
the
place
is
full
of
american
visitors
at
present
*punct* ,
and
i
have
had
to
be
content
with
a
room
right
at
the
top
*punct* ;
so
that
the
only
danger
i
apprehend
is
that
of
fire
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
another
danger
*punct* ,
replied
smith
*punct* .
*break*
the
fact
that
you
are
at
the
top
of
the
building
enhances
that
danger
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
recall
anything
of
the
mysterious
epidemic
which
broke
out
in
rangoon
in
1908
*punct* ,
the
deaths
due
to
the
call
of
siva
*punct* ?
*break*
i
read
of
it
in
the
indian
papers
*punct* ,
said
guthrie
uneasily
*punct* .
*break*
suicides
*punct* ,
were
they
not
*punct* ?
*break*
there
was
a
brief
silence
*punct* .
*break*
from
what
i
recall
of
the
cases
*punct* ,
said
guthrie
*punct* ,
that
seems
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
in
several
instances
the
victims
threw
themselves
from
the
windows
of
locked
rooms
*punct* ,
and
the
windows
were
quite
inaccessible
*punct* .
*break*
exactly
*punct* ,
replied
smith
*punct* ;
and
in
the
dim
light
his
revolver
gleamed
dully
*punct* ,
as
he
placed
it
on
the
small
table
beside
the
bed
*punct* .
*break*
except
that
your
door
is
unlocked
*punct* ,
the
conditions
to-night
are
identical
*punct* .
*break*
silence
*punct* ,
please
*punct* ,
i
hear
a
clock
striking
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
big
ben
*punct* .
*break*
it
struck
the
half-hour
*punct* ,
leaving
the
stillness
complete
*punct* .
*break*
in
that
room
*punct* ,
high
above
the
activity
which
yet
prevailed
below
*punct* ,
high
above
the
supping
crowds
in
the
hotel
*punct* ,
high
above
the
starving
crowds
on
the
embankment
*punct* ,
a
curious
chill
of
isolation
swept
about
me
*punct* .
*break*
again
i
realized
how
*punct* ,
in
the
very
heart
of
the
great
metropolis
*punct* ,
a
man
may
be
as
far
from
aid
as
in
the
heart
of
a
desert
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
glad
that
i
was
not
alone
in
that
room
*punct* ,
marked
with
the
death-mark
of
fu-manchu
*punct* ;
and
i
am
certain
that
graham
guthrie
welcomed
his
unexpected
company
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
have
mentioned
the
fact
before
*punct* ,
but
on
this
occasion
it
became
so
peculiarly
evident
to
me
that
i
am
constrained
to
record
it
here
*punct* ,
i
refer
to
the
sense
of
impending
danger
which
invariably
preceded
a
*punct* ,
visit
from
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
even
had
i
not
known
that
an
attempt
was
to
be
made
that
night
*punct* ,
i
should
have
realized
it
*punct* ,
as
*punct* ,
strung
to
high
tension
*punct* ,
i
waited
in
the
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
some
invisible
herald
went
ahead
of
the
dreadful
chinaman
*punct* ,
proclaiming
his
coming
to
every
nerve
in
one's
body
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
like
a
breath
of
astral
incense
*punct* ,
announcing
the
presence
of
the
priests
of
death
*punct* .
*break*
a
wail
*punct* ,
low
but
singularly
penetrating
*punct* ,
falling
in
minor
cadences
to
a
new
silence
*punct* ,
came
from
somewhere
close
at
hand
*punct* .
*break*
hissed
guthrie
*punct* ,
what
was
that
*punct* ?
*break*
the
call
of
siva
*punct* ,
whispered
smith
*punct* .
*break*
don't
stir
*punct* ,
for
your
life
*punct* !
*break*
guthrie
was
breathing
hard
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
that
we
were
three
*punct* ;
that
the
hotel
detective
was
within
hail
*punct* ;
that
there
was
a
telephone
in
the
room
*punct* ;
that
the
traffic
of
the
embankment
moved
almost
beneath
us
*punct* ;
but
i
knew
*punct* ,
and
am
not
ashamed
to
confess
*punct* ,
that
king
fear
had
icy
fingers
about
my
heart
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
awful
*punct* ,
that
tense
waiting
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
what
*punct* ?
*break*
three
taps
sounded
*punct* ,
very
distinctly
upon
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
graham
guthrie
started
so
as
to
shake
the
bed
*punct* .
*break*
he
muttered
*punct* ,
all
that
was
celtic
in
his
blood
recoiling
from
the
omen
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
human
can
reach
that
window
*punct* !
*break*
the
tapping
was
repeated
*punct* .
*break*
smith
softly
crossed
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
my
heart
was
beating
painfully
*punct* .
*break*
he
threw
open
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
further
inaction
was
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
i
joined
him
*punct* ;
and
we
looked
out
into
the
empty
air
*punct* .
*break*
don't
come
too
near
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
he
warned
over
his
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
one
on
either
side
of
the
open
window
*punct* ,
we
stood
and
looked
down
at
the
moving
embankment
lights
*punct* ,
at
the
glitter
of
the
thames
*punct* ,
at
the
silhouetted
buildings
on
the
farther
bank
*punct* ,
with
the
shot
tower
starting
above
them
all
*punct* .
*break*
three
taps
sounded
on
the
panes
above
us
*punct* .
*break*
in
all
my
dealings
with
dr.
fu-manchu
i
had
had
to
face
nothing
so
uncanny
as
this
*punct* .
*break*
what
burmese
ghoul
had
he
loosed
*punct* ?
*break*
was
it
outside
*punct* ,
in
the
air
*punct* ?
*break*
was
it
actually
in
the
room
*punct* ?
*break*
don't
let
me
go
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
whispered
smith
suddenly
*punct* .
*break*
get
a
tight
hold
on
me
*punct* !
*break*
that
was
the
last
straw
*punct* ;
for
i
thought
that
some
dreadful
fascination
was
impelling
my
friend
to
hurl
himself
out
*punct* !
*break*
wildly
i
threw
my
arms
about
him
*punct* ,
and
guthrie
leaped
forward
to
help
*punct* .
*break*
smith
leaned
from
the
window
and
looked
up
*punct* .
*break*
one
choking
cry
he
gave
*punct* ,
smothered
*punct* ,
inarticulate
*punct* ,
and
i
found
him
slipping
from
my
grip
*punct* ,
being
drawn
out
of
the
window
*punct* ,
drawn
to
his
death
*punct* !
*break*
hold
him
*punct* ,
guthrie
*punct* !
*break*
i
gasped
hoarsely
*punct* .
*break*
my
god
*punct* ,
he's
going
*punct* !
*break*
my
friend
writhed
in
our
grasp
*punct* ,
and
i
saw
him
stretch
his
arm
upward
*punct* .
*break*
the
crack
of
his
revolver
came
*punct* ,
and
he
collapsed
on
to
the
floor
*punct* ,
carrying
me
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
i
fell
i
heard
a
scream
above
*punct* .
*break*
smith's
revolver
went
hurtling
through
the
air
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
hard
upon
it
*punct* ,
went
a
black
shape
*punct* ,
flashing
past
the
open
window
into
the
gulf
of
the
night
*punct* .
*break*
guthrie
ran
and
turned
on
the
light
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
his
eyes
starting
from
his
head
*punct* ,
his
face
swollen
*punct* ,
lay
plucking
at
a
silken
cord
which
showed
tight
about
his
throat
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
thug
*punct* !
*break*
get
the
rope
off
*punct* !
*break*
my
hands
a-twitch
*punct* ,
i
seized
the
strangling-cord
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
lost
mine
*punct* !
*break*
guthrie
ran
to
the
dressing-table
and
passed
me
an
open
penknife
*punct* .
*break*
i
somehow
forced
the
blade
between
the
rope
and
smith's
swollen
neck
*punct* ,
and
severed
the
deadly
silken
thing
*punct* .
*break*
smith
made
a
choking
noise
*punct* ,
and
fell
back
*punct* ,
swooning
in
my
arms
*punct* .
*break*
when
*punct* ,
later
*punct* ,
we
stood
looking
down
upon
the
mutilated
thing
which
had
been
brought
in
from
where
it
fell
*punct* ,
smith
showed
me
a
mark
on
the
brow
*punct* ,
close
beside
the
wound
where
his
bullet
had
entered
*punct* .
*break*
the
mark
of
kali
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
was
a
phansigar
*punct* ,
a
religious
strangler
*punct* .
*break*
since
fu-manchu
has
dacoits
in
his
service
i
might
have
expected
that
he
would
have
thugs
*punct* .
*break*
a
group
of
these
fiends
would
seem
to
have
fled
into
burma
*punct* ;
so
that
the
mysterious
epidemic
in
rangoon
was
really
an
outbreak
of
thuggee
*punct* ,
on
slightly
improved
lines
*punct* !
*break*
i
had
suspected
something
of
the
kind
but
*punct* ,
naturally
*punct* ,
i
had
not
looked
for
thugs
near
rangoon
*punct* .
*break*
my
unexpected
resistance
led
the
strangler
to
bungle
the
rope
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
seen
how
it
was
fastened
about
my
throat
*punct* ?
*break*
that
was
unscientific
*punct* .
*break*
the
true
method
*punct* ,
as
practiced
by
the
group
operating
in
burma
*punct* ,
was
to
throw
the
line
about
the
victim's
neck
and
jerk
him
from
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
a
man
leaning
from
an
open
window
is
very
nicely
poised
*punct* :
it
requires
only
a
slight
jerk
to
pitch
him
forward
*punct* .
*break*
no
loop
was
used
*punct* ,
but
a
running
line
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
as
the
victim
fell
*punct* ,
remained
in
the
hand
of
the
murderer
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
we
see
at
once
what
commended
the
system
to
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
graham
guthrie
*punct* ,
very
pale
*punct* ,
stood
looking
down
at
the
dead
strangler
*punct* .
*break*
i
owe
you
my
life
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
had
come
five
minutes
later
*punct* ,
he
grasped
smith's
hand
*punct* .
*break*
you
see
*punct* ,
guthrie
continued
*punct* ,
no
one
thought
of
looking
for
a
thug
in
burma
*punct* !
*break*
and
no
one
thought
of
the
roof
*punct* !
*break*
these
fellows
are
as
active
as
monkeys
*punct* ,
and
where
an
ordinary
man
would
infallibly
break
his
neck
*punct* ,
they
are
entirely
at
home
*punct* .
*break*
i
might
have
chosen
my
room
especially
for
the
business
*punct* !
*break*
he
slipped
in
late
this
evening
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* .
*break*
the
hotel
detective
saw
him
*punct* ,
but
these
stranglers
are
as
elusive
as
shadows
*punct* ,
otherwise
*punct* ,
despite
their
having
changed
the
scene
of
their
operations
*punct* ,
not
one
could
have
survived
*punct* .
*break*
didn't
you
mention
a
case
of
this
kind
on
the
irrawaddy
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
was
the
reply
*punct* ;
and
i
know
of
what
you
are
thinking
*punct* .
*break*
the
steamers
of
the
irrawaddy
flotilla
have
a
corrugated-iron
roof
over
the
top
deck
*punct* .
*break*
the
thug
must
have
been
lying
up
there
as
the
colassie
passed
on
the
deck
below
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ,
what
is
the
motive
of
the
call
*punct* ?
*break*
partly
religious
*punct* ,
he
explained
*punct* ,
and
partly
to
wake
the
victims
*punct* !
*break*
you
are
perhaps
going
to
ask
me
how
dr.
fu-manchu
has
obtained
power
over
such
people
as
phansigars
*punct* ?
*break*
i
can
only
reply
that
dr.
fu-manchu
has
secret
knowledge
of
which
*punct* ,
so
far
*punct* ,
we
know
absolutely
nothing
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
despite
all
*punct* ,
at
last
i
begin
to
score
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
*punct* ,
i
agreed
*punct* ;
but
your
victory
took
you
near
to
death
*punct* .
*break*
i
owe
my
life
to
you
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
once
to
your
strength
of
arm
*punct* ,
and
once
to
*punct* ,
don't
speak
of
her
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ,
i
interrupted
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
fu-manchu
may
have
discovered
the
part
she
played
*punct* !
*break*
in
which
event
*punct* ,
god
help
her
*punct* !
*break*
upon
the
following
day
we
were
afoot
again
*punct* ,
and
shortly
at
handgrips
with
the
enemy
*punct* .
*break*
in
retrospect
*punct* ,
that
restless
time
offers
a
chaotic
prospect
*punct* ,
with
no
peaceful
spot
amid
its
turmoils
*punct* .
*break*
all
that
was
reposeful
in
nature
seemed
to
have
become
an
irony
and
a
mockery
to
us
*punct* ,
who
knew
how
an
evil
demigod
had
his
sacrificial
altars
amid
our
sweetest
groves
*punct* .
*break*
this
idea
ruled
strongly
in
my
mind
upon
that
soft
autumnal
day
*punct* .
*break*
the
net
is
closing
in
*punct* ,
said
nayland
smith
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
hope
upon
a
big
catch
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* ,
with
a
laugh
*punct* .
*break*
beyond
where
the
thames
tided
slumberously
seaward
showed
the
roofs
of
royal
windsor
*punct* ,
the
castle
towers
showing
through
the
autumn
haze
*punct* .
*break*
the
peace
of
beautiful
thames-side
was
about
us
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
one
of
the
few
tangible
clews
upon
which
thus
far
we
had
chanced
*punct* ;
but
at
last
it
seemed
indeed
that
we
were
narrowing
the
resources
of
that
enemy
of
the
white
race
who
was
writing
his
name
over
england
in
characters
of
blood
*punct* .
*break*
to
capture
dr.
fu-manchu
we
did
not
hope
*punct* ;
but
at
least
there
was
every
promise
of
destroying
one
of
the
enemy's
strongholds
*punct* .
*break*
we
had
circled
upon
the
map
a
tract
of
country
cut
by
the
thames
*punct* ,
with
windsor
for
its
center
*punct* .
*break*
within
that
circle
was
the
house
from
which
miraculously
we
had
escaped
*punct* ,
a
house
used
by
the
most
highly
organized
group
in
the
history
of
criminology
*punct* .
*break*
so
much
we
knew
*punct* .
*break*
even
if
we
found
the
house
*punct* ,
and
this
was
likely
enough
*punct* ,
to
find
it
vacated
by
fu-manchu
and
his
mysterious
servants
we
were
prepared
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
would
be
a
base
destroyed
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
working
upon
a
methodical
plan
*punct* ,
and
although
our
cooperators
were
invisible
*punct* ,
these
numbered
no
fewer
than
twelve
*punct* ,
all
of
them
experienced
men
*punct* .
*break*
thus
far
we
had
drawn
blank
*punct* ,
but
the
place
for
which
smith
and
i
were
making
now
came
clearly
into
view
*punct* :
an
old
mansion
situated
in
extensive
walled
grounds
*punct* .
*break*
leaving
the
river
behind
us
*punct* ,
we
turned
sharply
to
the
right
along
a
lane
flanked
by
a
high
wall
*punct* .
*break*
on
an
open
patch
of
ground
*punct* ,
as
we
passed
*punct* ,
i
noted
a
gypsy
caravan
*punct* .
*break*
an
old
woman
was
seated
on
the
steps
*punct* ,
her
wrinkled
face
bent
*punct* ,
her
chin
resting
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
*punct* .
*break*
i
scarcely
glanced
at
her
*punct* ,
but
pressed
on
*punct* ,
nor
did
i
notice
that
my
friend
no
longer
was
beside
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
all
anxiety
to
come
to
some
point
from
whence
i
might
obtain
a
view
of
the
house
*punct* ;
all
anxiety
to
know
if
this
was
the
abode
of
our
mysterious
enemy
*punct* ,
the
place
where
he
worked
amid
his
weird
company
*punct* ,
where
he
bred
his
deadly
scorpions
and
his
bacilli
*punct* ,
reared
his
poisonous
fungi
*punct* ,
from
whence
he
dispatched
his
murder
ministers
*punct* .
*break*
above
all
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
i
wondered
if
this
would
prove
to
be
the
hiding-place
of
the
beautiful
slave
girl
who
was
such
a
potent
factor
in
the
doctor's
plans
*punct* ,
but
a
two-edged
sword
which
yet
we
hoped
to
turn
upon
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
even
in
the
hands
of
a
master
*punct* ,
a
woman's
beauty
is
a
dangerous
weapon
*punct* .
*break*
a
cry
rang
out
behind
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
turned
quickly
*punct* .
*break*
and
a
singular
sight
met
my
gaze
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
was
engaged
in
a
furious
struggle
with
the
old
gypsy
woman
*punct* !
*break*
his
long
arms
clasped
about
her
*punct* ,
he
was
roughly
dragging
her
out
into
the
roadway
*punct* ,
she
fighting
like
a
wild
thing
*punct* ,
silently
*punct* ,
fiercely
*punct* .
*break*
smith
often
surprised
me
*punct* ,
but
at
that
sight
*punct* ,
frankly
*punct* ,
i
thought
that
he
was
become
bereft
of
reason
*punct* .
*break*
i
ran
back
*punct* ;
and
i
had
almost
reached
the
scene
of
this
incredible
contest
*punct* ,
and
smith
now
was
evidently
hard
put
to
it
to
hold
his
own
when
a
man
*punct* ,
swarthy
*punct* ,
with
big
rings
in
his
ears
*punct* ,
leaped
from
the
caravan
*punct* .
*break*
one
quick
glance
he
threw
in
our
direction
*punct* ,
and
made
off
towards
the
river
*punct* .
*break*
smith
twisted
round
upon
me
*punct* ,
never
releasing
his
hold
of
the
woman
*punct* .
*break*
after
him
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
don't
let
him
escape
*punct* .
*break*
it's
a
dacoit
*punct* !
*break*
my
brain
in
a
confused
whirl
*punct* ;
my
mind
yet
disposed
to
a
belief
that
my
friend
had
lost
his
senses
*punct* ,
the
word
dacoit
was
sufficient
*punct* .
*break*
i
started
down
the
road
after
the
fleetly
running
man
*punct* .
*break*
never
once
did
he
glance
behind
him
*punct* ,
so
that
he
evidently
had
occasion
to
fear
pursuit
*punct* .
*break*
the
dusty
road
rang
beneath
my
flying
footsteps
*punct* .
*break*
that
sense
of
fantasy
*punct* ,
which
claimed
me
often
enough
in
those
days
of
our
struggle
with
the
titantic
genius
whose
victory
meant
the
victory
of
the
yellow
races
over
the
white
*punct* ,
now
had
me
fast
in
its
grip
again
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
an
actor
in
one
of
those
dream-scenes
of
the
grim
fu-manchu
drama
*punct* .
*break*
out
over
the
grass
and
down
to
the
river's
brink
ran
the
gypsy
who
was
no
gypsy
*punct* ,
but
one
of
that
far
more
sinister
brotherhood
*punct* ,
the
dacoits
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
close
upon
his
heels
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
him
to
leap
in
among
the
rushes
at
the
margin
of
the
stream
*punct* ;
and
seeing
him
do
this
i
pulled
up
quickly
*punct* .
*break*
straight
into
the
water
he
plunged
*punct* ;
and
i
saw
that
he
held
some
object
in
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
he
waded
out
*punct* ;
he
dived
*punct* ;
and
as
i
gained
the
bank
and
looked
to
right
and
left
he
had
vanished
completely
*punct* .
*break*
only
ever
*punct* ,
widening
rings
showed
where
he
had
been
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
him
*punct* .
*break*
for
directly
he
rose
to
the
surface
he
would
be
visible
from
either
bank
*punct* ,
and
with
the
police
whistle
which
i
carried
i
could
*punct* ,
if
necessary
*punct* ,
summon
one
of
the
men
in
hiding
across
the
stream
*punct* .
*break*
a
wild-fowl
floated
serenely
past
*punct* ,
untroubled
by
this
strange
invasion
of
his
precincts
*punct* .
*break*
a
full
minute
i
waited
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
lane
behind
me
came
smith's
voice
*punct* :
don't
let
him
escape
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
never
lifting
my
eyes
from
the
water
*punct* ,
i
waved
my
hand
reassuringly
*punct* .
*break*
but
still
the
dacoit
did
not
rise
*punct* .
*break*
i
searched
the
surface
in
all
directions
as
far
as
my
eyes
could
reach
*punct* ;
but
no
swimmer
showed
above
it
*punct* .
*break*
then
it
was
that
i
concluded
he
had
dived
too
deeply
*punct* ,
become
entangled
in
the
weeds
and
was
drowned
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
final
glance
to
right
and
left
and
some
feeling
of
awe
at
this
sudden
tragedy
*punct* ,
this
grim
going
out
of
a
life
at
glorious
noonday
*punct* ,
i
turned
away
*punct* .
*break*
smith
had
the
woman
securely
*punct* ;
but
i
had
not
taken
five
steps
towards
him
when
a
faint
splash
behind
warned
me
*punct* .
*break*
instinctively
i
ducked
*punct* .
*break*
from
whence
that
saving
instinct
arose
i
cannot
surmise
*punct* ,
but
to
it
i
owed
my
life
*punct* .
*break*
for
as
i
rapidly
lowered
my
head
*punct* ,
something
hummed
past
me
*punct* ,
something
that
flew
out
over
the
grass
bank
*punct* ,
and
fell
with
a
jangle
upon
the
dusty
roadside
*punct* .
*break*
i
turned
and
bounded
back
to
the
river's
brink
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
a
faint
cry
behind
me
*punct* ,
which
could
only
have
come
from
the
gypsy
woman
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
disturbed
the
calm
surface
of
the
water
*punct* .
*break*
the
reach
was
lonely
of
rowers
*punct* .
*break*
out
by
the
farther
bank
a
girl
was
poling
a
punt
along
*punct* ,
and
her
white-clad
figure
was
the
only
living
thing
that
moved
upon
the
river
within
the
range
of
the
most
expert
knife-thrower
*punct* .
*break*
to
say
that
i
was
nonplused
is
to
say
less
than
the
truth
*punct* ;
i
was
amazed
*punct* .
*break*
that
it
was
the
dacoit
who
had
shown
me
this
murderous
attention
i
could
not
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
but
where
in
heaven's
name
was
he
*punct* ?
*break*
he
could
not
humanly
have
remained
below
water
for
so
long
*punct* ;
yet
he
certainly
was
not
above
*punct* ,
was
not
upon
the
surface
*punct* ,
concealed
amongst
the
reeds
*punct* ,
nor
hidden
upon
the
bank
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
in
the
bright
sunshine
*punct* ,
a
consciousness
of
the
eerie
possessed
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
with
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
my
phantom
foe
might
be
aiming
a
second
knife
at
my
back
that
i
turned
away
and
hastened
towards
smith
*punct* .
*break*
my
fearful
expectations
were
not
realized
*punct* ,
and
i
picked
up
the
little
weapon
which
had
so
narrowly
missed
me
*punct* ,
and
with
it
in
my
hand
rejoined
my
friend
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
standing
with
one
arm
closely
clasped
about
the
apparently
exhausted
woman
*punct* ,
and
her
dark
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
with
an
extraordinary
expression
*punct* .
*break*
what
does
it
mean
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
but
he
interrupted
me
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
the
dacoit
*punct* ?
*break*
he
demanded
rapidly
*punct* .
*break*
since
he
seemingly
possesses
the
attributes
of
a
fish
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* ,
i
cannot
pretend
to
say
*punct* .
*break*
the
gypsy
woman
lifted
her
eyes
to
mine
and
laughed
*punct* .
*break*
her
laughter
was
musical
*punct* ,
not
that
of
such
an
old
hag
as
smith
held
captive
*punct* ;
it
was
familiar
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
i
started
and
looked
closely
into
the
wizened
face
*punct* .
*break*
he's
tricked
you
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* ,
an
angry
note
in
his
voice
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
that
you
have
in
your
hand
*punct* ?
*break*
i
showed
him
the
knife
*punct* ,
and
told
him
how
it
had
come
into
my
possession
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
*punct* ,
he
rapped
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
in
the
water
not
three
yards
from
where
you
stood
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
have
seen
him
*punct* .
*break*
was
there
nothing
visible
*punct* ?
*break*
the
woman
laughed
again
*punct* ,
and
again
i
wondered
*punct* .
*break*
a
wild-fowl
*punct* ,
i
added
*punct* ;
nothing
else
*punct* .
*break*
a
wild-fowl
*punct* ,
snapped
smith
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
will
consult
your
recollections
of
the
habits
of
wild-fowl
you
will
see
that
this
particular
specimen
was
a
rara
avis
*punct* .
*break*
it's
an
old
trick
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
but
a
good
one
*punct* ,
for
it
is
used
in
decoying
*punct* .
*break*
a
dacoit's
head
was
concealed
in
that
wild-fowl
*punct* !
*break*
he
has
certainly
made
good
his
escape
by
now
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
somewhat
crestfallen
*punct* ,
why
are
you
detaining
this
gypsy
woman
*punct* ?
*break*
he
laughed
*punct* ,
hugging
her
tightly
as
she
made
an
impatient
movement
*punct* .
*break*
use
your
eyes
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* .
*break*
he
jerked
the
frowsy
wig
from
her
head
*punct* ,
and
beneath
was
a
cloud
of
disordered
hair
that
shimmered
in
the
sunlight
*punct* .
*break*
a
wet
sponge
will
do
the
rest
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
into
my
eyes
*punct* ,
widely
opened
in
wonder
*punct* ,
looked
the
dark
eyes
of
the
captive
*punct* ;
and
beneath
the
disguise
i
picked
out
the
charming
features
of
the
slave
girl
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
tears
on
the
whitened
lashes
*punct* ,
and
she
was
submissive
now
*punct* .
*break*
this
time
*punct* ,
said
my
friend
hardly
*punct* ,
we
have
fairly
captured
her
*punct* ,
and
we
will
hold
her
*punct* .
*break*
from
somewhere
up-stream
came
a
faint
call
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith's
lean
body
straightened
*punct* ;
he
stood
alert
*punct* ,
strung
up
*punct* .
*break*
another
call
answered
*punct* ,
and
a
third
responded
*punct* .
*break*
then
followed
the
flatly
shrill
note
of
a
police
whistle
*punct* ,
and
i
noted
a
column
of
black
vapor
rising
beyond
the
wall
*punct* ,
mounting
straight
to
heaven
as
the
smoke
of
a
welcome
offering
*punct* .
*break*
the
surrounded
mansion
was
in
flames
*punct* !
*break*
so
this
time
we
were
right
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
he
has
had
ample
opportunity
to
remove
his
effects
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
that
*punct* .
*break*
the
man's
daring
is
incredible
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
given
himself
till
the
very
last
moment
*punct* ,
and
we
blundered
upon
two
of
the
outposts
*punct* .
*break*
i
lost
one
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
i
expect
no
further
arrests
*punct* ,
and
the
house
will
have
been
so
well
fired
by
the
doctor's
servants
that
nothing
can
save
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
fear
its
ashes
will
afford
us
no
clew
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ;
but
we
have
secured
a
lever
which
should
serve
to
disturb
fu-manchu's
world
*punct* .
*break*
he
glanced
at
the
queer
figure
which
hung
submissively
in
his
arms
*punct* .
*break*
she
looked
up
proudly
*punct* .
*break*
you
need
not
hold
me
so
tight
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* ,
in
her
soft
voice
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
come
with
you
*punct* .
*break*
that
i
moved
amid
singular
happenings
*punct* ,
you
*punct* ,
who
have
borne
with
me
thus
far
*punct* ,
have
learned
*punct* ,
and
that
i
witnessed
many
curious
scenes
*punct* ;
but
of
the
many
such
scenes
in
that
race
*punct* ,
drama
wherein
nayland
smith
and
dr.
fu-manchu
played
the
leading
parts
*punct* ,
i
remember
none
more
bizarre
than
the
one
at
my
rooms
that
afternoon
*punct* .
*break*
without
delay
*punct* ,
and
without
taking
the
scotland
yard
men
into
our
confidence
*punct* ,
we
had
hurried
our
prisoner
back
to
london
*punct* ,
for
my
friend's
authority
was
supreme
*punct* .
*break*
a
strange
trio
we
were
*punct* ,
and
one
which
excited
no
little
comment
*punct* ;
but
the
journey
came
to
an
end
at
last
*punct* .
*break*
now
we
were
in
my
unpretentious
sitting-room
*punct* ,
the
room
wherein
smith
first
had
unfolded
to
me
the
story
of
dr.
fu-manchu
and
of
the
great
secret
society
which
sought
to
upset
the
balance
of
the
world
*punct* ,
to
place
europe
and
america
beneath
the
scepter
of
cathay
*punct* .
*break*
i
sat
with
my
elbows
upon
the
writing-table
*punct* ,
my
chin
in
my
hands
*punct* ;
smith
restlessly
paced
the
floor
*punct* ,
relighting
his
blackened
briar
a
dozen
times
in
as
many
minutes
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
big
arm-chair
the
pseudogypsy
was
curled
up
*punct* .
*break*
a
brief
toilet
had
converted
the
wizened
old
woman's
face
into
that
of
a
fascinatingly
pretty
girl
*punct* .
*break*
wildly
picturesque
she
looked
in
her
ragged
romany
garb
*punct* .
*break*
she
held
a
cigarette
in
her
fingers
and
watched
us
through
lowered
lashes
*punct* .
*break*
seemingly
*punct* ,
with
true
oriental
fatalism
*punct* ,
she
was
quite
reconciled
to
her
fate
*punct* ,
and
ever
and
anon
she
would
bestow
upon
me
a
glance
from
her
beautiful
eyes
which
few
men
*punct* ,
i
say
with
confidence
*punct* ,
could
have
sustained
unmoved
*punct* .
*break*
though
i
could
not
be
blind
to
the
emotions
of
that
passionate
eastern
soul
*punct* ,
yet
i
strove
not
to
think
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
accomplice
of
an
arch-murderer
she
might
be
*punct* ;
but
she
was
dangerously
lovely
*punct* .
*break*
that
man
who
was
with
you
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* ,
suddenly
turning
upon
her
*punct* ,
was
in
burma
up
till
quite
recently
*punct* .
*break*
he
murdered
a
fisherman
thirty
miles
above
prome
only
a
mouth
before
i
left
*punct* .
*break*
had
placed
a
thousand
rupees
on
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
am
i
right
*punct* ?
*break*
the
girl
shrugged
her
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
suppose
*punct* ,
what
then
*punct* ?
*break*
suppose
i
handed
you
over
to
the
police
*punct* ?
*break*
but
he
spoke
without
conviction
*punct* ,
for
in
the
recent
past
we
both
had
owed
our
lives
to
this
girl
*punct* .
*break*
as
you
please
*punct* ,
she
replied
*punct* .
*break*
the
police
would
learn
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
not
belong
to
the
far
east
*punct* ,
my
friend
said
abruptly
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
have
eastern
blood
in
your
veins
*punct* ,
but
you
are
no
kin
of
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
true
*punct* ,
she
admitted
*punct* ,
and
knocked
the
ash
from
her
cigarette
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
tell
me
where
to
find
fu-manchu
*punct* ?
*break*
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
again
*punct* ,
glancing
eloquently
in
my
direction
*punct* .
*break*
smith
walked
to
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
make
out
my
report
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
look
after
the
prisoner
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
the
door
closed
softly
behind
him
i
knew
what
was
expected
of
me
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
honestly
*punct* ,
i
shirked
my
responsibility
*punct* .
*break*
what
attitude
should
i
adopt
*punct* ?
*break*
how
should
i
go
about
my
delicate
task
*punct* ?
*break*
in
a
quandary
*punct* ,
i
stood
watching
the
girl
whom
singular
circumstances
saw
captive
in
my
rooms
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
not
think
we
would
harm
you
*punct* ?
*break*
i
began
awkwardly
*punct* .
*break*
no
harm
shall
come
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
why
will
you
not
trust
us
*punct* ?
*break*
she
raised
her
brilliant
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
of
what
avail
has
your
protection
been
to
some
of
those
others
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* ;
those
others
whom
he
has
sought
for
*punct* ?
*break*
it
had
been
of
none
*punct* ,
and
i
knew
it
well
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
i
grasped
the
drift
of
her
words
*punct* .
*break*
you
mean
that
if
you
speak
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
will
find
a
way
of
killing
you
*punct* ?
*break*
of
killing
me
*punct* !
*break*
she
flashed
scornfully
*punct* .
*break*
do
i
seem
one
to
fear
for
myself
*punct* ?
*break*
then
what
do
you
fear
*punct* ?
*break*
i
asked
*punct* ,
in
surprise
*punct* .
*break*
she
looked
at
me
oddly
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
was
seized
and
sold
for
a
slave
*punct* ,
she
answered
slowly
*punct* ,
my
sister
was
taken
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
and
my
brother
*punct* ,
a
child
*punct* .
*break*
she
spoke
the
word
with
a
tender
intonation
*punct* ,
and
her
slight
accent
rendered
it
the
more
soft
*punct* .
*break*
my
sister
died
in
the
desert
*punct* .
*break*
my
brother
lived
*punct* .
*break*
better
*punct* ,
far
better
*punct* ,
that
he
had
died
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
her
words
impressed
me
intensely
*punct* .
*break*
of
what
are
you
speaking
*punct* ?
*break*
you
speak
of
slave-raids
*punct* ,
of
the
desert
*punct* .
*break*
where
did
these
things
take
place
*punct* ?
*break*
of
what
country
are
you
*punct* ?
*break*
does
it
matter
*punct* ?
*break*
she
questioned
in
turn
*punct* .
*break*
of
what
country
am
i
*punct* ?
*break*
a
slave
has
no
country
*punct* ,
no
name
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
call
me
karamaneh
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* .
*break*
as
karamaneh
i
was
sold
to
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
and
my
brother
also
he
purchased
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
cheap
at
the
price
he
paid
*punct* .
*break*
she
laughed
shortly
*punct* ,
wildly
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
has
spent
a
lot
of
money
to
educate
me
*punct* .
*break*
my
brother
is
all
that
is
left
to
me
in
the
world
to
love
*punct* ,
and
he
is
in
the
power
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
upon
him
the
blow
will
fall
*punct* .
*break*
you
ask
me
to
fight
against
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
you
talk
of
protection
*punct* .
*break*
did
your
protection
save
sir
crichton
davey
*punct* ?
*break*
i
shook
my
head
sadly
*punct* .
*break*
you
understand
now
why
i
cannot
disobey
my
master's
orders
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
if
i
would
*punct* ,
i
dare
not
betray
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
*punct* .
*break*
how
could
i
answer
her
arguments
*punct* ?
*break*
what
could
i
say
*punct* ?
*break*
i
heard
the
rustle
of
her
ragged
skirts
*punct* ,
and
she
who
called
herself
karamaneh
stood
beside
me
*punct* .
*break*
she
laid
her
hand
upon
my
arm
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
go
*punct* ,
she
pleaded
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
kill
him
*punct* !
*break*
he
will
kill
him
*punct* !
*break*
her
voice
shook
with
emotion
*punct* .
*break*
he
cannot
revenge
himself
upon
your
brother
when
you
are
in
no
way
to
blame
*punct* ,
i
said
angrily
*punct* .
*break*
we
arrested
you
*punct* ;
you
are
not
here
of
your
own
free
will
*punct* .
*break*
she
drew
her
breath
sharply
*punct* ,
clutching
at
my
arm
*punct* ,
and
in
her
eyes
i
could
read
that
she
was
forcing
her
mind
to
some
arduous
decision
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
speaking
rapidly
*punct* ,
nervously
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
help
you
to
take
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
tell
you
where
he
is
to
be
found
alone
*punct* ,
will
you
promise
me
*punct* ,
solemnly
promise
me
*punct* ,
that
you
will
immediately
go
to
the
place
where
i
shall
guide
you
and
release
my
brother
*punct* ;
that
you
will
let
us
both
go
free
*punct* ?
*break*
i
will
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
without
hesitation
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
rest
assured
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
is
a
condition
*punct* ,
she
added
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
when
i
have
told
you
where
to
capture
him
you
must
release
me
*punct* .
*break*
smith
often
had
accused
me
of
weakness
where
this
girl
was
concerned
*punct* .
*break*
what
now
was
my
plain
duty
*punct* ?
*break*
that
she
would
utterly
decline
to
speak
under
any
circumstances
unless
it
suited
her
to
do
so
i
felt
assured
*punct* .
*break*
if
she
spoke
the
truth
*punct* ,
in
her
proposed
bargain
there
was
no
personal
element
*punct* ;
her
conduct
i
now
viewed
in
a
new
light
*punct* .
*break*
humanity
*punct* ,
i
thought
*punct* ,
dictated
that
i
accept
her
proposal
*punct* ;
policy
also
*punct* .
*break*
i
agree
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
and
looked
into
her
eyes
*punct* ,
which
were
aflame
now
with
emotion
*punct* ,
an
excitement
perhaps
of
anticipation
*punct* ,
perhaps
of
fear
*punct* .
*break*
she
laid
her
hands
upon
my
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
be
careful
*punct* ?
*break*
she
said
pleadingly
*punct* .
*break*
for
your
sake
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* ,
i
shall
*punct* .
*break*
not
for
my
sake
*punct* .
*break*
then
for
your
brother's
*punct* .
*break*
her
voice
had
sunk
to
a
whisper
*punct* .
*break*
for
your
own
*punct* .
*break*
a
cool
breeze
met
us
*punct* ,
blowing
from
the
lower
reaches
of
the
thames
*punct* .
*break*
far
behind
us
twinkled
the
dim
lights
of
low's
cottages
*punct* ,
the
last
regular
habitations
abutting
upon
the
marshes
*punct* .
*break*
between
us
and
the
cottages
stretched
half-a-mile
of
lush
land
through
which
at
this
season
there
were
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
numerous
dry
paths
*punct* .
*break*
before
us
the
flats
again
*punct* ,
a
dull
*punct* ,
monotonous
expanse
beneath
the
moon
*punct* ,
with
the
promise
of
the
cool
breeze
that
the
river
flowed
round
the
bend
ahead
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
very
quiet
*punct* .
*break*
only
the
sound
of
our
footsteps
*punct* ,
as
nayland
smith
and
i
tramped
steadily
towards
our
goal
*punct* ,
broke
the
stillness
of
that
lonely
place
*punct* .
*break*
not
once
but
many
times
*punct* ,
within
the
last
twenty
minutes
*punct* ,
i
had
thought
that
we
were
ill-advised
to
adventure
alone
upon
the
capture
of
the
formidable
chinese
doctor
*punct* ;
but
we
were
following
out
our
compact
with
karamaneh
*punct* ;
and
one
of
her
stipulations
had
been
that
the
police
must
not
be
acquainted
with
her
share
in
the
matter
*punct* .
*break*
a
light
came
into
view
far
ahead
of
us
*punct* .
*break*
that's
the
light
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
keep
that
straight
before
us
*punct* ,
according
to
our
information
we
shall
strike
the
hulk
*punct* .
*break*
i
grasped
the
revolver
in
my
pocket
*punct* ,
and
the
presence
of
the
little
weapon
was
curiously
reassuring
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
endeavored
*punct* ,
perhaps
in
extenuation
of
my
own
fears
*punct* ,
to
explain
how
about
dr.
fu-manchu
there
rested
an
atmosphere
of
horror
*punct* ,
peculiar
*punct* ,
unique
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
not
as
other
men
*punct* .
*break*
the
dread
that
he
inspired
in
all
with
whom
he
came
in
contact
*punct* ,
the
terrors
which
he
controlled
and
hurled
at
whomsoever
cumbered
his
path
*punct* ,
rendered
him
an
object
supremely
sinister
*punct* .
*break*
i
despair
of
conveying
to
those
who
may
read
this
account
any
but
the
coldest
conception
of
the
man's
evil
power
*punct* .
*break*
smith
stopped
suddenly
and
grasped
my
arm
*punct* .
*break*
we
stood
listening
*punct* .
*break*
you
heard
nothing
*punct* ?
*break*
i
shook
my
head
*punct* .
*break*
smith
was
peering
back
over
the
marshes
in
his
oddly
alert
way
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
to
me
*punct* ,
and
his
tanned
face
wore
a
peculiar
expression
*punct* .
*break*
you
don't
think
it's
a
trap
*punct* ?
*break*
we
are
trusting
her
blindly
*punct* .
*break*
strange
it
may
seem
*punct* ,
but
something
within
me
rose
in
arms
against
the
innuendo
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
*punct* ,
i
said
shortly
*punct* .
*break*
we
pressed
on
*punct* .
*break*
ten
minutes
steady
tramping
brought
us
within
sight
of
the
thames
*punct* .
*break*
smith
and
i
both
had
noticed
how
fu-manchu's
activities
centered
always
about
the
london
river
*punct* .
*break*
undoubtedly
it
was
his
highway
*punct* ,
his
line
of
communication
*punct* ,
along
which
he
moved
his
mysterious
forces
*punct* .
*break*
the
opium
den
off
shadwell
highway
*punct* ,
the
mansion
upstream
*punct* ,
at
that
hour
a
smoldering
shell
*punct* ;
now
the
hulk
lying
off
the
marshes
*punct* .
*break*
always
he
made
his
headquarters
upon
the
river
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
significant
*punct* ;
and
even
if
to-night's
expedition
should
fail
*punct* ,
this
was
a
clew
for
our
future
guidance
*punct* .
*break*
bear
to
the
right
*punct* ,
directed
smith
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
reconnoiter
before
making
our
attack
*punct* .
*break*
we
took
a
path
that
led
directly
to
the
river
bank
*punct* .
*break*
before
us
lay
the
gray
expanse
of
water
*punct* ,
and
out
upon
it
moved
the
busy
shipping
of
the
great
mercantile
city
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
life
of
the
river
seemed
widely
removed
from
us
*punct* .
*break*
the
lonely
spot
where
we
stood
had
no
kinship
with
human
activity
*punct* .
*break*
its
dreariness
illuminated
by
the
brilliant
moon
*punct* ,
it
looked
indeed
a
fit
setting
for
an
act
in
such
a
drama
as
that
wherein
we
played
our
parts
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
had
lain
in
the
east
end
opium
den
*punct* ,
when
upon
such
another
night
as
this
i
had
looked
out
upon
a
peaceful
norfolk
countryside
*punct* ,
the
same
knowledge
of
aloofness
*punct* ,
of
utter
detachment
from
the
world
of
living
men
*punct* ,
had
come
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
silently
smith
stared
out
at
the
distant
moving
lights
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
merely
means
a
slave
*punct* ,
he
said
irrelevantly
*punct* .
*break*
i
made
no
comment
*punct* .
*break*
there's
the
hulk
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* .
*break*
the
bank
upon
which
we
stood
dipped
in
mud
slopes
to
the
level
of
the
running
tide
*punct* .
*break*
seaward
it
rose
higher
*punct* ,
and
by
a
narrow
inlet
*punct* ,
for
we
perceived
that
we
were
upon
a
kind
of
promontory
*punct* ,
a
rough
pier
showed
*punct* .
*break*
beneath
it
was
a
shadowy
shape
in
the
patch
of
gloom
which
the
moon
threw
far
out
upon
the
softly
eddying
water
*punct* .
*break*
only
one
dim
light
was
visible
amid
this
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
that
will
be
the
cabin
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* .
*break*
acting
upon
our
prearranged
plan
*punct* ,
we
turned
and
walked
up
on
to
the
staging
above
the
hulk
*punct* .
*break*
a
wooden
ladder
led
out
and
down
to
the
deck
below
*punct* ,
and
was
loosely
lashed
to
a
ring
on
the
pier
*punct* .
*break*
with
every
motion
of
the
tidal
waters
the
ladder
rose
and
fell
*punct* ,
its
rings
creaking
harshly
*punct* ,
against
the
crazy
railing
*punct* .
*break*
how
are
we
going
to
get
down
without
being
detected
*punct* ?
*break*
we've
got
to
risk
it
*punct* ,
i
said
grimly
*punct* .
*break*
without
further
words
my
friend
climbed
around
on
to
the
ladder
and
commenced
to
descend
*punct* .
*break*
i
waited
until
his
head
disappeared
below
the
level
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
clumsily
enough
*punct* ,
prepared
to
follow
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
hulk
at
that
moment
giving
an
unusually
heavy
heave
*punct* ,
i
stumbled
*punct* ,
and
for
one
breathless
moment
looked
down
upon
the
glittering
surface
streaking
the
darkness
beneath
me
*punct* .
*break*
my
foot
had
slipped
*punct* ,
and
but
that
i
had
a
firm
grip
upon
the
top
rung
*punct* ,
that
instant
*punct* ,
most
probably
*punct* ,
had
marked
the
end
of
my
share
in
the
fight
with
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
as
it
was
i
had
a
narrow
escape
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
something
slip
from
my
hip
pocket
*punct* ,
but
the
weird
creaking
of
the
ladder
*punct* ,
the
groans
of
the
laboring
hulk
*punct* ,
and
the
lapping
of
the
waves
about
the
staging
drowned
the
sound
of
the
splash
as
my
revolver
dropped
into
the
river
*punct* .
*break*
rather
*punct* ,
white-faced
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
i
joined
smith
on
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
witnessed
my
accident
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
we
must
risk
it
*punct* ,
he
whispered
in
my
ear
*punct* .
*break*
we
dare
not
turn
back
now
*punct* .
*break*
he
plunged
into
the
semi-darkness
*punct* ,
making
for
the
cabin
*punct* ,
i
perforce
following
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
we
came
fully
into
the
light
streaming
out
from
the
singular
apartments
at
the
entrance
to
which
we
found
ourselves
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
fitted
up
as
a
laboratory
*punct* .
*break*
a
glimpse
i
had
of
shelves
loaded
with
jars
and
bottles
*punct* ,
of
a
table
strewn
with
scientific
paraphernalia
*punct* ,
with
retorts
*punct* ,
with
tubes
of
extraordinary
shapes
*punct* ,
holding
living
organisms
*punct* ,
and
with
instruments
*punct* ,
some
of
them
of
a
form
unknown
to
my
experience
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
too
that
books
*punct* ,
papers
and
rolls
of
parchment
littered
the
bare
wooden
floor
*punct* .
*break*
then
smith's
voice
rose
above
the
confused
sounds
about
me
*punct* ,
incisive
*punct* ,
commanding
*punct* :
i
have
you
covered
*punct* ,
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
for
fu-manchu
sat
at
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
the
picture
that
he
presented
at
that
moment
is
one
which
persistently
clings
in
my
memory
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
long
*punct* ,
yellow
robe
*punct* ,
his
masklike
*punct* ,
intellectual
face
bent
forward
amongst
the
riot
of
singular
objects
upon
the
table
*punct* ,
his
great
*punct* ,
high
brow
gleaming
in
the
light
of
the
shaded
lamp
above
him
*punct* ,
and
with
the
abnormal
eyes
*punct* ,
filmed
and
green
*punct* ,
raised
to
us
*punct* ,
he
seemed
a
figure
from
the
realms
of
delirium
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
most
amazing
circumstance
of
all
*punct* ,
he
and
his
surroundings
tallied
*punct* ,
almost
identically
*punct* ,
with
the
dream-picture
which
had
come
to
me
as
i
lay
chained
in
the
cell
*punct* !
*break*
some
of
the
large
jars
about
the
place
held
anatomy
specimens
*punct* .
*break*
a
faint
smell
of
opium
hung
in
the
air
*punct* ,
and
playing
with
the
tassel
of
one
of
the
cushions
upon
which
*punct* ,
as
upon
a
divan
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
was
seated
*punct* ,
leaped
and
chattered
a
little
marmoset
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
an
electric
moment
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
prepared
for
anything
*punct* ,
for
anything
except
for
what
really
happened
*punct* .
*break*
the
doctor's
wonderful
*punct* ,
evil
face
betrayed
no
hint
of
emotion
*punct* .
*break*
the
lids
flickered
over
the
filmed
eyes
*punct* ,
and
their
greenness
grew
momentarily
brighter
*punct* ,
and
filmed
over
again
*punct* .
*break*
put
up
your
hands
*punct* !
*break*
rapped
smith
*punct* ,
and
attempt
no
tricks
*punct* .
*break*
his
voice
quivered
with
excitement
*punct* .
*break*
the
game's
up
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
find
something
to
tie
him
up
with
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
i
moved
forward
to
smith's
side
*punct* ,
and
was
about
to
pass
him
in
the
narrow
doorway
*punct* .
*break*
the
hulk
moved
beneath
our
feet
like
a
living
thing
groaning
*punct* ,
creaking
*punct* ,
and
the
water
lapped
about
the
rotten
woodwork
with
a
sound
infinitely
dreary
*punct* .
*break*
put
up
your
hands
*punct* !
*break*
ordered
smith
imperatively
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
slowly
raised
his
hands
*punct* ,
and
a
smile
dawned
upon
the
impassive
features
*punct* ,
a
smile
that
had
no
mirth
in
it
*punct* ,
only
menace
*punct* ,
revealing
as
it
did
his
even
*punct* ,
discolored
teeth
*punct* ,
but
leaving
the
filmed
eyes
inanimate
*punct* ,
dull
*punct* ,
inhuman
*punct* .
*break*
he
spoke
softly
*punct* ,
sibilantly
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
advise
dr.
petrie
to
glance
behind
him
before
he
moves
*punct* .
*break*
smith's
keen
gray
eyes
never
for
a
moment
quitted
the
speaker
*punct* .
*break*
the
gleaming
barrel
moved
not
a
hair's-breadth
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
glanced
quickly
over
my
shoulder
*punct* ,
and
stifled
a
cry
of
pure
horror
*punct* .
*break*
a
wicked
*punct* ,
pock-marked
face
*punct* ,
with
wolfish
fangs
bared
*punct* ,
and
jaundiced
eyes
squinting
obliquely
into
mine
*punct* ,
was
within
two
inches
of
me
*punct* .
*break*
a
lean
*punct* ,
brown
hand
and
arm
*punct* ,
the
great
thews
standing
up
like
cords
*punct* ,
held
a
crescent-shaped
knife
a
fraction
of
an
inch
above
my
jugular
vein
*punct* .
*break*
a
slight
movement
must
have
dispatched
me
*punct* ;
a
sweep
of
the
fearful
weapon
*punct* ,
i
doubt
not
*punct* ,
would
have
severed
my
head
from
my
body
*punct* .
*break*
i
whispered
hoarsely
*punct* ,
don't
look
around
*punct* .
*break*
for
god's
sake
keep
him
covered
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
dacoit
has
his
knife
at
my
throat
*punct* !
*break*
then
*punct* ,
for
the
first
time
*punct* ,
smith's
hand
trembled
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
glance
never
wavered
from
the
malignant
*punct* ,
emotionless
countenance
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
he
clenched
his
teeth
hard
*punct* ,
so
that
the
muscles
stood
out
prominently
upon
his
jaw
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
that
silence
which
followed
my
awful
discovery
prevailed
but
a
few
seconds
*punct* .
*break*
to
me
those
seconds
were
each
a
lingering
death
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
below
*punct* ,
in
that
groaning
hulk
*punct* ,
i
knew
more
of
icy
terror
than
any
of
our
meetings
with
the
murder-group
had
brought
to
me
before
*punct* ;
and
through
my
brain
throbbed
a
thought
*punct* :
the
girl
had
betrayed
us
*punct* !
*break*
you
supposed
that
i
was
alone
*punct* ?
*break*
so
i
was
*punct* .
*break*
yet
no
trace
of
fear
had
broken
through
the
impassive
yellow
mask
when
we
had
entered
*punct* .
*break*
but
my
faithful
servant
followed
you
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* .
*break*
i
thank
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
honors
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
are
mine
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ?
*break*
smith
made
no
reply
*punct* .
*break*
i
divined
that
he
was
thinking
furiously
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
moved
his
hand
to
caress
the
marmoset
*punct* ,
which
had
leaped
playfully
upon
his
shoulder
*punct* ,
and
crouched
there
gibing
at
us
in
a
whistling
voice
*punct* .
*break*
said
smith
savagely
*punct* .
*break*
i
warn
you
*punct* !
*break*
fu-manchu
kept
his
hand
raised
*punct* .
*break*
may
i
ask
you
how
you
discovered
my
retreat
*punct* ?
*break*
this
hulk
has
been
watched
since
dawn
*punct* ,
lied
smith
brazenly
*punct* .
*break*
the
doctor's
filmed
eyes
cleared
for
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
and
to-day
you
compelled
me
to
burn
a
house
*punct* ,
and
you
have
captured
one
of
my
people
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
i
congratulate
you
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
not
betray
me
though
lashed
with
scorpions
*punct* .
*break*
the
great
gleaming
knife
was
so
near
to
my
neck
that
a
sheet
of
notepaper
could
scarcely
have
been
slipped
between
blade
and
vein
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ;
but
my
heart
throbbed
even
more
wildly
when
i
heard
those
words
*punct* .
*break*
an
impasse
*punct* ,
said
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
a
proposal
to
make
*punct* .
*break*
i
assume
that
you
would
not
accept
my
word
for
anything
*punct* ?
*break*
i
would
not
*punct* ,
replied
smith
promptly
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
*punct* ,
pursued
the
chinaman
*punct* ,
and
the
occasional
guttural
alone
marred
his
perfect
english
*punct* ,
i
must
accept
yours
*punct* .
*break*
of
your
resources
outside
this
cabin
i
know
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
you
*punct* ,
i
take
it
*punct* ,
know
as
little
of
mine
*punct* .
*break*
my
burmese
friend
and
doctor
petrie
will
lead
the
way
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ;
you
and
i
will
follow
*punct* .
*break*
we
will
strike
out
across
the
marsh
for
*punct* ,
say
*punct* ,
three
hundred
yards
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
then
place
your
pistol
on
the
ground
*punct* ,
pledging
me
your
word
to
leave
it
there
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
further
require
your
assurance
that
you
will
make
no
attempt
upon
me
until
i
have
retraced
my
steps
*punct* .
*break*
i
and
my
good
servant
will
withdraw
*punct* ,
leaving
you
*punct* ,
at
the
expiration
of
the
specified
period
*punct* ,
to
act
as
you
see
fit
*punct* .
*break*
is
it
agreed
*punct* ?
*break*
then
*punct* :
the
dacoit
must
leave
his
knife
also
*punct* ,
he
stipulated
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
smiled
his
evil
smile
again
*punct* .
*break*
shall
i
lead
the
way
*punct* ?
*break*
petrie
and
the
dacoit
first
*punct* ;
then
you
*punct* ;
i
last
*punct* .
*break*
a
guttural
word
of
command
from
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
and
we
left
the
cabin
*punct* ,
with
its
evil
odors
*punct* ,
its
mortuary
specimens
*punct* ,
and
its
strange
instruments
*punct* ,
and
in
the
order
arranged
mounted
to
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
be
awkward
on
the
ladder
*punct* ,
said
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
petrie
*punct* ,
i
will
accept
your
word
to
adhere
to
the
terms
*punct* .
*break*
i
promise
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
the
words
almost
choking
me
*punct* .
*break*
we
mounted
the
rising
and
dipping
ladder
*punct* ,
all
reached
the
pier
*punct* ,
and
strode
out
across
the
flats
*punct* ,
the
chinaman
always
under
close
cover
of
smith's
revolver
*punct* .
*break*
round
about
our
feet
*punct* ,
now
leaping
ahead
*punct* ,
now
gamboling
back
*punct* ,
came
and
went
the
marmoset
*punct* .
*break*
the
dacoit
*punct* ,
dressed
solely
in
a
dark
loin-cloth
*punct* ,
walked
beside
me
*punct* ,
carrying
his
huge
knife
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
glancing
at
me
with
his
blood-lustful
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
never
before
*punct* ,
i
venture
to
say
*punct* ,
had
an
autumn
moon
lighted
such
a
scene
in
that
place
*punct* .
*break*
here
we
part
*punct* ,
said
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
and
spoke
another
word
to
his
follower
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
threw
his
knife
upon
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
search
him
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
directed
smith
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
have
a
second
concealed
*punct* .
*break*
the
doctor
consented
*punct* ;
and
i
passed
my
hands
over
the
man's
scanty
garments
*punct* .
*break*
now
search
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
this
also
i
did
*punct* .
*break*
and
never
have
i
experienced
a
similar
sense
of
revulsion
from
any
human
being
*punct* .
*break*
i
shuddered
*punct* ,
as
though
i
had
touched
a
venomous
reptile
*punct* .
*break*
smith
drew
down
his
revolver
*punct* .
*break*
i
curse
myself
for
an
honorable
fool
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
could
dispute
my
right
to
shoot
you
dead
where
you
stand
*punct* .
*break*
knowing
him
as
i
did
*punct* ,
i
could
tell
from
the
suppressed
passion
in
smith's
voice
that
only
by
his
unhesitating
acceptance
of
my
friend's
word
*punct* ,
and
implicit
faith
in
his
keeping
it
*punct* ,
had
dr.
fu-manchu
escaped
just
retribution
at
that
moment
*punct* .
*break*
fiend
though
he
was
*punct* ,
i
admired
his
courage
*punct* ;
for
all
this
he
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
must
have
known
*punct* .
*break*
the
doctor
turned
*punct* ,
and
with
the
dacoit
walked
back
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith's
next
move
filled
me
with
surprise
*punct* .
*break*
for
just
as
*punct* ,
silently
*punct* ,
i
was
thanking
god
for
my
escape
*punct* ,
my
friend
began
shedding
his
coat
*punct* ,
collar
and
waistcoat
*punct* .
*break*
pocket
your
valuables
*punct* ,
and
do
the
same
*punct* ,
he
muttered
hoarsely
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
a
poor
chances
but
we
are
both
fairly
fit
*punct* .
*break*
to-night
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
we
literally
have
to
run
for
our
lives
*punct* .
*break*
we
live
in
a
peaceful
age
*punct* ,
wherein
it
falls
to
the
lot
of
few
men
to
owe
their
survival
to
their
fleetness
of
foot
*punct* .
*break*
at
smith's
words
i
realized
in
a
flash
that
such
was
to
be
our
fate
to-night
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
said
that
the
hulk
lay
off
a
sort
of
promontory
*punct* .
*break*
east
and
west
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
we
had
nothing
to
hope
for
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
south
was
fu-manchu
*punct* ;
and
even
as
*punct* ,
stripped
of
our
heavier
garments
*punct* ,
we
started
to
run
northward
*punct* ,
the
weird
signal
of
a
dacoit
rose
on
the
night
and
was
answered
*punct* ,
was
answered
again
*punct* .
*break*
three
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
hissed
smith
*punct* ;
three
armed
dacoits
*punct* .
*break*
take
the
revolver
*punct* ,
i
cried
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
it's
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
he
rapped
*punct* ,
through
clenched
teeth
*punct* .
*break*
a
servant
of
the
crown
in
the
east
makes
his
motto
*punct* :
keep
your
word
*punct* ,
though
it
break
your
neck
*punct* !
*break*
i
don't
think
we
need
fear
it
being
used
against
us
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
avoids
noisy
methods
*punct* .
*break*
so
back
we
ran
*punct* ,
over
the
course
by
which
*punct* ,
earlier
*punct* ,
we
had
come
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
*punct* ,
roughly
*punct* ,
a
mile
to
the
first
building
*punct* ,
a
deserted
cottage
*punct* ,
and
another
quarter
of
a
mile
to
any
that
was
occupied
*punct* .
*break*
our
chance
of
meeting
a
living
soul
*punct* ,
other
than
fu-manchu's
dacoits
*punct* ,
was
practically
nil
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
we
ran
easily
*punct* ,
for
it
was
the
second
half-mile
that
would
decide
our
fate
*punct* .
*break*
the
professional
murderers
who
pursued
us
ran
like
panthers
*punct* ,
i
knew
*punct* ;
and
i
dare
not
allow
my
mind
to
dwell
upon
those
yellow
figures
with
the
curved
*punct* ,
gleaming
*punct* ,
knives
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
long
time
neither
of
us
looked
back
*punct* .
*break*
on
we
ran
*punct* ,
and
on
*punct* ,
silently
*punct* ,
doggedly
*punct* .
*break*
then
a
hissing
breath
from
smith
warned
me
what
to
expect
*punct* .
*break*
should
i
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
look
back
*punct* ?
*break*
it
was
impossible
to
resist
the
horrid
fascination
*punct* .
*break*
i
threw
a
quick
glance
over
my
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
and
never
while
i
live
shall
i
forget
what
i
saw
*punct* .
*break*
two
of
the
pursuing
dacoits
had
outdistanced
their
fellow
*punct* ,
or
fellows
*punct* ,
and
were
actually
within
three
hundred
yards
of
us
*punct* .
*break*
more
like
dreadful
animals
they
looked
than
human
beings
*punct* ,
running
bent
forward
*punct* ,
with
their
faces
curiously
uptilted
*punct* .
*break*
the
brilliant
moonlight
gleamed
upon
bared
teeth
*punct* ,
as
i
could
see
*punct* ,
even
at
that
distance
*punct* ,
even
in
that
quick
*punct* ,
agonized
glance
*punct* ,
and
it
gleamed
upon
the
crescent-shaped
knives
*punct* .
*break*
as
hard
as
you
can
go
now
*punct* ,
panted
smith
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
make
an
attempt
to
break
into
the
empty
cottage
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
never
in
my
younger
days
been
a
notable
runner
*punct* ;
for
smith
i
cannot
speak
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
am
confident
that
the
next
half-mile
was
done
in
time
that
would
not
have
disgraced
a
crack
man
*punct* .
*break*
not
once
again
did
either
of
us
look
back
*punct* .
*break*
yard
upon
yard
we
raced
forward
together
*punct* .
*break*
my
heart
seemed
to
be
bursting
*punct* .
*break*
my
leg
muscles
throbbed
with
pain
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
with
the
empty
cottage
in
sight
*punct* ,
it
came
to
that
pass
with
me
when
another
three
yards
looks
as
unattainable
as
three
miles
*punct* .
*break*
once
i
stumbled
*punct* .
*break*
came
from
smith
weakly
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
recovered
myself
*punct* .
*break*
bare
feet
pattered
close
upon
our
heels
*punct* ,
and
panting
breaths
told
how
even
fu-manchu's
bloodhounds
were
hard
put
to
it
by
the
killing
pace
we
had
made
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
whispered
*punct* ,
look
in
front
*punct* .
*break*
as
through
a
red
mist
i
had
seen
a
dark
shape
detach
itself
from
the
shadows
of
the
cottage
*punct* ,
and
merge
into
them
again
*punct* .
*break*
it
could
only
be
another
dacoit
*punct* ;
but
smith
*punct* ,
not
heeding
*punct* ,
or
not
hearing
*punct* ,
my
faintly
whispered
words
*punct* ,
crashed
open
the
gate
and
hurled
himself
blindly
at
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
it
burst
open
before
him
with
a
resounding
boom
*punct* ,
and
he
pitched
forward
into
the
interior
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
flat
upon
the
floor
he
lay
*punct* ,
for
as
*punct* ,
with
a
last
effort
*punct* ,
i
gained
the
threshold
and
dragged
myself
within
*punct* ,
i
almost
fell
over
his
recumbent
body
*punct* .
*break*
madly
i
snatched
at
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
his
foot
held
it
open
*punct* .
*break*
i
kicked
the
foot
away
*punct* ,
and
banged
the
door
to
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
turned
*punct* ,
the
leading
dacoit
*punct* ,
his
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
*punct* ,
his
face
the
face
of
a
demon
leaped
wildly
through
the
gateway
*punct* .
*break*
that
smith
had
burst
the
latch
i
felt
assured
*punct* ,
but
by
some
divine
accident
my
weak
hands
found
the
bolt
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
last
ounce
of
strength
spared
to
me
i
thrust
it
home
in
the
rusty
socket
*punct* ,
as
a
full
six
inches
of
shining
steel
split
the
middle
panel
and
protruded
above
my
head
*punct* .
*break*
i
dropped
*punct* ,
sprawling
*punct* ,
beside
my
friend
*punct* .
*break*
a
terrific
blow
shattered
every
pane
of
glass
in
the
solitary
window
*punct* ,
and
one
of
the
grinning
animal
faces
looked
in
*punct* .
*break*
sorry
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ,
whispered
smith
*punct* ,
and
his
voice
was
barely
audible
*punct* .
*break*
weakly
he
grasped
my
hand
*punct* .
*break*
i
shouldn't
have
let
*punct* ,
you
come
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
corner
of
the
room
where
the
black
shadows
lay
flicked
a
long
tongue
of
flame
*punct* .
*break*
muffled
*punct* ,
staccato
*punct* ,
came
the
report
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
yellow
face
at
the
window
was
blotted
out
*punct* .
*break*
one
wild
cry
*punct* ,
ending
in
a
rattling
gasp
*punct* ,
told
of
a
dacoit
gone
to
his
account
*punct* .
*break*
a
gray
figure
glided
past
me
and
was
silhouetted
against
the
broken
window
*punct* .
*break*
again
the
pistol
sent
its
message
into
the
night
*punct* ,
and
again
came
the
reply
to
tell
how
well
and
truly
that
message
had
been
delivered
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
stillness
*punct* ,
intense
by
sharp
contrast
*punct* ,
the
sound
of
bare
soles
pattering
upon
the
path
outside
stole
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
two
runners
*punct* ,
i
thought
there
were
*punct* ,
so
that
four
dacoits
must
have
been
upon
our
trail
*punct* .
*break*
the
room
was
full
of
pungent
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
i
staggered
to
my
feet
as
the
gray
figure
with
the
revolver
turned
towards
me
*punct* .
*break*
something
familiar
there
was
in
that
long
*punct* ,
gray
garment
*punct* ,
and
now
i
perceived
why
i
had
thought
so
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
my
gray
rain-coat
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
*punct* ,
i
whispered
*punct* .
*break*
and
smith
*punct* ,
with
difficulty
*punct* ,
supporting
himself
upright
*punct* ,
and
holding
fast
to
the
ledge
beside
the
door
*punct* ,
muttered
something
hoarsely
*punct* ,
which
sounded
like
god
bless
her
*punct* !
*break*
the
girl
*punct* ,
trembling
now
*punct* ,
placed
her
hands
upon
my
shoulders
with
that
quaint
*punct* ,
pathetic
gesture
peculiarly
her
own
*punct* .
*break*
i
followed
you
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
not
know
i
should
follow
you
*punct* ?
*break*
but
i
had
to
hide
because
of
another
who
was
following
also
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
but
just
reached
this
place
when
i
saw
you
running
towards
me
*punct* .
*break*
she
broke
off
and
turned
to
smith
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
your
pistol
*punct* ,
she
said
naively
*punct* .
*break*
i
found
it
in
your
bag
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
please
take
it
*punct* !
*break*
he
took
it
without
a
word
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
speak
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
not
safe
yet
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
failed
*punct* ,
she
replied
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
go
back
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
other
way
*punct* .
*break*
strangely
sick
at
heart
for
a
man
who
has
just
had
a
miraculous
escape
from
death
*punct* ,
i
opened
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
coatless
*punct* ,
disheveled
figures
*punct* ,
my
friend
and
i
stepped
out
into
the
moonlight
*punct* .
*break*
hideous
under
the
pale
rays
lay
the
two
dead
men
*punct* ,
their
glazed
eyes
upcast
to
the
peace
of
the
blue
heavens
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
had
shot
to
kill
*punct* ,
for
both
had
bullets
in
their
brains
*punct* .
*break*
if
god
ever
planned
a
more
complex
nature
than
hers
*punct* ,
a
nature
more
tumultuous
with
conflicting
passions
*punct* ,
i
cannot
conceive
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
yet
her
beauty
was
of
the
sweetest
*punct* ;
and
in
some
respects
she
had
the
heart
of
a
child
*punct* ,
this
girl
who
could
shoot
so
straight
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
send
the
police
to-night
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* .
*break*
or
the
papers
*punct* ,
hurry
*punct* ,
came
the
girl's
voice
commandingly
from
the
darkness
of
the
cottage
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
singular
situation
*punct* .
*break*
my
very
soul
rebelled
against
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
could
we
do
*punct* ?
*break*
tell
us
where
we
can
communicate
*punct* ,
began
smith
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
be
suspected
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
want
him
to
kill
me
*punct* !
*break*
we
moved
away
*punct* .
*break*
all
was
very
still
now
*punct* ,
and
the
lights
glimmered
faintly
ahead
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
wisp
of
cloud
brushed
the
moon's
disk
*punct* .
*break*
good-night
*punct* ,
karamaneh
*punct* ,
i
whispered
softly
*punct* .
*break*
to
pursue
further
the
adventure
on
the
marshes
would
be
a
task
at
once
useless
and
thankless
*punct* .
*break*
in
its
actual
and
in
its
dramatic
significance
it
concluded
with
our
parting
from
karamaneh
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
that
parting
i
learned
what
shakespeare
meant
by
sweet
sorrow
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
world
*punct* ,
i
learned
*punct* ,
upon
the
confines
of
which
i
stood
*punct* ,
a
world
whose
very
existence
hitherto
had
been
unsuspected
*punct* .
*break*
not
the
least
of
the
mysteries
which
peeped
from
the
darkness
was
the
mystery
of
the
heart
of
karamaneh
*punct* .
*break*
i
sought
to
forget
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
sought
to
remember
her
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
in
the
latter
task
i
found
one
more
congenial
*punct* ,
yet
*punct* ,
in
the
direction
and
extent
of
the
ideas
which
it
engendered
*punct* ,
one
that
led
me
to
a
precipice
*punct* .
*break*
east
and
west
may
not
intermingle
*punct* .
*break*
as
a
student
of
world-policies
*punct* ,
as
a
physician
*punct* ,
i
admitted
*punct* ,
could
not
deny
*punct* ,
that
truth
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
if
karamaneh
were
to
be
credited
*punct* ,
she
had
come
to
fu-manchu
a
slave
*punct* ;
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
raiders
*punct* ;
had
crossed
the
desert
with
the
slave-drivers
*punct* ;
had
known
the
house
of
the
slave-dealer
*punct* .
*break*
could
it
be
*punct* ?
*break*
with
the
fading
of
the
crescent
of
islam
i
had
thought
such
things
to
have
passed
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
it
were
so
*punct* ?
*break*
at
the
mere
thought
of
a
girl
so
deliciously
beautiful
in
the
brutal
power
of
slavers
*punct* ,
i
found
myself
grinding
my
teeth
*punct* ,
closing
my
eyes
in
a
futile
attempt
to
blot
out
the
pictures
called
up
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
at
such
times
*punct* ,
i
would
find
myself
discrediting
her
story
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
i
would
find
myself
wondering
*punct* ,
vaguely
*punct* ,
why
such
problems
persistently
haunted
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
always
*punct* ,
my
heart
had
an
answer
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
was
a
medical
man
*punct* ,
who
sought
to
build
up
a
family
practice!
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
a
very
little
time
ago
*punct* ,
had
thought
himself
past
the
hot
follies
of
youth
and
entered
upon
that
staid
phase
of
life
wherein
the
daily
problems
of
the
medical
profession
hold
absolute
sway
and
such
seductive
follies
as
dark
eyes
and
red
lips
find
*punct* ,
no
place
*punct* ,
are
excluded
*punct* !
*break*
but
it
is
foreign
from
the
purpose
of
this
plain
record
to
enlist
sympathy
for
the
recorder
*punct* .
*break*
the
topic
upon
which
*punct* ,
here
*punct* ,
i
have
ventured
to
touch
was
one
fascinating
enough
to
me
*punct* ;
i
cannot
hope
that
it
holds
equal
charm
for
any
other
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
return
to
that
which
it
is
my
duty
to
narrate
and
let
us
forget
my
brief
digression
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
fact
*punct* ,
singular
*punct* ,
but
true
*punct* ,
that
few
londoners
know
london
*punct* .
*break*
under
the
guidance
of
my
friend
*punct* ,
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
i
had
learned
*punct* ,
since
his
return
from
burma
*punct* ,
how
there
are
haunts
in
the
very
heart
of
the
metropolis
whose
existence
is
unsuspected
by
all
but
the
few
*punct* ;
places
unknown
even
to
the
ubiquitous
copy-hunting
pressman
*punct* .
*break*
into
a
quiet
thoroughfare
not
two
minutes
walk
from
the
pulsing
life
of
leicester
square
*punct* ,
smith
led
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
before
a
door
sandwiched
in
between
two
dingy
shop-fronts
he
paused
and
turned
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
whatever
you
see
or
hear
*punct* ,
he
cautioned
*punct* ,
express
no
surprise
*punct* .
*break*
a
cab
had
dropped
us
at
the
corner
*punct* .
*break*
we
both
wore
dark
suits
and
fez
caps
with
black
silk
tassels
*punct* .
*break*
my
complexion
had
been
artificially
reduced
to
a
shade
resembling
the
deep
tan
of
my
friend's
*punct* .
*break*
he
rang
the
bell
beside
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
almost
immediately
it
was
opened
by
a
negro
woman
*punct* ,
gross
*punct* ,
hideously
ugly
*punct* .
*break*
smith
uttered
something
in
voluble
arabic
*punct* .
*break*
as
a
linguist
his
attainments
were
a
constant
source
of
surprise
*punct* .
*break*
the
jargons
of
the
east
*punct* ,
far
and
near
*punct* ,
he
spoke
as
his
mother
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
the
woman
immediately
displayed
the
utmost
servility
*punct* ,
ushering
us
into
an
ill-lighted
passage
*punct* ,
with
every
evidence
of
profound
respect
*punct* .
*break*
following
this
passage
*punct* ,
and
passing
an
inner
door
*punct* ,
from
beyond
whence
proceeded
bursts
of
discordant
music
*punct* ,
we
entered
a
little
room
bare
of
furniture
*punct* ,
with
coarse
matting
for
mural
decorations
*punct* ,
and
a
patternless
red
carpet
on
the
floor
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
niche
burned
a
common
metal
lamp
*punct* .
*break*
the
negress
left
us
*punct* ,
and
close
upon
her
departure
entered
a
very
aged
man
with
a
long
patriarchal
beard
*punct* ,
who
greeted
my
friend
with
dignified
courtesy
*punct* .
*break*
following
a
brief
conversation
*punct* ,
the
aged
arab
*punct* ,
for
such
he
appeared
to
be
*punct* ,
drew
aside
a
strip
of
matting
*punct* ,
revealing
a
dark
recess
*punct* .
*break*
placing
his
finger
upon
his
lips
*punct* ,
he
silently
invited
us
to
enter
*punct* .
*break*
we
did
so
*punct* ,
and
the
mat
was
dropped
behind
us
*punct* .
*break*
the
sounds
of
crude
music
were
now
much
plainer
*punct* ,
and
as
smith
slipped
a
little
shutter
aside
i
gave
a
start
of
surprise
*punct* .
*break*
beyond
lay
a
fairly
large
apartment
*punct* ,
having
divans
or
low
seats
around
three
of
its
walls
*punct* .
*break*
these
divans
were
occupied
by
a
motley
company
of
turks
*punct* ,
egyptians
*punct* ,
greeks
*punct* ,
and
others
*punct* ;
and
i
noted
two
chinese
*punct* .
*break*
most
of
them
smoked
cigarettes
*punct* ,
and
some
were
drinking
*punct* .
*break*
a
girl
was
performing
a
sinuous
dance
upon
the
square
carpet
occupying
the
center
of
the
floor
*punct* ,
accompanied
by
a
young
negro
woman
upon
a
guitar
and
by
several
members
of
the
assembly
who
clapped
their
hands
to
the
music
or
hummed
a
low
*punct* ,
monotonous
melody
*punct* .
*break*
shortly
after
our
entrance
into
the
passage
the
dance
terminated
*punct* ,
and
the
dancer
fled
through
a
curtained
door
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
a
buzz
of
conversation
arose
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
sort
of
combined
wekaleh
and
place
of
entertainment
for
a
certain
class
of
oriental
residents
in
*punct* ,
or
visiting
*punct* ,
london
*punct* ,
smith
whispered
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
gentleman
who
has
just
left
us
is
the
proprietor
or
host
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
been
here
before
on
several
occasions
*punct* ,
but
have
always
drawn
blank
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
peering
out
eagerly
into
the
strange
clubroom
*punct* .
*break*
whom
do
you
expect
to
find
here
*punct* ?
*break*
it
is
a
recognized
meeting-place
*punct* ,
said
smith
in
my
ear
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
almost
a
certainty
that
some
of
the
fu-manchu
group
use
it
at
times
*punct* .
*break*
curiously
i
surveyed
all
these
faces
which
were
visible
from
the
spy-hole
*punct* .
*break*
my
eyes
rested
particularly
upon
the
two
chinamen
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
recognize
anyone
*punct* ?
*break*
smith
was
craning
his
neck
so
as
to
command
a
sight
of
the
doorway
*punct* .
*break*
he
obstructed
my
view
*punct* ,
and
only
by
his
tense
attitude
and
some
subtle
wave
of
excitement
which
he
communicated
to
me
did
i
know
that
a
new
arrival
was
entering
*punct* .
*break*
the
hum
of
conversation
died
away
*punct* ,
and
in
the
ensuing
silence
i
heard
the
rustle
of
draperies
*punct* .
*break*
the
newcomer
was
a
woman
*punct* ,
then
*punct* .
*break*
fearful
of
making
any
noise
i
yet
managed
to
get
my
eyes
to
the
level
of
the
shutter
*punct* .
*break*
a
woman
in
an
elegant
*punct* ,
flame-colored
opera
cloak
was
crossing
the
floor
and
coming
in
the
direction
of
the
spot
where
we
were
concealed
*punct* .
*break*
she
wore
a
soft
silk
scarf
about
her
head
*punct* ,
a
fold
partly
draped
across
her
face
*punct* .
*break*
a
momentary
view
i
had
of
her
*punct* ,
and
wildly
incongruous
she
looked
in
that
place
*punct* ,
and
she
had
disappeared
from
sight
*punct* ,
having
approached
someone
invisible
who
sat
upon
the
divan
immediately
beneath
our
point
of
vantage
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
way
in
which
the
company
gazed
towards
her
*punct* ,
i
divined
that
she
was
no
habitue
of
the
place
*punct* ,
but
that
her
presence
there
was
as
greatly
surprising
to
those
in
the
room
as
it
was
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
whom
could
she
be
*punct* ,
this
elegant
lady
who
visited
such
a
haunt
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
it
would
seem
*punct* ,
was
so
anxious
to
disguise
her
identity
*punct* ,
but
who
was
dressed
for
a
society
function
rather
than
for
a
midnight
expedition
of
so
unusual
a
character
*punct* ?
*break*
i
began
a
whispered
question
*punct* ,
but
smith
tugged
at
my
arm
to
silence
me
*punct* .
*break*
his
excitement
was
intense
*punct* .
*break*
had
his
keener
powers
enabled
him
to
recognize
the
unknown
*punct* ?
*break*
a
faint
but
most
peculiar
perfume
stole
to
my
nostrils
*punct* ,
a
perfume
which
seemed
to
contain
the
very
soul
of
eastern
mystery
*punct* .
*break*
only
one
woman
known
to
me
used
that
perfume
*punct* ,
karamaneh
*punct* .
*break*
then
it
was
she
*punct* !
*break*
at
last
my
friend's
vigilance
had
been
rewarded
*punct* .
*break*
eagerly
i
bent
forward
*punct* .
*break*
smith
literally
quivered
in
anticipation
of
a
discovery
*punct* .
*break*
again
the
strange
perfume
was
wafted
to
our
hiding-place
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
glancing
neither
to
right
nor
left
*punct* ,
i
saw
karamaneh
*punct* ,
for
that
it
was
she
i
no
longer
doubted
*punct* ,
recross
the
room
and
disappear
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
she
spoke
to
*punct* ,
hissed
smith
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
see
him
*punct* !
*break*
we
must
have
him
*punct* !
*break*
he
pulled
the
mat
aside
and
stepped
out
into
the
anteroom
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
empty
*punct* .
*break*
down
the
passage
he
led
*punct* ,
and
we
were
almost
come
to
the
door
of
the
big
room
when
it
was
thrown
open
and
a
man
came
rapidly
out
*punct* ,
opened
the
street
door
before
smith
could
reach
him
*punct* ,
and
was
gone
*punct* ,
slamming
it
fast
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
swear
that
we
were
not
four
seconds
behind
him
*punct* ,
but
when
we
gained
the
street
it
was
empty
*punct* .
*break*
our
quarry
had
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
*punct* .
*break*
a
big
car
was
just
turning
the
corner
towards
leicester
square
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
the
girl
*punct* ,
rapped
smith
*punct* ;
but
where
in
heaven's
name
is
the
man
to
whom
she
brought
the
message
*punct* ?
*break*
i
would
give
a
hundred
pounds
to
know
what
business
is
afoot
*punct* .
*break*
to
think
that
we
have
had
such
an
opportunity
and
have
thrown
it
away
*punct* !
*break*
angry
and
nonplused
he
stood
at
the
corner
*punct* ,
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
crowded
thoroughfare
into
which
the
car
had
been
driven
*punct* ,
tugging
at
the
lobe
of
his
ear
*punct* ,
as
was
his
habit
in
such
moments
of
perplexity
*punct* ,
and
sharply
clicking
his
teeth
together
*punct* .
*break*
i
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
was
very
thoughtful
*punct* .
*break*
clews
were
few
enough
in
those
days
of
our
war
with
that
giant
antagonist
*punct* .
*break*
the
mere
thought
that
our
trifling
error
of
judgment
tonight
in
tarrying
a
moment
too
long
might
mean
the
victory
of
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
might
mean
the
turning
of
the
balance
which
a
wise
providence
had
adjusted
between
the
white
and
yellow
races
*punct* ,
was
appalling
*punct* .
*break*
to
smith
and
me
*punct* ,
who
knew
something
of
the
secret
influences
at
work
to
overthrow
the
indian
empire
*punct* ,
to
place
*punct* ,
it
might
be
*punct* ,
the
whole
of
europe
and
america
beneath
an
eastern
rule
*punct* ,
it
seemed
that
a
great
yellow
hand
was
stretched
out
over
london
*punct* .
*break*
doctor
fu-manchu
was
a
menace
to
the
civilized
world
*punct* .
*break*
yet
his
very
existence
remained
unsuspected
by
the
millions
whose
fate
he
sought
to
command
*punct* .
*break*
into
what
dark
scheme
have
we
had
a
glimpse
*punct* ?
*break*
what
state
secret
is
to
be
filched
*punct* ?
*break*
what
faithful
servant
of
the
british
raj
to
be
spirited
away
*punct* ?
*break*
upon
whom
now
has
fu-manchu
set
his
death
seal
*punct* ?
*break*
karamaneh
on
this
occasion
may
not
have
been
acting
as
an
emissary
of
the
doctor's
*punct* .
*break*
i
feel
assured
that
she
was
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
of
the
many
whom
this
yellow
cloud
may
at
any
moment
envelop
*punct* ,
to
which
one
did
her
message
refer
*punct* ?
*break*
the
man's
instructions
were
urgent
*punct* .
*break*
witness
his
hasty
departure
*punct* .
*break*
he
dashed
his
right
clenched
fist
into
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
had
a
glimpse
of
his
face
*punct* ,
first
to
last
*punct* .
*break*
to
think
of
the
hours
i
have
spent
in
that
place
*punct* ,
in
anticipation
of
just
such
a
meeting
*punct* ,
only
to
bungle
the
opportunity
when
it
arose
*punct* !
*break*
scarce
heeding
what
course
we
followed
*punct* ,
we
had
come
now
to
piccadilly
circus
*punct* ,
and
had
walked
out
into
the
heart
of
the
night's
traffic
*punct* .
*break*
i
just
dragged
smith
aside
in
time
to
save
him
from
the
off-front
wheel
of
a
big
mercedes
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
traffic
was
blocked
*punct* ,
and
we
found
ourselves
dangerously
penned
in
amidst
the
press
of
vehicles
*punct* .
*break*
somehow
we
extricated
ourselves
*punct* ,
jeered
at
by
taxi-drivers
*punct* ,
who
naturally
took
us
for
two
simple
oriental
visitors
*punct* ,
and
just
before
that
impassable
barrier
the
arm
of
a
london
policeman
was
lowered
and
the
stream
moved
on
a
faint
breath
of
perfume
became
perceptible
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
the
cabs
and
cars
about
us
were
actually
beginning
to
move
again
*punct* ,
and
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
a
hasty
retreat
to
the
curb
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
pause
to
glance
behind
*punct* ,
but
instinctively
i
knew
that
someone
*punct* ,
someone
who
used
that
rare
*punct* ,
fragrant
essence
*punct* ,
was
leaning
from
the
window
of
the
car
*punct* .
*break*
andaman
*punct* ,
second
*punct* !
*break*
floated
a
soft
whisper
*punct* .
*break*
we
gained
the
pavement
as
the
pent-up
traffic
roared
upon
its
way
*punct* .
*break*
smith
had
not
noticed
the
perfume
worn
by
the
unseen
occupant
of
the
car
*punct* ,
had
not
detected
the
whispered
words
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
had
no
reason
to
doubt
my
senses
*punct* ,
and
i
knew
beyond
question
that
fu-manchu's
lovely
slave
*punct* ,
karamaneh
*punct* ,
had
been
within
a
yard
of
us
*punct* ,
had
recognized
us
*punct* ,
and
had
uttered
those
words
for
our
guidance
*punct* .
*break*
on
regaining
my
rooms
*punct* ,
we
devoted
a
whole
hour
to
considering
what
andaman
*punct* ,
second
could
possibly
mean
*punct* .
*break*
hang
it
all
*punct* !
*break*
cried
smith
*punct* ,
it
might
mean
anything
*punct* ,
the
result
of
a
race
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* .
*break*
he
burst
into
one
of
his
rare
laughs
*punct* ,
and
began
to
stuff
broadcut
mixture
into
his
briar
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
see
that
he
had
no
intention
of
turning
in
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
think
of
no
one
*punct* ,
no
one
of
note
*punct* ,
in
london
at
present
upon
whom
it
is
likely
that
fu-manchu
would
make
an
attempt
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
except
ourselves
*punct* .
*break*
we
began
methodically
to
go
through
the
long
list
of
names
which
we
had
compiled
and
to
review
our
elaborate
notes
*punct* .
*break*
when
*punct* ,
at
last
*punct* ,
i
turned
in
*punct* ,
the
night
had
given
place
to
a
new
day
*punct* .
*break*
but
sleep
evaded
me
*punct* ,
and
andaman
*punct* ,
second
danced
like
a
mocking
phantom
through
my
brain
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
heard
the
telephone
bell
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
smith
speaking
*punct* .
*break*
a
minute
afterwards
he
was
in
my
room
*punct* ,
his
face
very
grim
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
as
well
as
if
i'd
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
that
some
black
business
was
afoot
last
night
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
was
*punct* .
*break*
within
pistol-shot
of
us
*punct* !
*break*
someone
has
got
at
frank
norris
west
*punct* .
*break*
inspector
weymouth
has
just
been
on
the
phone
*punct* .
*break*
i
cried
*punct* ,
the
american
aviator
*punct* ,
and
inventor
*punct* ,
of
the
west
aero-torpedo
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* .
*break*
he's
been
offering
it
to
the
english
war
office
*punct* ,
and
they
have
delayed
too
long
*punct* .
*break*
i
got
out
of
bed
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
i
mean
that
the
potentialities
have
attracted
the
attention
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
those
words
operated
electrically
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
was
in
dressing
*punct* ,
how
long
a
time
elapsed
ere
the
cab
for
which
smith
had
phoned
arrived
*punct* ,
how
many
precious
minutes
were
lost
upon
the
journey
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
in
a
nervous
whirl
*punct* ,
these
things
slipped
into
the
past
*punct* ,
like
the
telegraph
poles
seen
from
the
window
of
an
express
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
still
in
that
tense
state
*punct* ,
we
came
upon
the
scene
of
this
newest
outrage
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
norris
west
*punct* ,
whose
lean
*punct* ,
stoic
face
had
latterly
figured
so
often
in
the
daily
press
*punct* ,
lay
upon
the
floor
in
the
little
entrance
hall
of
his
chambers
*punct* ,
flat
upon
his
back
*punct* ,
with
the
telephone
receiver
in
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
the
outer
door
had
been
forced
by
the
police
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
had
to
remove
a
piece
of
the
paneling
to
get
at
the
bolt
*punct* .
*break*
a
medical
man
was
leaning
over
the
recumbent
figure
in
the
striped
pajama
suit
*punct* ,
and
detective-inspector
weymouth
stood
watching
him
as
smith
and
i
entered
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
been
heavily
drugged
*punct* ,
said
the
doctor
*punct* ,
sniffing
at
west's
lips
*punct* ,
but
i
cannot
say
what
drug
has
been
used
*punct* .
*break*
it
isn't
chloroform
or
anything
of
that
nature
*punct* .
*break*
he
can
safely
be
left
to
sleep
it
off
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* .
*break*
i
agreed
*punct* ,
after
a
brief
examination
*punct* .
*break*
it's
most
extraordinary
*punct* ,
said
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
he
rang
up
the
yard
about
an
hour
ago
and
said
his
chambers
had
been
invaded
by
chinamen
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
man
at
the
phone
plainly
heard
him
fall
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
got
here
his
front
door
was
bolted
*punct* ,
as
you've
seen
*punct* ,
and
the
windows
are
three
floors
up
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
is
disturbed
*punct* .
*break*
the
plans
of
the
aero-torpedo
*punct* ?
*break*
i
take
it
they
are
in
the
safe
in
his
bedroom
*punct* ,
replied
the
detective
*punct* ,
and
that
is
locked
all
right
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
he
must
have
taken
an
overdose
of
something
and
had
illusions
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
case
there
was
anything
in
what
he
mumbled
*punct* ,
you
could
hardly
understand
him
*punct* ,
i
thought
it
as
well
to
send
for
you
*punct* .
*break*
quite
right
*punct* ,
said
smith
rapidly
*punct* .
*break*
his
eyes
shone
like
steel
*punct* .
*break*
lay
him
on
the
bed
*punct* ,
inspector
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
done
*punct* ,
and
my
friend
walked
into
the
bedroom
*punct* .
*break*
save
that
the
bed
was
disordered
*punct* ,
showing
that
west
had
been
sleeping
in
it
*punct* ,
there
were
no
evidences
of
the
extraordinary
invasion
mentioned
by
the
drugged
man
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
small
room
*punct* ,
the
chambers
were
of
that
kind
which
are
let
furnished
*punct* ,
and
very
neat
*punct* .
*break*
a
safe
with
a
combination
lock
stood
in
a
corner
*punct* .
*break*
the
window
was
open
about
a
foot
at
the
top
*punct* .
*break*
smith
tried
the
safe
and
found
it
fast
*punct* .
*break*
he
stood
for
a
moment
clicking
his
teeth
together
*punct* ,
by
which
i
knew
him
to
be
perplexed
*punct* .
*break*
he
walked
over
to
the
window
and
threw
it
up
*punct* .
*break*
we
both
looked
out
*punct* .
*break*
you
see
*punct* ,
came
weymouth's
voice
*punct* ,
it
is
altogether
too
far
from
the
court
below
for
our
cunning
chinese
friends
to
have
fixed
a
ladder
with
one
of
their
bamboo
rod
arrangements
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
even
if
they
could
get
up
there
*punct* ,
it's
too
far
down
from
the
roof
*punct* ,
two
more
stories
*punct* ,
for
them
to
have
fixed
it
from
there
*punct* .
*break*
smith
nodded
thoughtfully
*punct* ,
at
the
same
time
trying
the
strength
of
an
iron
bar
which
ran
from
side
to
side
of
the
window-sill
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
he
stooped
*punct* ,
with
a
sharp
exclamation
*punct* .
*break*
bending
over
his
shoulder
i
saw
what
it
was
that
had
attracted
his
attention
*punct* .
*break*
clearly
imprinted
upon
the
dust-coated
gray
stone
of
the
sill
was
a
confused
series
of
marks
*punct* ,
tracks
call
them
what
you
will
*punct* .
*break*
smith
straightened
himself
and
turned
a
wondering
look
upon
me
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
it
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ?
*break*
he
said
amazedly
*punct* .
*break*
some
kind
of
bird
has
been
here
*punct* ,
and
recently
*punct* .
*break*
inspector
weymouth
in
turn
examined
the
marks
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
saw
bird
tracks
like
these
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
he
muttered
*punct* .
*break*
smith
was
tugging
at
the
lobe
of
his
ear
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
he
returned
reflectively
*punct* ;
come
to
think
of
it
*punct* ,
neither
did
i
*punct* .
*break*
he
twisted
around
*punct* ,
looking
at
the
man
on
the
bed
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
think
it
was
all
an
illusion
*punct* ?
*break*
asked
the
detective
*punct* .
*break*
what
about
those
marks
on
the
window-sill
*punct* ?
*break*
he
began
restlessly
pacing
about
the
room
*punct* ,
sometimes
stopping
before
the
locked
safe
and
frequently
glancing
at
norris
west
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
he
walked
out
and
briefly
examined
the
other
apartments
*punct* ,
only
to
return
again
to
the
bedroom
*punct* .
*break*
petrie
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
we
are
losing
valuable
time
*punct* .
*break*
west
must
be
aroused
*punct* .
*break*
inspector
weymouth
stared
*punct* .
*break*
smith
turned
to
me
impatiently
*punct* .
*break*
the
doctor
summoned
by
the
police
had
gone
*punct* .
*break*
is
there
no
means
of
arousing
him
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ?
*break*
doubtless
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* ,
he
could
be
revived
if
one
but
knew
what
drug
he
had
taken
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend
began
his
restless
pacing
again
*punct* ,
and
suddenly
pounced
upon
a
little
phial
of
tabloids
which
had
been
hidden
behind
some
books
on
a
shelf
near
the
bed
*punct* .
*break*
he
uttered
a
triumphant
exclamation
*punct* .
*break*
see
what
we
have
here
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
he
directed
*punct* ,
handing
the
phial
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
bears
no
label
*punct* .
*break*
i
crushed
one
of
the
tabloids
in
my
palm
and
applied
my
tongue
to
the
powder
*punct* .
*break*
some
preparation
of
chloral
hydrate
*punct* ,
i
pronounced
*punct* .
*break*
a
sleeping
draught
*punct* ?
*break*
suggested
smith
eagerly
*punct* .
*break*
we
might
try
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
and
scribbled
a
formula
upon
a
leaf
of
my
notebook
*punct* .
*break*
i
asked
weymouth
to
send
the
man
who
accompanied
him
to
call
up
the
nearest
chemist
and
procure
the
antidote
*punct* .
*break*
during
the
man's
absence
smith
stood
contemplating
the
unconscious
inventor
*punct* ,
a
peculiar
expression
upon
his
bronzed
face
*punct* .
*break*
andaman
*punct* ,
second
*punct* ,
he
muttered
*punct* .
*break*
shall
we
find
the
key
to
the
riddle
here
*punct* ,
i
wonder
*punct* ?
*break*
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ,
who
had
concluded
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
that
the
mysterious
telephone
call
was
due
to
mental
aberration
on
the
part
of
norris
west
*punct* ,
was
gnawing
at
his
mustache
impatiently
when
his
assistant
returned
*punct* .
*break*
i
administered
the
powerful
restorative
*punct* ,
and
although
*punct* ,
as
later
transpired
*punct* ,
chloral
was
not
responsible
for
west's
condition
*punct* ,
the
antidote
operated
successfully
*punct* .
*break*
norris
west
struggled
into
a
sitting
position
*punct* ,
and
looked
about
him
with
haggard
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
he
sprang
to
his
feet
*punct* ,
glaring
wildly
at
smith
and
me
*punct* ,
reeled
*punct* ,
and
almost
fell
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
all
right
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
supporting
him
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
a
doctor
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
been
unwell
*punct* .
*break*
have
the
police
come
*punct* ?
*break*
he
burst
out
*punct* .
*break*
the
safe
*punct* ,
try
the
safe
*punct* !
*break*
it's
all
right
*punct* ,
said
inspector
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
the
safe
is
locked
*punct* ,
unless
someone
else
knows
the
combination
*punct* ,
there's
nothing
to
worry
about
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
else
knows
it
*punct* ,
said
west
*punct* ,
and
staggered
unsteadily
to
the
safe
*punct* .
*break*
clearly
his
mind
was
in
a
dazed
condition
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
setting
his
jaw
with
a
curious
expression
of
grim
determination
*punct* ,
he
collected
his
thoughts
and
opened
the
safe
*punct* .
*break*
he
bent
down
*punct* ,
looking
in
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
way
the
knowledge
came
to
me
that
the
curtain
was
about
to
rise
on
a
new
and
surprising
act
in
the
fu-manchu
drama
*punct* .
*break*
he
whispered
*punct* ,
we
could
scarcely
hear
him
*punct* ,
the
plans
are
gone
*punct* !
*break*
i
have
never
seen
a
man
quite
so
surprised
as
inspector
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
absolutely
incredible
*punct* !
*break*
there's
only
one
door
to
your
chambers
*punct* .
*break*
we
found
it
bolted
from
the
inside
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
groaned
west
*punct* ,
pressing
his
hand
to
his
forehead
*punct* .
*break*
i
bolted
it
myself
at
eleven
o'clock
*punct* ,
when
i
came
in
*punct* .
*break*
no
human
being
could
climb
up
or
down
to
your
windows
*punct* .
*break*
the
plans
of
the
aero-torpedo
were
inside
a
safe
*punct* .
*break*
i
put
them
there
myself
*punct* ,
said
west
*punct* ,
on
returning
from
the
war
office
*punct* ,
and
i
had
occasion
to
consult
them
after
i
had
come
in
and
bolted
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
i
returned
them
to
the
safe
and
locked
it
*punct* .
*break*
that
it
was
still
locked
you
saw
for
yourselves
*punct* ,
and
no
one
else
in
the
world
knows
the
combination
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
plans
have
gone
*punct* ,
said
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
how
was
it
done
*punct* ?
*break*
what
happened
last
night
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
what
did
you
mean
when
you
rang
us
up
*punct* ?
*break*
smith
during
this
colloquy
was
pacing
rapidly
up
and
down
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
aviator
*punct* .
*break*
every
fact
you
can
remember
*punct* ,
mr.
west
*punct* ,
please
*punct* ,
he
said
tersely
*punct* ;
and
be
as
brief
as
you
possibly
can
*punct* .
*break*
i
came
in
*punct* ,
as
i
said
*punct* ,
explained
west
about
eleven
o'clock
and
having
made
some
notes
relating
to
an
interview
arranged
for
this
morning
*punct* ,
i
locked
the
plans
in
the
safe
and
turned
in
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
one
hidden
anywhere
in
your
chambers
*punct* ?
*break*
there
was
not
*punct* ,
replied
west
*punct* .
*break*
i
invariably
do
*punct* .
*break*
almost
immediately
*punct* ,
i
went
to
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
how
many
chloral
tabloids
did
you
take
*punct* ?
*break*
norris
west
turned
to
me
with
a
slow
smile
*punct* .
*break*
you're
cute
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
i
took
two
*punct* .
*break*
it's
a
bad
habit
*punct* ,
but
i
can't
sleep
without
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
specially
made
up
for
me
by
a
firm
in
philadelphia
*punct* .
*break*
how
long
sleep
lasted
*punct* ,
when
it
became
filled
with
uncanny
dreams
*punct* ,
and
when
those
dreams
merged
into
reality
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
*punct* ,
shall
never
know
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* .
*break*
but
out
of
the
dreamless
void
a
face
came
to
me
*punct* ,
closer
*punct* ,
closer
*punct* ,
and
peered
into
mine
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
in
that
curious
condition
wherein
one
knows
that
one
is
dreaming
and
seeks
to
awaken
*punct* ,
to
escape
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
nightmare-like
oppression
held
me
*punct* .
*break*
so
i
must
lie
and
gaze
into
the
seared
yellow
face
that
hung
over
me
*punct* ,
for
it
would
drop
so
close
that
i
could
trace
the
cicatrized
scar
running
from
the
left
ear
to
the
corner
of
the
mouth
*punct* ,
and
drawing
up
the
lip
like
the
lip
of
a
snarling
cur
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
look
into
the
malignant
*punct* ,
jaundiced
eyes
*punct* ;
i
could
hear
the
dim
whispering
of
the
distorted
mouth
*punct* ,
whispering
that
seemed
to
counsel
something
*punct* ,
something
evil
*punct* .
*break*
that
whispering
intimacy
was
indescribably
repulsive
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
wicked
yellow
face
would
be
withdrawn
*punct* ,
and
would
recede
until
it
became
as
a
pin's
head
in
the
darkness
far
above
me
*punct* ,
almost
like
a
glutinous
*punct* ,
liquid
thing
*punct* .
*break*
somehow
i
got
upon
my
feet
*punct* ,
or
dreamed
i
did
*punct* ,
god
knows
where
dreaming
ended
and
reality
began
*punct* .
*break*
gentlemen
maybe
you'll
conclude
i
went
mad
last
night
*punct* ,
but
as
i
stood
holding
on
to
the
bedrail
i
heard
the
blood
throbbing
through
my
arteries
with
a
noise
like
a
screw-propeller
*punct* .
*break*
i
started
laughing
*punct* .
*break*
the
laughter
issued
from
my
lips
with
a
shrill
whistling
sound
that
pierced
me
with
physical
pain
and
seemed
to
wake
the
echoes
of
the
whole
block
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
myself
i
was
going
mad
*punct* ,
and
i
tried
to
command
my
will
*punct* ,
to
break
the
power
of
the
chloral
*punct* ,
for
i
concluded
that
i
had
accidentally
taken
an
overdose
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
walls
of
my
bedroom
started
to
recede
*punct* ,
till
at
last
i
stood
holding
on
to
a
bed
which
had
shrunk
to
the
size
of
a
doll's
cot
*punct* ,
in
the
middle
of
a
room
like
trafalgar
square
*punct* !
*break*
that
window
yonder
was
such
a
long
way
off
i
could
scarcely
see
it
*punct* ,
but
i
could
just
defect
a
chinaman
*punct* ,
the
owner
of
the
evil
yellow
face
*punct* ,
creeping
through
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
followed
by
another
*punct* ,
who
was
enormously
tall
*punct* ,
so
tall
that
*punct* ,
as
they
came
towards
me
*punct* ,
and
it
seemed
to
take
them
something
like
half-an-hour
to
cross
this
incredible
apartment
in
my
dream
*punct* ,
the
second
chinaman
seemed
to
tower
over
me
like
a
cypress-tree
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
up
to
his
face
*punct* ,
his
wicked
*punct* ,
hairless
face
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
whatever
age
i
live
to
*punct* ,
i'll
never
forget
that
face
i
saw
last
night
*punct* ,
or
did
i
see
it
*punct* ?
*break*
the
pointed
chin
*punct* ,
the
great
dome
of
a
forehead
*punct* ,
and
the
eyes
*punct* ,
heavens
above
*punct* ,
the
huge
green
eyes
*punct* !
*break*
he
shook
like
a
sick
man
*punct* ,
and
i
glanced
at
smith
significantly
*punct* .
*break*
inspector
weymouth
was
stroking
his
mustache
*punct* ,
and
his
mingled
expression
of
incredulity
and
curiosity
was
singular
to
behold
*punct* .
*break*
the
pumping
of
my
blood
*punct* ,
continued
west
*punct* ,
seemed
to
be
bursting
my
body
*punct* ;
the
room
kept
expanding
and
contracting
*punct* .
*break*
one
time
the
ceiling
would
be
pressing
down
on
my
head
*punct* ,
and
the
chinamen
*punct* ,
sometimes
i
thought
there
were
two
of
them
*punct* ,
sometimes
twenty
*punct* ,
became
dwarfs
*punct* ;
the
next
instant
it
shot
up
like
the
roof
of
a
cathedral
*punct* .
*break*
can
i
be
awake
*punct* ,
i
whispered
*punct* ,
or
am
i
dreaming
*punct* ?
*break*
my
whisper
went
sweeping
in
windy
echoes
about
the
walls
*punct* ,
and
was
lost
in
the
shadowy
distances
up
under
the
invisible
roof
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
dreaming
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
chinaman
with
the
green
eyes
who
was
addressing
me
*punct* ,
and
the
words
that
he
uttered
appeared
to
occupy
an
immeasurable
time
in
the
utterance
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
will
i
can
render
the
subjective
objective
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
think
i
can
have
dreamed
those
singular
words
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
he
fixed
the
green
eyes
upon
me
*punct* ,
the
blazing
green
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
i
made
no
attempt
to
move
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
to
be
draining
me
of
something
vital
*punct* ,
bleeding
me
of
every
drop
of
mental
power
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
nightmare
room
grew
green
*punct* ,
and
i
felt
that
i
was
being
absorbed
into
its
greenness
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
see
what
you
think
*punct* .
*break*
and
even
in
my
delirium
*punct* ,
if
it
was
delirium
*punct* ,
i
thought
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
now
comes
the
climax
of
my
experience
*punct* ,
my
vision
*punct* ,
i
don't
know
what
to
call
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
some
words
issuing
from
my
own
mouth
*punct* !
*break*
inspector
weymouth
coughed
discreetly
*punct* .
*break*
smith
whisked
round
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
this
will
be
outside
your
experience
*punct* ,
inspector
*punct* ,
i
know
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
but
mr.
norris
west's
statement
does
not
surprise
me
in
the
least
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
to
what
the
experience
was
due
*punct* .
*break*
weymouth
stared
incredulously
*punct* ,
but
a
dawning
perception
of
the
truth
was
come
to
me
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
how
i
saw
a
sound
i
just
won't
attempt
to
explain
*punct* ;
i
simply
tell
you
i
saw
it
*punct* .
*break*
somehow
i
knew
i
had
betrayed
myself
*punct* ,
given
something
away
*punct* .
*break*
you
gave
away
the
secret
of
the
lock
combination
*punct* !
*break*
but
west
went
on
hoarsely
*punct* :
just
before
the
blank
came
a
name
flashed
before
my
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
bayard
taylor
*punct* .
*break*
at
that
i
interrupted
west
*punct* .
*break*
another
name
has
just
occurred
to
me
*punct* ,
mr.
west
*punct* ,
that
of
the
frenchman
*punct* ,
moreau
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
solved
the
mystery
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
natural
mr.
west
should
have
thought
of
the
american
traveler
*punct* ,
bayard
taylor
*punct* ,
though
*punct* .
*break*
moreau's
book
is
purely
scientific
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
probably
never
read
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
fought
with
the
stupor
that
was
overcoming
me
*punct* ,
continued
west
*punct* ,
striving
to
associate
that
vaguely
familiar
name
with
the
fantastic
things
through
which
i
moved
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
room
was
empty
again
*punct* .
*break*
i
made
for
the
hall
*punct* ,
for
the
telephone
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
scarcely
drag
my
feet
along
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
to
take
me
half-an-hour
to
get
there
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
calling
up
scotland
yard
*punct* ,
and
i
remember
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
short
*punct* ,
tense
interval
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
respects
i
was
nonplused
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
frankly
*punct* ,
i
think
inspector
weymouth
considered
west
insane
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
his
hands
locked
behind
his
back
*punct* ,
stared
out
of
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
andaman
*punct* ,
second
he
said
suddenly
*punct* .
*break*
weymouth
*punct* ,
when
is
the
first
train
to
tilbury
*punct* ?
*break*
five
twenty-two
from
fenchurch
street
*punct* ,
replied
the
scotland
yard
man
promptly
*punct* .
*break*
rapped
my
friend
*punct* .
*break*
jump
in
a
taxi
and
pick
up
two
good
men
to
leave
for
china
at
once
*punct* !
*break*
then
go
and
charter
a
special
to
tilbury
to
leave
in
twenty-five
minutes
*punct* .
*break*
order
another
cab
to
wait
outside
for
me
*punct* .
*break*
weymouth
was
palpably
amazed
*punct* ,
but
smith's
tone
was
imperative
*punct* .
*break*
the
inspector
departed
hastily
*punct* .
*break*
i
stared
at
smith
*punct* ,
not
comprehending
what
prompted
this
singular
course
*punct* .
*break*
now
that
you
can
think
clearly
*punct* ,
mr.
west
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
of
what
does
your
experience
remind
you
*punct* ?
*break*
the
errors
of
perception
regarding
time
*punct* ;
the
idea
of
seeing
a
sound
*punct* ;
the
illusion
that
the
room
alternately
increased
and
diminished
in
size
*punct* ;
your
fit
of
laughter
*punct* ,
and
the
recollection
of
the
name
bayard
taylor
*punct* .
*break*
since
evidently
you
are
familiar
with
that
author's
work
*punct* ,
the
land
of
the
saracen
*punct* ,
is
it
not?
*punct* ,
these
symptoms
of
the
attack
should
be
familiar
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* .
*break*
norris
west
pressed
his
hands
to
his
evidently
aching
head
*punct* .
*break*
bayard
taylor's
book
*punct* ,
he
said
dully
*punct* .
*break*
yes!
*punct* ...
i
know
of
what
my
brain
sought
to
remind
me
*punct* ,
taylor's
account
of
his
experience
under
hashish
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
someone
doped
me
with
hashish
*punct* !
*break*
smith
nodded
grimly
*punct* .
*break*
cannabis
indica
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
indian
hemp
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
what
you
were
drugged
with
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
doubt
that
now
you
experience
a
feeling
of
nausea
and
intense
thirst
*punct* ,
with
aching
in
the
muscles
*punct* ,
particularly
the
deltoid
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
you
must
have
taken
at
least
fifteen
grains
*punct* .
*break*
smith
stopped
his
perambulations
immediately
in
front
of
west
*punct* ,
looking
into
his
dulled
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
someone
visited
your
chambers
last
night
*punct* ,
he
said
slowly
*punct* ,
and
for
your
chloral
tabloids
substituted
some
containing
hashish
*punct* ,
or
perhaps
not
pure
hashish
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
is
a
profound
chemist
*punct* .
*break*
norris
west
started
*punct* .
*break*
someone
substituted
*punct* ,
he
began
*punct* .
*break*
exactly
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* ,
looking
at
him
keenly
*punct* ;
someone
who
was
here
yesterday
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
any
idea
whom
it
could
have
been
*punct* ?
*break*
i
had
a
visitor
in
the
afternoon
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
seemingly
speaking
the
words
unwillingly
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
a
lady
*punct* ?
*break*
i
suggest
that
it
was
a
lady
*punct* .
*break*
you're
quite
right
*punct* ,
he
admitted
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
how
you
arrived
at
the
conclusion
*punct* ,
but
a
lady
whose
acquaintance
i
made
recently
*punct* ,
a
foreign
lady
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
in
the
least
*punct* ,
but
she
came
here
*punct* ,
knowing
this
to
be
my
present
address
*punct* ,
to
ask
me
to
protect
her
from
a
mysterious
man
who
had
followed
her
right
from
charing
cross
*punct* .
*break*
she
said
he
was
down
in
the
lobby
*punct* ,
and
naturally
*punct* ,
i
asked
her
to
wait
here
whilst
i
went
and
sent
him
about
his
business
*punct* .
*break*
he
laughed
shortly
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
over-old
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
to
be
guyed
by
a
woman
*punct* .
*break*
you
spoke
just
now
of
someone
called
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
is
that
the
crook
i'm
indebted
to
for
the
loss
of
my
plans
*punct* ?
*break*
i've
had
attempts
made
by
agents
of
two
european
governments
*punct* ,
but
a
chinaman
is
a
novelty
*punct* .
*break*
this
chinaman
*punct* ,
smith
assured
him
*punct* ,
is
the
greatest
novelty
of
his
age
*punct* .
*break*
you
recognize
your
symptoms
now
from
bayard
taylors
account
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
west's
statement
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
ran
closely
parallel
with
portions
of
moreau's
book
on
hashish
hallucinations
*punct* .
*break*
only
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
would
have
thought
of
employing
indian
hemp
*punct* .
*break*
i
doubt
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
if
it
was
pure
cannabis
indica
*punct* .
*break*
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
it
acted
as
an
opiate
*punct* ,
and
drugged
mr.
west
*punct* ,
interrupted
smith
*punct* ,
sufficiently
to
enable
fu-manchu
to
enter
unobserved
*punct* .
*break*
whilst
it
produced
symptoms
which
rendered
him
an
easy
subject
for
the
doctor's
influence
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
difficult
in
this
case
to
separate
hallucination
from
reality
*punct* ,
but
i
think
*punct* ,
mr.
west
*punct* ,
that
fu-manchu
must
have
exercised
an
hypnotic
influence
upon
your
drugged
brain
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
evidence
that
he
dragged
from
you
the
secret
of
the
combination
*punct* .
*break*
god
knows
we
have
*punct* !
*break*
but
who
is
this
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
and
how
*punct* ,
how
in
the
name
of
wonder
did
he
get
into
my
chambers
*punct* ?
*break*
smith
pulled
out
his
watch
*punct* .
*break*
that
*punct* ,
he
said
rapidly
*punct* ,
i
cannot
delay
to
explain
if
i'm
to
intercept
the
man
who
has
the
plans
*punct* .
*break*
come
along
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ;
we
must
be
at
tilbury
within
the
hour
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
just
a
bare
chance
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
with
my
mind
in
a
condition
of
unique
perplexity
that
i
hurried
with
nayland
smith
into
the
cab
which
waited
and
dashed
off
through
the
streets
in
which
the
busy
life
of
london
just
stirred
into
being
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
i
need
not
say
that
i
could
penetrate
no
farther
into
this
*punct* ,
fu-manchu's
latest
plot
*punct* ,
than
the
drugging
of
norris
west
with
hashish
*punct* ?
*break*
of
his
having
been
so
drugged
with
indian
hemp
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
converted
temporarily
into
a
maniac
*punct* ,
would
have
been
evident
to
any
medical
man
who
had
heard
his
statement
and
noted
the
distressing
after-effects
which
conclusively
pointed
to
indian
hemp
poisoning
*punct* .
*break*
knowing
something
of
the
chinese
doctor's
powers
*punct* ,
i
could
understand
that
he
might
have
extracted
from
west
the
secret
of
the
combination
by
sheer
force
of
will
whilst
the
american
was
under
the
influence
of
the
drug
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
could
not
understand
how
fu-manchu
had
gained
access
to
locked
chambers
on
the
third
story
of
a
building
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
those
bird
tracks
on
the
window-sill
*punct* ,
they
furnish
the
key
to
a
mystery
which
is
puzzling
me
*punct* .
*break*
they
do
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* ,
glancing
impatiently
at
his
watch
*punct* .
*break*
consult
your
memories
of
dr.
fu-manchu's
habits
*punct* ,
especially
your
memories
of
his
pets
*punct* .
*break*
i
reviewed
in
my
mind
the
creatures
gruesome
and
terrible
which
surrounded
the
chinaman
*punct* ,
the
scorpions
*punct* ,
the
bacteria
*punct* ,
the
noxious
things
which
were
the
weapons
wherewith
he
visited
death
upon
whomsoever
opposed
the
establishment
of
a
potential
yellow
empire
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
one
of
them
could
account
for
the
imprints
upon
the
dust
of
west's
window-sill
*punct* .
*break*
you
puzzle
me
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ,
i
confessed
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
much
in
this
extraordinary
case
that
puzzles
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
think
of
nothing
to
account
for
the
marks
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
thought
of
fu-manchu's
marmoset
*punct* ?
*break*
they
were
the
footprints
of
a
small
ape
*punct* ,
my
friend
continued
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
i
was
deceived
as
you
were
*punct* ,
and
believed
them
to
be
the
tracks
of
a
large
bird
*punct* ;
but
i
have
seen
the
footprints
of
apes
before
now
*punct* ,
and
a
marmoset
*punct* ,
though
an
american
variety
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
is
not
unlike
some
of
the
apes
of
burma
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
still
in
the
dark
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
pure
hypothesis
*punct* ,
continued
smith
*punct* ,
but
here
is
the
theory
*punct* ,
in
lieu
of
a
better
one
it
covers
the
facts
*punct* .
*break*
the
marmoset
*punct* ,
and
it
is
contrary
from
the
character
of
fu-manchu
to
keep
any
creature
for
mere
amusement
*punct* ,
is
trained
to
perform
certain
duties
*punct* .
*break*
you
observed
the
waterspout
running
up
beside
the
window
*punct* ;
you
observed
the
iron
bar
intended
to
prevent
a
window-cleaner
from
falling
out
*punct* ?
*break*
for
an
ape
the
climb
from
the
court
below
to
the
sill
above
was
a
simple
one
*punct* .
*break*
he
carried
a
cord
*punct* ,
probably
attached
to
his
body
*punct* .
*break*
he
climbed
on
to
the
sill
*punct* ,
over
the
bar
*punct* ,
and
climbed
down
again
*punct* .
*break*
by
means
of
this
cord
a
rope
was
pulled
up
over
the
bar
*punct* ,
by
means
of
the
rope
one
of
those
ladders
of
silk
and
bamboo
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
the
doctor's
servants
ascended
*punct* ,
probably
to
ascertain
if
the
hashish
had
acted
successfully
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
the
yellow
dream-face
which
west
saw
bending
over
him
*punct* .
*break*
then
followed
the
doctor
*punct* ,
and
to
his
giant
will
the
drugged
brain
of
west
was
a
pliant
instrument
which
he
bent
to
his
own
ends
*punct* .
*break*
the
court
would
be
deserted
at
that
hour
of
the
night
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
any
event
*punct* ,
directly
after
the
ascent
the
ladder
probably
was
pulled
up
*punct* ,
only
to
be
lowered
again
when
west
had
revealed
the
secret
of
his
own
safe
and
fu-manchu
had
secured
the
plans
*punct* .
*break*
the
reclosing
of
the
safe
and
the
removing
of
the
hashish
tabloids
*punct* ,
leaving
no
clew
beyond
the
delirious
ravings
of
a
drug
slave
*punct* ,
for
so
anyone
unacquainted
with
the
east
must
have
construed
west's
story
*punct* ,
is
particularly
characteristic
*punct* .
*break*
his
own
tabloids
were
returned
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* .
*break*
the
sparing
of
his
life
alone
is
a
refinement
of
art
which
points
to
a
past
master
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
was
the
decoy
again
*punct* ?
*break*
i
said
shortly
*punct* .
*break*
hers
was
the
task
to
ascertain
west's
habits
and
to
substitute
the
tabloids
*punct* .
*break*
she
it
was
who
waited
in
the
luxurious
car
*punct* ,
infinitely
less
likely
to
attract
attention
at
that
hour
in
that
place
than
a
modest
taxi
*punct* ,
and
received
the
stolen
plans
*punct* .
*break*
she
did
her
work
well
*punct* .
*break*
poor
karamaneh
*punct* ;
she
had
no
alternative
*punct* !
*break*
i
said
i
would
have
given
a
hundred
pounds
for
a
sight
of
the
messenger's
face
*punct* ,
the
man
to
whom
she
handed
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
give
a
thousand
now
*punct* !
*break*
andaman
*punct* ,
second
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
what
did
she
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
then
it
has
not
dawned
upon
you
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
smith
excitedly
*punct* ,
as
the
cab
turned
into
the
station
*punct* .
*break*
the
andaman
*punct* ,
of
the
oriental
navigation
company's
line
*punct* ,
leaves
tilbury
with
the
next
tide
for
china
ports
*punct* .
*break*
our
man
is
a
second-class
passenger
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
wiring
to
delay
her
departure
*punct* ,
and
the
special
should
get
us
to
the
docks
inside
of
forty
minutes
*punct* .
*break*
very
vividly
i
can
reconstruct
in
my
mind
that
dash
to
the
docks
through
the
early
autumn
morning
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend
being
invested
with
extraordinary
powers
from
the
highest
authorities
*punct* ,
by
inspector
weymouth's
instructions
the
line
had
been
cleared
all
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
something
of
the
tremendous
importance
of
nayland
smith's
mission
came
home
to
me
as
we
hurried
on
to
the
platform
*punct* ,
escorted
by
the
station-master
*punct* ,
and
the
five
of
us
*punct* ,
for
weymouth
had
two
other
c.i.d
*punct* .
*break*
men
with
him
*punct* ,
took
our
seats
in
the
special
*punct* .
*break*
off
we
went
on
top
speed
*punct* ,
roaring
through
stations
*punct* ,
where
a
glimpse
might
be
had
of
wondering
officials
upon
the
platforms
*punct* ,
for
a
special
train
was
a
novelty
on
the
line
*punct* .
*break*
all
ordinary
traffic
arrangements
were
held
up
until
we
had
passed
through
*punct* ,
and
we
reached
tilbury
in
time
which
i
doubt
not
constituted
a
record
*punct* .
*break*
there
at
the
docks
was
the
great
liner
*punct* ,
delayed
in
her
passage
to
the
far
east
by
the
will
of
my
royally
empowered
companion
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
novel
*punct* ,
and
infinitely
exciting
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
commissioner
nayland
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
captain
interrogatively
*punct* ,
when
we
were
shown
into
his
room
*punct* ,
and
looked
from
one
to
another
and
back
to
the
telegraph
form
which
he
held
in
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
*punct* ,
captain
*punct* ,
said
my
friend
briskly
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
not
detain
you
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
instructing
the
authorities
at
all
ports
east
of
suez
to
apprehend
one
of
your
second-class
passengers
*punct* ,
should
he
leave
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
in
possession
of
plans
which
practically
belong
to
the
british
government
*punct* ?
*break*
why
not
arrest
him
now
*punct* ?
*break*
asked
the
seaman
bluntly
*punct* .
*break*
because
i
don't
know
him
*punct* .
*break*
all
second-class
passengers
baggage
will
be
searched
as
they
land
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
hoping
something
from
that
*punct* ,
if
all
else
fails
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
want
you
privately
to
instruct
your
stewards
to
watch
any
passenger
of
oriental
nationality
*punct* ,
and
to
cooperate
with
the
two
scotland
yard
men
who
are
joining
you
for
the
voyage
*punct* .
*break*
i
look
to
you
to
recover
these
plans
*punct* ,
captain
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
do
my
best
*punct* ,
the
captain
assured
him
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
from
amid
the
heterogeneous
group
on
the
dockside
*punct* ,
we
were
watching
the
liner
depart
*punct* ,
and
nayland
smith's
expression
was
a
very
singular
one
*punct* .
*break*
inspector
weymouth
stood
with
us
*punct* ,
a
badly
puzzled
man
*punct* .
*break*
then
occurred
the
extraordinary
incident
which
to
this
day
remains
inexplicable
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
clearly
heard
by
all
three
of
us
*punct* ,
a
guttural
voice
said
*punct* :
another
victory
for
china
*punct* ,
mr.
nayland
smith
*punct* !
*break*
i
turned
as
though
i
had
been
stung
*punct* .
*break*
smith
turned
also
*punct* .
*break*
my
eyes
passed
from
face
to
face
of
the
group
about
us
*punct* .
*break*
none
was
familiar
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
apparently
had
moved
away
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
doctor
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
write
of
it
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
i
can
appreciate
the
difference
between
that
happening
*punct* ,
as
it
appealed
to
us
*punct* ,
and
as
it
must
appeal
to
you
who
merely
read
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
beyond
my
powers
to
convey
the
sense
of
the
uncanny
which
the
episode
created
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
even
as
i
think
of
it
*punct* ,
i
feel
again
*punct* ,
though
in
lesser
degree
*punct* ,
the
chill
which
seemed
to
creep
through
my
veins
that
day
*punct* .
*break*
from
my
brief
history
of
the
wonderful
and
evil
man
who
once
walked
*punct* ,
by
the
way
unsuspected
*punct* ,
in
the
midst
of
the
people
of
england
*punct* ,
near
whom
you
*punct* ,
personally
*punct* ,
may
at
some
time
unwittingly
*punct* ,
have
been
*punct* ,
i
am
aware
that
much
must
be
omitted
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
space
for
lengthy
examinations
of
the
many
points
but
ill
illuminated
with
which
it
is
dotted
*punct* .
*break*
this
incident
at
the
docks
is
but
one
such
point
*punct* .
*break*
another
is
the
singular
vision
which
appeared
to
me
whilst
i
lay
in
the
cellar
of
the
house
near
windsor
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
since
struck
me
that
it
possessed
peculiarities
akin
to
those
of
a
hashish
hallucination
*punct* .
*break*
can
it
be
that
we
were
drugged
on
that
occasion
with
indian
hemp
*punct* ?
*break*
cannabis
indica
is
a
treacherous
narcotic
*punct* ,
as
every
medical
man
knows
full
well
*punct* ;
but
fu-manchu's
knowledge
of
the
drug
was
far
in
advance
of
our
slow
science
*punct* .
*break*
west's
experience
proved
so
much
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
have
neglected
opportunities
*punct* ,
later
*punct* ,
you
shall
judge
if
i
did
so
*punct* ,
opportunities
to
glean
for
the
west
some
of
the
strange
knowledge
of
the
secret
east
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
*punct* ,
at
a
future
time
*punct* ,
i
may
rectify
my
errors
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
that
wisdom
*punct* ,
the
wisdom
stored
up
by
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
is
lost
forever
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
at
least
a
bare
possibility
of
its
survival
*punct* ,
in
part
*punct* ;
and
i
do
not
wholly
despair
of
one
day
publishing
a
scientific
sequel
to
this
record
of
our
dealings
with
the
chinese
doctor
*punct* .
*break*
time
wore
on
and
seemingly
brought
us
no
nearer
*punct* ,
or
very
little
nearer
*punct* ,
to
our
goal
*punct* .
*break*
so
carefully
had
my
friend
nayland
smith
excluded
the
matter
from
the
press
that
*punct* ,
whilst
public
interest
was
much
engaged
with
some
of
the
events
in
the
skein
of
mystery
which
he
had
come
from
burma
to
unravel
*punct* ,
outside
the
secret
service
and
the
special
department
of
scotland
yard
few
people
recognized
that
the
several
murders
*punct* ,
robberies
and
disappearances
formed
each
a
link
in
a
chain
*punct* ;
fewer
still
were
aware
that
a
baneful
presence
was
in
our
midst
*punct* ,
that
a
past
master
of
the
evil
arts
lay
concealed
somewhere
in
the
metropolis
*punct* ;
searched
for
by
the
keenest
wits
which
the
authorities
could
direct
to
the
task
*punct* ,
but
eluding
all-triumphant
*punct* ,
contemptuous
*punct* .
*break*
one
link
in
that
chain
smith
himself
for
long
failed
to
recognize
*punct* .
*break*
yet
it
was
a
big
and
important
link
*punct* .
*break*
on
board
the
deck
of
a
junk
passing
close
to
seaward
of
the
andaman
a
blue
flare
started
up
*punct* .
*break*
a
minute
later
there
was
a
cry
of
man
overboard
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
lewin
*punct* ,
the
chief
officer
*punct* ,
who
was
in
charge
*punct* ,
stopped
the
engines
*punct* .
*break*
a
boat
was
put
out
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
one
was
recovered
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
sharks
in
these
waters
*punct* .
*break*
a
fairly
heavy
sea
was
running
*punct* .
*break*
inquiry
showed
the
missing
man
to
be
a
james
edwards
*punct* ,
second
class
*punct* ,
booked
to
shanghai
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
the
name
was
assumed
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
was
some
sort
of
oriental
*punct* ,
and
we
had
had
him
under
close
observation
*punct* ...
that's
the
end
of
their
report
*punct* ,
exclaimed
smith
*punct* .
*break*
he
referred
to
the
two
c.i.d
*punct* .
*break*
men
who
had
joined
the
andaman
at
the
moment
of
her
departure
from
tilbury
*punct* .
*break*
he
carefully
lighted
his
pipe
*punct* .
*break*
is
it
a
victory
for
china
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ?
*break*
he
said
softly
*punct* .
*break*
until
the
great
war
reveals
her
secret
resources
*punct* ,
and
i
pray
that
the
day
be
not
in
my
time
*punct* ,
we
shall
never
know
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* .
*break*
smith
began
striding
up
and
down
the
room
*punct* ,
whose
name
*punct* ,
he
jerked
abruptly
*punct* ,
stands
now
at
the
head
of
our
danger
list
*punct* ?
*break*
he
referred
to
a
list
which
we
had
compiled
of
the
notable
men
intervening
between
the
evil
genius
who
secretly
had
invaded
london
and
the
triumph
of
his
cause
*punct* ,
the
triumph
of
the
yellow
races
*punct* .
*break*
i
glanced
at
our
notes
*punct* .
*break*
lord
southery
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* .
*break*
smith
tossed
the
morning
paper
across
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
look
*punct* ,
he
said
shortly
*punct* .
*break*
i
read
the
account
of
the
peer's
death
*punct* ,
and
glanced
at
the
long
obituary
notice
*punct* ;
but
no
more
than
glanced
at
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
but
recently
returned
from
the
east
*punct* ,
and
now
*punct* ,
after
a
short
illness
*punct* ,
had
died
from
some
affection
of
the
heart
*punct* .
*break*
there
had
been
no
intimation
that
his
illness
was
of
a
serious
nature
*punct* ,
and
even
smith
*punct* ,
who
watched
over
his
flock
*punct* ,
the
flock
threatened
by
the
wolf
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
with
jealous
zeal
*punct* ,
had
not
suspected
that
the
end
was
so
near
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
think
he
died
a
natural
death
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
my
friend
reached
across
the
table
and
rested
the
tip
of
a
long
ringer
upon
one
of
the
sub-headings
to
the
account
*punct* :
sir
frank
narcombe
summoned
too
late
*punct* .
*break*
you
see
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* ,
southery
died
during
the
night
*punct* ,
but
sir
frank
narcombe
*punct* ,
arriving
a
few
minutes
later
*punct* ,
unhesitatingly
pronounced
death
to
be
due
to
syncope
*punct* ,
and
seems
to
have
noticed
nothing
suspicious
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
*punct* .
*break*
sir
frank
is
a
great
physician
*punct* ,
i
said
slowly
*punct* ;
but
we
must
remember
he
would
be
looking
for
nothing
suspicious
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
remember
*punct* ,
rapped
smith
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
if
dr.
fu-manchu
is
responsible
for
southery's
death
*punct* ,
except
to
the
eye
of
an
expert
there
would
be
nothing
suspicious
to
see
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
leaves
no
clews
*punct* .
*break*
are
you
going
around
*punct* ?
*break*
smith
shrugged
his
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
not
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* .
*break*
either
a
greater
one
than
fu-manchu
has
taken
lord
southery
*punct* ,
or
the
yellow
doctor
has
done
his
work
so
well
that
no
trace
remains
of
his
presence
in
the
matter
*punct* .
*break*
leaving
his
breakfast
untasted
*punct* ,
he
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
room
*punct* ,
littering
the
hearth
with
matches
as
he
constantly
relighted
his
pipe
*punct* ,
which
went
out
every
few
minutes
*punct* .
*break*
it's
no
good
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
he
burst
out
suddenly
*punct* ;
it
cannot
be
a
coincidence
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
go
around
and
see
him
*punct* .
*break*
an
hour
later
we
stood
in
the
silent
room
*punct* ,
with
its
drawn
blinds
and
its
deathful
atmosphere
*punct* ,
looking
down
at
the
pale
*punct* ,
intellectual
face
of
henry
stradwick
*punct* ,
lord
southery
*punct* ,
the
greatest
engineer
of
his
day
*punct* .
*break*
the
mind
that
lay
behind
that
splendid
brow
had
planned
the
construction
of
the
railway
for
which
russia
had
paid
so
great
a
price
*punct* ,
had
conceived
the
scheme
for
the
canal
which
*punct* ,
in
the
near
future
*punct* ,
was
to
bring
two
great
continents
*punct* ,
a
full
week's
journey
nearer
one
to
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
it
would
plan
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
latterly
developed
symptoms
of
angina
pectoris
*punct* ,
explained
the
family
physician
*punct* ;
but
i
had
not
anticipated
a
fatal
termination
so
soon
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
called
about
two
o'clock
this
morning
*punct* ,
and
found
lord
southery
in
a
dangerously
exhausted
condition
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
all
that
was
possible
*punct* ,
and
sir
frank
narcombe
was
sent
for
*punct* .
*break*
but
shortly
before
his
arrival
the
patient
expired
*punct* .
*break*
i
understand
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ,
that
you
had
been
treating
lord
southery
for
angina
pectoris
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
was
the
reply
*punct* ,
for
some
months
*punct* .
*break*
you
regard
the
circumstances
of
his
end
as
entirely
consistent
with
a
death
from
that
cause
*punct* ?
*break*
do
you
observe
anything
unusual
yourself
*punct* ?
*break*
sir
frank
narcombe
quite
agrees
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
surely
no
room
for
doubt
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* ,
tugging
reflectively
at
the
lobe
of
his
left
ear
*punct* .
*break*
we
do
not
question
the
accuracy
of
your
diagnosis
in
any
way
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
the
physician
seemed
puzzled
*punct* .
*break*
but
am
i
not
right
in
supposing
that
you
are
connected
with
the
police
*punct* ?
*break*
asked
the
physician
*punct* .
*break*
neither
dr.
petrie
nor
myself
are
in
any
way
connected
with
the
police
*punct* ,
answered
smith
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
nevertheless
*punct* ,
i
look
to
you
to
regard
our
recent
questions
as
confidential
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
were
leaving
the
house
*punct* ,
hushed
awesomely
in
deference
to
the
unseen
visitor
who
had
touched
lord
southery
with
gray
*punct* ,
cold
fingers
*punct* ,
smith
paused
*punct* ,
detaining
a
black-coated
man
who
passed
us
on
the
stairs
*punct* .
*break*
you
were
lord
southery's
valet
*punct* ?
*break*
the
man
bowed
*punct* .
*break*
were
you
in
the
room
at
the
moment
of
his
fatal
seizure
*punct* ?
*break*
i
was
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
see
or
hear
anything
unusual
*punct* ,
anything
unaccountable
*punct* ?
*break*
nothing
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
no
strange
sounds
outside
the
house
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ?
*break*
the
man
shook
his
head
*punct* ,
and
smith
*punct* ,
taking
my
arm
*punct* ,
passed
out
into
the
street
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
this
business
is
making
me
imaginative
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ;
but
there
seems
to
be
something
tainting
the
air
in
yonder
*punct* ,
something
peculiar
to
houses
whose
doors
bear
the
invisible
death-mark
of
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
right
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* !
*break*
i
hesitated
to
mention
the
matter
*punct* ,
but
i
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
have
developed
some
other
sense
which
warns
me
of
the
doctor's
presence
*punct* .
*break*
although
there
is
not
a
scrap
of
confirmatory
evidence
*punct* ,
i
am
as
sure
that
he
has
brought
about
lord
southery's
death
as
if
i
had
seen
him
strike
the
blow
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
in
that
torturing
frame
of
mind
*punct* ,
chained
*punct* ,
helpless
*punct* ,
in
our
ignorance
*punct* ,
or
by
reason
of
the
chinaman's
supernormal
genius
*punct* ,
that
we
lived
throughout
the
ensuing
days
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend
began
to
look
like
a
man
consumed
by
a
burning
fever
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
we
could
not
act
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
growing
dark
of
an
evening
shortly
following
i
stood
idly
turning
over
some
of
the
works
exposed
for
sale
outside
a
second-hand
bookseller's
in
new
oxford
street
*punct* .
*break*
one
dealing
with
the
secret
societies
of
china
struck
me
as
being
likely
to
prove
instructive
*punct* ,
and
i
was
about
to
call
the
shopman
when
i
was
startled
to
feel
a
hand
clutch
my
arm
*punct* .
*break*
i
turned
around
rapidly
*punct* ,
and
was
looking
into
the
darkly
beautiful
eyes
of
karamaneh
*punct* !
*break*
she
*punct* ,
whom
i
had
seen
in
so
many
guises
*punct* ,
was
dressed
in
a
perfectly
fitting
walking
habit
*punct* ,
and
had
much
of
her
wonderful
hair
concealed
beneath
a
fashionable
hat
*punct* .
*break*
she
glanced
about
her
apprehensively
*punct* .
*break*
come
round
the
corner
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
speak
to
you
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* ,
her
musical
voice
thrilling
with
excitement
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
was
quite
master
of
myself
in
her
presence
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
have
been
a
man
of
ice
who
could
have
been
*punct* ,
i
think
for
her
beauty
had
all
the
bouquet
of
rarity
*punct* ;
she
was
a
mystery
*punct* ,
and
mystery
adds
charm
to
a
woman
*punct* .
*break*
probably
she
should
have
been
under
arrest
*punct* ,
but
i
know
i
would
have
risked
much
to
save
her
from
it
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
turned
into
a
quiet
thoroughfare
she
stopped
and
said
*punct* :
i
am
in
distress
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
often
asked
me
to
enable
you
to
capture
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
prepared
to
do
so
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
i
heard
right
*punct* .
*break*
your
brother
*punct* ,
i
began
*punct* .
*break*
she
seized
my
arm
entreatingly
*punct* ,
looking
into
my
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
a
doctor
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* .
*break*
i
want
you
to
come
and
see
him
now
*punct* .
*break*
is
he
in
london
*punct* ?
*break*
he
is
at
the
house
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
and
you
would
have
me
*punct* ,
accompany
me
there
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
i
doubted
not
*punct* ,
would
have
counseled
me
against
trusting
my
life
in
the
hands
of
this
girl
with
the
pleading
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
yet
i
did
so
*punct* ,
and
with
little
hesitation
*punct* ;
shortly
we
were
traveling
eastward
in
a
closed
cab
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
was
very
silent
*punct* ,
but
always
when
i
turned
to
her
i
found
her
big
eyes
fixed
upon
me
with
an
expression
in
which
there
was
pleading
*punct* ,
in
which
there
was
sorrow
*punct* ,
in
which
there
was
something
else
*punct* ,
something
indefinable
*punct* ,
yet
strangely
disturbing
*punct* .
*break*
the
cabman
she
had
directed
to
drive
to
the
lower
end
of
the
commercial
road
*punct* ,
the
neighborhood
of
the
new
docks
*punct* ,
and
the
scene
of
one
of
our
early
adventures
with
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
the
mantle
of
dusk
had
closed
about
the
squalid
activity
of
the
east
end
streets
as
we
neared
our
destination
*punct* .
*break*
aliens
of
every
shade
of
color
were
about
us
now
*punct* ,
emerging
from
burrow-like
alleys
into
the
glare
of
the
lamps
upon
the
main
road
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
short
space
of
the
drive
we
had
passed
from
the
bright
world
of
the
west
into
the
dubious
underworld
of
the
east
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
that
karamaneh
moved
*punct* ;
but
in
sympathy
*punct* ,
as
we
neared
the
abode
of
the
sinister
chinaman
*punct* ,
she
crept
nearer
to
me
*punct* ,
and
when
the
cab
was
discharged
*punct* ,
and
together
we
walked
down
a
narrow
turning
leading
riverward
*punct* ,
she
clung
to
me
fearfully
*punct* ,
hesitated
*punct* ,
and
even
seemed
upon
the
point
of
turning
back
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
overcoming
her
fear
or
repugnance
*punct* ,
she
led
on
*punct* ,
through
a
maze
of
alleyways
and
courts
*punct* ,
wherein
i
hopelessly
lost
my
bearings
*punct* ,
so
that
it
came
home
to
me
how
wholly
i
was
in
the
hands
of
this
girl
whose
history
was
so
full
of
shadows
*punct* ,
whose
real
character
was
so
inscrutable
*punct* ,
whose
beauty
*punct* ,
whose
charm
truly
might
mask
the
cunning
of
a
serpent
*punct* .
*break*
i
spoke
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
laid
her
hand
upon
my
arm
*punct* ,
enjoining
me
to
silence
*punct* .
*break*
the
high
*punct* ,
drab
brick
wall
of
what
looked
like
some
part
of
a
dock
building
loomed
above
us
in
the
darkness
*punct* ,
and
the
indescribable
stenches
of
the
lower
thames
were
borne
to
my
nostrils
through
a
gloomy
*punct* ,
tunnel-like
opening
*punct* ,
beyond
which
whispered
the
river
*punct* .
*break*
the
muffled
clangor
of
waterside
activity
was
about
us
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
a
key
grate
in
a
lock
*punct* ,
and
karamaneh
drew
me
into
the
shadow
of
an
open
door
*punct* ,
entered
*punct* ,
and
closed
it
behind
her
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
first
time
i
perceived
*punct* ,
in
contrast
to
the
odors
of
the
court
without
*punct* ,
the
fragrance
of
the
peculiar
perfume
which
now
i
had
come
to
associate
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
absolute
darkness
was
about
us
*punct* ,
and
by
this
perfume
alone
i
knew
that
she
*punct* ,
was
near
to
me
*punct* ,
until
her
hand
touched
mine
*punct* ,
and
i
was
led
along
an
uncarpeted
passage
and
up
an
uncarpeted
stair
*punct* .
*break*
a
second
door
was
unlocked
*punct* ,
and
i
found
myself
in
an
exquisitely
furnished
room
*punct* ,
illuminated
by
the
soft
light
of
a
shaded
lamp
which
stood
upon
a
low
*punct* ,
inlaid
table
amidst
a
perfect
ocean
of
silken
cushions
*punct* ,
strewn
upon
a
persian
carpet
*punct* ,
whose
yellow
richness
was
lost
in
the
shadows
beyond
the
circle
of
light
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
raised
a
curtain
draped
before
a
doorway
*punct* ,
and
stood
listening
intently
for
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
the
silence
was
unbroken
*punct* .
*break*
then
something
stirred
amid
the
wilderness
of
cushions
*punct* ,
and
two
tiny
bright
eyes
looked
up
at
me
*punct* .
*break*
peering
closely
*punct* ,
i
succeeded
in
distinguishing
*punct* ,
crouched
in
that
soft
luxuriance
*punct* ,
a
little
ape
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
dr.
fu-manchu's
marmoset
*punct* .
*break*
this
way
*punct* ,
whispered
karamaneh
*punct* .
*break*
never
*punct* ,
i
thought
*punct* ,
was
a
staid
medical
man
committed
to
a
more
unwise
enterprise
*punct* ,
but
so
far
i
had
gone
*punct* ,
and
no
consideration
of
prudence
could
now
be
of
avail
*punct* .
*break*
the
corridor
beyond
was
thickly
carpeted
*punct* .
*break*
following
the
direction
of
a
faint
light
which
gleamed
ahead
*punct* ,
it
proved
to
extend
as
a
balcony
across
one
end
of
a
spacious
apartment
*punct* .
*break*
together
we
stood
high
up
there
in
the
shadows
*punct* ,
and
looked
down
upon
such
a
scene
as
i
never
could
have
imagined
to
exist
within
many
a
mile
of
that
district
*punct* .
*break*
the
place
below
was
even
more
richly
appointed
than
the
room
into
which
first
we
had
come
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
as
there
*punct* ,
piles
of
cushions
formed
splashes
of
gaudy
color
about
the
floor
*punct* .
*break*
three
lamps
hung
by
chains
from
the
ceiling
*punct* ,
their
light
softened
by
rich
silk
shades
*punct* .
*break*
one
wall
was
almost
entirely
occupied
by
glass
cases
containing
chemical
apparatus
*punct* ,
tubes
*punct* ,
retorts
and
other
less
orthodox
indications
of
dr.
fu-manchu's
pursuits
*punct* ,
whilst
close
against
another
lay
the
most
extraordinary
object
of
a
sufficiently
extraordinary
room
*punct* ,
a
low
couch
*punct* ,
upon
which
was
extended
the
motionless
form
of
a
boy
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
light
of
a
lamp
which
hung
directly
above
him
*punct* ,
his
olive
face
showed
an
almost
startling
resemblance
to
that
of
karamaneh
*punct* ,
save
that
the
girl's
coloring
was
more
delicate
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
black
*punct* ,
curly
hair
*punct* ,
which
stood
out
prominently
against
the
white
covering
upon
which
he
lay
*punct* ,
his
hands
crossed
upon
his
breast
*punct* .
*break*
transfixed
with
astonishment
*punct* ,
i
stood
looking
down
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
wonders
of
the
arabian
nights
were
wonders
no
longer
*punct* ,
for
here
*punct* ,
in
east-end
london
*punct* ,
was
a
true
magician's
palace
*punct* ,
lacking
not
its
beautiful
slave
lacking
not
its
enchanted
prince
*punct* !
*break*
it
is
aziz
*punct* ,
my
brother
*punct* ,
said
karamaneh
*punct* .
*break*
we
passed
down
a
stairway
on
to
the
floor
of
the
apartment
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
knelt
and
bent
over
the
boy
*punct* ,
stroking
his
hair
and
whispering
to
him
lovingly
*punct* .
*break*
i
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
bent
over
him
*punct* ;
and
i
shall
never
forget
the
anxiety
in
the
girl's
eyes
as
she
watched
me
eagerly
whilst
i
made
a
brief
examination
*punct* .
*break*
brief
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
for
even
ere
i
had
touched
him
i
knew
that
the
comely
shell
held
no
spark
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
but
karamaneh
fondled
the
cold
hands
*punct* ,
and
spoke
softly
in
that
arabic
tongue
which
long
before
i
had
divined
must
be
her
native
language
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
as
i
remained
silent
*punct* ,
she
turned
and
looked
at
me
*punct* ,
read
the
truth
in
my
eyes
*punct* ,
and
rose
from
her
knees
*punct* ,
stood
rigidly
upright
*punct* ,
and
clutched
me
tremblingly
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
not
dead
*punct* ,
he
is
not
dead
*punct* !
*break*
she
whispered
*punct* ,
and
shook
me
as
a
child
might
*punct* ,
seeking
to
arouse
me
to
a
proper
understanding
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
tell
me
he
is
not
*punct* ,
i
cannot
*punct* ,
i
replied
gently
*punct* ,
for
indeed
he
is
*punct* .
*break*
she
said
*punct* ,
wild-eyed
*punct* ,
and
raising
her
hands
to
her
face
as
though
half
distraught
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
not
understand
*punct* ,
yet
you
are
a
doctor
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
not
understand
*punct* ,
she
stopped
*punct* ,
moaning
to
herself
and
looking
from
the
handsome
face
of
the
boy
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
pitiful
*punct* ;
it
was
uncanny
*punct* .
*break*
but
sorrow
for
the
girl
predominated
in
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
then
from
somewhere
i
heard
a
sound
which
i
had
heard
before
in
houses
occupied
by
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
that
of
a
muffled
gong
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
had
me
by
the
arm
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
returned
*punct* !
*break*
she
fled
up
the
stairs
to
the
balcony
*punct* ,
i
close
at
her
heels
*punct* .
*break*
the
shadows
veiled
us
*punct* ,
the
thick
carpet
deadened
the
sound
of
our
tread
*punct* ,
or
certainly
we
must
have
been
detected
by
the
man
who
entered
the
room
we
had
just
quitted
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
yellow-robbed
*punct* ,
immobile
*punct* ,
the
inhuman
green
eyes
glittering
catlike
even
*punct* ,
it
seemed
*punct* ,
before
the
light
struck
them
*punct* ,
he
threaded
his
way
through
the
archipelago
of
cushions
and
bent
over
the
couch
of
aziz
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
dragged
me
down
on
to
my
knees
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
fu-manchu
felt
for
the
pulse
of
the
boy
whom
a
moment
since
i
had
pronounced
dead
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
stepping
to
the
tall
glass
case
*punct* ,
took
out
a
long-necked
flask
of
chased
gold
*punct* ,
and
from
it
*punct* ,
into
a
graduated
glass
*punct* ,
he
poured
some
drops
of
an
amber
liquid
wholly
unfamiliar
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
watched
him
with
all
my
eyes
*punct* ,
and
noted
how
high
the
liquid
rose
in
the
measure
*punct* .
*break*
he
charged
a
needle-syringe
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
bending
again
over
aziz
*punct* ,
made
an
injection
*punct* .
*break*
then
all
the
wonders
i
had
heard
of
this
man
became
possible
*punct* ,
and
with
an
awe
which
any
other
physician
who
had
examined
aziz
must
have
felt
*punct* ,
i
admitted
him
a
miracle-worker
*punct* .
*break*
for
as
i
watched
*punct* ,
all
but
breathless
*punct* ,
the
dead
came
to
life
*punct* !
*break*
the
glow
of
health
crept
upon
the
olive
cheek
*punct* ,
the
boy
moved
*punct* ,
he
raised
his
hands
above
his
head
*punct* ,
he
sat
up
*punct* ,
supported
by
the
chinese
doctor
*punct* !
*break*
fu-manchu
touched
some
hidden
bell
*punct* .
*break*
a
hideous
yellow
man
with
a
scarred
face
entered
*punct* ,
carrying
a
tray
upon
which
were
a
bowl
containing
some
steaming
fluid
*punct* ,
apparently
soup
*punct* ,
what
looked
like
oaten
cakes
*punct* ,
and
a
flask
of
red
wine
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
boy
*punct* ,
exhibiting
no
more
unusual
symptoms
than
if
he
had
just
awakened
from
a
normal
sleep
*punct* ,
commenced
his
repast
*punct* ,
karamaneh
drew
me
gently
along
the
passage
into
the
room
which
we
had
first
entered
*punct* .
*break*
my
heart
leaped
wildly
as
the
marmoset
bounded
past
us
to
drop
hand
over
hand
to
the
lower
apartment
in
search
of
its
master
*punct* .
*break*
you
see
*punct* ,
said
karamaneh
*punct* ,
her
voice
quivering
*punct* ,
he
is
not
dead
*punct* !
*break*
but
without
fu-manchu
he
is
dead
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
how
can
i
leave
him
when
he
holds
the
life
of
aziz
in
his
hand
*punct* ?
*break*
you
must
get
me
that
flask
*punct* ,
or
some
of
its
contents
*punct* ,
i
directed
*punct* .
*break*
but
tell
me
*punct* ,
how
does
he
produce
the
appearance
of
death
*punct* ?
*break*
i
cannot
tell
you
*punct* ,
she
replied
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
something
in
the
wine
*punct* .
*break*
in
another
hour
aziz
will
be
again
as
you
saw
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
opening
a
little
ebony
box
*punct* ,
she
produced
a
phial
half
filled
with
the
amber
liquid
*punct* .
*break*
i
said
*punct* ,
and
slipped
it
into
my
pocket
*punct* .
*break*
when
will
be
the
best
time
to
seize
fu-manchu
and
to
restore
your
brother
*punct* ?
*break*
i
will
let
you
know
*punct* ,
she
whispered
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
opening
the
door
*punct* ,
pushed
me
hurriedly
from
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
going
away
to-night
to
the
north
*punct* ;
but
you
must
not
come
to-night
*punct* .
*break*
along
the
passage
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
call
me
at
any
moment
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
with
the
phial
in
my
pocket
containing
a
potent
preparation
unknown
to
western
science
*punct* ,
and
with
a
last
long
look
into
the
eyes
of
karamaneh
*punct* ,
i
passed
out
into
the
narrow
alley
*punct* ,
out
from
the
fragrant
perfumes
of
that
mystery
house
into
the
place
of
thames-side
stenches
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
arrange
for
the
house
to
be
raided
without
delay
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* .
*break*
this
time
we
are
sure
of
our
ally
*punct* ,
but
we
must
keep
our
promise
to
her
*punct* ,
i
interrupted
*punct* .
*break*
you
can
look
after
that
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
my
friend
said
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
devote
the
whole
of
my
attention
to
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
he
added
grimly
*punct* .
*break*
up
and
down
the
room
he
paced
*punct* ,
gripping
the
blackened
briar
between
his
teeth
*punct* ,
so
that
the
muscles
stood
out
squarely
upon
his
lean
jaws
*punct* .
*break*
the
bronze
which
spoke
of
the
burmese
sun
enhanced
the
brightness
of
his
gray
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
what
have
i
all
along
maintained
*punct* ?
*break*
he
jerked
*punct* ,
looking
back
at
me
across
his
shoulder
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
although
karamaneh
was
one
of
the
strongest
weapons
in
the
doctor's
armory
*punct* ,
she
was
one
which
some
day
would
be
turned
against
him
*punct* .
*break*
that
day
has
dawned
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
await
word
from
her
*punct* .
*break*
he
knocked
out
his
pipe
on
the
grate
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* :
have
you
any
idea
of
the
nature
of
the
fluid
in
the
phial
*punct* ?
*break*
not
the
slightest
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
have
none
to
spare
for
analytical
purposes
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
began
stuffing
mixture
into
the
hot
pipe-bowl
*punct* ,
and
dropping
an
almost
equal
quantity
on
the
floor
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
rest
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
itching
to
get
to
work
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
a
false
move
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
he
lighted
his
pipe
*punct* ,
and
stood
staring
from
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
take
a
needle-syringe
with
me
*punct* ,
i
explained
*punct* .
*break*
smith
made
no
reply
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
but
knew
the
composition
of
the
drug
which
produced
the
semblance
of
death
*punct* ,
i
continued
*punct* ,
my
fame
would
long
survive
my
ashes
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend
did
not
turn
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* :
she
said
it
was
something
he
put
in
the
wine
*punct* ?
*break*
in
the
wine
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* .
*break*
my
thoughts
reverted
to
karamaneh
*punct* ,
whom
dr.
fu-manchu
held
in
bonds
stronger
than
any
slave-chains
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
with
aziz
*punct* ,
her
brother
*punct* ,
suspended
between
life
and
death
*punct* ,
what
could
she
do
save
obey
the
mandates
of
the
cunning
chinaman
*punct* ?
*break*
what
perverted
genius
was
his
*punct* !
*break*
if
that
treasury
of
obscure
wisdom
which
he
*punct* ,
perhaps
alone
of
living
men
*punct* ,
had
rifled
*punct* ,
could
but
be
thrown
open
to
the
sick
and
suffering
*punct* ,
the
name
of
dr.
fu-manchu
would
rank
with
the
golden
ones
in
the
history
of
healing
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
suddenly
turned
*punct* ,
and
the
expression
upon
his
face
amazed
me
*punct* .
*break*
there's
the
bradshaw
*punct* .
*break*
we
haven't
a
minute
to
waste
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
voice
was
the
imperative
note
i
knew
so
well
*punct* ;
in
his
eyes
was
the
light
which
told
of
an
urgent
need
for
action
*punct* ,
a
portentous
truth
suddenly
grasped
*punct* .
*break*
one
in
half-an-hour
*punct* ,
the
last
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
catch
it
*punct* .
*break*
no
further
word
of
explanation
he
vouchsafed
*punct* ,
but
darted
off
to
dress
*punct* ;
for
he
had
spent
the
afternoon
pacing
the
room
in
his
dressing-gown
and
smoking
without
intermission
*punct* .
*break*
out
and
to
the
corner
we
hurried
*punct* ,
and
leaped
into
the
first
taxi
upon
the
rank
*punct* .
*break*
smith
enjoined
the
man
to
hasten
*punct* ,
and
we
were
off
*punct* ,
all
in
that
whirl
of
feverish
activity
which
characterized
my
friend's
movements
in
times
of
important
action
*punct* .
*break*
he
sat
glancing
impatiently
from
the
window
and
twitching
at
the
lobe
of
his
ear
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
you
will
forgive
me
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
but
there
is
a
little
problem
which
i
am
trying
to
work
out
in
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
bring
the
things
i
mentioned
*punct* ?
*break*
conversation
lapsed
*punct* ,
until
*punct* ,
just
as
the
cab
turned
into
the
station
*punct* ,
smith
said
*punct* :
should
you
consider
lord
southery
to
have
been
the
first
constructive
engineer
of
his
time
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ?
*break*
undoubtedly
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* .
*break*
greater
than
von
homber
*punct* ,
of
berlin
*punct* ?
*break*
but
von
homber
has
been
dead
for
three
years
*punct* .
*break*
three
years
*punct* ,
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
we
reached
the
station
in
time
to
secure
a
non-corridor
compartment
to
ourselves
*punct* ,
and
to
allow
smith
leisure
carefully
to
inspect
the
occupants
of
all
the
others
*punct* ,
from
the
engine
to
the
guard's
van
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
muffled
up
to
the
eyes
*punct* ,
and
he
warned
me
to
keep
out
of
sight
in
the
corner
of
the
compartment
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
his
behavior
had
me
bursting
with
curiosity
*punct* .
*break*
the
train
having
started
*punct* :
don't
imagine
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
said
smith
that
i
am
trying
to
lead
you
blindfolded
in
order
later
to
dazzle
you
with
my
perspicacity
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
simply
afraid
that
this
may
be
a
wild-goose
chase
*punct* .
*break*
the
idea
upon
which
i
am
acting
does
not
seem
to
have
struck
you
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
it
had
*punct* .
*break*
the
fact
would
argue
in
favor
of
its
being
*punct* ,
sound
*punct* .
*break*
at
present
i
am
hopelessly
mystified
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
i
will
not
bias
you
towards
my
view
*punct* .
*break*
but
just
study
the
situation
*punct* ,
and
see
if
you
can
arrive
at
the
reason
for
this
sudden
journey
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
be
distinctly
encouraged
if
you
succeed
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
did
not
succeed
*punct* ,
and
since
smith
obviously
was
unwilling
to
enlighten
me
*punct* ,
i
pressed
him
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
the
train
stopped
at
rugby
*punct* ,
where
he
was
engaged
with
the
stationmaster
in
making
some
mysterious
arrangements
*punct* .
*break*
twenty
minutes
rapid
traveling
*punct* ,
and
a
white
mansion
leaped
into
the
line
of
sight
*punct* ,
standing
out
vividly
against
its
woody
backing
*punct* .
*break*
stradwick
hall
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* .
*break*
the
home
of
lord
southery
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
first
*punct* ,
but
dr.
fu-manchu
was
on
the
train
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
truth
dawned
upon
the
gloom
of
my
perplexity
*punct* .
*break*
your
extraordinary
proposal
fills
me
with
horror
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* !
*break*
the
sleek
little
man
in
the
dress
suit
*punct* ,
who
looked
like
a
head
waiter
*punct* ,
but
was
the
trusted
legal
adviser
of
the
house
of
southery
*punct* ,
puffed
at
his
cigar
indignantly
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
whose
restless
pacing
had
led
him
to
the
far
end
of
the
library
*punct* ,
turned
*punct* ,
a
remote
but
virile
figure
*punct* ,
and
looked
back
to
where
i
stood
by
the
open
hearth
with
the
solicitor
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
in
your
hands
*punct* ,
mr.
henderson
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
and
advanced
upon
the
latter
*punct* ,
his
gray
eyes
ablaze
*punct* .
*break*
save
for
the
heir
*punct* ,
who
is
abroad
on
foreign
service
*punct* ,
you
say
there
is
no
kin
of
lord
southery
to
consider
*punct* .
*break*
the
word
rests
with
you
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
am
wrong
*punct* ,
and
you
agree
to
my
proposal
*punct* ,
there
is
none
whose
susceptibilities
will
suffer
*punct* ,
my
own
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
if
i
am
right
*punct* ,
and
you
prevent
me
from
acting
*punct* ,
you
become
a
murderer
*punct* ,
mr.
henderson
*punct* .
*break*
the
lawyer
started
*punct* ,
staring
nervously
up
at
smith
*punct* ,
who
now
towered
over
him
menacingly
*punct* .
*break*
lord
southery
was
a
lonely
man
*punct* ,
continued
my
friend
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
could
have
placed
my
proposition
before
one
of
his
blood
*punct* ,
i
do
not
doubt
what
my
answer
had
been
*punct* .
*break*
why
do
you
hesitate
*punct* ?
*break*
why
do
you
experience
this
feeling
of
horror
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
henderson
stared
down
into
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
his
constitutionally
ruddy
face
was
pale
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
entirely
irregular
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
not
the
necessary
powers
*punct* ,
smith
snapped
his
teeth
together
impatiently
*punct* ,
snatching
his
watch
from
his
pocket
and
glancing
at
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
vested
with
the
necessary
powers
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
give
you
a
written
order
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
the
proceeding
savors
of
paganism
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
course
might
be
admissible
in
china
*punct* ,
in
burma
*punct* ,
do
you
weigh
a
life
against
such
quibbles
*punct* ?
*break*
do
you
suppose
that
*punct* ,
granting
my
irresponsibility
*punct* ,
dr.
petrie
would
countenance
such
a
thing
if
be
doubted
the
necessity
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
henderson
looked
at
me
with
pathetic
hesitance
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
guests
in
the
house
*punct* ,
mourners
who
attended
the
ceremony
to-day
*punct* .
*break*
they
*punct* ,
will
never
know
*punct* ,
if
we
are
in
error
*punct* ,
interrupted
smith
*punct* .
*break*
why
do
you
delay
*punct* ?
*break*
you
wish
it
to
be
kept
secret
*punct* ?
*break*
you
and
i
*punct* ,
mr.
henderson
*punct* ,
and
dr.
petrie
will
go
now
*punct* .
*break*
we
require
no
other
witnesses
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
answerable
only
to
our
consciences
*punct* .
*break*
the
lawyer
passed
his
hand
across
his
damp
brow
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
never
in
my
life
been
called
upon
to
come
to
so
momentous
a
decision
in
so
short
a
time
*punct* ,
he
confessed
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
aided
by
smith's
indomitable
will
*punct* ,
he
made
his
decision
*punct* .
*break*
as
its
result
*punct* ,
we
three
*punct* ,
looking
and
feeling
like
conspirators
*punct* ,
hurried
across
the
park
beneath
a
moon
whose
placidity
was
a
rebuke
to
the
turbulent
passions
which
reared
their
strangle-growth
in
the
garden
of
england
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
breath
of
wind
stirred
amid
the
leaves
*punct* .
*break*
the
calm
of
perfect
night
soothed
everything
to
slumber
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
if
smith
were
right
*punct* ,
and
i
did
not
doubt
him
*punct* ,
the
green
eyes
of
dr.
fu-manchu
had
looked
upon
the
scene
*punct* ;
and
i
found
myself
marveling
that
its
beauty
had
not
wilted
up
*punct* .
*break*
even
now
the
dread
chinaman
must
be
near
to
us
*punct* .
*break*
as
mr.
henderson
unlocked
the
ancient
iron
gates
he
turned
to
nayland
smith
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
twitched
oddly
*punct* .
*break*
witness
that
i
do
this
unwillingly
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
most
unwillingly
*punct* .
*break*
mine
be
the
responsibility
*punct* ,
was
the
reply
*punct* .
*break*
smith's
voice
quivered
*punct* ,
responsive
to
the
nervous
vitality
pent
up
within
that
lean
frame
*punct* .
*break*
he
stood
motionless
*punct* ,
listening
*punct* ,
and
i
knew
for
whom
he
listened
*punct* .
*break*
he
peered
about
him
to
right
and
left
*punct* ,
and
i
knew
whom
he
expected
but
dreaded
to
see
*punct* .
*break*
above
us
now
the
trees
looked
down
with
a
solemnity
different
from
the
aspect
of
the
monarchs
of
the
park
*punct* ,
and
the
nearer
we
came
to
our
journey's
end
the
more
somber
and
lowering
bent
the
verdant
arch
*punct* ,
or
so
it
seemed
*punct* .
*break*
by
that
path
*punct* ,
patched
now
with
pools
of
moonlight
*punct* ,
lord
southery
had
passed
upon
his
bier
*punct* ,
with
the
sun
to
light
his
going
*punct* ;
by
that
path
several
generations
of
stradwicks
had
gone
to
their
last
resting-place
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
doors
of
the
vault
the
moon
rays
found
free
access
*punct* .
*break*
no
branch
*punct* ,
no
leaf
*punct* ,
intervened
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
henderson's
face
looked
ghastly
*punct* .
*break*
the
keys
which
he
carried
rattled
in
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
light
the
lantern
*punct* ,
he
said
unsteadily
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
who
again
had
been
peering
suspiciously
about
into
the
shadows
*punct* ,
struck
a
match
and
lighted
the
lantern
which
he
carried
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
to
the
solicitor
*punct* .
*break*
be
calm
*punct* ,
mr.
henderson
*punct* ,
he
said
sternly
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
your
plain
duty
to
your
client
*punct* .
*break*
god
be
my
witness
that
i
doubt
it
*punct* ,
replied
henderson
*punct* ,
and
opened
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
we
descended
the
steps
*punct* .
*break*
the
air
beneath
was
damp
and
chill
*punct* .
*break*
it
touched
us
as
with
clammy
fingers
*punct* ;
and
the
sensation
was
not
wholly
physical
*punct* .
*break*
before
the
narrow
mansion
which
now
sufficed
lord
southery
*punct* ,
the
great
engineer
whom
kings
had
honored
*punct* ,
henderson
reeled
and
clutched
at
me
for
support
*punct* .
*break*
smith
and
i
had
looked
to
him
for
no
aid
in
our
uncanny
task
*punct* ,
and
rightly
*punct* .
*break*
with
averted
eyes
he
stood
over
by
the
steps
of
the
tomb
*punct* ,
whilst
my
friend
and
myself
set
to
work
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
pursuit
of
my
profession
i
had
undertaken
labors
as
unpleasant
*punct* ,
but
never
amid
an
environment
such
as
this
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
that
generations
of
stradwicks
listened
to
each
turn
of
every
screw
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
it
was
done
*punct* ,
and
the
pallid
face
of
lord
southery
questioned
the
intruding
light
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith's
hand
was
as
steady
as
a
rigid
bar
when
he
raised
the
lantern
*punct* .
*break*
later
*punct* ,
i
knew
*punct* ,
there
would
be
a
sudden
releasing
of
the
tension
of
will
*punct* ,
a
reaction
physical
and
mental
*punct* ,
but
not
until
his
work
was
finished
*punct* .
*break*
that
my
own
hand
was
steady
i
ascribed
to
one
thing
solely
*punct* ,
professional
zeal
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
under
conditions
which
*punct* ,
in
the
event
of
failure
and
exposure
*punct* ,
must
have
led
to
an
unpleasant
inquiry
by
the
british
medical
association
*punct* ,
i
was
about
to
attempt
an
experiment
never
before
essayed
by
a
physician
of
the
white
races
*punct* .
*break*
though
i
failed
*punct* ,
though
i
succeeded
*punct* ,
that
it
ever
came
before
the
b.m.a.
*punct* ,
or
any
other
council
*punct* ,
was
improbable
*punct* ;
in
the
former
event
*punct* ,
all
but
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
knowledge
that
i
was
about
to
practice
charlatanry
*punct* ,
or
what
any
one
of
my
fellow-practitioners
must
have
designated
as
such
*punct* ,
was
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
yet
so
profound
had
my
belief
become
in
the
extraordinary
being
whose
existence
was
a
danger
to
the
world
that
i
reveled
in
my
immunity
from
official
censure
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
glad
that
it
had
fallen
to
my
lot
to
take
at
least
one
step
*punct* ,
though
blindly
*punct* ,
into
the
future
of
medical
science
*punct* .
*break*
so
far
as
my
skill
bore
me
*punct* ,
lord
southery
was
dead
*punct* .
*break*
unhesitatingly
*punct* ,
i
would
have
given
a
death
certificate
*punct* ,
save
for
two
considerations
*punct* .
*break*
the
first
*punct* ,
although
his
latest
scheme
ran
contrary
from
the
interests
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
his
genius
*punct* ,
diverted
into
other
channels
*punct* ,
would
serve
the
yellow
group
better
than
his
death
*punct* .
*break*
the
second
*punct* ,
i
had
seen
the
boy
aziz
raised
from
a
state
as
like
death
as
this
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
phial
of
amber-hued
liquid
which
i
had
with
me
*punct* ,
i
charged
the
needle
syringe
*punct* .
*break*
i
made
the
injection
*punct* ,
and
waited
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
is
really
dead
*punct* !
*break*
it
seems
incredible
that
he
can
have
survived
for
three
days
without
food
*punct* .
*break*
yet
i
have
known
a
fakir
to
go
for
a
week
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
henderson
groaned
*punct* .
*break*
watch
in
hand
*punct* ,
i
stood
observing
the
gray
face
*punct* .
*break*
a
second
passed
*punct* ;
another
*punct* ;
a
third
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
fourth
the
miracle
began
*punct* .
*break*
over
the
seemingly
cold
clay
crept
the
hue
of
pulsing
life
*punct* .
*break*
it
came
in
waves
*punct* ,
in
waves
which
corresponded
with
the
throbbing
of
the
awakened
heart
*punct* ;
which
swept
fuller
and
stronger
*punct* ;
which
filled
and
quickened
the
chilled
body
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
rapidly
freed
the
living
man
from
the
trappings
of
the
dead
one
*punct* ,
southery
*punct* ,
uttering
a
stifled
scream
*punct* ,
sat
up
*punct* ,
looked
about
him
with
half-glazed
eyes
*punct* ,
and
fell
back
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
all
right
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
and
had
time
to
note
how
my
voice
had
assumed
a
professional
tone
*punct* .
*break*
a
little
brandy
from
my
flask
is
all
that
is
necessary
now
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
two
patients
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ,
rapped
my
friend
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
henderson
had
fallen
in
a
swoon
to
the
floor
of
the
vault
*punct* .
*break*
quiet
*punct* ,
whispered
smith
*punct* ;
he
is
here
*punct* .
*break*
he
extinguished
the
light
*punct* .
*break*
i
supported
lord
southery
*punct* .
*break*
what
has
happened
*punct* ?
*break*
he
kept
moaning
*punct* .
*break*
where
am
i
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
god
*punct* !
*break*
what
has
happened
*punct* ?
*break*
i
strove
to
reassure
him
in
a
whisper
*punct* ,
and
placed
my
traveling
coat
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
mausoleum
steps
we
had
reclosed
but
not
relocked
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
as
i
upheld
the
man
whom
literally
we
had
rescued
from
the
grave
*punct* ,
i
heard
the
door
reopen
*punct* .
*break*
to
aid
henderson
i
could
make
no
move
*punct* .
*break*
smith
was
breathing
hard
beside
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
dared
not
think
what
was
about
to
happen
*punct* ,
nor
what
its
effects
might
be
upon
lord
southery
in
his
exhausted
condition
*punct* .
*break*
through
the
memphian
dark
of
the
tomb
cut
a
spear
of
light
*punct* ,
touching
the
last
stone
of
the
stairway
*punct* .
*break*
a
guttural
voice
spoke
some
words
rapidly
*punct* ,
and
i
knew
that
dr.
fu-manchu
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
*punct* .
*break*
although
i
could
not
see
my
friend
*punct* ,
i
became
aware
that
nayland
smith
had
his
revolver
in
his
hand
*punct* ,
and
i
reached
into
my
pocket
for
mine
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
the
cunning
chinaman
was
about
to
fall
into
a
trap
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
require
all
his
genius
*punct* ,
i
thought
*punct* ,
to
save
him
to-night
*punct* .
*break*
unless
his
suspicions
were
aroused
by
the
unlocked
door
*punct* ,
his
capture
was
imminent
*punct* .
*break*
someone
was
descending
the
steps
*punct* .
*break*
in
my
right
hand
i
held
my
revolver
*punct* ,
and
with
my
left
arm
about
lord
southery
*punct* ,
i
waited
through
ten
such
seconds
of
suspense
as
i
have
rarely
known
*punct* .
*break*
the
spear
of
light
plunged
into
the
well
of
darkness
again
*punct* .
*break*
lord
southery
*punct* ,
smith
and
myself
were
hidden
by
the
angle
of
the
wall
*punct* ;
but
full
upon
the
purplish
face
of
mr.
henderson
the
beam
shone
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
way
it
penetrated
to
the
murk
in
his
mind
*punct* ;
and
he
awakened
from
his
swoon
with
a
hoarse
cry
*punct* ,
struggled
to
his
feet
*punct* ,
and
stood
looking
up
the
stair
in
a
sort
of
frozen
horror
*punct* .
*break*
smith
was
past
him
at
a
bound
*punct* .
*break*
something
flashed
towards
him
as
the
light
was
extinguished
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
him
duck
*punct* ,
and
heard
the
knife
ring
upon
the
floor
*punct* .
*break*
i
managed
to
move
sufficiently
to
see
at
the
top
*punct* ,
as
i
fired
up
the
stairs
*punct* ,
the
yellow
face
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
to
see
the
gleaming
*punct* ,
chatoyant
eyes
*punct* ,
greenly
terrible
*punct* ,
as
they
sought
to
pierce
the
gloom
*punct* .
*break*
he
stumbled
and
fell
*punct* ,
by
which
i
knew
that
he
was
hit
*punct* ;
but
went
on
again
*punct* ,
smith
hard
on
his
heels
*punct* .
*break*
i
cried
*punct* ,
relight
the
lantern
and
take
charge
of
lord
southery
*punct* .
*break*
here
is
my
flask
on
the
floor
*punct* .
*break*
i
rely
upon
you
*punct* .
*break*
smith's
revolver
spoke
again
as
i
went
bounding
up
the
stair
*punct* .
*break*
black
against
the
square
of
moonlight
i
saw
him
stagger
*punct* ,
i
saw
him
fall
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
fell
*punct* ,
for
the
third
time
*punct* ,
i
heard
the
crack
of
his
revolver
*punct* .
*break*
instantly
i
was
at
his
side
*punct* .
*break*
somewhere
along
the
black
aisle
beneath
the
trees
receding
footsteps
pattered
*punct* .
*break*
are
you
hurt
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
i
cried
anxiously
*punct* .
*break*
he
got
upon
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
a
dacoit
with
him
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
and
showed
me
the
long
curved
knife
which
he
held
in
his
hand
*punct* ,
a
full
inch
of
the
blade
bloodstained
*punct* .
*break*
a
near
thing
for
me
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
the
whir
of
a
restarted
motor
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
lost
him
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
have
saved
lord
southery
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
will
credit
us
with
a
skill
as
great
as
his
own
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
get
to
the
car
*punct* ,
smith
muttered
*punct* ,
and
try
to
overtake
them
*punct* .
*break*
my
left
arm
is
useless
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
mere
waste
of
time
to
attempt
to
overtake
them
*punct* ,
i
argued
*punct* ,
for
we
have
no
idea
in
which
direction
they
will
proceed
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
a
very
good
idea
*punct* ,
snapped
smith
*punct* .
*break*
stradwick
hall
is
less
than
ten
miles
from
the
coast
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
only
one
practicable
means
of
conveying
an
unconscious
man
secretly
from
here
to
london
*punct* .
*break*
you
think
he
meant
to
take
him
from
here
to
london
*punct* ?
*break*
prior
to
shipping
him
to
china
*punct* ;
i
think
so
*punct* .
*break*
his
clearing-house
is
probably
on
the
thames
*punct* .
*break*
a
yacht
*punct* ,
presumably
*punct* ,
is
lying
off
the
coast
in
readiness
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
may
even
have
designed
to
ship
him
direct
to
china
*punct* .
*break*
lord
southery
*punct* ,
a
bizarre
figure
*punct* ,
my
traveling
coat
wrapped
about
him
*punct* ,
and
supported
by
his
solicitor
*punct* ,
who
was
almost
as
pale
as
himself
*punct* ,
emerged
from
the
vault
into
the
moonlight
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
a
triumph
for
you
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
the
throb
of
fu-manchu's
car
died
into
faintness
and
was
lost
in
the
night's
silence
*punct* .
*break*
only
half
a
triumph
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
still
have
another
chance
*punct* ,
the
raid
on
his
house
*punct* .
*break*
when
will
the
word
come
from
karamaneh
*punct* ?
*break*
southery
spoke
in
a
weak
voice
*punct* .
*break*
gentlemen
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
it
seems
i
am
raised
from
the
dead
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
weirdest
moment
of
the
night
wherein
we
heard
that
newly
buried
man
speak
from
the
mold
of
his
tomb
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
replied
smith
slowly
*punct* ,
and
spared
from
the
fate
of
heaven
alone
knows
how
many
men
of
genius
*punct* .
*break*
the
yellow
society
lacks
a
southery
*punct* ,
but
that
dr.
fu-manchu
was
in
germany
three
years
ago
i
have
reason
to
believe
*punct* ;
so
that
*punct* ,
even
without
visiting
the
grave
of
your
great
teutonic
rival
*punct* ,
who
suddenly
died
at
about
that
time
*punct* ,
i
venture
to
predict
that
they
have
a
von
homber
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
futurist
group
in
china
knows
how
to
make
men
work
*punct* !
*break*
from
the
rescue
of
lord
southery
my
story
bears
me
mercilessly
on
to
other
things
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
not
tarry
*punct* ,
as
more
leisurely
penmen
*punct* ,
to
round
my
incidents
*punct* ;
they
were
not
of
my
choosing
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
not
pause
to
make
you
better
acquainted
with
the
figure
of
my
drama
*punct* ;
its
scheme
is
none
of
mine
*punct* .
*break*
often
enough
*punct* ,
in
those
days
*punct* ,
i
found
a
fitness
in
the
lines
of
omar
*punct* :
we
are
no
other
than
a
moving
show
of
magic
shadow-shapes
that
come
and
go
round
with
the
sun-illumined
lantern
held
in
midnight
by
the
master
of
the
show
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
master
of
the
show
*punct* ,
in
this
case
*punct* ,
was
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
i
have
been
asked
many
times
since
the
days
with
which
these
records
deal
*punct* :
who
was
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ?
*break*
let
me
confess
here
that
my
final
answer
must
be
postponed
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
only
indicate
*punct* ,
at
this
place
*punct* ,
the
trend
of
my
reasoning
*punct* ,
and
leave
my
reader
to
form
whatever
conclusion
he
pleases
*punct* .
*break*
what
group
can
we
isolate
and
label
as
responsible
for
the
overthrow
of
the
manchus
*punct* ?
*break*
the
casual
student
of
modern
chinese
history
will
reply
*punct* :
young
china
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
unsatisfactory
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
we
mean
by
young
china
*punct* ?
*break*
in
my
own
hearing
fu-manchu
had
disclaimed
*punct* ,
with
scorn
*punct* ,
association
with
the
whole
of
that
movement
*punct* ;
and
assuming
that
the
name
were
not
an
assumed
one
*punct* ,
he
clearly
can
have
been
no
anti-manchu
*punct* ,
no
republican
*punct* .
*break*
the
chinese
republican
is
of
the
mandarin
class
*punct* ,
but
of
a
new
generation
which
veneers
its
con
fucianism
with
western
polish
*punct* .
*break*
these
youthful
and
unbalanced
reformers
*punct* ,
in
conjunction
with
older
but
no
less
ill-balanced
provincial
politicians
*punct* ,
may
be
said
to
represent
young
china
*punct* .
*break*
amid
such
turmoils
as
this
we
invariably
look
for
*punct* ,
and
invariably
find
*punct* ,
a
third
party
*punct* .
*break*
in
my
opinion
*punct* ,
dr.
fu-manchu
was
one
of
the
leaders
of
such
a
party
*punct* .
*break*
another
question
often
put
to
me
was
*punct* :
where
did
the
doctor
hide
during
the
time
that
he
pursued
his
operations
in
london
*punct* ?
*break*
this
is
more
susceptible
of
explanation
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
time
nayland
smith
supposed
*punct* ,
as
i
did
myself
*punct* ,
that
the
opium
den
adjacent
to
the
old
ratcliff
highway
was
the
chinaman's
base
of
operations
*punct* ;
later
we
came
to
believe
that
the
mansion
near
windsor
was
his
hiding-place
*punct* ,
and
later
still
*punct* ,
the
hulk
lying
off
the
downstream
flats
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
think
i
can
state
with
confidence
that
the
spot
which
he
had
chosen
for
his
home
was
neither
of
these
*punct* ,
but
the
east
end
riverside
building
which
i
was
the
first
to
enter
*punct* .
*break*
of
this
i
am
all
but
sure
*punct* ;
for
the
reason
that
it
not
only
was
the
home
of
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
of
karamaneh
*punct* ,
and
of
her
brother
*punct* ,
aziz
*punct* ,
but
the
home
of
something
else
*punct* ,
of
something
which
i
shall
speak
of
later
*punct* .
*break*
the
dreadful
tragedy
*punct* ,
or
series
of
tragedies
*punct* ,
which
attended
the
raid
upon
the
place
will
always
mark
in
my
memory
the
supreme
horror
of
a
horrible
case
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
endeavor
to
explain
what
occurred
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
aid
of
karamaneh
*punct* ,
you
have
seen
how
we
had
located
the
whilom
warehouse
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
from
the
exterior
*punct* ,
was
so
drab
and
dreary
*punct* ,
but
which
within
was
a
place
of
wondrous
luxury
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
moment
selected
by
our
beautiful
accomplice
*punct* ,
inspector
weymouth
and
a
body
of
detectives
entirely
surrounded
it
*punct* ;
a
river
police
launch
lay
off
the
wharf
which
opened
from
it
on
the
river-side
*punct* ;
and
this
upon
a
singularly
black
night
*punct* ,
than
which
a
better
could
not
have
been
chosen
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
fulfill
your
promise
to
me
*punct* ?
*break*
said
karamaneh
*punct* ,
and
looked
up
into
my
face
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
enveloped
in
a
big
*punct* ,
loose
cloak
*punct* ,
and
from
the
shadow
of
the
hood
her
wonderful
eyes
gleamed
out
like
stars
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
wish
us
to
do
*punct* ?
*break*
asked
nayland
smith
*punct* .
*break*
you
*punct* ,
and
dr.
petrie
*punct* ,
she
replied
swiftly
*punct* ,
must
enter
first
*punct* ,
and
bring
out
aziz
*punct* .
*break*
until
he
is
safe
*punct* ,
until
he
is
out
of
that
place
*punct* ,
you
are
to
make
no
attempt
upon
*punct* ,
upon
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ?
*break*
interrupted
weymouth
*punct* ;
for
karamaneh
hesitated
to
pronounce
the
dreaded
name
*punct* ,
as
she
always
did
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
can
we
be
sure
that
there
is
no
trap
laid
for
us
*punct* ?
*break*
the
scotland
yard
man
did
not
entirely
share
my
confidence
in
the
integrity
of
this
eastern
girl
whom
he
knew
to
have
been
a
creature
of
the
chinaman's
*punct* .
*break*
aziz
lies
in
the
private
room
*punct* ,
she
explained
eagerly
*punct* ,
her
old
accent
more
noticeable
than
usual
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
only
one
of
the
burmese
men
in
the
house
*punct* ,
and
he
*punct* ,
he
dare
not
enter
without
orders
*punct* !
*break*
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
be
your
prisoner
within
ten
minutes
from
now
*punct* !
*break*
i
have
no
time
for
words
*punct* ,
you
must
believe
*punct* !
*break*
she
stamped
her
foot
impatiently
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
dacoit
*punct* ?
*break*
i
think
perhaps
i'd
better
come
in
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
said
weymouth
slowly
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
quick
impatience
*punct* ,
and
unlocked
the
door
in
the
high
brick
wall
which
divided
the
gloomy
*punct* ,
evil-smelling
court
from
the
luxurious
apartments
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
make
no
noise
*punct* ,
she
warned
*punct* .
*break*
and
smith
and
myself
followed
her
along
the
uncarpeted
passage
beyond
*punct* .
*break*
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ,
with
a
final
word
of
instruction
to
his
second
in
command
*punct* ,
brought
up
the
rear
*punct* .
*break*
the
door
was
reclosed
*punct* ;
a
few
paces
farther
on
a
second
was
unlocked
*punct* .
*break*
passing
through
a
small
room
*punct* ,
unfurnished
*punct* ,
a
farther
passage
led
us
to
a
balcony
*punct* .
*break*
the
transition
was
startling
*punct* .
*break*
darkness
was
about
us
now
*punct* ,
and
silence
*punct* :
a
perfumed
*punct* ,
slumberous
darkness
*punct* ,
a
silence
full
of
mystery
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
beyond
the
walls
of
the
apartment
whereon
we
looked
down
waged
the
unceasing
battle
of
sounds
that
is
the
hymn
of
the
great
industrial
river
*punct* .
*break*
about
the
scented
confines
which
bounded
us
now
floated
the
smoke-laden
vapors
of
the
lower
thames
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
metallic
but
infinitely
human
clangor
of
dock-side
life
*punct* ,
from
the
unpleasant
but
homely
odors
which
prevail
where
ships
swallow
in
and
belch
out
the
concrete
evidences
of
commercial
prosperity
*punct* ,
we
had
come
into
this
incensed
stillness
*punct* ,
where
one
shaded
lamp
painted
dim
enlargements
of
its
chinese
silk
upon
the
nearer
walls
*punct* ,
and
left
the
greater
part
of
the
room
the
darker
for
its
contrast
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
of
the
thames-side
activity
*punct* ,
of
the
riveting
and
scraping
*punct* ,
the
bumping
of
bales
*punct* ,
the
bawling
of
orders
*punct* ,
the
hiss
of
steam
*punct* ,
penetrated
to
this
perfumed
place
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
pool
of
tinted
light
lay
the
deathlike
figure
of
a
dark-haired
boy
*punct* ,
karamaneh's
muffled
form
bending
over
him
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
i
stand
in
the
house
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
despite
the
girl's
assurance
*punct* ,
we
knew
that
proximity
to
the
sinister
chinaman
must
be
fraught
with
danger
*punct* .
*break*
we
stood
*punct* ,
not
in
the
lion's
den
*punct* ,
but
in
the
serpent's
lair
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
time
when
nayland
smith
had
come
from
burma
in
pursuit
of
this
advance-guard
of
a
cogent
yellow
peril
*punct* ,
the
face
of
dr.
fu-manchu
rarely
had
been
absent
from
my
dreams
day
or
night
*punct* .
*break*
the
millions
might
sleep
in
peace
*punct* ,
the
millions
in
whose
cause
we
labored!
*punct* ,
but
we
who
knew
the
reality
of
the
danger
knew
that
a
veritable
octopus
had
fastened
upon
england
*punct* ,
a
yellow
octopus
whose
head
was
that
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
whose
tentacles
were
dacoity
*punct* ,
thuggee
*punct* ,
modes
of
death
*punct* ,
secret
and
swift
*punct* ,
which
in
the
darkness
plucked
men
from
life
and
left
no
clew
behind
*punct* .
*break*
i
called
softly
*punct* .
*break*
the
muffled
form
beneath
the
lamp
turned
so
that
the
soft
light
fell
upon
the
lovely
face
of
the
slave
girl
*punct* .
*break*
she
who
had
been
a
pliant
instrument
in
the
hands
of
fu-manchu
now
was
to
be
the
means
whereby
society
should
be
rid
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
she
raised
her
finger
warningly
*punct* ;
then
beckoned
me
to
approach
*punct* .
*break*
my
feet
sinking
in
the
rich
pile
of
the
carpet
*punct* ,
i
came
through
the
gloom
of
the
great
apartment
in
to
the
patch
of
light
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
karamaneh
beside
me
*punct* ,
stood
looking
down
upon
the
boy
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
aziz
*punct* ,
her
brother
*punct* ;
dead
so
far
as
western
lore
had
power
to
judge
*punct* ,
but
kept
alive
in
that
deathlike
trance
by
the
uncanny
power
of
the
chinese
doctor
*punct* .
*break*
be
quick
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* ;
be
quick
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
afraid
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
case
which
i
carried
i
took
out
a
needle-syringe
and
a
phial
containing
a
small
quantity
of
amber-hued
liquid
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
drug
not
to
be
found
in
the
british
pharmacopoeia
*punct* .
*break*
of
its
constitution
i
knew
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
although
i
had
had
the
phial
in
my
possession
for
some
days
i
had
not
dared
to
devote
any
of
its
precious
contents
to
analytical
purposes
*punct* .
*break*
the
amber
drops
spelled
life
for
the
boy
aziz
*punct* ,
spelled
success
for
the
mission
of
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
spelled
ruin
for
the
fiendish
chinaman
*punct* .
*break*
i
raised
the
white
coverlet
*punct* .
*break*
the
boy
*punct* ,
fully
dressed
*punct* ,
lay
with
his
arms
crossed
upon
his
breast
*punct* .
*break*
i
discerned
the
mark
of
previous
injections
as
*punct* ,
charging
the
syringe
from
the
phial
*punct* ,
i
made
what
i
hoped
would
be
the
last
of
such
experiments
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
have
given
half
of
my
small
worldly
possessions
to
have
known
the
real
nature
of
the
drug
which
was
now
coursing
through
the
veins
of
aziz
*punct* ,
which
was
tinting
the
grayed
face
with
the
olive
tone
of
life
*punct* ;
which
*punct* ,
so
far
as
my
medical
training
bore
me
*punct* ,
was
restoring
the
dead
to
life
*punct* .
*break*
but
such
was
not
the
purpose
of
my
visit
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
come
to
remove
from
the
house
of
dr.
fu-manchu
the
living
chain
which
bound
karamaneh
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
boy
alive
and
free
*punct* ,
the
doctor's
hold
upon
the
slave
girl
would
be
broken
*punct* .
*break*
my
lovely
companion
*punct* ,
her
hands
convulsively
clasped
*punct* ,
knelt
and
devoured
with
her
eyes
the
face
of
the
boy
who
was
passing
through
the
most
amazing
physiological
change
in
the
history
of
therapeutics
*punct* .
*break*
the
peculiar
perfume
which
she
wore
*punct* ,
which
seemed
to
be
a
part
of
her
*punct* ,
which
always
i
associated
with
her
*punct* ,
was
faintly
perceptible
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
was
breathing
rapidly
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
nothing
to
fear
*punct* ,
i
whispered
*punct* ;
see
*punct* ,
he
is
reviving
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
few
moments
all
will
be
well
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
hanging
lamp
with
its
garishly
colored
shade
swung
gently
above
us
*punct* ,
wafted
*punct* ,
it
seemed
*punct* ,
by
some
draught
which
passed
through
the
apartment
*punct* .
*break*
the
boy's
heavy
lids
began
to
quiver
*punct* ,
and
karamaneh
nervously
clutched
my
arm
*punct* ,
and
held
me
so
whilst
we
watched
for
the
long-lashed
eyes
to
open
*punct* .
*break*
the
stillness
of
the
place
was
positively
unnatural
*punct* ;
it
seemed
inconceivable
that
all
about
us
was
the
discordant
activity
of
the
commercial
east
end
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
this
eerie
silence
was
becoming
oppressive
*punct* ;
it
began
positively
to
appall
me
*punct* .
*break*
inspector
weymouth's
wondering
face
peeped
over
my
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ?
*break*
i
whispered
*punct* ,
as
nayland
smith
in
turn
appeared
beside
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
understand
the
silence
of
the
house
*punct* ,
look
about
*punct* ,
replied
karamaneh
*punct* ,
never
taking
her
eyes
from
the
face
of
aziz
*punct* .
*break*
i
peered
around
the
shadowy
walls
*punct* .
*break*
tall
glass
cases
there
were
*punct* ,
shelves
and
niches
*punct* :
where
once
*punct* ,
from
the
gallery
above
*punct* ,
i
had
seen
the
tubes
and
retorts
*punct* ,
the

the

*break*
shelves

were
bare

*break*
of
the
complicated

unknown

pursued

he
isolated

unclassified

the

no

*break*
the

all
were
gone
*punct* .
*break*
the
room
was
stripped
*punct* ,
dismantled
*punct* .
*break*
had
fu-manchu
fled
*punct* ?
*break*
the
silence
assumed
a
new
significance
*punct* .
*break*
his
dacoits
and
kindred
ministers
of
death
all
must
have
fled
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
let
him
escape
us
*punct* !
*break*
i
said
rapidly
*punct* .
*break*
you
promised
to
aid
us
to
capture
him
*punct* ,
to
send
us
a
message
*punct* ,
and
you
have
delayed
until
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* ;
no
*punct* !
*break*
and
clutched
at
my
arm
again
*punct* .
*break*
is
he
not
reviving
slowly
*punct* ?
*break*
are
you
sure
you
have
made
no
mistake
*punct* ?
*break*
her
thoughts
were
all
for
the
boy
*punct* ;
and
her
solicitude
touched
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
again
examined
aziz
*punct* ,
the
most
remarkable
patient
of
my
busy
professional
career
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
counted
the
strengthening
pulse
*punct* ,
he
opened
his
dark
eyes
*punct* ,
which
were
so
like
the
eyes
of
karamaneh
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
with
the
girl's
eager
arms
tightly
about
him
*punct* ,
sat
up
*punct* ,
looking
wonderingly
around
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
pressed
her
cheek
to
his
*punct* ,
whispering
loving
words
in
that
softly
spoken
arabic
which
had
first
betrayed
her
nationality
to
nayland
smith
*punct* .
*break*
i
handed
her
my
flask
*punct* ,
which
i
had
filled
with
wine
*punct* .
*break*
my
promise
is
fulfilled
*punct* !
*break*
you
are
free
*punct* !
*break*
now
for
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
but
first
let
us
admit
the
police
to
this
house
*punct* ;
there
is
something
uncanny
in
its
stillness
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
she
replied
*punct* .
*break*
first
let
my
brother
be
taken
out
and
placed
in
safety
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
carry
him
*punct* ?
*break*
she
raised
her
face
to
that
of
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ,
upon
which
was
written
awe
and
wonder
*punct* .
*break*
the
burly
detective
lifted
the
boy
as
tenderly
as
a
woman
*punct* ,
passed
through
the
shadows
to
the
stairway
*punct* ,
ascended
*punct* ,
and
was
swallowed
up
in
the
gloom
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith's
eyes
gleamed
feverishly
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
to
karamaneh
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
not
playing
with
us
*punct* ?
*break*
he
said
harshly
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
done
our
part
*punct* ;
it
remains
for
you
to
do
yours
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
speak
so
loudly
*punct* ,
the
girl
begged
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
near
us
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
god
*punct* ,
i
fear
him
so
*punct* !
*break*
where
is
he
*punct* ?
*break*
persisted
my
friend
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh's
eyes
were
glassy
with
fear
now
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
not
touch
him
until
the
police
are
here
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* ,
but
from
the
direction
of
her
quick
*punct* ,
agitated
glances
i
knew
that
*punct* ,
her
brother
safe
now
*punct* ,
she
feared
for
me
*punct* ,
and
for
me
alone
*punct* .
*break*
those
glances
sent
my
blood
dancing
*punct* ;
for
karamaneh
was
an
eastern
jewel
which
any
man
of
flesh
and
blood
must
have
coveted
had
he
known
it
to
lie
within
his
reach
*punct* .
*break*
her
eyes
were
twin
lakes
of
mystery
which
*punct* ,
more
than
once
*punct* ,
i
had
known
the
desire
to
explore
*punct* .
*break*
look
*punct* ,
beyond
that
curtain
*punct* ,
her
voice
was
barely
audible
*punct* ,
but
do
not
enter
*punct* .
*break*
even
as
he
is
*punct* ,
i
fear
him
*punct* .
*break*
her
voice
*punct* ,
her
palpable
agitation
*punct* ,
prepared
us
for
something
extraordinary
*punct* .
*break*
tragedy
and
fu-manchu
were
never
far
apart
*punct* .
*break*
though
we
were
two
*punct* ,
and
help
was
so
near
*punct* ,
we
were
in
the
abode
of
the
most
cunning
murderer
who
ever
came
out
of
the
east
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
with
strangely
mingled
emotions
that
i
crossed
the
thick
carpet
*punct* ,
nayland
smith
beside
me
*punct* ,
and
drew
aside
the
draperies
concealing
a
door
*punct* ,
to
which
karamaneh
had
pointed
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
upon
looking
into
the
dim
place
beyond
*punct* ,
all
else
save
what
it
held
was
forgotten
*punct* .
*break*
we
looked
upon
a
small
*punct* ,
square
room
*punct* ,
the
walls
draped
with
fantastic
chinese
tapestry
*punct* ,
the
floor
strewn
with
cushions
*punct* ;
and
reclining
in
a
corner
*punct* ,
where
the
faint
*punct* ,
blue
light
from
a
lamp
*punct* ,
placed
upon
a
low
table
*punct* ,
painted
grotesque
shadows
about
the
cavernous
face
*punct* ,
was
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
at
sight
of
him
my
heart
leaped
*punct* ,
and
seemed
to
suspend
its
functions
*punct* ,
so
intense
was
the
horror
which
this
man's
presence
inspired
in
me
*punct* .
*break*
my
hand
clutching
the
curtain
*punct* ,
i
stood
watching
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
lids
veiled
the
malignant
green
eyes
*punct* ,
but
the
thin
lips
seemed
to
smile
*punct* .
*break*
then
smith
silently
pointed
to
the
hand
which
held
a
little
pipe
*punct* .
*break*
a
sickly
perfume
assailed
my
nostrils
*punct* ,
and
the
explanation
of
the
hushed
silence
*punct* ,
and
the
ease
with
which
we
had
thus
far
executed
our
plan
*punct* ,
came
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
the
cunning
mind
was
torpid
*punct* ,
lost
in
a
brutish
world
of
dreams
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
was
in
an
opium
sleep
*punct* !
*break*
the
dim
light
traced
out
a
network
of
tiny
lines
*punct* ,
which
covered
the
yellow
face
from
the
pointed
chin
to
the
top
of
the
great
domed
brow
*punct* ,
and
formed
deep
shadow
pools
in
the
hollows
beneath
his
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
we
had
triumphed
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
determine
the
depth
of
his
obscene
trance
*punct* ;
and
mastering
some
of
my
repugnance
*punct* ,
and
forgetful
of
karamaneh's
warning
*punct* ,
i
was
about
to
step
forward
into
the
room
*punct* ,
loaded
with
its
nauseating
opium
fumes
*punct* ,
when
a
soft
breath
fanned
my
cheek
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
go
in
*punct* !
*break*
came
karamaneh's
warning
voice
*punct* ,
hushed
*punct* ,
trembling
*punct* .
*break*
her
little
hand
grasped
my
arm
*punct* .
*break*
she
drew
smith
and
myself
back
from
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
danger
there
*punct* !
*break*
do
not
enter
that
room
*punct* !
*break*
the
police
must
reach
him
in
some
way
*punct* ,
and
drag
him
out
*punct* !
*break*
do
not
enter
that
room
*punct* !
*break*
the
girl's
voice
quivered
hysterically
*punct* ;
her
eyes
blazed
into
savage
flame
*punct* .
*break*
the
fierce
resentment
born
of
dreadful
wrongs
was
consuming
her
now
*punct* ;
but
fear
of
fu-manchu
held
her
yet
*punct* .
*break*
inspector
weymouth
came
down
the
stairs
and
joined
us
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
sent
the
boy
to
ryman's
room
at
the
station
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
the
divisional
surgeon
will
look
after
him
until
you
arrive
*punct* ,
dr.
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
all
is
ready
now
*punct* .
*break*
the
launch
is
just
off
the
wharf
and
every
side
of
the
place
under
observation
*punct* .
*break*
where's
our
man
*punct* ?
*break*
he
drew
a
pair
of
handcuffs
from
his
pocket
and
raised
his
eyebrows
interrogatively
*punct* .
*break*
the
absence
of
sound
*punct* ,
of
any
demonstration
from
the
uncanny
chinaman
whom
he
was
there
to
arrest
*punct* ,
puzzled
him
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
jerked
his
thumb
toward
the
curtain
*punct* .
*break*
at
that
*punct* ,
and
before
we
could
utter
a
word
*punct* ,
weymouth
stepped
to
the
draped
door
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
man
who
drove
straight
at
his
goal
and
saved
reflections
for
subsequent
leisure
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
*punct* ,
stripped
as
it
was
it
retained
its
heavy
*punct* ,
voluptuous
perfume
*punct* ,
had
begun
to
get
a
hold
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
anxious
to
shake
it
off
*punct* ;
to
be
up
and
doing
*punct* .
*break*
he
pulled
the
curtain
aside
and
stepped
into
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
smith
and
i
perforce
followed
him
*punct* .
*break*
just
within
the
door
the
three
of
us
stood
looking
across
at
the
limp
thing
which
had
spread
terror
throughout
the
eastern
and
western
world
*punct* .
*break*
helpless
as
fu-manchu
was
*punct* ,
he
inspired
terror
now
*punct* ,
though
the
giant
intellect
was
inert
*punct* ,
stupefied
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
dimly
lit
apartment
we
had
quitted
i
heard
karamaneh
utter
a
stifled
scream
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
came
too
late
*punct* .
*break*
as
though
cast
up
by
a
volcano
*punct* ,
the
silken
cushions
*punct* ,
the
inlaid
table
with
its
blue-shaded
lamp
*punct* ,
the
garish
walls
*punct* ,
the
sprawling
figure
with
the
ghastly
light
playing
upon
its
features
*punct* ,
quivered
*punct* ,
and
shot
upward
*punct* !
*break*
so
it
seemed
to
me
*punct* ;
though
*punct* ,
in
the
ensuing
instant
i
remembered
*punct* ,
too
late
*punct* ,
a
previous
experience
of
the
floors
of
fu-manchu's
private
apartments
*punct* ;
i
knew
what
had
indeed
befallen
us
*punct* .
*break*
a
trap
had
been
released
beneath
our
feet
*punct* .
*break*
i
recall
falling
*punct* ,
but
have
no
recollection
of
the
end
of
my
fall
*punct* ,
of
the
shock
marking
the
drop
*punct* .
*break*
i
only
remember
fighting
for
my
life
against
a
stifling
something
which
had
me
by
the
throat
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
that
i
was
being
suffocated
*punct* ,
but
my
hands
met
only
the
deathly
emptiness
*punct* .
*break*
into
a
poisonous
well
of
darkness
i
sank
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
cry
out
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
helpless
*punct* .
*break*
of
the
fate
of
my
companions
i
knew
nothing
*punct* ,
could
surmise
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ...
all
consciousness
ended
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
being
carried
along
a
dimly
lighted
*punct* ,
tunnel-like
place
*punct* ,
slung
*punct* ,
sackwise
*punct* ,
across
the
shoulder
of
a
burman
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
not
a
big
man
*punct* ,
but
he
supported
my
considerable
weight
with
apparent
ease
*punct* .
*break*
a
deadly
nausea
held
me
*punct* ,
but
the
rough
handling
had
served
to
restore
me
to
consciousness
*punct* .
*break*
my
hands
and
feet
were
closely
lashed
*punct* .
*break*
i
hung
limply
as
a
wet
towel
*punct* :
i
felt
that
this
spark
of
tortured
life
which
had
flickered
up
in
me
must
ere
long
finally
become
extinguished
*punct* .
*break*
a
fancy
possessed
me
*punct* ,
in
these
the
first
moments
of
my
restoration
to
the
world
of
realities
*punct* ,
that
i
had
been
smuggled
into
china
*punct* ;
and
as
i
swung
head
downward
i
told
myself
that
the
huge
*punct* ,
puffy
things
which
strewed
the
path
were
a
species
of
giant
toadstool
*punct* ,
unfamiliar
to
me
and
possibly
peculiar
to
whatever
district
of
china
i
now
was
in
*punct* .
*break*
the
air
was
hot
*punct* ,
steamy
*punct* ,
and
loaded
with
a
smell
as
of
rotting
vegetation
*punct* .
*break*
i
wondered
why
my
bearer
so
scrupulously
avoided
touching
any
of
the
unwholesome-looking
growths
in
passing
through
what
seemed
a
succession
of
cellars
*punct* ,
but
steered
a
tortuous
course
among
the
bloated
*punct* ,
unnatural
shapes
*punct* ,
lifting
his
bare
brown
feet
with
a
catlike
delicacy
*punct* .
*break*
he
passed
under
a
low
arch
*punct* ,
dropped
me
roughly
to
the
ground
and
ran
back
*punct* .
*break*
half
stunned
*punct* ,
i
lay
watching
the
agile
brown
body
melt
into
the
distances
of
the
cellars
*punct* .
*break*
their
walls
and
roof
seemed
to
emit
a
faint
*punct* ,
phosphorescent
light
*punct* .
*break*
came
a
weak
voice
from
somewhere
ahead
*punct* ...
is
that
you
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ?
*break*
it
was
nayland
smith
*punct* !
*break*
i
said
*punct* ,
and
strove
to
sit
up
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
intense
nausea
overcame
me
*punct* ,
so
that
i
all
but
swooned
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
his
voice
again
*punct* ,
but
could
attach
no
meaning
to
the
words
which
he
uttered
*punct* .
*break*
a
sound
of
terrific
blows
reached
my
ears
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
the
burman
reappeared
*punct* ,
bending
under
the
heavy
load
which
he
bore
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
as
he
picked
his
way
through
the
bloated
things
which
grew
upon
the
floors
of
the
cellars
*punct* ,
i
realized
that
he
was
carrying
the
inert
body
of
inspector
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
found
time
to
compare
the
strength
of
the
little
brown
man
with
that
of
a
nile
beetle
*punct* ,
which
can
raise
many
times
its
own
weight
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
behind
him
*punct* ,
appeared
a
second
figure
*punct* ,
which
immediately
claimed
the
whole
of
my
errant
attention
*punct* .
*break*
hissed
my
friend
*punct* ,
from
the
darkness
which
concealed
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
indeed
none
other
than
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
the
fu-manchu
whom
we
had
thought
to
be
helpless
*punct* .
*break*
the
deeps
of
the
chinaman's
cunning
*punct* ,
the
fine
quality
of
his
courage
*punct* ,
were
forced
upon
me
as
amazing
facts
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
assumed
the
appearance
of
a
drugged
opium-smoker
so
well
as
to
dupe
me
*punct* ,
a
medical
man
*punct* ;
so
well
as
to
dupe
karamaneh
*punct* ,
whose
experience
of
the
noxious
habit
probably
was
greater
than
my
own
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
with
the
gallows
dangling
before
him
*punct* ,
he
had
waited
*punct* ,
played
the
part
of
a
lure
*punct* ,
whilst
a
body
of
police
actually
surrounded
the
place
*punct* !
*break*
i
have
since
thought
that
the
room
probably
was
one
which
he
actually
used
for
opium
debauches
*punct* ,
and
the
device
of
the
trap
was
intended
to
protect
him
during
the
comatose
period
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
holding
a
lantern
above
his
head
*punct* ,
the
deviser
of
the
trap
whereinto
we
*punct* ,
mouselike
*punct* ,
had
blindly
entered
*punct* ,
came
through
the
cellars
*punct* ,
following
the
brown
man
who
carried
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
the
faint
rays
of
the
lantern
*punct* ,
it
apparently
contained
a
candle
*punct* ,
revealed
a
veritable
forest
of
the
gigantic
fungi
*punct* ,
poisonously
colored
*punct* ,
hideously
swollen
*punct* ,
climbing
from
the
floor
up
the
slimy
walls
*punct* ,
climbing
like
horrid
parasites
to
such
part
of
the
arched
roof
as
was
visible
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
picked
his
way
through
the
fungi
ranks
as
daintily
as
though
the
distorted
*punct* ,
tumid
things
had
been
viper-headed
*punct* .
*break*
the
resounding
blows
which
i
had
noted
before
*punct* ,
and
which
had
never
ceased
*punct* ,
culminated
in
a
splintering
crash
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
fu-manchu
and
his
servant
*punct* ,
who
carried
the
apparently
insensible
detective
*punct* ,
passed
in
under
the
arch
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
glancing
back
once
along
the
passages
*punct* .
*break*
the
lantern
he
extinguished
*punct* ,
or
concealed
*punct* ;
and
whilst
i
waited
*punct* ,
my
mind
dully
surveying
*punct* ,
memories
of
all
the
threats
which
this
uncanny
being
had
uttered
*punct* ,
a
distant
clamor
came
to
my
ears
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
abruptly
*punct* ,
it
ceased
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
fu-manchu
had
closed
a
heavy
door
*punct* ;
and
to
my
surprise
i
perceived
that
the
greater
part
of
it
was
of
glass
*punct* .
*break*
the
will-o'-the-wisp
glow
which
played
around
the
fungi
rendered
the
vista
of
the
cellars
faintly
luminous
*punct* ,
and
visible
to
me
from
where
i
lay
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
spoke
softly
*punct* .
*break*
his
voice
*punct* ,
its
guttural
note
alternating
with
a
sibilance
on
certain
words
*punct* ,
betrayed
no
traces
of
agitation
*punct* .
*break*
the
man's
unbroken
calm
had
in
it
something
inhuman
*punct* .
*break*
for
he
had
just
perpetrated
an
act
of
daring
unparalleled
in
my
experience
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
the
clamor
now
shut
out
by
the
glass
door
i
tardily
recognized
the
entrance
of
the
police
into
some
barricaded
part
of
the
house
*punct* ,
the
coming
of
those
who
would
save
us
*punct* ,
who
would
hold
the
chinese
doctor
for
the
hangman
*punct* !
*break*
i
have
decided
*punct* ,
he
said
deliberately
*punct* ,
that
you
are
more
worthy
of
my
attention
than
i
had
formerly
supposed
*punct* .
*break*
a
man
who
can
solve
the
secret
of
the
golden
elixir
*punct* ,
i
had
not
solved
it
*punct* ;
i
had
merely
stolen
some
*punct* ,
should
be
a
valuable
acquisition
to
my
council
*punct* .
*break*
the
extent
of
the
plans
of
mr.
commissioner
nayland
smith
and
of
the
english
scotland
yard
it
is
incumbent
upon
me
to
learn
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
you
live
*punct* ,
for
the
present
*punct* !
*break*
and
you'll
swing
*punct* ,
came
weymouth's
hoarse
voice
*punct* ,
in
the
near
future
*punct* !
*break*
you
and
all
your
yellow
gang
*punct* !
*break*
i
trust
not
*punct* ,
was
the
placid
reply
*punct* .
*break*
most
of
my
people
are
safe
*punct* :
some
are
shipped
as
lascars
upon
the
liners
*punct* ;
others
have
departed
by
different
means
*punct* .
*break*
that
last
word
was
the
only
one
indicative
of
excitement
which
had
yet
escaped
him
*punct* .
*break*
a
disk
of
light
danced
among
the
brilliant
poison
hues
of
the
passages
*punct* ,
but
no
sound
reached
us
*punct* ;
by
which
i
knew
that
the
glass
door
must
fit
almost
hermetically
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
much
cooler
here
than
in
the
place
through
which
we
had
passed
*punct* ,
and
the
nausea
began
to
leave
me
*punct* ,
my
brain
to
grow
more
clear
*punct* .
*break*
had
i
known
what
was
to
follow
i
should
have
cursed
the
lucidity
of
mind
which
now
came
to
me
*punct* ;
i
should
have
prayed
for
oblivion
*punct* ,
to
be
spared
the
sight
of
that
which
ensued
*punct* .
*break*
cried
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ;
and
i
could
tell
that
he
was
struggling
to
free
himself
of
his
bonds
*punct* .
*break*
from
his
voice
it
was
evident
that
he
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
was
recovering
from
the
effects
of
the
narcotic
which
had
been
administered
to
us
all
*punct* .
*break*
this
way
*punct* ,
help
*punct* !
*break*
but
the
cry
beat
back
upon
us
in
that
enclosed
space
and
seemed
to
carry
no
farther
than
the
invisible
walls
of
our
prison
*punct* .
*break*
the
door
fits
well
*punct* ,
came
fu-manchu's
mocking
voice
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
fortunate
for
us
all
that
it
is
so
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
my
observation
window
*punct* ,
dr.
petrie
*punct* ,
and
you
are
about
to
enjoy
an
unique
opportunity
of
studying
fungology
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
have
recognized
the
fumes
*punct* ?
*break*
the
chamber
into
which
you
rashly
precipitated
yourselves
was
charged
with
them
*punct* .
*break*
by
a
process
of
my
own
i
have
greatly
enhanced
the
value
of
the
puff-ball
in
this
respect
*punct* .
*break*
your
friend
*punct* ,
mr.
weymouth
*punct* ,
proved
the
most
obstinate
subject
*punct* ;
but
he
succumbed
in
fifteen
seconds
*punct* .
*break*
this
way
*punct* ,
man
*punct* !
*break*
something
very
like
fear
sounded
in
weymouth's
voice
now
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
the
situation
was
so
uncanny
that
it
almost
seemed
unreal
*punct* .
*break*
a
group
of
men
had
entered
the
farthermost
cellars
*punct* ,
led
by
one
who
bore
an
electric
pocket-lamp
*punct* .
*break*
the
hard
*punct* ,
white
ray
danced
from
bloated
gray
fungi
to
others
of
nightmare
shape
*punct* ,
of
dazzling
*punct* ,
venomous
brilliance
*punct* .
*break*
the
mocking
*punct* ,
lecture-room
voice
continued
*punct* :
note
the
snowy
growth
upon
the
roof
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
be
deceived
by
its
size
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
developed
the
spores
of
this
mold
and
have
produced
a
giant
species
*punct* .
*break*
observe
the
interesting
effect
of
the
strong
light
upon
my
orange
and
blue
amanita
fungus
*punct* !
*break*
hard
beside
me
i
heard
nayland
smith
groan
*punct* ,
weymouth
had
become
suddenly
silent
*punct* .
*break*
for
my
own
part
*punct* ,
i
could
have
shrieked
in
pure
horror
*punct* .
*break*
for
i
knew
what
was
coming
*punct* .
*break*
i
realized
in
one
agonized
instant
the
significance
of
the
dim
lantern
*punct* ,
of
the
careful
progress
through
the
subterranean
fungi
grove
*punct* ,
of
the
care
with
which
fu-manchu
and
his
servant
had
avoided
touching
any
of
the
growths
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
that
dr.
fu-manchu
was
the
greatest
fungologist
the
world
had
ever
known
*punct* ;
was
a
poisoner
to
whom
the
borgias
were
as
children
*punct* ,
and
i
knew
that
the
detectives
blindly
were
walking
into
a
valley
of
death
*punct* .
*break*
then
it
began
*punct* ,
the
unnatural
scene
*punct* ,
the
saturnalia
of
murder
*punct* .
*break*
like
so
many
bombs
the
brilliantly
colored
caps
of
the
huge
toadstool-like
things
alluded
to
by
the
chinaman
exploded
*punct* ,
as
the
white
ray
sought
them
out
in
the
darkness
which
alone
preserved
their
existence
*punct* .
*break*
a
brownish
cloud
*punct* ,
i
could
not
determine
whether
liquid
or
powdery
*punct* ,
arose
in
the
cellar
*punct* .
*break*
i
tried
to
close
my
eyes
*punct* ,
or
to
turn
them
away
from
the
reeling
forms
of
the
men
who
were
trapped
in
that
poison-hole
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
useless
*punct* :
i
must
look
*punct* .
*break*
the
bearer
of
the
lamp
had
dropped
it
*punct* ,
but
the
dim
*punct* ,
eerily
illuminated
gloom
endured
scarce
a
second
*punct* .
*break*
a
bright
light
sprang
up
*punct* ,
doubtless
at
the
touch
of
the
fiendish
being
who
now
resumed
speech
*punct* :
observe
the
symptoms
of
delirium
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* !
*break*
out
there
*punct* ,
beyond
the
glass
door
*punct* ,
the
unhappy
victims
were
laughing
*punct* ,
tearing
their
garments
from
their
bodies
*punct* ,
leaping
*punct* ,
waving
their
arms
*punct* ,
were
become
maniacs
*punct* !
*break*
we
will
now
release
the
ripe
spores
of
giant
entpusa
*punct* ,
continued
the
wicked
voice
*punct* .
*break*
the
air
of
the
second
cellar
being
super-charged
with
oxygen
*punct* ,
they
immediately
germinate
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
triumph
*punct* !
*break*
that
process
is
the
scientific
triumph
of
my
life
*punct* !
*break*
like
powdered
snow
the
white
spores
fell
from
the
roof
*punct* ,
frosting
the
writhing
shapes
of
the
already
poisoned
men
*punct* .
*break*
before
my
horrified
gaze
*punct* ,
the
fungus
grew
*punct* ;
it
spread
from
the
head
to
the
*punct* ,
feet
of
those
it
touched
*punct* ;
it
enveloped
them
as
in
glittering
shrouds
*punct* ...
they
die
like
flies
*punct* !
*break*
screamed
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
with
a
sudden
febrile
excitement
*punct* ;
and
i
felt
assured
of
something
i
had
long
suspected
*punct* :
that
that
magnificent
*punct* ,
perverted
brain
was
the
brain
of
a
homicidal
maniac
*punct* ,
though
smith
would
never
accept
the
theory
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
my
fly-trap
*punct* !
*break*
shrieked
the
chinaman
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
am
the
god
of
destruction
*punct* !
*break*
the
clammy
touch
of
the
mist
revived
me
*punct* .
*break*
the
culmination
of
the
scene
in
the
poison
cellars
*punct* ,
together
with
the
effects
of
the
fumes
which
i
had
inhaled
again
*punct* ,
had
deprived
me
of
consciousness
*punct* .
*break*
now
i
knew
that
i
was
afloat
on
the
river
*punct* .
*break*
i
still
was
bound
*punct* :
furthermore
*punct* ,
a
cloth
was
wrapped
tightly
about
my
mouth
*punct* ,
and
i
was
secured
to
a
ring
in
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
by
moving
my
aching
head
to
the
left
i
could
look
down
into
the
oily
water
*punct* ;
by
moving
it
to
the
right
i
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
empurpled
face
of
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
similarly
bound
and
gagged
*punct* ,
lay
beside
me
*punct* ,
but
only
of
the
feet
and
legs
of
nayland
smith
*punct* .
*break*
for
i
could
not
turn
my
head
sufficiently
far
to
see
more
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
aboard
an
electric
launch
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
the
hated
guttural
voice
of
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
subdued
now
to
its
habitual
calm
*punct* ,
and
my
heart
leaped
to
hear
the
voice
that
answered
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
that
of
karamaneh
*punct* .
*break*
his
triumph
was
complete
*punct* .
*break*
clearly
his
plans
for
departure
were
complete
*punct* ;
his
slaughter
of
the
police
in
the
underground
passages
had
been
a
final
reckless
demonstration
of
which
the
chinaman's
subtle
cunning
would
have
been
incapable
had
he
not
known
his
escape
from
the
country
to
be
assured
*punct* .
*break*
what
fate
was
in
store
for
us
*punct* ?
*break*
how
would
he
avenge
himself
upon
the
girl
who
had
betrayed
him
to
his
enemies
*punct* ?
*break*
what
portion
awaited
those
enemies
*punct* ?
*break*
he
seemed
to
have
formed
the
singular
determination
to
smuggle
me
into
china
*punct* ,
but
what
did
he
purpose
in
the
case
of
weymouth
*punct* ,
and
in
the
case
of
nayland
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
all
but
silently
we
were
feeling
our
way
through
the
mist
*punct* .
*break*
astern
died
the
clangor
of
dock
and
wharf
into
a
remote
discord
*punct* .
*break*
ahead
hung
the
foggy
curtain
veiling
the
traffic
of
the
great
waterway
*punct* ;
but
through
it
broke
the
calling
of
sirens
*punct* ,
the
tinkling
of
bells
*punct* .
*break*
the
gentle
movement
of
the
screw
ceased
altogether
*punct* .
*break*
the
launch
lay
heaving
slightly
upon
the
swells
*punct* .
*break*
a
distant
throbbing
grew
louder
*punct* ,
and
something
advanced
upon
us
through
the
haze
*punct* .
*break*
a
bell
rang
and
muffled
by
the
fog
a
voice
proclaimed
itself
*punct* ,
a
voice
which
i
knew
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
weymouth
writhing
impotently
beside
me
*punct* ;
heard
him
mumbling
incoherently
*punct* ;
and
i
knew
that
he
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
had
recognized
the
voice
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
that
of
inspector
ryman
of
the
river
police
and
their
launch
was
within
biscuit-throw
of
that
upon
which
we
lay
*punct* !
*break*
a
feverish
excitement
claimed
me
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
hailing
us
*punct* .
*break*
we
carried
no
lights
*punct* ;
but
now
*punct* ,
and
ignoring
the
pain
which
shot
from
my
spine
to
my
skull
i
craned
my
neck
to
the
left
*punct* ,
the
port
light
of
the
police
launch
glowed
angrily
through
the
mist
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
unable
to
utter
any
save
mumbling
sounds
*punct* ,
and
my
companions
were
equally
helpless
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
desperate
position
*punct* .
*break*
had
the
police
seen
us
or
had
they
hailed
at
random
*punct* ?
*break*
the
light
drew
nearer
*punct* .
*break*
launch
*punct* ,
hoy
*punct* !
*break*
they
had
seen
us
*punct* !
*break*
fu-manchu's
guttural
voice
spoke
shortly
*punct* ,
and
our
screw
began
to
revolve
again
*punct* ;
we
leaped
ahead
into
the
bank
of
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
faint
grew
the
light
of
the
police
launch
*punct* ,
and
was
gone
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
heard
ryman's
voice
shouting
*punct* .
*break*
came
faintly
through
the
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
murk
closed
down
*punct* ,
and
with
our
friends
far
astern
of
us
we
were
racing
deeper
into
the
fog
banks
*punct* ,
speeding
seaward
*punct* ;
though
of
this
i
was
unable
to
judge
at
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
on
we
raced
*punct* ,
and
on
*punct* ,
sweeping
over
growing
swells
*punct* .
*break*
once
*punct* ,
a
black
*punct* ,
towering
shape
dropped
down
upon
us
*punct* .
*break*
far
above
*punct* ,
lights
blazed
*punct* ,
bells
rang
*punct* ,
vague
cries
pierced
the
fog
*punct* .
*break*
the
launch
pitched
and
rolled
perilously
*punct* ,
but
weathered
the
wash
of
the
liner
which
so
nearly
had
concluded
this
episode
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
such
a
journey
as
i
had
taken
once
before
*punct* ,
early
in
our
pursuit
of
the
genius
of
the
yellow
peril
*punct* ;
but
this
was
infinitely
more
terrible
*punct* ;
for
now
we
were
utterly
in
fu-manchu's
power
*punct* .
*break*
a
voice
mumbled
in
my
ear
*punct* .
*break*
i
turned
my
bound-up
face
*punct* ;
and
inspector
weymouth
raised
his
hands
in
the
dimness
and
partly
slipped
the
bandage
from
his
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
i've
been
working
at
the
cords
since
we
left
those
filthy
cellars
*punct* ,
he
whispered
*punct* .
*break*
my
wrists
are
all
cut
*punct* ,
but
when
i've
got
out
a
knife
and
freed
my
ankles
*punct* ,
smith
had
kicked
him
with
his
bound
feet
*punct* .
*break*
the
detective
slipped
the
bandage
back
to
position
and
placed
his
hands
behind
him
again
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
wearing
a
heavy
overcoat
but
no
hat
*punct* ,
came
aft
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
dragging
karamaneh
by
the
wrists
*punct* .
*break*
he
seated
himself
on
the
cushions
near
to
us
*punct* ,
pulling
the
girl
down
beside
him
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
i
could
see
her
face
*punct* ,
and
the
expression
in
her
beautiful
eyes
made
me
writhe
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
was
watching
us
*punct* ,
his
discolored
teeth
faintly
visible
in
the
dim
light
*punct* ,
to
which
my
eyes
were
becoming
accustomed
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
petrie
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
you
shall
be
my
honored
guest
at
my
home
in
china
*punct* .
*break*
you
shall
assist
me
to
revolutionize
chemistry
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
i
fear
you
know
more
of
my
plans
than
i
had
deemed
it
possible
for
you
to
have
learned
*punct* ,
and
i
am
anxious
to
know
if
you
have
a
confidant
*punct* .
*break*
where
your
memory
fails
you
*punct* ,
and
my
files
and
wire
jackets
prove
ineffectual
*punct* ,
inspector
weymouth's
recollections
may
prove
more
accurate
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
to
the
cowering
girl
*punct* ,
who
shrank
away
from
him
in
pitiful
*punct* ,
abject
terror
*punct* .
*break*
in
my
hands
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ,
he
continued
*punct* ,
i
hold
a
needle
charged
with
a
rare
culture
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
the
link
between
the
bacilli
and
the
fungi
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
seemed
to
display
an
undue
interest
in
the
peach
and
pearl
which
render
my
karamaneh
so
delightful
*punct* ,
in
the
supple
grace
of
her
movements
and
the
sparkle
of
her
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
you
can
never
devote
your
whole
mind
to
those
studies
which
i
have
planned
for
you
whilst
such
distractions
exist
*punct* .
*break*
a
touch
of
this
keen
point
*punct* ,
and
the
laughing
karamaneh
becomes
the
shrieking
hag
*punct* ,
the
maniacal
*punct* ,
mowing
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
with
an
ox-like
rush
*punct* ,
weymouth
was
upon
him
*punct* !
*break*
karamaneh
*punct* ,
wrought
upon
past
endurance
*punct* ,
with
a
sobbing
cry
*punct* ,
sank
to
the
deck
*punct* ,
and
lay
still
*punct* .
*break*
i
managed
to
writhe
into
a
half-sitting
posture
*punct* ,
and
smith
rolled
aside
as
the
detective
and
the
chinaman
crashed
down
together
*punct* .
*break*
weymouth
had
one
big
hand
at
the
doctor's
yellow
throat
*punct* ;
with
his
left
he
grasped
the
chinaman's
right
*punct* .
*break*
it
held
the
needle
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
i
could
look
along
*punct* ,
the
length
of
the
little
craft
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
so
far
as
it
was
possible
to
make
out
in
the
fog
*punct* ,
only
one
other
was
aboard
*punct* ,
the
half-clad
brown
man
who
navigated
her
*punct* ,
and
who
had
carried
us
through
the
cellars
*punct* .
*break*
the
murk
had
grown
denser
and
now
shut
us
in
like
a
box
*punct* .
*break*
the
throb
of
the
motor
*punct* ,
the
hissing
breath
of
the
two
who
fought
*punct* ,
with
so
much
at
issue
*punct* ,
these
sounds
and
the
wash
of
the
water
alone
broke
the
eerie
stillness
*punct* .
*break*
by
slow
degrees
*punct* ,
and
with
a
reptilian
agility
horrible
to
watch
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
was
neutralizing
the
advantage
gained
by
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
his
clawish
fingers
were
fast
in
the
big
man's
throat
*punct* ;
the
right
hand
with
its
deadly
needle
was
forcing
down
the
left
of
his
opponent
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
underneath
*punct* ,
but
now
he
was
gaining
the
upper
place
*punct* .
*break*
his
powers
of
physical
endurance
must
have
been
truly
marvelous
*punct* .
*break*
his
breath
was
whistling
through
his
nostrils
significantly
*punct* ,
but
weymouth
was
palpably
tiring
*punct* .
*break*
the
latter
suddenly
changed
his
tactics
*punct* .
*break*
by
a
supreme
effort
*punct* ,
to
which
he
was
spurred
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
by
the
growing
proximity
of
the
needle
*punct* ,
he
raised
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
by
the
throat
and
arm
*punct* ,
and
pitched
him
sideways
*punct* .
*break*
the
chinaman's
grip
did
not
relax
*punct* ,
and
the
two
wrestlers
dropped
*punct* ,
a
writhing
mass
*punct* ,
upon
the
port
cushions
*punct* .
*break*
the
launch
heeled
over
*punct* ,
and
my
cry
of
horror
was
crushed
back
into
my
throat
by
the
bandage
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
as
fu-manchu
sought
to
extricate
himself
*punct* ,
he
overbalanced
*punct* ,
fell
back
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
bearing
weymouth
with
him
*punct* ,
slid
into
the
river
*punct* !
*break*
the
mist
swallowed
them
up
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
moments
of
which
no
man
can
recall
his
mental
impressions
*punct* ,
moments
so
acutely
horrible
that
*punct* ,
mercifully
*punct* ,
our
memory
retains
nothing
of
the
emotions
they
occasioned
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
one
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
a
chaos
ruled
in
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
a
vague
belief
that
the
burman
*punct* ,
forward
*punct* ,
glanced
back
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
course
of
the
launch
was
changed
*punct* .
*break*
how
long
intervened
between
the
tragic
end
of
that
gargantuan
struggle
and
the
time
when
a
black
wall
leaped
suddenly
up
before
us
i
cannot
pretend
to
state
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
sickening
jerk
we
ran
aground
*punct* .
*break*
a
loud
explosion
ensued
*punct* ,
and
i
clearly
remember
seeing
the
brown
man
leap
out
into
the
fog
*punct* ,
which
was
the
last
i
saw
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
water
began
to
wash
aboard
*punct* .
*break*
fully
alive
to
our
imminent
peril
*punct* ,
i
fought
with
the
cords
that
bound
me
*punct* ;
but
i
lacked
poor
weymouth's
strength
of
wrist
*punct* ,
and
i
began
to
accept
as
a
horrible
and
imminent
possibility
*punct* ,
a
death
from
drowning
*punct* ,
within
six
feet
of
the
bank
*punct* .
*break*
beside
me
*punct* ,
nayland
smith
was
straining
and
twisting
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
his
object
was
to
touch
karamaneh
*punct* ,
in
the
hope
of
arousing
her
*punct* .
*break*
where
he
failed
in
his
project
*punct* ,
the
inflowing
water
succeeded
*punct* .
*break*
a
silent
prayer
of
thankfulness
came
from
my
very
soul
when
i
saw
her
stir
*punct* ,
when
i
saw
her
raise
her
hands
to
her
head
*punct* ,
and
saw
the
big
*punct* ,
horror-bright
eyes
gleam
through
the
mist
veil
*punct* .
*break*
we
quitted
the
wrecked
launch
but
a
few
seconds
before
her
stern
settled
down
into
the
river
*punct* .
*break*
where
the
mud-bank
upon
which
we
found
ourselves
was
situated
we
had
no
idea
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
least
it
was
terra
firma
and
we
were
free
from
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
smith
stood
looking
out
towards
the
river
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
thinking
*punct* ,
as
i
was
*punct* ,
of
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
*punct* ,
an
hour
later
*punct* ,
the
police
boat
located
us
*punct* ,
on
the
mud-flats
below
greenwich
*punct* ,
and
we
heard
that
the
toll
of
the
poison
cellars
was
eight
men
*punct* ,
we
also
heard
news
of
our
brave
companion
*punct* .
*break*
back
there
in
the
fog
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
reported
inspector
ryman
*punct* ,
who
was
in
charge
*punct* ,
and
his
voice
was
under
poor
command
*punct* ,
there
was
an
uncanny
howling
*punct* ,
and
peals
of
laughter
that
i'm
going
to
dream
about
for
weeks
*punct* ,
karamaneh
*punct* ,
who
nestled
beside
me
like
a
frightened
child
*punct* ,
shivered
*punct* ;
and
i
knew
that
the
needle
had
done
its
work
*punct* ,
despite
weymouth's
giant
strength
*punct* .
*break*
smith
swallowed
noisily
*punct* .
*break*
pray
god
the
river
has
that
yellow
satan
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
sacrifice
a
year
of
my
life
to
see
his
rat's
body
on
the
end
of
a
grappling-iron
*punct* !
*break*
we
were
a
sad
party
that
steamed
through
the
fog
homeward
that
night
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
almost
like
deserting
a
staunch
comrade
to
leave
the
spot
*punct* ,
so
nearly
as
we
could
locate
it
*punct* ,
where
weymouth
had
put
up
that
last
gallant
fight
*punct* .
*break*
our
helplessness
was
pathetic
*punct* ,
and
although
*punct* ,
had
the
night
been
clear
as
crystal
*punct* ,
i
doubt
if
we
could
have
acted
otherwise
*punct* ,
it
came
to
me
that
this
stinking
murk
was
a
new
enemy
which
drove
us
back
in
coward
retreat
*punct* .
*break*
but
so
many
were
the
calls
upon
our
activity
*punct* ,
and
so
numerous
the
stimulants
to
our
initiative
in
those
times
*punct* ,
that
soon
we
had
matter
to
relieve
our
minds
from
this
stress
of
sorrow
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
karamaneh
to
be
considered
*punct* ,
karamaneh
and
her
brother
*punct* .
*break*
a
brief
counsel
was
held
*punct* ,
whereat
it
was
decided
that
for
the
present
they
should
be
lodged
at
a
hotel
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
arrange
*punct* ,
smith
whispered
to
me
*punct* ,
for
the
girl
was
watching
us
*punct* ,
to
have
the
place
patrolled
night
and
day
*punct* .
*break*
you
cannot
suppose
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
i
cannot
and
dare
not
suppose
fu-manchu
dead
until
with
my
own
eyes
i
have
seen
him
so
*punct* !
*break*
accordingly
we
conveyed
the
beautiful
oriental
girl
and
her
brother
away
from
that
luxurious
abode
in
its
sordid
setting
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
not
dwell
upon
the
final
scene
in
the
poison
cellars
lest
i
be
accused
of
accumulating
horror
for
horror's
sake
*punct* .
*break*
members
of
the
fire
brigade
*punct* ,
helmed
against
contagion
*punct* ,
brought
out
the
bodies
of
the
victims
wrapped
in
their
living
shrouds
*punct* ...
from
karamaneh
we
learned
much
of
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
little
of
herself
*punct* .
*break*
what
am
i
*punct* ?
*break*
does
my
poor
history
matter
*punct* ,
to
anyone
*punct* ?
*break*
was
her
answer
to
questions
respecting
herself
*punct* .
*break*
and
she
would
droop
her
lashes
over
her
dark
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
the
dacoits
whom
the
chinaman
had
brought
to
england
originally
numbered
seven
*punct* ,
we
learned
*punct* .
*break*
as
you
*punct* ,
having
followed
me
thus
far
*punct* ,
will
be
aware
*punct* ,
we
had
thinned
the
ranks
of
the
burmans
*punct* .
*break*
probably
only
one
now
remained
in
england
*punct* .
*break*
the
thames
had
been
his
highway
*punct* .
*break*
other
members
of
the
group
had
occupied
quarters
in
various
parts
of
the
east
end
*punct* ,
where
sailormen
of
all
nationalities
congregate
*punct* .
*break*
shen-yan's
had
been
the
east
end
headquarters
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
employed
the
hulk
from
the
time
of
his
arrival
*punct* ,
as
a
laboratory
for
a
certain
class
of
experiments
undesirable
in
proximity
to
a
place
of
residence
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
asked
the
girl
on
one
occasion
if
the
chinaman
had
had
a
private
sea-going
vessel
*punct* ,
and
she
replied
in
the
affirmative
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
never
been
on
board
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
had
never
even
set
eyes
upon
it
*punct* ,
and
could
give
us
no
information
respecting
its
character
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
sailed
for
china
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
sure
*punct* ,
asked
smith
keenly
*punct* ,
that
it
has
actually
left
*punct* ?
*break*
i
understood
so
*punct* ,
and
that
we
were
to
follow
by
another
route
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
fu-manchu
to
travel
by
a
passenger
boat
*punct* ?
*break*
i
cannot
say
what
were
his
plans
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
state
of
singular
uncertainty
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
readily
to
be
understood
*punct* ,
we
passed
the
days
following
the
tragedy
which
had
deprived
us
of
our
fellow-worker
*punct* .
*break*
vividly
i
recall
the
scene
at
poor
weymouth's
home
*punct* ,
on
the
day
that
we
visited
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
then
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
inspector's
brother
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
gave
him
a
detailed
account
of
the
last
scene
*punct* .
*break*
out
there
in
the
mist
*punct* ,
he
concluded
wearily
*punct* ,
it
all
seemed
very
unreal
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
to
god
it
had
been
*punct* !
*break*
amen
to
that
*punct* ,
mr.
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
but
your
brother
made
a
gallant
finish
*punct* .
*break*
if
ridding
the
world
of
fu-manchu
were
the
only
good
deed
to
his
credit
*punct* ,
his
life
had
been
well
spent
*punct* .
*break*
james
weymouth
smoked
awhile
in
thoughtful
silence
*punct* .
*break*
though
but
four
and
a
half
miles
s.s.e
*punct* .
*break*
paul's
the
quaint
little
cottage
*punct* ,
with
its
rustic
garden
*punct* ,
shadowed
by
the
tall
trees
which
had
so
lined
the
village
street
before
motor
buses
were
*punct* ,
was
a
spot
as
peaceful
and
secluded
as
any
in
broad
england
*punct* .
*break*
but
another
shadow
lay
upon
it
to-day
*punct* ,
chilling
*punct* ,
fearful
*punct* .
*break*
an
incarnate
evil
had
come
out
of
the
dim
east
and
in
its
dying
malevolence
had
touched
this
home
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
two
things
i
don't
understand
about
it
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
continued
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
what
was
the
meaning
of
the
horrible
laughter
which
the
river
police
heard
in
the
fog
*punct* ?
*break*
and
where
are
the
bodies
*punct* ?
*break*
karamaneh
*punct* ,
seated
beside
me
*punct* ,
shuddered
at
the
words
*punct* .
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
whose
restless
spirit
granted
him
little
repose
*punct* ,
paused
in
his
aimless
wanderings
about
the
room
and
looked
at
her
*punct* .
*break*
in
these
latter
days
of
his
augean
labors
to
purge
england
of
the
unclean
thing
which
had
fastened
upon
her
*punct* ,
my
friend
was
more
lean
and
nervous-looking
than
i
had
ever
known
him
*punct* .
*break*
his
long
residence
in
burma
had
rendered
him
spare
and
had
burned
his
naturally
dark
skin
to
a
coppery
hue
*punct* ;
but
now
his
gray
eyes
had
grown
feverishly
bright
and
his
face
so
lean
as
at
times
to
appear
positively
emaciated
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
knew
that
he
was
as
fit
as
ever
*punct* .
*break*
this
lady
may
be
able
to
answer
your
first
question
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
she
and
her
brother
were
for
some
time
in
the
household
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
mr.
weymouth
*punct* ,
karamaneh
*punct* ,
as
her
name
implies
*punct* ,
was
a
slave
*punct* .
*break*
weymouth
glanced
at
the
beautiful
*punct* ,
troubled
face
with
scarcely
veiled
distrust
*punct* .
*break*
you
don't
look
as
though
you
had
come
from
china
*punct* ,
miss
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
with
a
sort
of
unwilling
admiration
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
come
from
china
*punct* ,
replied
karamaneh
*punct* .
*break*
my
father
was
a
pure
bedawee
*punct* .
*break*
but
my
history
does
not
matter
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
at
times
there
was
something
imperious
in
her
manner
*punct* ;
and
to
this
her
musical
accent
added
force.
*punct* ,
when
your
brave
brother
*punct* ,
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ,
and
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
were
swallowed
up
by
the
river
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
held
a
poisoned
needle
in
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
the
laughter
meant
that
the
needle
had
done
its
work
*punct* .
*break*
your
brother
had
become
mad
*punct* !
*break*
weymouth
turned
aside
to
hide
his
emotion
*punct* .
*break*
what
was
on
the
needle
*punct* ?
*break*
he
asked
huskily
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
something
which
he
prepared
from
the
venom
of
a
kind
of
swamp
adder
*punct* ,
she
answered
*punct* .
*break*
it
produces
madness
*punct* ,
but
not
always
death
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
have
had
a
poor
chance
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* ,
even
had
he
been
in
complete
possession
of
his
senses
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
time
of
the
encounter
we
must
have
been
some
considerable
distance
from
shore
*punct* ,
and
the
fog
was
impenetrable
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
do
you
account
for
the
fact
that
neither
of
the
bodies
have
been
recovered
*punct* ?
*break*
ryman
of
the
river
police
tells
me
that
persons
lost
at
that
point
are
not
always
recovered
*punct* ,
or
not
until
a
considerable
time
later
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
faint
sound
from
the
room
above
*punct* .
*break*
the
news
of
that
tragic
happening
out
in
the
mist
upon
the
thames
had
prostrated
poor
mrs.
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
she
hasn't
been
told
half
the
truth
*punct* ,
said
her
brother-in-law
*punct* .
*break*
she
doesn't
know
about
*punct* ,
the
poisoned
needle
*punct* .
*break*
what
kind
of
fiend
was
this
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ?
*break*
he
burst
out
into
a
sudden
blaze
of
furious
resentment
*punct* .
*break*
john
never
told
me
much
*punct* ,
and
you
have
let
mighty
little
leak
into
the
papers
*punct* .
*break*
what
was
he
*punct* ?
*break*
who
was
he
*punct* ?
*break*
half
he
addressed
the
words
to
smith
*punct* ,
half
to
karamaneh
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
replied
the
former
*punct* ,
was
the
ultimate
expression
of
chinese
cunning
*punct* ;
a
phenomenon
such
as
occurs
but
once
in
many
generations
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
superman
of
incredible
genius
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
had
he
willed
*punct* ,
could
have
revolutionized
science
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
a
superstition
in
some
parts
of
china
according
to
which
*punct* ,
under
certain
peculiar
conditions
*punct* ,
one
of
which
is
proximity
to
a
deserted
burial-ground
*punct* ,
an
evil
spirit
of
incredible
age
may
enter
unto
the
body
of
a
new-born
infant
*punct* .
*break*
all
my
efforts
thus
far
have
not
availed
me
to
trace
the
genealogy
of
the
man
called
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
even
karamaneh
cannot
help
me
in
this
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
have
sometimes
thought
that
he
was
a
member
of
a
certain
very
old
kiangsu
family
*punct* ,
and
that
the
peculiar
conditions
i
have
mentioned
prevailed
at
his
birth
*punct* !
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
observing
our
looks
of
amazement
*punct* ,
laughed
shortly
*punct* ,
and
quite
mirthlessly
*punct* .
*break*
poor
old
weymouth
*punct* !
*break*
i
suppose
my
labors
are
finished
*punct* ;
but
i
am
far
from
triumphant
*punct* .
*break*
is
there
any
improvement
in
mrs.
weymouth's
condition
*punct* ?
*break*
very
little
*punct* ,
was
the
reply
*punct* ;
she
has
lain
in
a
semi-conscious
state
since
the
news
came
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
had
any
idea
she
would
take
it
so
*punct* .
*break*
at
one
time
we
were
afraid
her
brain
was
going
*punct* .
*break*
she
seemed
to
have
delusions
*punct* .
*break*
smith
spun
round
upon
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
of
what
nature
*punct* ?
*break*
he
asked
rapidly
*punct* .
*break*
the
other
pulled
nervously
at
his
mustache
*punct* .
*break*
my
wife
has
been
staying
with
her
*punct* ,
he
explained
*punct* ,
since
*punct* ,
it
happened
*punct* ;
and
for
the
last
three
nights
poor
john's
widow
has
cried
out
at
the
same
time
*punct* ,
half-past
two
*punct* ,
that
someone
was
knocking
on
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
that
door
yonder
*punct* ,
the
street
door
*punct* .
*break*
all
our
eyes
turned
in
the
direction
indicated
*punct* .
*break*
john
often
came
home
at
half-past
two
from
the
yard
*punct* ,
continued
weymouth
*punct* ;
so
we
naturally
thought
poor
mary
was
wandering
in
her
mind
*punct* .
*break*
but
last
night
*punct* ,
and
it's
not
to
be
wondered
at
*punct* ,
my
wife
couldn't
sleep
*punct* ,
and
she
was
wide
awake
at
half-past
two
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
was
standing
before
him
*punct* ,
alert
*punct* ,
bright-eyed
*punct* .
*break*
she
heard
it
*punct* ,
too
*punct* !
*break*
the
sun
was
streaming
into
the
cozy
little
sitting-room
*punct* ;
but
i
will
confess
that
weymouth's
words
chilled
me
uncannily
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
laid
her
hand
upon
mine
*punct* ,
in
a
quaint
*punct* ,
childish
fashion
peculiarly
her
own
*punct* .
*break*
her
hand
was
cold
*punct* ,
but
its
touch
thrilled
me
*punct* .
*break*
for
karamaneh
was
not
a
child
*punct* ,
but
a
rarely
beautiful
girl
*punct* ,
a
pearl
of
the
east
such
as
many
a
monarch
has
fought
for
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
afraid
to
move
*punct* ,
afraid
to
look
from
the
window
*punct* !
*break*
my
friend
turned
and
stared
hard
at
me
*punct* .
*break*
a
subjective
hallucination
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ?
*break*
in
all
probability
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* .
*break*
you
should
arrange
that
your
wife
be
relieved
in
her
trying
duties
*punct* ,
mr.
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
too
great
a
strain
for
an
inexperienced
nurse
*punct* .
*break*
of
all
that
we
had
hoped
for
in
our
pursuit
of
fu-manchu
how
little
had
we
accomplished
*punct* .
*break*
excepting
karamaneh
and
her
brother
*punct* ,
who
were
victims
and
not
creatures
of
the
chinese
doctor's
*punct* ,
not
one
of
the
formidable
group
had
fallen
alive
into
our
hands
*punct* .
*break*
dreadful
crimes
had
marked
fu-manchu's
passage
through
the
land
*punct* .
*break*
not
one-half
of
the
truth
*punct* ,
and
nothing
of
the
later
developments
*punct* ,
had
been
made
public
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith's
authority
was
sufficient
to
control
the
press
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
absence
of
such
a
veto
a
veritable
panic
must
have
seized
upon
the
entire
country
*punct* ;
for
a
monster
*punct* ,
a
thing
more
than
humanly
evil
*punct* ,
existed
in
our
midst
*punct* .
*break*
always
fu-manchu's
secret
activities
had
centered
about
the
great
waterway
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
much
of
poetic
justice
in
his
end
*punct* ;
for
the
thames
had
claimed
him
*punct* ,
who
so
long
had
used
the
stream
as
a
highway
for
the
passage
to
and
fro
for
his
secret
forces
*punct* .
*break*
gone
now
were
the
yellow
men
who
had
been
the
instruments
of
his
evil
will
*punct* ;
gone
was
the
giant
intellect
which
had
controlled
the
complex
murder
machine
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
*punct* ,
whose
beauty
he
had
used
as
a
lure
*punct* ,
at
last
was
free
*punct* ,
and
no
more
with
her
smile
would
tempt
men
to
death
*punct* ,
that
her
brother
might
live
*punct* .
*break*
many
there
are
*punct* ,
i
doubt
not
*punct* ,
who
will
regard
the
eastern
girl
with
horror
*punct* .
*break*
i
ask
their
forgiveness
in
that
i
regarded
her
quite
differently
*punct* .
*break*
no
man
having
seen
her
could
have
condemned
her
unheard
*punct* .
*break*
many
*punct* ,
having
looked
into
her
lovely
eyes
*punct* ,
had
they
found
there
what
i
found
*punct* ,
must
have
forgiven
her
almost
any
crime
*punct* .
*break*
that
she
valued
human
life
but
little
was
no
matter
for
wonder
*punct* .
*break*
her
nationality
*punct* ,
her
history
*punct* ,
furnished
adequate
excuse
for
an
attitude
not
condonable
in
a
european
equally
cultured
*punct* .
*break*
but
indeed
let
me
confess
that
hers
was
a
nature
incomprehensible
to
me
in
some
respects
*punct* .
*break*
the
soul
of
karamaneh
was
a
closed
book
to
my
short-sighted
western
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
body
of
karamaneh
was
exquisite
*punct* ;
her
beauty
of
a
kind
that
was
a
key
to
the
most
extravagant
rhapsodies
of
eastern
poets
*punct* .
*break*
her
eyes
held
a
challenge
wholly
oriental
in
its
appeal
*punct* ;
her
lips
*punct* ,
even
in
repose
*punct* ,
were
a
taunt
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
herein
*punct* ,
east
is
west
and
west
is
east
*punct* .
*break*
finally
*punct* ,
despite
her
lurid
history
*punct* ,
despite
the
scornful
self-possession
of
which
i
knew
her
capable
*punct* ,
she
was
an
unprotected
girl
*punct* ,
in
years
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
a
mere
child
*punct* ,
whom
fate
had
cast
in
my
way
*punct* .
*break*
at
her
request
*punct* ,
we
had
booked
passages
for
her
brother
and
herself
to
egypt
*punct* .
*break*
the
boat
sailed
in
three
days
*punct* .
*break*
but
karamaneh's
beautiful
eyes
were
sad
*punct* ;
often
i
detected
tears
on
the
black
lashes
*punct* .
*break*
shall
i
endeavor
to
describe
my
own
tumultuous
*punct* ,
conflicting
emotions
*punct* ?
*break*
it
would
be
useless
*punct* ,
since
i
know
it
to
be
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
for
in
those
dark
eyes
burned
a
fire
i
might
not
see
*punct* ;
those
silken
lashes
veiled
a
message
i
dared
not
read
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
was
not
blind
to
the
facts
of
the
complicated
situation
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
truthfully
assert
that
he
was
the
only
man
of
my
acquaintance
who
*punct* ,
having
come
in
contact
with
karamaneh
*punct* ,
had
kept
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
we
endeavored
to
divert
her
mind
from
the
recent
tragedies
by
a
round
of
amusements
*punct* ,
though
with
poor
weymouth's
body
still
at
the
mercy
of
unknown
waters
smith
and
i
made
but
a
poor
show
of
gayety
*punct* ;
and
i
took
a
gloomy
pride
in
the
admiration
which
our
lovely
companion
everywhere
excited
*punct* .
*break*
i
learned
*punct* ,
in
those
days
*punct* ,
how
rare
a
thing
in
nature
is
a
really
beautiful
woman
*punct* .
*break*
one
afternoon
we
found
ourselves
at
an
exhibition
of
water
colors
in
bond
street
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
was
intensely
interested
in
the
subjects
of
the
drawings
*punct* ,
which
were
entirely
egyptian
*punct* .
*break*
as
usual
*punct* ,
she
furnished
matter
for
comment
amongst
the
other
visitors
*punct* ,
as
did
the
boy
*punct* ,
aziz
*punct* ,
her
brother
*punct* ,
anew
upon
the
world
from
his
living
grave
in
the
house
of
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
aziz
clutched
at
his
sister's
arm
*punct* ,
whispering
rapidly
in
arabic
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
her
peachlike
color
fade
*punct* ;
saw
her
become
pale
and
wild-eyed
*punct* ,
the
haunted
karamaneh
of
the
old
days
*punct* .
*break*
she
turned
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
petrie
*punct* ,
he
says
that
fu-manchu
is
here
*punct* !
*break*
nayland
smith
rapped
out
the
question
violently
*punct* ,
turning
in
a
flash
from
the
picture
which
he
was
examining
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
room
*punct* !
*break*
she
whispered
glancing
furtively
*punct* ,
affrightedly
about
her
*punct* .
*break*
something
tells
aziz
when
he
is
near
*punct* ,
and
i
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
feel
strangely
afraid
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
can
it
be
that
he
is
not
dead
*punct* !
*break*
she
held
my
arm
tightly
*punct* .
*break*
her
brother
was
searching
the
room
with
big
*punct* ,
velvet
black
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
i
studied
the
faces
of
the
several
visitors
*punct* ;
and
smith
was
staring
about
him
with
the
old
alert
look
*punct* ,
and
tugging
nervously
at
the
lobe
of
his
ear
*punct* .
*break*
the
name
of
the
giant
foe
of
the
white
race
instantaneously
had
strung
him
up
to
a
pitch
of
supreme
intensity
*punct* .
*break*
our
united
scrutinies
discovered
no
figure
which
could
have
been
that
of
the
chinese
doctor
*punct* .
*break*
who
could
mistake
that
long
*punct* ,
gaunt
shape
*punct* ,
with
the
high
*punct* ,
mummy-like
shoulders
*punct* ,
and
the
indescribable
gait
*punct* ,
which
i
can
only
liken
to
that
of
an
awkward
cat
*punct* ?
*break*
then
*punct* ,
over
the
heads
of
a
group
of
people
who
stood
by
the
doorway
*punct* ,
i
saw
smith
peering
at
someone
*punct* ,
at
someone
who
passed
across
the
outer
room
*punct* .
*break*
stepping
aside
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
obtained
a
glimpse
of
this
person
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
saw
him
*punct* ,
he
was
a
tall
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ,
wearing
a
black
inverness
coat
and
a
rather
shabby
silk
hat
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
long
white
hair
and
a
patriarchal
beard
*punct* ,
wore
smoked
glasses
and
walked
slowly
*punct* ,
leaning
upon
a
stick
*punct* .
*break*
smith's
gaunt
face
paled
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
rapid
glance
at
karamaneh
*punct* ,
he
made
off
across
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
could
it
be
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* ?
*break*
many
days
had
passed
since
*punct* ,
already
half-choked
by
inspector
weymouth's
iron
grip
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
before
our
own
eyes
*punct* ,
had
been
swallowed
up
by
the
thames
*punct* .
*break*
even
now
men
were
seeking
his
body
*punct* ,
and
that
of
his
last
victim
*punct* .
*break*
nor
had
we
left
any
stone
unturned
*punct* .
*break*
acting
upon
information
furnished
by
karamaneh
*punct* ,
the
police
had
searched
every
known
haunt
of
the
murder
group
*punct* .
*break*
but
everything
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
group
was
disbanded
and
dispersed
*punct* ;
that
the
lord
of
strange
deaths
who
had
ruled
it
was
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
yet
smith
was
not
satisfied
*punct* .
*break*
neither
*punct* ,
let
me
confess
*punct* ,
was
i
*punct* .
*break*
every
port
was
watched
*punct* ;
and
in
suspected
districts
a
kind
of
house-to-house
patrol
had
been
instituted
*punct* .
*break*
unknown
to
the
great
public
*punct* ,
in
those
days
a
secret
war
waged
*punct* ,
a
war
in
which
all
the
available
forces
of
the
authorities
took
the
field
against
one
man
*punct* !
*break*
but
that
one
man
was
the
evil
of
the
east
incarnate
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
rejoined
him
*punct* ,
nayland
smith
was
talking
to
the
commissionaire
at
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
professor
jenner
monde
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
the
sergeant
*punct* ,
here
*punct* ,
knows
him
well
*punct* .
*break*
the
name
of
the
celebrated
orientalist
of
course
was
familiar
to
me
*punct* ,
although
i
had
never
before
set
eyes
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
professor
was
out
east
the
last
time
i
was
there
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
stated
the
commissionaire
*punct* .
*break*
i
often
used
to
see
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
he's
an
eccentric
old
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
seems
to
live
in
a
world
of
his
own
*punct* .
*break*
he's
recently
back
from
china
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
stood
clicking
his
teeth
together
in
irritable
hesitation
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
karamaneh
sigh
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
looking
at
her
*punct* ,
i
saw
that
her
cheeks
were
regaining
their
natural
color
*punct* .
*break*
she
smiled
in
pathetic
apology
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
was
here
he
is
gone
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
afraid
now
*punct* .
*break*
smith
thanked
the
commissionaire
for
his
information
and
we
quitted
the
gallery
*punct* .
*break*
professor
jenner
monde
*punct* ,
muttered
my
friend
*punct* ,
has
lived
so
long
in
china
as
almost
to
be
a
chinaman
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
never
met
him
*punct* ,
never
seen
him
*punct* ,
before
*punct* ;
but
i
wonder
*punct* ,
you
wonder
what
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
i
wonder
if
he
could
possibly
be
an
ally
*punct* ,
of
the
doctor's
*punct* !
*break*
i
stared
at
him
in
amazement
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
are
to
attach
any
importance
to
the
incident
at
all
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
we
must
remember
that
the
boy's
impression
*punct* ,
and
karamaneh's
*punct* ,
was
that
fu-manchu
was
present
in
person
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
attach
importance
to
the
incident
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ;
they
are
naturally
sensitive
to
such
impressions
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
doubt
if
even
the
abnormal
organization
of
aziz
could
distinguish
between
the
hidden
presence
of
a
creature
of
the
doctor's
and
that
of
the
doctor
himself
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
make
a
point
of
calling
upon
professor
jenner
monde
*punct* .
*break*
but
fate
had
ordained
that
much
should
happen
ere
smith
made
his
proposed
call
upon
the
professor
*punct* .
*break*
karamaneh
and
her
brother
safely
lodged
in
their
hotel
*punct* ,
which
was
watched
night
and
day
by
four
men
under
smith's
orders
*punct* ,
we
returned
to
my
quiet
suburban
rooms
*punct* .
*break*
first
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* ,
let
us
see
what
we
can
find
out
respecting
professor
monde
*punct* .
*break*
he
went
to
the
telephone
and
called
up
new
scotland
yard
*punct* .
*break*
there
followed
some
little
delay
before
the
requisite
information
was
obtained
*punct* .
*break*
finally
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
we
learned
that
the
professor
was
something
of
a
recluse
*punct* ,
having
few
acquaintances
*punct* ,
and
fewer
friends
*punct* .
*break*
he
lived
alone
in
chambers
in
new
inn
court
*punct* ,
carey
street
*punct* .
*break*
a
charwoman
did
such
cleaning
as
was
considered
necessary
by
the
professor
*punct* ,
who
employed
no
regular
domestic
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
was
in
london
he
might
be
seen
fairly
frequently
at
the
british
museum
*punct* ,
where
his
shabby
figure
was
familiar
to
the
officials
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
was
not
in
london
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
during
the
greater
part
of
each
year
*punct* ,
no
one
knew
where
he
went
*punct* .
*break*
he
never
left
any
address
to
which
letters
might
be
forwarded
*punct* .
*break*
how
long
has
he
been
in
london
now
*punct* ?
*break*
so
far
as
could
be
ascertained
from
new
inn
court
*punct* ,
replied
scotland
yard
*punct* ,
roughly
a
week
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend
left
the
telephone
and
began
restlessly
to
pace
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
the
charred
briar
was
produced
and
stuffed
with
that
broad
cut
latakia
mixture
of
which
nayland
smith
consumed
close
upon
a
pound
a
week
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
one
of
those
untidy
smokers
who
leave
tangled
tufts
hanging
from
the
pipe-bowl
and
when
they
light
up
strew
the
floor
with
smoldering
fragments
*punct* .
*break*
a
ringing
came
*punct* ,
and
shortly
afterwards
a
girl
entered
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
james
weymouth
to
see
you
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
weymouth
entered
*punct* ,
big
and
florid
*punct* ,
and
in
some
respects
singularly
like
his
brother
*punct* ,
in
others
as
singularly
unlike
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
his
black
suit
*punct* ,
he
was
a
somber
figure
*punct* ;
and
in
the
blue
eyes
i
read
a
fear
suppressed
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
he
began
*punct* ,
there's
something
uncanny
going
on
at
maple
cottage
*punct* .
*break*
smith
wheeled
the
big
arm-chair
forward
*punct* .
*break*
sit
down
*punct* ,
mr.
weymouth
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
entirely
surprised
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
have
my
attention
*punct* .
*break*
what
has
occurred
*punct* ?
*break*
weymouth
took
a
cigarette
from
the
box
which
i
proffered
and
poured
out
a
peg
of
whisky
*punct* .
*break*
his
hand
was
not
quite
steady
*punct* .
*break*
that
knocking
*punct* ,
he
explained
*punct* .
*break*
it
came
again
the
night
after
you
were
there
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
weymouth
*punct* ,
my
wife
*punct* ,
i
mean
*punct* ,
felt
that
she
couldn't
spend
another
night
there
*punct* ,
alone
did
she
look
out
of
the
window
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ;
she
was
afraid
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
spent
last
night
downstairs
in
the
sitting-room
*punct* ,
and
_i_
looked
out
*punct* !
*break*
he
took
a
gulp
from
his
glass
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
seated
on
the
edge
of
the
table
*punct* ,
his
extinguished
pipe
in
his
hand
*punct* ,
was
watching
him
keenly
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
admit
i
didn't
look
out
at
once
*punct* ,
weymouth
resumed
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
something
so
uncanny
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
in
that
knocking
*punct* ,
knocking
*punct* ,
in
the
dead
of
the
night
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
*punct* ,
his
voice
shook
*punct* ,
of
poor
jack
*punct* ,
lying
somewhere
amongst
the
slime
of
the
river
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
my
god
*punct* !
*break*
it
came
to
me
that
it
was
jack
who
was
knocking
*punct* ,
and
i
dare
not
think
what
he
*punct* ,
what
it
*punct* ,
would
look
like
*punct* !
*break*
he
leaned
forward
*punct* ,
his
chin
in
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
few
moments
we
were
all
silent
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
i
funked
*punct* ,
he
continued
huskily
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
the
wife
came
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
whispered
to
me
*punct* :
there
it
is
again
*punct* .
*break*
what
in
heaven's
name
can
it
be'
*punct* ,
i
started
to
unbolt
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
the
knocking
had
stopped
*punct* .
*break*
everything
was
very
still
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
mary
*punct* ,
his
widow
*punct* ,
sobbing
*punct* ,
upstairs
*punct* ;
that
was
all
*punct* .
*break*
i
opened
the
door
*punct* ,
a
little
bit
at
a
time
*punct* .
*break*
pausing
again
*punct* ,
he
cleared
his
throat
*punct* ,
and
went
on
*punct* :
it
was
a
bright
night
*punct* ,
and
there
was
no
one
there
*punct* ,
not
a
soul
*punct* .
*break*
but
somewhere
down
the
lane
*punct* ,
as
i
looked
out
into
the
porch
*punct* ,
i
heard
most
awful
groans
*punct* !
*break*
they
got
fainter
and
fainter
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
i
could
have
sworn
i
heard
someone
laughing
*punct* !
*break*
my
nerves
cracked
up
at
that
*punct* ;
and
i
shut
the
door
again
*punct* .
*break*
the
narration
of
his
weird
experience
revived
something
of
the
natural
fear
which
it
had
occasioned
*punct* .
*break*
he
raised
his
glass
*punct* ,
with
unsteady
hand
*punct* ,
and
drained
it
*punct* .
*break*
smith
struck
a
match
and
relighted
his
pipe
*punct* .
*break*
he
began
to
pace
the
room
again
*punct* .
*break*
his
eyes
were
literally
on
fire
*punct* .
*break*
would
it
be
possible
to
get
mrs.
weymouth
out
of
the
house
before
to-night
*punct* ?
*break*
remove
her
to
your
place
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ?
*break*
he
asked
abruptly
*punct* .
*break*
weymouth
looked
up
in
surprise
*punct* .
*break*
she
seems
to
be
in
a
very
low
state
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* .
*break*
he
glanced
at
me
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
dr.
petrie
would
give
us
an
opinion
*punct* ?
*break*
i
will
come
and
see
her
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
is
your
idea
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
i
want
to
hear
that
knocking
*punct* !
*break*
but
in
what
i
may
see
fit
to
do
i
must
not
be
handicapped
by
the
presence
of
a
sick
woman
*punct* .
*break*
her
condition
at
any
rate
will
admit
of
our
administering
an
opiate
*punct* ,
i
suggested
*punct* .
*break*
that
would
meet
the
situation
*punct* ?
*break*
he
was
intensely
excited
now
*punct* .
*break*
i
rely
upon
you
to
arrange
something
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weymouth
*punct* ,
he
turned
to
our
visitor
*punct* ,
i
shall
be
with
you
this
evening
not
later
than
twelve
o'clock
*punct* .
*break*
weymouth
appeared
to
be
greatly
relieved
*punct* .
*break*
i
asked
him
to
wait
whilst
i
prepared
a
drought
for
the
patient
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
was
gone
*punct* :
what
do
you
think
this
knocking
means
*punct* ,
smith
*punct* ?
*break*
he
tapped
out
his
pipe
on
the
side
of
the
grate
and
began
with
nervous
energy
to
refill
it
again
from
the
dilapidated
pouch
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
not
tell
you
what
i
hope
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
nor
what
i
fear
*punct* .
*break*
dusk
was
falling
when
we
made
our
way
in
the
direction
of
maple
cottage
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
appeared
to
be
keenly
interested
in
the
character
of
the
district
*punct* .
*break*
a
high
and
ancient
wall
bordered
the
road
along
which
we
walked
for
a
considerable
distance
*punct* .
*break*
later
it
gave
place
to
a
rickety
fence
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend
peered
through
a
gap
in
the
latter
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
quite
an
extensive
estate
here
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
not
yet
cut
up
by
the
builder
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
well
wooded
on
one
side
*punct* ,
and
there
appears
to
be
a
pool
lower
down
*punct* .
*break*
the
road
was
a
quiet
one
*punct* ,
and
we
plainly
heard
the
tread
*punct* ,
quite
unmistakable
*punct* ,
of
an
approaching
policeman
*punct* .
*break*
smith
continued
to
peer
through
the
hole
in
the
fence
*punct* ,
until
the
officer
drew
up
level
with
us
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* :
does
this
piece
of
ground
extend
down
to
the
village
*punct* ,
constable
*punct* ?
*break*
quite
willing
for
a
chat
*punct* ,
the
man
stopped
*punct* ,
and
stood
with
his
thumbs
thrust
in
his
belt
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
they
tell
me
three
new
roads
will
be
made
through
it
between
here
and
the
hill
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
be
a
happy
hunting
ground
for
tramps
*punct* ?
*break*
i've
seen
some
suspicious-looking
coves
about
at
times
*punct* .
*break*
but
after
dusk
an
army
might
be
inside
there
and
nobody
would
ever
be
the
wiser
*punct* .
*break*
burglaries
frequent
in
the
houses
backing
on
to
it
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
no
*punct* .
*break*
a
favorite
game
in
these
parts
is
snatching
loaves
and
bottles
of
milk
from
the
doors
*punct* ,
first
thing
*punct* ,
as
they're
delivered
*punct* .
*break*
there's
been
an
extra
lot
of
it
lately
*punct* .
*break*
my
mate
who
relieves
me
has
got
special
instructions
to
keep
his
eye
open
in
the
mornings
*punct* !
*break*
the
man
grinned
*punct* .
*break*
it
wouldn't
be
a
very
big
case
even
if
he
caught
anybody
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
said
smith
absently
*punct* ;
perhaps
not
*punct* .
*break*
your
business
must
be
a
dry
one
this
warm
weather
*punct* .
*break*
good-night
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
the
constable
*punct* ,
richer
by
half-a-crown
*punct* ,
and
thank
you
*punct* .
*break*
smith
stared
after
him
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
tugging
reflectively
at
the
lobe
of
his
ear
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
big
case
*punct* ,
after
all
*punct* ,
he
murmured
*punct* .
*break*
come
on
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
not
another
word
did
he
speak
*punct* ,
until
we
stood
at
the
gate
of
maple
cottage
*punct* .
*break*
there
a
plain-clothes
man
was
standing
*punct* ,
evidently
awaiting
smith
*punct* .
*break*
he
touched
his
hat
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
found
a
suitable
hiding-place
*punct* ?
*break*
asked
my
companion
rapidly
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
was
the
reply
*punct* .
*break*
kent
*punct* ,
my
mate
*punct* ,
is
there
now
*punct* .
*break*
you'll
notice
that
he
can't
be
seen
from
here
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
agreed
smith
*punct* ,
peering
all
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
he
*punct* ?
*break*
behind
the
broken
wall
*punct* ,
explained
the
man
*punct* ,
pointing
*punct* .
*break*
through
that
ivy
there's
a
clear
view
of
the
cottage
door
*punct* .
*break*
keep
your
eyes
open
*punct* .
*break*
if
a
messenger
comes
for
me
*punct* ,
he
is
to
be
intercepted
*punct* ,
you
understand
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
must
be
allowed
to
disturb
us
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
recognize
the
messenger
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
be
one
of
your
fellows
*punct* .
*break*
should
he
come
*punct* ,
hoot
three
times
*punct* ,
as
much
like
an
owl
as
you
can
*punct* .
*break*
we
walked
up
to
the
porch
of
the
cottage
*punct* .
*break*
in
response
to
smith's
ringing
came
james
weymouth
*punct* ,
who
seemed
greatly
relieved
by
our
arrival
*punct* .
*break*
first
*punct* ,
said
my
friend
briskly
*punct* ,
you
had
better
run
up
and
see
the
patient
*punct* .
*break*
accordingly
*punct* ,
i
followed
weymouth
upstairs
and
was
admitted
by
his
wife
to
a
neat
little
bedroom
where
the
grief-stricken
woman
lay
*punct* ,
a
wanly
pathetic
sight
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
administer
the
draught
*punct* ,
as
directed
*punct* ?
*break*
mrs.
james
weymouth
nodded
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
a
kindly
looking
woman
*punct* ,
with
the
same
dread
haunting
her
hazel
eyes
as
that
which
lurked
in
her
husband's
blue
ones
*punct* .
*break*
the
patient
was
sleeping
soundly
*punct* .
*break*
some
whispered
instructions
i
gave
to
the
faithful
nurse
and
descended
to
the
sitting-room
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
warm
night
*punct* ,
and
weymouth
sat
by
the
open
window
*punct* ,
smoking
*punct* .
*break*
the
dim
light
from
the
lamp
on
the
table
lent
him
an
almost
startling
likeness
to
his
brother
*punct* ;
and
for
a
moment
i
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
scarce
able
to
trust
my
reason
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
turned
his
face
fully
towards
me
*punct* ,
and
the
illusion
was
lost
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
think
she
is
likely
to
wake
*punct* ,
doctor
*punct* ?
*break*
i
think
not
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
stood
upon
the
rug
before
the
hearth
*punct* ,
swinging
from
one
foot
to
the
other
*punct* ,
in
his
nervously
restless
way
*punct* .
*break*
the
room
was
foggy
with
the
fumes
of
tobacco
*punct* ,
for
he
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
was
smoking
*punct* .
*break*
at
intervals
of
some
five
to
ten
minutes
*punct* ,
his
blackened
briar
*punct* ,
which
i
never
knew
him
to
clean
or
scrape
*punct* ,
would
go
out
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
smith
used
more
matches
than
any
other
smoker
i
have
ever
met
*punct* ,
and
he
invariably
carried
three
boxes
in
various
pockets
of
his
garments
*punct* .
*break*
the
tobacco
habit
is
infectious
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
seating
myself
in
an
arm-chair
*punct* ,
i
lighted
a
cigarette
*punct* .
*break*
for
this
dreary
vigil
i
had
come
prepared
with
a
bunch
of
rough
notes
*punct* ,
a
writing-block
*punct* ,
and
a
fountain
pen
*punct* .
*break*
i
settled
down
to
work
upon
my
record
of
the
fu-manchu
case
*punct* .
*break*
silence
fell
upon
maple
cottage
*punct* .
*break*
save
for
the
shuddering
sigh
which
whispered
through
the
over-hanging
cedars
and
smith's
eternal
match-striking
*punct* ,
nothing
was
there
to
disturb
me
in
my
task
*punct* .
*break*
yet
i
could
make
little
progress
*punct* .
*break*
between
my
mind
and
the
chapter
upon
which
i
was
at
work
a
certain
sentence
persistently
intruded
itself
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
as
though
an
unseen
hand
held
the
written
page
closely
before
my
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
the
sentence
*punct* :
imagine
a
person
*punct* ,
tall
*punct* ,
lean
*punct* ,
and
feline
*punct* ,
high-shouldered
*punct* ,
with
a
brow
like
shakespeare
and
a
face
like
satan
*punct* ,
a
close-shaven
skull
*punct* ,
and
long
*punct* ,
magnetic
eyes
of
the
true
cat-green
*punct* :
invest
him
with
all
the
cruel
cunning
of
an
entire
eastern
race
*punct* ,
accumulated
in
one
giant
intellect
*punct* ...
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
fu-manchu
as
smith
had
described
him
to
me
on
that
night
which
now
seemed
so
remotely
distant
*punct* ,
the
night
upon
which
i
had
learned
of
the
existence
of
the
wonderful
and
evil
being
born
of
that
secret
quickening
which
stirred
in
the
womb
of
the
yellow
races
*punct* .
*break*
as
smith
*punct* ,
for
the
ninth
or
tenth
time
*punct* ,
knocked
out
his
pipe
on
a
bar
of
the
grate
*punct* ,
the
cuckoo
clock
in
the
kitchen
proclaimed
the
hour
*punct* .
*break*
two
*punct* ,
said
james
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
i
abandoned
my
task
*punct* ,
replacing
notes
and
writing-block
in
the
bag
that
i
had
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
weymouth
adjusted
the
lamp
which
had
begun
to
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
i
tiptoed
to
the
stairs
and
*punct* ,
stepping
softly
*punct* ,
ascended
to
the
sick
room
*punct* .
*break*
all
was
quiet
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
weymouth
whispered
to
me
that
the
patient
still
slept
soundly
*punct* .
*break*
i
returned
to
find
nayland
smith
pacing
about
the
room
in
that
state
of
suppressed
excitement
habitual
with
him
in
the
approach
of
any
crisis
*punct* .
*break*
at
a
quarter
past
two
the
breeze
dropped
entirely
*punct* ,
and
such
a
stillness
reigned
all
about
us
as
i
could
not
have
supposed
possible
so
near
to
the
ever-throbbing
heart
of
the
great
metropolis
*punct* .
*break*
plainly
i
could
hear
weymouth's
heavy
breathing
*punct* .
*break*
he
sat
at
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
black
shadows
under
the
cedars
*punct* .
*break*
smith
ceased
his
pacing
and
stood
again
on
the
rug
very
still
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
listening
*punct* !
*break*
i
doubt
not
we
were
all
listening
*punct* .
*break*
some
faint
sound
broke
the
impressive
stillness
*punct* ,
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
village
street
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
vague
*punct* ,
indefinite
disturbance
*punct* ,
brief
*punct* ,
and
upon
it
ensued
a
silence
more
marked
than
ever
*punct* .
*break*
some
minutes
before
*punct* ,
smith
had
extinguished
the
lamp
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
darkness
i
heard
his
teeth
snap
sharply
together
*punct* .
*break*
the
call
of
an
owl
sounded
very
clearly
three
times
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
that
to
mean
that
a
messenger
had
come
*punct* ;
but
from
whence
or
bearing
what
tidings
i
knew
not
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend's
plans
were
incomprehensible
to
me
*punct* ,
nor
had
i
pressed
him
for
any
explanation
of
their
nature
*punct* ,
knowing
him
to
be
in
that
high-strung
and
somewhat
irritable
mood
which
claimed
him
at
times
of
uncertainty
*punct* ,
when
he
doubted
the
wisdom
of
his
actions
*punct* ,
the
accuracy
of
his
surmises
*punct* .
*break*
he
gave
no
sign
*punct* .
*break*
very
faintly
i
heard
a
clock
strike
the
half-hour
*punct* .
*break*
a
soft
breeze
stole
again
through
the
branches
above
*punct* .
*break*
the
wind
i
thought
must
be
in
a
new
quarter
since
i
had
not
heard
the
clock
before
*punct* .
*break*
in
so
lonely
a
spot
it
was
difficult
to
believe
that
the
bell
was
that
of
st
*punct* .
*break*
yet
such
was
the
fact
*punct* .
*break*
and
hard
upon
the
ringing
followed
another
sound
*punct* ,
a
sound
we
all
had
expected
*punct* ,
had
waited
for
*punct* ;
but
at
whose
coming
no
one
of
us
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
retained
complete
mastery
of
himself
*punct* .
*break*
breaking
up
the
silence
in
a
manner
that
set
my
heart
wildly
leaping
it
came
*punct* ,
an
imperative
knocking
on
the
door
*punct* !
*break*
groaned
weymouth
*punct* ,
but
he
did
not
move
from
his
position
at
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
stand
by
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
he
strode
to
the
door
*punct* ,
and
threw
it
widely
open
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
i
was
very
pale
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
i
cried
out
as
i
fell
back
*punct* ,
retreated
with
clenched
hands
from
before
that
which
stood
on
the
threshold
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
wild
*punct* ,
unkempt
figure
*punct* ,
with
straggling
beard
*punct* ,
hideously
staring
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
with
its
hands
it
clutched
at
its
hair
*punct* ,
at
its
chin
*punct* ;
plucked
at
its
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
no
moonlight
touched
the
features
of
this
unearthly
visitant
*punct* ,
but
scanty
as
was
the
illumination
we
could
see
the
gleaming
teeth
*punct* ,
and
the
wildly
glaring
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
it
began
to
laugh
*punct* ,
peal
after
peal
*punct* ,
hideous
and
shrill
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
so
terrifying
had
ever
smote
upon
my
ears
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
palsied
by
the
horror
of
the
sound
*punct* .
*break*
then
nayland
smith
pressed
the
button
of
an
electric
torch
which
he
carried
*punct* .
*break*
he
directed
the
disk
of
white
light
fully
upon
the
face
in
the
doorway
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
god
*punct* !
*break*
it's
john!
*punct* ,
and
again
and
again
*punct* :
oh
*punct* ,
god
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
god
*punct* !
*break*
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
really
believed
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
i
could
not
doubt
*punct* ,
that
a
thing
of
another
world
stood
before
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
ashamed
to
confess
the
extent
of
the
horror
that
came
upon
me
*punct* .
*break*
james
weymouth
raised
his
hands
*punct* ,
as
if
to
thrust
away
from
him
that
awful
thing
in
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
babbling
*punct* ,
prayers
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
but
wholly
incoherent
*punct* .
*break*
hold
him
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
smith's
voice
was
low
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
when
we
were
past
thought
or
intelligent
action
*punct* ,
he
*punct* ,
dominant
and
cool
*punct* ,
with
that
forced
calm
for
which
*punct* ,
a
crisis
over
*punct* ,
he
always
paid
so
dearly
*punct* ,
was
thinking
of
the
woman
who
slept
above.
*punct* ,
he
leaped
forward
*punct* ;
and
in
the
instant
that
he
grappled
with
the
one
who
had
knocked
i
knew
the
visitant
for
a
man
of
flesh
and
blood
*punct* ,
a
man
who
shrieked
and
fought
like
a
savage
animal
*punct* ,
foamed
at
the
mouth
and
gnashed
his
teeth
in
horrid
frenzy
*punct* ;
knew
him
for
a
madman
*punct* ,
knew
him
for
the
victim
of
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
not
dead
*punct* ,
but
living
*punct* ,
for
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ,
a
maniac
*punct* !
*break*
in
a
flash
i
realized
all
this
and
sprang
to
smith's
assistance
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
sound
of
racing
footsteps
and
the
men
who
had
been
watching
outside
came
running
into
the
porch
*punct* .
*break*
a
third
was
with
them
*punct* ;
and
the
five
of
us
*punct* ,
for
weymouth's
brother
had
not
yet
grasped
the
fact
that
a
man
and
not
a
spirit
shrieked
and
howled
in
our
midst
*punct* ,
clung
to
the
infuriated
madman
*punct* ,
yet
barely
held
our
own
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
syringe
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
you
must
manage
to
make
an
injection
*punct* !
*break*
i
extricated
myself
and
raced
into
the
cottage
for
my
bag
*punct* .
*break*
a
hypodermic
syringe
ready
charged
i
had
brought
with
me
at
smith's
request
*punct* .
*break*
even
in
that
thrilling
moment
i
could
find
time
to
admire
the
wonderful
foresight
of
my
friend
*punct* ,
who
had
divined
what
would
befall
*punct* ,
isolated
the
strange
*punct* ,
pitiful
truth
from
the
chaotic
circumstances
which
saw
us
at
maple
cottage
that
night
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
not
enlarge
upon
the
end
of
the
awful
struggle
*punct* .
*break*
at
one
time
i
despaired
*punct* ,
we
all
despaired
*punct* ,
of
quieting
the
poor
*punct* ,
demented
creature
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
last
it
was
done
*punct* ;
and
the
gaunt
*punct* ,
blood-stained
savage
whom
we
had
known
as
detective-inspector
weymouth
lay
passive
upon
the
couch
in
his
own
sitting-room
*punct* .
*break*
a
great
wonder
possessed
my
mind
for
the
genius
of
the
uncanny
being
who
with
the
scratch
of
a
needle
had
made
a
brave
and
kindly
man
into
this
unclean
*punct* ,
brutish
thing
*punct* .
*break*
nayland
smith
*punct* ,
gaunt
and
wild-eyed
*punct* ,
and
trembling
yet
with
his
tremendous
exertions
*punct* ,
turned
to
the
man
whom
i
knew
to
be
the
messenger
from
scotland
yard
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
arrested
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
the
detective
reported
*punct* .
*break*
they
have
kept
him
at
his
chambers
as
you
ordered
*punct* .
*break*
has
she
slept
through
it
*punct* ?
*break*
said
smith
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
i
had
just
returned
from
a
visit
to
the
room
above.
*punct* ,
i
nodded
*punct* .
*break*
is
he
safe
for
an
hour
or
two?
*punct* ,
indicating
the
figure
on
the
couch
*punct* .
*break*
for
eight
or
ten
*punct* ,
i
replied
grimly
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
then
*punct* .
*break*
our
night's
labors
are
not
nearly
complete
*punct* .
*break*
later
was
forthcoming
evidence
to
show
that
poor
weymouth
had
lived
a
wild
life
*punct* ,
in
hiding
among
the
thick
bushes
of
the
tract
of
land
which
lay
between
the
village
and
the
suburb
on
the
neighboring
hill
*punct* .
*break*
literally
*punct* ,
he
had
returned
to
primitive
savagery
and
some
of
his
food
had
been
that
of
the
lower
animals
*punct* ,
though
he
had
not
scrupled
to
steal
*punct* ,
as
we
learned
when
his
lair
was
discovered
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
hidden
himself
cunningly
*punct* ;
but
witnesses
appeared
who
had
seen
him
*punct* ,
in
the
dusk
*punct* ,
and
fled
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
they
never
learned
that
the
object
of
their
fear
was
inspector
john
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
how
*punct* ,
having
escaped
death
in
the
thames
*punct* ,
he
had
crossed
london
unobserved
*punct* ,
we
never
knew
*punct* ;
but
his
trick
of
knocking
upon
his
own
door
at
half-past
two
each
morning
*punct* ,
a
sort
of
dawning
of
sanity
mysteriously
linked
with
old
custom
*punct* ,
will
be
a
familiar
class
of
symptom
to
all
students
of
alienation
*punct* .
*break*
i
revert
to
the
night
when
smith
solved
the
mystery
of
the
knocking
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
car
which
he
had
in
waiting
at
the
end
of
the
village
we
sped
through
the
deserted
streets
to
new
inn
court
*punct* .
*break*
i
*punct* ,
who
had
followed
nayland
smith
through
the
failures
and
successes
of
his
mission
*punct* ,
knew
that
to-night
he
had
surpassed
himself
*punct* ;
had
justified
the
confidence
placed
in
him
by
the
highest
authorities
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
admitted
to
an
untidy
room
*punct* ,
that
of
a
student
*punct* ,
a
traveler
and
a
crank
*punct* ,
by
a
plain-clothes
officer
*punct* .
*break*
amid
picturesque
and
disordered
fragments
of
a
hundred
ages
*punct* ,
in
a
great
carven
chair
placed
before
a
towering
statue
of
the
buddha
*punct* ,
sat
a
hand-cuffed
man
*punct* .
*break*
his
white
hair
and
beard
were
patriarchal
*punct* ;
his
pose
had
great
dignity
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
expression
was
entirely
masked
by
the
smoked
glasses
which
he
wore
*punct* .
*break*
two
other
detectives
were
guarding
the
prisoner
*punct* .
*break*
we
arrested
professor
jenner
monde
as
he
came
in
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
reported
the
man
who
had
opened
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
made
no
statement
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
there
isn't
a
mistake
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
not
*punct* ,
rapped
smith
*punct* .
*break*
he
strode
across
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
consumed
by
a
fever
of
excitement
*punct* .
*break*
almost
savagely
*punct* ,
he
tore
away
the
beard
*punct* ,
tore
off
the
snowy
wig
dashed
the
smoked
glasses
upon
the
floor
*punct* .
*break*
a
great
*punct* ,
high
brow
was
revealed
*punct* ,
and
green
*punct* ,
malignant
eyes
*punct* ,
which
fixed
themselves
upon
him
with
an
expression
i
never
can
forget
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
dr.
fu-manchu
*punct* !
*break*
one
intense
moment
of
silence
ensued
*punct* ,
of
silence
which
seemed
to
throb
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* :
what
have
you
done
with
professor
monde
*punct* ?
*break*
dr.
fu-manchu
showed
his
even
*punct* ,
yellow
teeth
in
the
singularly
evil
smile
which
i
knew
so
well
*punct* .
*break*
a
manacled
prisoner
he
sat
as
unruffled
as
a
judge
upon
the
bench
*punct* .
*break*
in
truth
and
in
justice
i
am
compelled
to
say
that
fu-manchu
was
absolutely
fearless
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
been
detained
in
china
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
in
smooth
*punct* ,
sibilant
tones
*punct* ,
by
affairs
of
great
urgency
*punct* .
*break*
his
well-known
personality
and
ungregarious
habits
have
served
me
well
*punct* ,
here
*punct* !
*break*
smith
*punct* ,
i
could
see
*punct* ,
was
undetermined
how
to
act
*punct* ;
he
stood
tugging
at
his
ear
and
glancing
from
the
impassive
chinaman
to
the
wondering
detectives
*punct* .
*break*
what
are
we
to
do
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
one
of
them
asked
*punct* .
*break*
leave
dr.
petrie
and
myself
alone
with
the
prisoner
*punct* ,
until
i
call
you
*punct* .
*break*
the
three
withdrew
*punct* .
*break*
i
divined
now
what
was
coming
*punct* .
*break*
can
you
restore
weymouth's
sanity
*punct* ?
*break*
rapped
smith
abruptly
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
save
you
from
the
hangman
*punct* ,
nor
*punct* ,
his
fists
clenched
convulsively
*punct* ,
would
i
if
i
could
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
fixed
his
brilliant
eyes
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
say
no
more
*punct* ,
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
he
interrupted
*punct* ;
you
misunderstand
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
quarrel
with
that
*punct* ,
but
what
i
have
done
from
conviction
and
what
i
have
done
of
necessity
are
separated
*punct* ,
are
seas
apart
*punct* .
*break*
the
brave
inspector
weymouth
i
wounded
with
a
poisoned
needle
*punct* ,
in
self-defense
*punct* ;
but
i
regret
his
condition
as
greatly
as
you
do
*punct* .
*break*
i
respect
such
a
man
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
an
antidote
to
the
poison
of
the
needle
*punct* .
*break*
name
it
*punct* ,
said
smith
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
smiled
again
*punct* .
*break*
useless
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* .
*break*
i
alone
can
prepare
it
*punct* .
*break*
my
secrets
shall
die
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
make
a
sane
man
of
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ,
but
no
one
else
shall
be
in
the
house
but
he
and
i
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
be
surrounded
by
police
*punct* ,
interrupted
smith
grimly
*punct* .
*break*
as
you
please
*punct* ,
said
fu-manchu
*punct* .
*break*
make
your
arrangements
*punct* .
*break*
in
that
ebony
case
upon
the
table
are
the
instruments
for
the
cure
*punct* .
*break*
arrange
for
me
to
visit
him
where
and
when
you
will
*punct* ,
i
distrust
you
utterly
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
some
trick
*punct* ,
jerked
smith
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
fu-manchu
rose
slowly
and
drew
himself
up
to
his
great
height
*punct* .
*break*
his
manacled
hands
could
not
rob
him
of
the
uncanny
dignity
which
was
his
*punct* .
*break*
he
raised
them
above
his
head
with
a
tragic
gesture
and
fixed
his
piercing
gaze
upon
nayland
smith
*punct* .
*break*
the
god
of
cathay
bear
me
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
with
a
deep
*punct* ,
guttural
note
in
his
voice
*punct* ,
i
swear
*punct* ,
the
most
awful
visitor
who
ever
threatened
the
peace
of
england
*punct* ,
the
end
of
the
visit
of
fu-manchu
was
characteristic
*punct* ,
terrible
*punct* ,
inexplicable
*punct* .
*break*
strange
to
relate
*punct* ,
i
did
not
doubt
that
this
weird
being
had
conceived
some
kind
of
admiration
or
respect
for
the
man
to
whom
he
had
wrought
so
terrible
an
injury
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
capable
of
such
sentiments
*punct* ,
for
he
entertained
some
similar
one
in
regard
to
myself
*punct* .
*break*
a
cottage
farther
down
the
village
street
than
weymouth's
was
vacant
*punct* ,
and
in
the
early
dawn
of
that
morning
became
the
scene
of
outre
happenings
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
so
strange
a
specialist
never
visited
a
patient
before
*punct* ,
certainly
not
under
such
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
for
into
the
cottage
*punct* ,
which
had
been
entirely
surrounded
by
a
ring
of
police
*punct* ,
dr.
fu-manchu
was
admitted
from
the
closed
car
in
which
*punct* ,
his
work
of
healing
complete
*punct* ,
he
was
to
be
borne
to
prison
*punct* ,
to
death
*punct* !
*break*
law
and
justice
were
suspended
by
my
royally
empowered
friend
that
the
enemy
of
the
white
race
might
heal
one
of
those
who
had
hunted
him
down
*punct* !
*break*
no
curious
audience
was
present
*punct* ,
for
sunrise
was
not
yet
come
*punct* ;
no
concourse
of
excited
students
followed
the
hand
of
the
master
*punct* ;
but
within
that
surrounded
cottage
was
performed
one
of
those
miracles
of
science
which
in
other
circumstances
had
made
the
fame
of
dr.
fu-manchu
to
live
forever
*punct* .
*break*
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ,
dazed
*punct* ,
disheveled
*punct* ,
clutching
his
head
as
a
man
who
has
passed
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
*punct* ,
but
sane
*punct* ,
sane!
*punct* ,
walked
out
into
the
porch
*punct* !
*break*
he
looked
towards
us
*punct* ,
his
eyes
wild
*punct* ,
but
not
with
the
fearsome
wildness
of
insanity
*punct* .
*break*
he
cried
*punct* ,
and
staggered
down
the
path
*punct* ,
dr.
petrie
*punct* !
*break*
what
*punct* ,
there
came
a
deafening
explosion
*punct* .
*break*
from
every
visible
window
of
the
deserted
cottage
flames
burst
forth
*punct* !
*break*
smith's
voice
rose
almost
to
a
scream
*punct* ,
into
the
house
*punct* !
*break*
he
raced
up
the
path
*punct* ,
past
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ,
who
stood
swaying
there
like
a
drunken
man
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
close
upon
his
heels
*punct* .
*break*
behind
me
came
the
police
*punct* .
*break*
the
door
was
impassable
*punct* !
*break*
already
*punct* ,
it
vomited
a
deathly
heat
*punct* ,
borne
upon
stifling
fumes
like
those
of
the
mouth
of
the
pit
*punct* .
*break*
we
burst
a
window
*punct* .
*break*
the
room
within
was
a
furnace
*punct* !
*break*
this
is
supernatural
*punct* !
*break*
the
crowd
which
a
fire
can
conjure
up
at
any
hour
of
day
or
night
*punct* ,
out
of
the
void
of
nowhere
*punct* ,
was
gathering
already
*punct* .
*break*
but
upon
all
descended
a
pall
of
silence
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
heat
of
the
holocaust
a
voice
proclaimed
itself
*punct* ,
a
voice
raised
*punct* ,
not
in
anguish
but
in
triumph
*punct* !
*break*
it
chanted
barbarically
*punct* ,
and
was
still
*punct* .
*break*
the
abnormal
flames
rose
higher
*punct* ,
leaping
forth
from
every
window
*punct* .
*break*
said
smith
hoarsely
*punct* .
*break*
call
up
the
brigade
*punct* !
*break*
i
come
to
the
close
of
my
chronicle
*punct* ,
and
feel
that
i
betray
a
trust
*punct* ,
the
trust
of
my
reader
*punct* .
*break*
for
having
limned
in
the
colors
at
my
command
the
fiendish
chinese
doctor
*punct* ,
i
am
unable
to
conclude
my
task
as
i
should
desire
*punct* ,
unable
*punct* ,
with
any
consciousness
of
finality
*punct* ,
to
write
finis
to
the
end
of
my
narrative
*punct* .
*break*
it
seems
to
me
sometimes
that
my
pen
is
but
temporarily
idle
*punct* ,
that
i
have
but
dealt
with
a
single
phase
of
a
movement
having
a
hundred
phases
*punct* .
*break*
one
sequel
i
hope
for
*punct* ,
and
against
all
the
promptings
of
logic
and
western
bias
*punct* .
*break*
if
my
hope
shall
be
realized
i
cannot
*punct* ,
at
this
time
*punct* ,
pretend
to
state
*punct* .
*break*
the
future
*punct* ,
mid
its
many
secrets
*punct* ,
holds
this
precious
one
from
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
ask
you
then
*punct* ,
to
absolve
me
from
the
charge
of
ill
completing
my
work
*punct* ;
for
any
curiosity
with
which
this
narrative
may
leave
the
reader
burdened
is
shared
by
the
writer
*punct* .
*break*
with
intent
*punct* ,
i
have
rushed
you
from
the
chambers
of
professor
jenner
monde
to
that
closing
episode
at
the
deserted
cottage
*punct* ;
i
have
made
the
pace
hot
in
order
to
impart
to
these
last
pages
of
my
account
something
of
the
breathless
scurry
which
characterized
those
happenings
*punct* .
*break*
my
canvas
may
seem
sketchy
*punct* :
it
is
my
impression
of
the
reality
*punct* .
*break*
no
hard
details
remain
in
my
mind
of
the
dealings
of
that
night
*punct* .
*break*
fu-manchu
arrested
*punct* ,
fu-manchu
*punct* ,
manacled
*punct* ,
entering
the
cottage
on
his
mission
of
healing
*punct* ;
weymouth
*punct* ,
miraculously
rendered
sane
*punct* ,
coming
forth
*punct* ;
the
place
in
flames
*punct* .
*break*
to
a
shell
the
cottage
burned
*punct* ,
with
an
incredible
rapidity
which
pointed
to
some
hidden
agency
*punct* ;
to
a
shell
about
ashes
which
held
no
trace
of
human
bones
*punct* !
*break*
it
has
been
asked
of
me
*punct* :
was
there
no
possibility
of
fu-manchu's
having
eluded
us
in
the
ensuing
confusion
*punct* ?
*break*
was
there
no
loophole
of
escape
*punct* ?
*break*
i
reply
*punct* ,
that
so
far
as
i
was
able
to
judge
*punct* ,
a
rat
could
scarce
have
quitted
the
building
undetected
*punct* .
*break*
yet
that
fu-manchu
had
*punct* ,
in
some
incomprehensible
manner
and
by
some
mysterious
agency
*punct* ,
produced
those
abnormal
flames
*punct* ,
i
cannot
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
did
he
voluntarily
ignite
his
own
funeral
pyre
*punct* ?
*break*
as
i
write
*punct* ,
there
lies
before
me
a
soiled
and
creased
sheet
of
vellum
*punct* .
*break*
it
bears
some
lines
traced
in
a
cramped
*punct* ,
peculiar
*punct* ,
and
all
but
illegible
hand
*punct* .
*break*
this
fragment
was
found
by
inspector
weymouth
*punct* ,
to
this
day
a
man
mentally
sound
*punct* ,
in
a
pocket
of
his
ragged
garments
*punct* .
*break*
when
it
was
written
i
leave
you
to
judge
*punct* .
*break*
how
it
came
to
be
where
weymouth
found
it
calls
for
no
explanation
*punct* :
to
mr.
commissioner
nayland
smith
and
dr.
petrie
*punct* ,
greeting
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
recalled
home
by
one
who
may
not
be
denied
*punct* .
*break*
in
much
that
i
came
to
do
i
have
failed
*punct* .
*break*
much
that
i
have
done
i
would
undo
*punct* ;
some
little
i
have
undone
*punct* .
*break*
out
of
fire
i
came
*punct* ,
the
smoldering
fire
of
a
thing
one
day
to
be
a
consuming
flame
*punct* ;
in
fire
i
go
*punct* .
*break*
seek
not
my
ashes
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
the
lord
of
the
fires
*punct* !
*break*
who
has
been
with
me
in
my
several
meetings
with
the
man
who
penned
that
message
i
leave
to
adjudge
if
it
be
the
letter
of
a
madman
bent
upon
self-destruction
by
strange
means
*punct* ,
or
the
gibe
of
a
preternaturally
clever
scientist
and
the
most
elusive
being
ever
born
of
the
land
of
mystery
*punct* ,
china
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
present
*punct* ,
i
can
aid
you
no
more
in
the
forming
of
your
verdict
*punct* .
*break*
a
day
may
come
though
i
pray
it
do
not
*punct* ,
when
i
shall
be
able
to
throw
new
light
upon
much
that
is
dark
in
this
matter
*punct* .
*break*
that
day
*punct* ,
so
far
as
i
can
judge
*punct* ,
could
only
dawn
in
the
event
of
the
chinaman's
survival
*punct* ;
therefore
i
pray
that
the
veil
be
never
lifted
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
i
have
said
*punct* ,
there
is
another
sequel
to
this
story
which
i
can
contemplate
with
a
different
countenance
*punct* .
*break*
how
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
shall
i
conclude
this
very
unsatisfactory
account
*punct* ?
*break*
shall
i
tell
you
*punct* ,
finally
*punct* ,
of
my
parting
with
lovely
*punct* ,
dark-eyed
karamaneh
*punct* ,
on
board
the
liner
which
was
to
bear
her
to
egypt
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
let
me
*punct* ,
instead
*punct* ,
conclude
with
the
words
of
nayland
smith
*punct* :
_i_
sail
for
burma
in
a
fortnight
*punct* ,
petrie
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
leave
to
break
my
journey
at
the
ditch
*punct* .
*break*
how
would
a
run
up
the
nile
fit
your
programme
*punct* ?
*break*
bit
early
for
the
season
*punct* ,
but
you
might
find
something
to
amuse
you
*punct* !
*break*
