Title: Oliver Twist
Author: Charles Dickens
among
other
public
buildings
in
a
certain
town
*punct* ,
which
for
many
reasons
it
will
be
prudent
to
refrain
from
mentioning
*punct* ,
and
to
which
i
will
assign
no
fictitious
name
*punct* ,
there
is
one
anciently
common
to
most
towns
*punct* ,
great
or
small
*punct* :
to
wit
*punct* ,
a
workhouse
*punct* ;
and
in
this
workhouse
was
born
*punct* ;
on
a
day
and
date
which
i
need
not
trouble
myself
to
repeat
*punct* ,
inasmuch
as
it
can
be
of
no
possible
consequence
to
the
reader
*punct* ,
in
this
stage
of
the
business
at
all
events
*punct* ;
the
item
of
mortality
whose
name
is
prefixed
to
the
head
of
this
chapter
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
long
time
after
it
was
ushered
into
this
world
of
sorrow
and
trouble
*punct* ,
by
the
parish
surgeon
*punct* ,
it
remained
a
matter
of
considerable
doubt
whether
the
child
would
survive
to
bear
any
name
at
all
*punct* ;
in
which
case
it
is
somewhat
more
than
probable
that
these
memoirs
would
never
have
appeared
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
if
they
had
*punct* ,
that
being
comprised
within
a
couple
of
pages
*punct* ,
they
would
have
possessed
the
inestimable
merit
of
being
the
most
concise
and
faithful
specimen
of
biography
*punct* ,
extant
in
the
literature
of
any
age
or
country
*punct* .
*break*
although
i
am
not
disposed
to
maintain
that
the
being
born
in
a
workhouse
*punct* ,
is
in
itself
the
most
fortunate
and
enviable
circumstance
that
can
possibly
befall
a
human
being
*punct* ,
i
do
mean
to
say
that
in
this
particular
instance
*punct* ,
it
was
the
best
thing
for
oliver
twist
that
could
by
possibility
have
occurred
*punct* .
*break*
the
fact
is
*punct* ,
that
there
was
considerable
difficulty
in
inducing
oliver
to
take
upon
himself
the
office
of
respiration,
*punct* ,
a
troublesome
practice
*punct* ,
but
one
which
custom
has
rendered
necessary
to
our
easy
existence
*punct* ;
and
for
some
time
he
lay
gasping
on
a
little
flock
mattress
*punct* ,
rather
unequally
poised
between
this
world
and
the
next
*punct* :
the
balance
being
decidedly
in
favour
of
the
latter
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
if
*punct* ,
during
this
brief
period
*punct* ,
oliver
had
been
surrounded
by
careful
grandmothers
*punct* ,
anxious
aunts
*punct* ,
experienced
nurses
*punct* ,
and
doctors
of
profound
wisdom
*punct* ,
he
would
most
inevitably
and
indubitably
have
been
killed
in
no
time
*punct* .
*break*
there
being
nobody
by
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
but
a
pauper
old
woman
*punct* ,
who
was
rendered
rather
misty
by
an
unwonted
allowance
of
beer
*punct* ;
and
a
parish
surgeon
who
did
such
matters
by
contract
*punct* ;
oliver
and
nature
fought
out
the
point
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
result
was
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
after
a
few
struggles
*punct* ,
oliver
breathed
*punct* ,
sneezed
*punct* ,
and
proceeded
to
advertise
to
the
inmates
of
the
workhouse
the
fact
of
a
new
burden
having
been
imposed
upon
the
parish
*punct* ,
by
setting
up
as
loud
a
cry
as
could
reasonably
have
been
expected
from
a
male
infant
who
had
not
been
possessed
of
that
very
useful
appendage
*punct* ,
a
voice
*punct* ,
for
a
much
longer
space
of
time
than
three
minutes
and
a
quarter
*punct* .
*break*
as
oliver
gave
this
first
proof
of
the
free
and
proper
action
of
his
lungs
*punct* ,
the
patchwork
coverlet
which
was
carelessly
flung
over
the
iron
bedstead
*punct* ,
rustled
*punct* ;
the
pale
face
of
a
young
woman
was
raised
feebly
from
the
pillow
*punct* ;
and
a
faint
voice
imperfectly
articulated
the
words
*punct* ,
let
me
see
the
child
*punct* ,
and
die
*punct* .
*break*
the
surgeon
had
been
sitting
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
fire
*punct* :
giving
the
palms
of
his
hands
a
warm
and
a
rub
alternately
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
young
woman
spoke
*punct* ,
he
rose
*punct* ,
and
advancing
to
the
bed's
head
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
with
more
kindness
than
might
have
been
expected
of
him
*punct* :
oh
*punct* ,
you
must
not
talk
about
dying
yet
*punct* .
*break*
lor
bless
her
dear
heart
*punct* ,
no
*punct* !
*break*
interposed
the
nurse
*punct* ,
hastily
depositing
in
her
pocket
a
green
glass
bottle
*punct* ,
the
contents
of
which
she
had
been
tasting
in
a
corner
with
evident
satisfaction
*punct* .
*break*
lor
bless
her
dear
heart
*punct* ,
when
she
has
lived
as
long
as
i
have
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
and
had
thirteen
children
of
her
own
*punct* ,
and
all
on
em
dead
except
two
*punct* ,
and
them
in
the
wurkus
with
me
*punct* ,
she'll
know
better
than
to
take
on
in
that
way
*punct* ,
bless
her
dear
heart
*punct* !
*break*
think
what
it
is
to
be
a
mother
*punct* ,
there's
a
dear
young
lamb
do
*punct* .
*break*
apparently
this
consolatory
perspective
of
a
mother's
prospects
failed
in
producing
its
due
effect
*punct* .
*break*
the
patient
shook
her
head
*punct* ,
and
stretched
out
her
hand
towards
the
child
*punct* .
*break*
the
surgeon
deposited
it
in
her
arms
*punct* .
*break*
she
imprinted
her
cold
white
lips
passionately
on
its
forehead
*punct* ;
passed
her
hands
over
her
face
*punct* ;
gazed
wildly
round
*punct* ;
shuddered
*punct* ;
fell
back
*punct* ,
and
died
*punct* .
*break*
they
chafed
her
breast
*punct* ,
hands
*punct* ,
and
temples
*punct* ;
but
the
blood
had
stopped
forever
*punct* .
*break*
they
talked
of
hope
and
comfort
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
been
strangers
too
long
*punct* .
*break*
it's
all
over
*punct* ,
mrs.
thingummy
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
surgeon
at
last
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
poor
dear
*punct* ,
so
it
is
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
nurse
*punct* ,
picking
up
the
cork
of
the
green
bottle
*punct* ,
which
had
fallen
out
on
the
pillow
*punct* ,
as
she
stooped
to
take
up
the
child
*punct* .
*break*
you
needn't
mind
sending
up
to
me
*punct* ,
if
the
child
cries
*punct* ,
nurse
*punct* ,
said
the
surgeon
*punct* ,
putting
on
his
gloves
with
great
deliberation
*punct* .
*break*
it's
very
likely
it
will
be
troublesome
*punct* .
*break*
give
it
a
little
gruel
if
it
is
*punct* .
*break*
he
put
on
his
hat
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
pausing
by
the
bed-side
on
his
way
to
the
door
*punct* ,
added
*punct* ,
she
was
a
good-looking
girl
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ;
where
did
she
come
from
*punct* ?
*break*
she
was
brought
here
last
night
*punct* ,
replied
the
old
woman
*punct* ,
by
the
overseer's
order
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
found
lying
in
the
street
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
walked
some
distance
*punct* ,
for
her
shoes
were
worn
to
pieces
*punct* ;
but
where
she
came
from
*punct* ,
or
where
she
was
going
to
*punct* ,
nobody
knows
*punct* .
*break*
the
surgeon
leaned
over
the
body
*punct* ,
and
raised
the
left
hand
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
story
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
shaking
his
head
*punct* :
no
wedding-ring
*punct* ,
i
see
*punct* .
*break*
the
medical
gentleman
walked
away
to
dinner
*punct* ;
and
the
nurse
*punct* ,
having
once
more
applied
herself
to
the
green
bottle
*punct* ,
sat
down
on
a
low
chair
before
the
fire
*punct* ,
and
proceeded
to
dress
the
infant
*punct* .
*break*
what
an
excellent
example
of
the
power
of
dress
*punct* ,
young
oliver
twist
was
*punct* !
*break*
wrapped
in
the
blanket
which
had
hitherto
formed
his
only
covering
*punct* ,
he
might
have
been
the
child
of
a
nobleman
or
a
beggar
*punct* ;
it
would
have
been
hard
for
the
haughtiest
stranger
to
have
assigned
him
his
proper
station
in
society
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
that
he
was
enveloped
in
the
old
calico
robes
which
had
grown
yellow
in
the
same
service
*punct* ,
he
was
badged
and
ticketed
*punct* ,
and
fell
into
his
place
at
once
*punct* ,
a
parish
child
*punct* ,
the
orphan
of
a
workhouse
*punct* ,
the
humble
*punct* ,
half-starved
drudge
*punct* ,
to
be
cuffed
and
buffeted
through
the
world
*punct* ,
despised
by
all
*punct* ,
and
pitied
by
none
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
cried
lustily
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
could
have
known
that
he
was
an
orphan
*punct* ,
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
church-wardens
and
overseers
*punct* ,
perhaps
he
would
have
cried
the
louder
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
next
eight
or
ten
months
*punct* ,
oliver
was
the
victim
of
a
systematic
course
of
treachery
and
deception
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
brought
up
by
hand
*punct* .
*break*
the
hungry
and
destitute
situation
of
the
infant
orphan
was
duly
reported
by
the
workhouse
authorities
to
the
parish
authorities
*punct* .
*break*
the
parish
authorities
inquired
with
dignity
of
the
workhouse
authorities
*punct* ,
whether
there
was
no
female
then
domiciled
in
the
house
who
was
in
a
situation
to
impart
to
oliver
twist
*punct* ,
the
consolation
and
nourishment
of
which
he
stood
in
need
*punct* .
*break*
the
workhouse
authorities
replied
with
humility
*punct* ,
that
there
was
not
*punct* .
*break*
upon
this
*punct* ,
the
parish
authorities
magnanimously
and
humanely
resolved
*punct* ,
that
oliver
should
be
farmed
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
in
other
words
*punct* ,
that
he
should
be
dispatched
to
a
branch-workhouse
some
three
miles
off
*punct* ,
where
twenty
or
thirty
other
juvenile
offenders
against
the
poor-laws
*punct* ,
rolled
about
the
floor
all
day
*punct* ,
without
the
inconvenience
of
too
much
food
or
too
much
clothing
*punct* ,
under
the
parental
superintendence
of
an
elderly
female
*punct* ,
who
received
the
culprits
at
and
for
the
consideration
of
sevenpence-halfpenny
per
small
head
per
week
*punct* .
*break*
sevenpence-halfpenny's
worth
per
week
is
a
good
round
diet
for
a
child
*punct* ;
a
great
deal
may
be
got
for
sevenpence-halfpenny
*punct* ,
quite
enough
to
overload
its
stomach
*punct* ,
and
make
it
uncomfortable
*punct* .
*break*
the
elderly
female
was
a
woman
of
wisdom
and
experience
*punct* ;
she
knew
what
was
good
for
children
*punct* ;
and
she
had
a
very
accurate
perception
of
what
was
good
for
herself
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
she
appropriated
the
greater
part
of
the
weekly
stipend
to
her
own
use
*punct* ,
and
consigned
the
rising
parochial
generation
to
even
a
shorter
allowance
than
was
originally
provided
for
them
*punct* .
*break*
thereby
finding
in
the
lowest
depth
a
deeper
still
*punct* ;
and
proving
herself
a
very
great
experimental
philosopher
*punct* .
*break*
everybody
knows
the
story
of
another
experimental
philosopher
who
had
a
great
theory
about
a
horse
being
able
to
live
without
eating
*punct* ,
and
who
demonstrated
it
so
well
*punct* ,
that
he
had
got
his
own
horse
down
to
a
straw
a
day
*punct* ,
and
would
unquestionably
have
rendered
him
a
very
spirited
and
rampacious
animal
on
nothing
at
all
*punct* ,
if
he
had
not
died
*punct* ,
four-and-twenty
hours
before
he
was
to
have
had
his
first
comfortable
bait
of
air
*punct* .
*break*
unfortunately
for
*punct* ,
the
experimenal
philosophy
of
the
female
to
whose
protecting
care
oliver
twist
was
delivered
over
*punct* ,
a
similar
result
usually
attended
the
operation
of
her
system
*punct* ;
for
at
the
very
moment
when
the
child
had
contrived
to
exist
upon
the
smallest
possible
portion
of
the
weakest
possible
food
*punct* ,
it
did
perversely
happen
in
eight
and
a
half
cases
out
of
ten
*punct* ,
either
that
it
sickened
from
want
and
cold
*punct* ,
or
fell
into
the
fire
from
neglect
*punct* ,
or
got
half-smothered
by
accident
*punct* ;
in
any
one
of
which
cases
*punct* ,
the
miserable
little
being
was
usually
summoned
into
another
world
*punct* ,
and
there
gathered
to
the
fathers
it
had
never
known
in
this
*punct* .
*break*
occasionally
*punct* ,
when
there
was
some
more
than
usually
interesting
inquest
upon
a
parish
child
who
had
been
overlooked
in
turning
up
a
bedstead
*punct* ,
or
inadvertently
scalded
to
death
when
there
happened
to
be
a
washing
*punct* ,
though
the
latter
accident
was
very
scarce
*punct* ,
anything
approaching
to
a
washing
being
of
rare
occurance
in
the
farm
*punct* ,
the
jury
would
take
it
into
their
heads
to
ask
troublesome
questions
*punct* ,
or
the
parishioners
would
rebelliously
affix
their
signatures
to
a
remonstrance
*punct* .
*break*
but
these
impertinences
were
speedily
checked
by
the
evidence
of
the
surgeon
*punct* ,
and
the
testimony
of
the
beadle
*punct* ;
the
former
of
whom
had
always
opened
the
body
and
found
nothing
inside
*punct* ,
which
was
very
probable
indeed
*punct* ,
and
the
latter
of
whom
invariably
swore
whatever
the
parish
wanted
*punct* ;
which
was
very
self-devotional
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
the
board
made
periodical
pilgrimages
to
the
farm
*punct* ,
and
always
sent
the
beadle
the
day
before
*punct* ,
to
say
they
were
going
*punct* .
*break*
the
children
were
neat
and
clean
to
behold
*punct* ,
when
they
went
*punct* ;
and
what
more
would
the
people
have
*punct* !
*break*
it
cannot
be
expected
that
this
system
of
farming
would
produce
any
very
extraordinary
or
luxuriant
crop
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
twist's
ninth
birthday
found
him
a
pale
thin
child
*punct* ,
somewhat
diminutive
in
stature
*punct* ,
and
decidely
small
in
circumference
*punct* .
*break*
but
nature
or
inheritance
had
implanted
a
good
sturdy
spirit
in
oliver's
breast
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
had
plenty
of
room
to
expand
*punct* ,
thanks
to
the
spare
diet
of
the
establishment
*punct* ;
and
perhaps
to
this
circumstance
may
be
attributed
his
having
any
ninth
birth-day
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
be
this
as
it
may
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
it
was
his
ninth
birthday
*punct* ;
and
he
was
keeping
it
in
the
coal-cellar
with
a
select
party
of
two
other
young
gentleman
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
after
participating
with
him
in
a
sound
thrashing
*punct* ,
had
been
locked
up
for
atrociously
presuming
to
be
hungry
*punct* ,
when
mrs.
mann
*punct* ,
the
good
lady
of
the
house
*punct* ,
was
unexpectedly
startled
by
the
apparition
of
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
the
beadle
*punct* ,
striving
to
undo
the
wicket
of
the
garden-gate
*punct* .
*break*
is
that
you
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mrs.
mann
*punct* ,
thrusting
her
head
out
of
the
window
in
well-affected
ecstasies
of
joy
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
susan
*punct* ,
take
oliver
and
them
two
brats
upstairs
*punct* ,
and
wash
em
directly.
*punct* ,
my
heart
alive
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
*punct* ,
sure-ly
*punct* !
*break*
now
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
was
a
fat
man
*punct* ,
and
a
choleric
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
instead
of
responding
to
this
open-hearted
salutation
in
a
kindred
spirit
*punct* ,
he
gave
the
little
wicket
a
tremendous
shake
*punct* ,
and
then
bestowed
upon
it
a
kick
which
could
have
emanated
from
no
leg
but
a
beadle's
*punct* .
*break*
lor
*punct* ,
only
think
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
mann
*punct* ,
running
out,
*punct* ,
for
the
three
boys
had
been
removed
by
this

think
of
that

*break*
that
i
should
have
forgotten
that
the
gate
was
bolted
on
the
inside
*punct* ,
on
account
of
them
dear
children

*break*
walk

walk
in

*punct* ,
mr.

do
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
although
this
invitation
was
accompanied
with
a
curtsey
that
might
have
softened
the
heart
of
a
church-warden
*punct* ,
it
by
no
means
mollified
the
beadle
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
think
this
respectful
or
proper
conduct
*punct* ,
mrs.
mann
*punct* ,
inquired
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
grasping
his
cane
*punct* ,
to
keep
the
parish
officers
a
waiting
at
your
garden-gate
*punct* ,
when
they
come
here
upon
porochial
business
with
the
porochial
orphans
*punct* ?
*break*
are
you
aweer
*punct* ,
mrs.
mann
*punct* ,
that
you
are
*punct* ,
as
i
may
say
*punct* ,
a
porochial
delegate
*punct* ,
and
a
stipendiary
*punct* ?
*break*
i'm
sure
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
that
i
was
only
a
telling
one
or
two
of
the
dear
children
as
is
so
fond
of
you
*punct* ,
that
it
was
you
a
coming
*punct* ,
replied
mrs.
mann
with
great
humility
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
bumble
had
a
great
idea
of
his
oratorical
powers
and
his
importance
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
displayed
the
one
*punct* ,
and
vindicated
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
mrs.
mann
*punct* ,
he
replied
in
a
calmer
tone
*punct* ;
it
may
be
as
you
say
*punct* ;
it
may
be
*punct* .
*break*
lead
the
way
in
*punct* ,
mrs.
mann
*punct* ,
for
i
come
on
business
*punct* ,
and
have
something
to
say
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
mann
ushered
the
beadle
into
a
small
parlour
with
a
brick
floor
*punct* ;
placed
a
seat
for
him
*punct* ;
and
officiously
deposited
his
cocked
hat
and
can
on
the
table
before
him
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
bumble
wiped
from
his
forehead
the
perspiration
which
his
walk
had
engendered
*punct* ,
glanced
complacently
at
the
cocked
hat
*punct* ,
and
smiled
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
he
smiled
*punct* .
*break*
beadles
are
but
men
*punct* :
and
mr.
bumble
smiled
*punct* .
*break*
now
don't
you
be
offended
at
what
i'm
a
going
to
say
*punct* ,
observed
mrs.
mann
*punct* ,
with
captivating
sweetness
*punct* .
*break*
you've
had
a
long
walk
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
or
i
wouldn't
mention
it
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
will
you
take
a
little
drop
of
somethink
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* ?
*break*
not
a
drop
*punct* .
*break*
nor
a
drop
*punct* ,
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
waving
his
right
hand
in
a
dignified
*punct* ,
but
placid
manner
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
you
will
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
mann
*punct* ,
who
had
noticed
the
tone
of
the
refusal
*punct* ,
and
the
gesture
that
had
accompanied
it
*punct* .
*break*
just
a
leetle
drop
*punct* ,
with
a
little
cold
water
*punct* ,
and
a
lump
of
sugar
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
bumble
coughed
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
just
a
leetle
drop
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
mann
persuasively
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
the
beadle
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
it's
what
i'm
obliged
to
keep
a
little
of
in
the
house
*punct* ,
to
put
into
the
blessed
infants
daffy
*punct* ,
when
they
ain't
well
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
replied
mrs.
mann
as
she
opened
a
corner
cupboard
*punct* ,
and
took
down
a
bottle
and
glass
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
give
the
children
daffy
*punct* ,
mrs.
mann
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
bumble
*punct* ,
following
with
this
eyes
the
interesting
process
of
mixing
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
bless
em
*punct* ,
that
i
do
*punct* ,
dear
as
it
is
*punct* ,
replied
the
nurse
*punct* .
*break*
i
couldn't
see
em
suffer
before
my
very
eyes
*punct* ,
you
know
sir
*punct* .
*break*
no'
*punct* ;
said
mr.
bumble
approvingly
*punct* ;
no
*punct* ,
you
could
not
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
a
humane
woman
*punct* ,
mrs.
mann
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
here
she
set
down
the
glass.
*punct* ,
i
shall
take
a
early
opportunity
of
mentioning
it
to
the
board
*punct* ,
mrs.
mann
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
he
drew
it
towards
him.
*punct* ,
you
feel
as
a
mother
*punct* ,
mrs.
mann
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
he
stirred
the
gin-and-water.
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
i
drink
your
health
with
cheerfulness
*punct* ,
mrs.
mann'
*punct* ;
and
he
swallowed
half
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
about
business
*punct* ,
said
the
beadle
*punct* ,
taking
out
a
leathern
pocket-book
*punct* .
*break*
the
child
that
was
half-baptized
oliver
twist
*punct* ,
is
nine
year
old
to-day.
*punct* ;
bless
him
*punct* !
*break*
interposed
mrs.
mann
*punct* ,
inflaming
her
left
eye
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
*punct* .
*break*
and
notwithstanding
a
offered
reward
of
ten
pound
*punct* ,
which
was
afterwards
increased
to
twenty
pound
*punct* .
*break*
notwithstanding
the
most
superlative
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
i
may
say
*punct* ,
supernat'ral
exertions
on
the
part
of
this
parish
*punct* ,
said
bumble
*punct* ,
we
have
never
been
able
to
discover
who
is
his
father
*punct* ,
or
what
was
his
mother's
settlement
*punct* ,
name
*punct* ,
or
con
*punct* ,
dition
*punct* .
*break*
mrs
mann
raised
her
hands
in
astonishment
*punct* ;
but
added
*punct* ,
after
a
moment's
reflection
*punct* ,
how
comes
he
to
have
any
name
at
all
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ?
*break*
the
beadle
drew
himself
up
with
great
pride
*punct* ,
and
said
*punct* ,
i
inwented
it
*punct* .
*break*
you
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* !
*break*
i
*punct* ,
mrs.
mann
*punct* .
*break*
we
name
our
fondlings
in
alphabetical
order
*punct* .
*break*
the
last
was
a
s,
*punct* ,
swubble
*punct* ,
i
named
him
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
a
t,
*punct* ,
twist
*punct* ,
i
named
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
one
comes
will
be
unwin
*punct* ,
and
the
next
vilkins
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
you're
quite
a
literary
character
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
said
mrs.
mann
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
said
the
beadle
*punct* ,
evidently
gratified
with
the
compliment
*punct* ;
perhaps
i
may
be
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
i
may
be
*punct* ,
mrs.
mann
*punct* .
*break*
he
finished
the
gin-and-water
*punct* ,
and
added
*punct* ,
oliver
being
now
too
old
to
remain
here
*punct* ,
the
board
have
determined
to
have
him
back
into
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
come
out
myself
to
take
him
there
*punct* .
*break*
so
let
me
see
him
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
fetch
him
directly
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
mann
*punct* ,
leaving
the
room
for
that
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
*punct* ,
having
had
by
this
time
as
much
of
the
outer
coat
of
dirt
which
encrusted
his
face
and
hands
*punct* ,
removed
*punct* ,
as
could
be
scrubbed
off
in
one
washing
*punct* ,
was
led
into
the
room
by
his
benevolent
protectress
*punct* .
*break*
make
a
bow
to
the
gentleman
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
mann
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
made
a
bow
*punct* ,
which
was
divided
between
the
beadle
on
the
chair
*punct* ,
and
the
cocked
hat
on
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
go
along
with
me
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
in
a
majestic
voice
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
was
about
to
say
that
he
would
go
along
with
anybody
with
great
readiness
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
glancing
upward
*punct* ,
he
caught
sight
of
mrs.
mann
*punct* ,
who
had
got
behind
the
beadle's
chair
*punct* ,
and
was
shaking
her
fist
at
him
with
a
furious
countenance
*punct* .
*break*
he
took
the
hint
at
once
*punct* ,
for
the
fist
had
been
too
often
impressed
upon
his
body
not
to
be
deeply
impressed
upon
his
recollection
*punct* .
*break*
will
she
go
with
me
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
poor
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
she
can't
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
but
she'll
come
and
see
you
sometimes
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
no
very
great
consolation
to
the
child
*punct* .
*break*
young
as
he
was
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
had
sense
enough
to
make
a
feint
of
feeling
great
regret
at
going
away
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
no
very
difficult
matter
for
the
boy
to
call
tears
into
his
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
hunger
and
recent
ill-usage
are
great
assistants
if
you
want
to
cry
*punct* ;
and
oliver
cried
very
naturally
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
mann
gave
him
a
thousand
embraces
*punct* ,
and
what
oliver
wanted
a
great
deal
more
*punct* ,
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
*punct* ,
less
he
should
seem
too
hungry
when
he
got
to
the
workhouse
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
slice
of
bread
in
his
hand
*punct* ,
and
the
little
brown-cloth
parish
cap
on
his
head
*punct* ,
oliver
was
then
led
away
by
mr.
bumble
from
the
wretched
home
where
one
kind
word
or
look
had
never
lighted
the
gloom
of
his
infant
years
*punct* .
*break*
and
yet
he
burst
into
an
agony
of
childish
grief
*punct* ,
as
the
cottage-gate
closed
after
him
*punct* .
*break*
wretched
as
were
the
little
companions
in
misery
he
was
leaving
behind
*punct* ,
they
were
the
only
friends
he
had
ever
known
*punct* ;
and
a
sense
of
his
loneliness
in
the
great
wide
world
*punct* ,
sank
into
the
child's
heart
for
the
first
time
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
bumble
walked
on
with
long
strides
*punct* ;
little
oliver
*punct* ,
firmly
grasping
his
gold-laced
cuff
*punct* ,
trotted
beside
him
*punct* ,
inquiring
at
the
end
of
every
quarter
of
a
mile
whether
they
were
nearly
there
*punct* .
*break*
to
these
interrogations
mr.
bumble
returned
very
brief
and
snappish
replies
*punct* ;
for
the
temporary
blandness
which
gin-and-water
awakens
in
some
bosoms
had
by
this
time
evaporated
*punct* ;
and
he
was
once
again
a
beadle
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
had
not
been
within
the
walls
of
the
workhouse
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*punct* ,
and
had
scarcely
completed
the
demolition
of
a
second
slice
of
bread
*punct* ,
when
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
who
had
handed
him
over
to
the
care
of
an
old
woman
*punct* ,
returned
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
telling
him
it
was
a
board
night
*punct* ,
informed
him
that
the
board
had
said
he
was
to
appear
before
it
forthwith
*punct* .
*break*
not
having
a
very
clearly
defined
notion
of
what
a
live
board
was
*punct* ,
oliver
was
rather
astounded
by
this
intelligence
*punct* ,
and
was
not
quite
certain
whether
he
ought
to
laugh
or
cry
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
no
time
to
think
about
the
matter
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ;
for
mr.
bumble
gave
him
a
tap
on
the
head
*punct* ,
with
his
cane
*punct* ,
to
wake
him
up
*punct* :
and
another
on
the
back
to
make
him
lively
*punct* :
and
bidding
him
to
follow
*punct* ,
conducted
him
into
a
large
white-washed
room
*punct* ,
where
eight
or
ten
fat
gentlemen
were
sitting
round
a
table
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
top
of
the
table
*punct* ,
seated
in
an
arm-chair
rather
higher
than
the
rest
*punct* ,
was
a
particularly
fat
gentleman
with
a
very
round
*punct* ,
red
face
*punct* .
*break*
bow
to
the
board
*punct* ,
said
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
brushed
away
two
or
three
tears
that
were
lingering
in
his
eyes
*punct* ;
and
seeing
no
board
but
the
table
*punct* ,
fortunately
bowed
to
that
*punct* .
*break*
what's
your
name
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
was
frightened
at
the
sight
of
so
many
gentlemen
*punct* ,
which
made
him
tremble
*punct* :
and
the
beadle
gave
him
another
tap
behind
*punct* ,
which
made
him
cry
*punct* .
*break*
these
two
causes
made
him
answer
in
a
very
low
and
hesitating
voice
*punct* ;
whereupon
a
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
said
he
was
a
fool
*punct* .
*break*
which
was
a
capital
way
of
raising
his
spirits
*punct* ,
and
putting
him
quite
at
his
ease
*punct* .
*break*
boy
*punct* ,
said
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
*punct* ,
listen
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
you're
an
orphan
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ?
*break*
what's
that
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
poor
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
the
boy
is
a
fool
*punct* ,
i
thought
he
was
*punct* ,
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
gentleman
who
had
spoken
first
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
you've
got
no
father
or
mother
*punct* ,
and
that
you
were
brought
up
by
the
parish
*punct* ,
don't
you
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* ,
weeping
bitterly
*punct* .
*break*
what
are
you
crying
for
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
*punct* .
*break*
and
to
be
sure
it
was
very
extraordinary
*punct* .
*break*
what
could
the
boy
be
crying
for
*punct* ?
*break*
i
hope
you
say
your
prayers
every
night
*punct* ,
said
another
gentleman
in
a
gruff
voice
*punct* ;
and
pray
for
the
people
who
feed
you
*punct* ,
and
take
care
of
you
*punct* ,
like
a
christian
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
stammered
the
boy
*punct* .
*break*
the
gentleman
who
spoke
last
was
unconsciously
right
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
have
been
very
like
a
christian
*punct* ,
and
a
marvellously
good
christian
too
*punct* ,
if
oliver
had
prayed
for
the
people
who
fed
and
took
care
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
hadn't
*punct* ,
because
nobody
had
taught
him
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
come
here
to
be
educated
*punct* ,
and
taught
a
useful
trade
*punct* ,
said
the
red-faced
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
*punct* .
*break*
so
you'll
begin
to
pick
oakum
to-morrow
morning
at
six
o'clock
*punct* ,
added
the
surly
one
in
the
white
waistcoat
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
combination
of
both
these
blessings
in
the
one
simple
process
of
picking
oakum
*punct* ,
oliver
bowed
low
by
the
direction
of
the
beadle
*punct* ,
and
was
then
hurried
away
to
a
large
ward
*punct* ;
where
*punct* ,
on
a
rough
*punct* ,
hard
bed
*punct* ,
he
sobbed
himself
to
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
novel
illustration
of
the
tender
laws
of
england
*punct* !
*break*
they
let
the
paupers
go
to
sleep
*punct* !
*break*
he
little
thought
*punct* ,
as
he
lay
sleeping
in
happy
unconsciousness
of
all
around
him
*punct* ,
that
the
board
had
that
very
day
arrived
at
a
decision
which
would
exercise
the
most
material
influence
over
all
his
future
fortunes
*punct* .
*break*
but
they
had
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
was
it
*punct* :
the
members
of
this
board
were
very
sage
*punct* ,
deep
*punct* ,
philosophical
men
*punct* ;
and
when
they
came
to
turn
their
attention
to
the
workhouse
*punct* ,
they
found
out
at
once
*punct* ,
what
ordinary
folks
would
nver
have
discovered
*punct* ,
the
poor
people
liked
it
*punct* !
*break*
it
was
a
regular
place
of
public
entertainment
for
the
poorer
classes
*punct* ;
a
tavern
where
there
was
nothing
to
pay
*punct* ;
a
public
breakfast
*punct* ,
dinner
*punct* ,
tea
*punct* ,
and
supper
all
the
year
round
*punct* ;
a
brick
and
mortar
elysium
*punct* ,
where
it
was
all
play
and
no
work
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
board
*punct* ,
looking
very
knowing
*punct* ;
we
are
the
fellows
to
set
this
to
rights
*punct* ;
we'll
stop
it
all
*punct* ,
in
no
time
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
they
established
the
rule
*punct* ,
that
all
poor
people
should
have
the
alternative
*punct* ,
for
they
would
compel
nobody
*punct* ,
not
they
*punct* ,
of
being
starved
by
a
gradual
process
in
the
house
*punct* ,
or
by
a
quick
one
out
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
with
this
view
*punct* ,
they
contracted
with
the
water-works
to
lay
on
an
unlimited
supply
of
water
*punct* ;
and
with
a
corn-factor
to
supply
periodically
small
quantities
of
oatmeal
*punct* ;
and
issued
three
meals
of
thin
gruel
a
day
*punct* ,
with
an
onion
twice
a
week
*punct* ,
and
half
a
roll
of
sundays
*punct* .
*break*
they
made
a
great
many
other
wise
and
humane
regulations
*punct* ,
having
reference
to
the
ladies
*punct* ,
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
*punct* ;
kindly
undertook
to
divorce
poor
married
people
*punct* ,
in
consequence
of
the
great
expense
of
a
suit
in
doctors
commons
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
instead
of
compelling
a
man
to
support
his
family
*punct* ,
as
they
had
theretofore
done
*punct* ,
took
his
family
away
from
him
*punct* ,
and
made
him
a
bachelor
*punct* !
*break*
there
is
no
saying
how
many
applicants
for
relief
*punct* ,
under
these
last
two
heads
*punct* ,
might
have
started
up
in
all
classes
of
society
*punct* ,
if
it
had
not
been
coupled
with
the
workhouse
*punct* ;
but
the
board
were
long-headed
men
*punct* ,
and
had
provided
for
this
difficulty
*punct* .
*break*
the
relief
was
inseparable
from
the
workhouse
and
the
gruel
*punct* ;
and
that
frightened
people
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
first
six
months
after
oliver
twist
was
removed
*punct* ,
the
system
was
in
full
operation
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
rather
expensive
at
first
*punct* ,
in
consequence
of
the
increase
in
the
undertaker's
bill
*punct* ,
and
the
necessity
of
taking
in
the
clothes
of
all
the
paupers
*punct* ,
which
fluttered
loosely
on
their
wasted
*punct* ,
shrunken
forms
*punct* ,
after
a
week
or
two's
gruel
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
number
of
workhouse
inmates
got
thin
as
well
as
the
paupers
*punct* ;
and
the
board
were
in
ecstasies
*punct* .
*break*
the
room
in
which
the
boys
were
fed
*punct* ,
was
a
large
stone
hall
*punct* ,
with
a
copper
at
one
end
*punct* :
out
of
which
the
master
*punct* ,
dressed
in
an
apron
for
the
purpose
*punct* ,
and
assisted
by
one
or
two
women
*punct* ,
ladled
the
gruel
at
mealtimes
*punct* .
*break*
of
this
festive
composition
each
boy
had
one
porringer
*punct* ,
and
no
more
*punct* ,
except
on
occasions
of
great
public
rejoicing
*punct* ,
when
he
had
two
ounces
and
a
quarter
of
bread
besides
*punct* .
*break*
the
bowls
never
wanted
washing
*punct* .
*break*
the
boys
polished
them
with
their
spoons
till
they
shone
again
*punct* ;
and
when
they
had
performed
this
operation
*punct* ,
which
never
took
very
long
*punct* ,
the
spoons
being
nearly
as
large
as
the
bowls
*punct* ,
they
would
sit
staring
at
the
copper
*punct* ,
with
such
eager
eyes
*punct* ,
as
if
they
could
have
devoured
the
very
bricks
of
which
it
was
composed
*punct* ;
employing
themselves
*punct* ,
meanwhile
*punct* ,
in
sucking
their
fingers
most
assiduously
*punct* ,
with
the
view
of
catching
up
any
stray
splashes
of
gruel
that
might
have
been
cast
thereon
*punct* .
*break*
boys
have
generally
excellent
appetites
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
twist
and
his
companions
suffered
the
tortures
of
slow
starvation
for
three
months
*punct* :
at
last
they
got
so
voracious
and
wild
with
hunger
*punct* ,
that
one
boy
*punct* ,
who
was
tall
for
his
age
*punct* ,
and
hadn't
been
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
*punct* ,
for
his
father
had
kept
a
small
cook-shop
*punct* ,
hinted
darkly
to
his
companions
*punct* ,
that
unless
he
had
another
basin
of
gruel
per
diem
*punct* ,
he
was
afraid
he
might
some
night
happen
to
eat
the
boy
who
slept
next
him
*punct* ,
who
happened
to
be
a
weakly
youth
of
tender
age
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
wild
*punct* ,
hungry
eye
*punct* ;
and
they
implicitly
believed
him
*punct* .
*break*
a
council
was
held
*punct* ;
lots
were
cast
who
should
walk
up
to
the
master
after
supper
that
evening
*punct* ,
and
ask
for
more
*punct* ;
and
it
fell
to
oliver
twist
*punct* .
*break*
the
evening
arrived
*punct* ;
the
boys
took
their
places
*punct* .
*break*
the
master
*punct* ,
in
his
cook's
uniform
*punct* ,
stationed
himself
at
the
copper
*punct* ;
his
pauper
assistants
ranged
themselves
behind
him
*punct* ;
the
gruel
was
served
out
*punct* ;
and
a
long
grace
was
said
over
the
short
commons
*punct* .
*break*
the
gruel
disappeared
*punct* ;
the
boys
whispered
each
other
*punct* ,
and
winked
at
oliver
*punct* ;
while
his
next
neighbours
nudged
him
*punct* .
*break*
child
as
he
was
*punct* ,
he
was
desperate
with
hunger
*punct* ,
and
reckless
with
misery
*punct* .
*break*
he
rose
from
the
table
*punct* ;
and
advancing
to
the
master
*punct* ,
basin
and
spoon
in
hand
*punct* ,
said
*punct* :
somewhat
alarmed
at
his
own
temerity
*punct* :
please
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
i
want
some
more
*punct* .
*break*
the
master
was
a
fat
*punct* ,
healthy
man
*punct* ;
but
he
turned
very
pale
*punct* .
*break*
he
gazed
in
stupified
astonishment
on
the
small
rebel
for
some
seconds
*punct* ,
and
then
clung
for
support
to
the
copper
*punct* .
*break*
the
assistants
were
paralysed
with
wonder
*punct* ;
the
boys
with
fear
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
master
at
length
*punct* ,
in
a
faint
voice
*punct* .
*break*
please
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* ,
i
want
some
more
*punct* .
*break*
the
master
aimed
a
blow
at
oliver's
head
with
the
ladle
*punct* ;
pinioned
him
in
his
arm
*punct* ;
and
shrieked
aloud
for
the
beadle
*punct* .
*break*
the
board
were
sitting
in
solemn
conclave
*punct* ,
when
mr.
bumble
rushed
into
the
room
in
great
excitement
*punct* ,
and
addressing
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
mr.
limbkins
*punct* ,
i
beg
your
pardon
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
oliver
twist
has
asked
for
more
*punct* !
*break*
there
was
a
general
start
*punct* .
*break*
horror
was
depicted
on
every
countenance
*punct* .
*break*
said
mr.
limbkins
*punct* .
*break*
compose
yourself
*punct* ,
bumble
*punct* ,
and
answer
me
distinctly
*punct* .
*break*
do
i
understand
that
he
asked
for
more
*punct* ,
after
he
had
eaten
the
supper
allotted
by
the
dietary
*punct* ?
*break*
he
did
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
that
boy
will
be
hung
*punct* ,
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
that
boy
will
be
hung
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
controverted
the
prophetic
gentleman's
opinion
*punct* .
*break*
an
animated
discussion
took
place
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
was
ordered
into
instant
confinement
*punct* ;
and
a
bill
was
next
morning
pasted
on
the
outside
of
the
gate
*punct* ,
offering
a
reward
of
five
pounds
to
anybody
who
would
take
oliver
twist
off
the
hands
of
the
parish
*punct* .
*break*
in
other
words
*punct* ,
five
pounds
and
oliver
twist
were
offered
to
any
man
or
woman
who
wanted
an
apprentice
to
any
trade
*punct* ,
business
*punct* ,
or
calling
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
was
more
convinced
of
anything
in
my
life
*punct* ,
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
*punct* ,
as
he
knocked
at
the
gate
and
read
the
bill
next
morning
*punct* :
i
never
was
more
convinced
of
anything
in
my
life
*punct* ,
than
i
am
that
that
boy
will
come
to
be
hung
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
purpose
to
show
in
the
sequel
whether
the
white
waistcoated
gentleman
was
right
or
not
*punct* ,
i
should
perhaps
mar
the
interest
of
this
narrative
*punct* ,
supposing
it
to
possess
any
at
all
*punct* ,
if
i
ventured
to
hint
just
yet
*punct* ,
whether
the
life
of
oliver
twist
had
this
violent
termination
or
no
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
week
after
the
commission
of
the
impious
and
profane
offence
of
asking
for
more
*punct* ,
oliver
remained
a
close
prisoner
in
the
dark
and
solitary
room
to
which
he
had
been
consigned
by
the
wisdom
and
mercy
of
the
board
*punct* .
*break*
it
appears
*punct* ,
at
first
sight
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
if
he
had
entertained
a
becoming
feeling
of
respect
for
the
prediction
of
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
*punct* ,
he
would
have
established
that
sage
individual's
prophetic
character
*punct* ,
once
and
for
ever
*punct* ,
by
tying
one
end
of
his
pocket-handkerchief
to
a
hook
in
the
wall
*punct* ,
and
attaching
himself
to
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
performance
of
this
feat
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
there
was
one
obstacle
*punct* :
namely
*punct* ,
that
pocket-handkerchiefs
being
decided
articles
of
luxury
*punct* ,
had
been
*punct* ,
for
all
future
times
and
ages
*punct* ,
removed
from
the
noses
of
paupers
by
the
express
order
of
the
board
*punct* ,
in
council
assembled
*punct* :
solemnly
given
and
pronounced
under
their
hands
and
seals
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
still
greater
obstacle
in
oliver's
youth
and
childishness
*punct* .
*break*
he
only
cried
bitterly
all
day
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
when
the
long
*punct* ,
dismal
night
came
on
*punct* ,
spread
his
little
hands
before
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
darkness
*punct* ,
and
crouching
in
the
corner
*punct* ,
tried
to
sleep
*punct* :
ever
and
anon
waking
with
a
start
and
tremble
*punct* ,
and
drawing
himself
closer
and
closer
to
the
wall
*punct* ,
as
if
to
feel
even
its
cold
hard
surface
were
a
protection
in
the
gloom
and
loneliness
which
surrounded
him
*punct* .
*break*
let
it
not
be
supposed
by
the
enemies
of
the
system
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
during
the
period
of
his
solitary
incarceration
*punct* ,
oliver
was
denied
the
benefit
of
exercise
*punct* ,
the
pleasure
of
society
*punct* ,
or
the
advantages
of
religious
consolation
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
exercise
*punct* ,
it
was
nice
cold
weather
*punct* ,
and
he
was
allowed
to
perform
his
ablutions
every
morning
under
the
pump
*punct* ,
in
a
stone
yard
*punct* ,
in
the
presence
of
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
who
prevented
his
catching
cold
*punct* ,
and
caused
a
tingling
sensation
to
pervade
his
frame
*punct* ,
by
repeated
applications
of
the
cane
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
society
*punct* ,
he
was
carried
every
other
day
into
the
hall
where
the
boys
dined
*punct* ,
and
there
sociably
flogged
as
a
public
warning
and
example
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
for
from
being
denied
the
advantages
of
religious
consolation
*punct* ,
he
was
kicked
into
the
same
apartment
every
evening
at
prayer-time
*punct* ,
and
there
permitted
to
listen
to
*punct* ,
and
console
his
mind
with
*punct* ,
a
general
supplication
of
the
boys
*punct* ,
containing
a
special
clause
*punct* ,
therein
inserted
by
authority
of
the
board
*punct* ,
in
which
they
entreated
to
be
made
good
*punct* ,
virtuous
*punct* ,
contented
*punct* ,
and
obedient
*punct* ,
and
to
be
guarded
from
the
sins
and
vices
of
oliver
twist
*punct* :
whom
the
supplication
distinctly
set
forth
to
be
under
the
exclusive
patronage
and
protection
of
the
powers
of
wickedness
*punct* ,
and
an
article
direct
from
the
manufactory
of
the
very
devil
himself
*punct* .
*break*
it
chanced
one
morning
*punct* ,
while
oliver's
affairs
were
in
this
auspicious
and
confortable
state
*punct* ,
that
mr.
gamfield
*punct* ,
chimney-sweep
*punct* ,
went
his
way
down
the
high
street
*punct* ,
deeply
cogitating
in
his
mind
his
ways
and
means
of
paying
certain
arrears
of
rent
*punct* ,
for
which
his
landlord
had
become
rather
pressing
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
gamfield's
most
sanguine
estimate
of
his
finances
could
not
raise
them
within
full
five
pounds
of
the
desired
amount
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
in
a
species
of
arthimetical
desperation
*punct* ,
he
was
alternately
cudgelling
his
brains
and
his
donkey
*punct* ,
when
passing
the
workhouse
*punct* ,
his
eyes
encountered
the
bill
on
the
gate
*punct* .
*break*
wo
*punct* ,
o
*punct* !
*break*
said
mr.
gamfield
to
the
donkey
*punct* .
*break*
the
donkey
was
in
a
state
of
profound
abstraction
*punct* :
wondering
*punct* ,
probably
*punct* ,
whether
he
was
destined
to
be
regaled
with
a
cabbage-stalk
or
two
when
he
had
disposed
of
the
two
sacks
of
soot
with
which
the
little
cart
was
laden
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
without
noticing
the
word
of
command
*punct* ,
he
jogged
onward
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
gamfield
growled
a
fierce
imprecation
on
the
donkey
generally
*punct* ,
but
more
particularly
on
his
eyes
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
running
after
him
*punct* ,
bestowed
a
blow
on
his
head
*punct* ,
which
would
inevitably
have
beaten
in
any
skull
but
a
donkey's
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
catching
hold
of
the
bridle
*punct* ,
he
gave
his
jaw
a
sharp
wrench
*punct* ,
by
way
of
gentle
reminder
that
he
was
not
his
own
master
*punct* ;
and
by
these
means
turned
him
round
*punct* .
*break*
he
then
gave
him
another
blow
on
the
head
*punct* ,
just
to
stun
him
till
he
came
back
again
*punct* .
*break*
having
completed
these
arrangements
*punct* ,
he
walked
up
to
the
gate
*punct* ,
to
read
the
bill
*punct* .
*break*
the
gentleman
with
the
white
waistcoat
was
standing
at
the
gate
with
his
hands
behind
him
*punct* ,
after
having
delivered
himself
of
some
profound
sentiments
in
the
board-room
*punct* .
*break*
having
witnessed
the
little
dispute
between
mr.
gamfield
and
the
donkey
*punct* ,
he
smiled
joyously
when
that
person
came
up
to
read
the
bill
*punct* ,
for
he
saw
at
once
that
mr.
gamfield
was
exactly
the
sort
of
master
oliver
twist
wanted
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
gamfield
smiled
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
as
he
perused
the
document
*punct* ;
for
five
pounds
was
just
the
sum
he
had
been
wishing
for
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
as
to
the
boy
with
which
it
was
encumbered
*punct* ,
mr.
gamfield
*punct* ,
knowing
what
the
dietary
of
the
workhouse
was
*punct* ,
well
knew
he
would
be
a
nice
small
pattern
*punct* ,
just
the
very
thing
for
register
stoves
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
he
spelt
the
bill
through
again
*punct* ,
from
beginning
to
end
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
touching
his
fur
cap
in
token
of
humility
*punct* ,
accosted
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
*punct* .
*break*
this
here
boy
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
wot
the
parish
wants
to
prentis
*punct* ,
said
mr.
gamfield
*punct* .
*break*
ay
*punct* ,
my
man
*punct* ,
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
*punct* ,
with
a
condescending
smile
*punct* .
*break*
what
of
him
*punct* ?
*break*
if
the
parish
vould
like
him
to
learn
a
right
pleasant
trade
*punct* ,
in
a
good
spectable
chimbley-sweepin
bisness
*punct* ,
said
mr.
gamfield
*punct* ,
i
wants
a
prentis
*punct* ,
and
i
am
ready
to
take
him
*punct* .
*break*
walk
in
*punct* ,
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
gamfield
having
lingered
behind
*punct* ,
to
give
the
donkey
another
blow
on
the
head
*punct* ,
and
another
wrench
of
the
jaw
*punct* ,
as
a
caution
not
to
run
away
in
his
absence
*punct* ,
followed
the
gentleman
with
the
white
waistcoat
into
the
room
where
oliver
had
first
seen
him
*punct* .
*break*
it's
a
nasty
trade
*punct* ,
said
mr.
limbkins
*punct* ,
when
gamfield
had
again
stated
his
wish
*punct* .
*break*
young
boys
have
been
smothered
in
chimneys
before
now
*punct* ,
said
another
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
that's
acause
they
damped
the
straw
afore
they
lit
it
in
the
chimbley
to
make
em
come
down
again
*punct* ,
said
gamfield
*punct* ;
that's
all
smoke
*punct* ,
and
no
blaze
*punct* ;
vereas
smoke
ain't
o
no
use
at
all
in
making
a
boy
come
down
*punct* ,
for
it
only
sinds
him
to
sleep
*punct* ,
and
that's
wot
he
likes
*punct* .
*break*
boys
is
wery
obstinit
*punct* ,
and
wery
lazy
*punct* ,
gen'l'men
*punct* ,
and
there's
nothink
like
a
good
hot
blaze
to
make
em
come
down
vith
a
run
*punct* .
*break*
it's
humane
too
*punct* ,
gen'l'men
*punct* ,
acause
*punct* ,
even
if
they've
stuck
in
the
chimbley
*punct* ,
roasting
their
feet
makes
em
struggle
to
hextricate
theirselves
*punct* .
*break*
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
appeared
very
much
amused
by
this
explanation
*punct* ;
but
his
mirth
was
speedily
checked
by
a
look
from
mr.
limbkins
*punct* .
*break*
the
board
then
procedded
to
converse
among
themselves
for
a
few
minutes
*punct* ,
but
in
so
low
a
tone
*punct* ,
that
the
words
saving
of
expenditure
*punct* ,
looked
well
in
the
accounts
*punct* ,
have
a
printed
report
published
*punct* ,
were
alone
audible
*punct* .
*break*
these
only
chanced
to
be
heard
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
or
account
of
their
being
very
frequently
repeated
with
great
emphasis
*punct* .
*break*
at
length
the
whispering
ceased
*punct* ;
and
the
members
of
the
board
*punct* ,
having
resumed
their
seats
and
their
solemnity
*punct* ,
mr.
limbkins
said
*punct* :
we
have
considered
your
proposition
*punct* ,
and
we
don't
approve
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
not
at
all
*punct* ,
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
*punct* .
*break*
decidedly
not
*punct* ,
added
the
other
members
*punct* .
*break*
as
mr.
gamfield
did
happen
to
labour
under
the
slight
imputation
of
having
bruised
three
or
four
boys
to
death
already
*punct* ,
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
board
had
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
in
some
unaccountable
freak
*punct* ,
taken
it
into
their
heads
that
this
extraneous
circumstance
ought
to
influence
their
proceedings
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
very
unlike
their
general
mode
of
doing
business
*punct* ,
if
they
had
*punct* ;
but
still
*punct* ,
as
he
had
no
particular
wish
to
revive
the
rumour
*punct* ,
he
twisted
his
cap
in
his
hands
*punct* ,
and
walked
slowly
from
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
so
you
won't
let
me
have
him
*punct* ,
gen'l'men
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mr.
gamfield
*punct* ,
pausing
near
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
limbkins
*punct* ;
at
least
*punct* ,
as
it's
a
nasty
business
*punct* ,
we
think
you
ought
to
take
something
less
than
the
premium
we
offered
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
gamfield's
countenance
brightened
*punct* ,
as
*punct* ,
with
a
quick
step
*punct* ,
he
returned
to
the
table
*punct* ,
and
said
*punct* ,
what'll
you
give
*punct* ,
gen'l'men
*punct* ?
*break*
don't
be
too
hard
on
a
poor
man
*punct* .
*break*
what'll
you
give
*punct* ?
*break*
i
should
say
*punct* ,
three
pound
ten
was
plenty
*punct* ,
said
mr.
limbkins
*punct* .
*break*
ten
shillings
too
much
*punct* ,
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
*punct* .
*break*
said
gamfield
*punct* ;
say
four
pound
*punct* ,
gen'l'men
*punct* .
*break*
say
four
pound
*punct* ,
and
you've
got
rid
of
him
for
good
and
all
*punct* .
*break*
three
pound
ten
*punct* ,
repeated
mr.
limbkins
*punct* ,
firmly
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
split
the
diff'erence
*punct* ,
gen'l'men
*punct* ,
urged
gamfield
*punct* .
*break*
three
pound
fifteen
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
farthing
more
*punct* ,
was
the
firm
reply
of
mr.
limbkins
*punct* .
*break*
you're
desperate
hard
upon
me
*punct* ,
gen'l'men
*punct* ,
said
gamfield
*punct* ,
wavering
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
*punct* .
*break*
he'd
be
cheap
with
nothing
at
all
*punct* ,
as
a
premium
*punct* .
*break*
take
him
*punct* ,
you
silly
fellow
*punct* !
*break*
he's
just
the
boy
for
you
*punct* .
*break*
he
wants
the
stick
*punct* ,
now
and
then
*punct* :
it'll
do
him
good
*punct* ;
and
his
board
needn't
come
very
expensive
*punct* ,
for
he
hasn't
been
overfed
since
he
was
born
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
gamfield
gave
an
arch
look
at
the
faces
round
the
table
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
observing
a
smile
on
all
of
them
*punct* ,
gradually
broke
into
a
smile
himself
*punct* .
*break*
the
bargain
was
made
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
was
at
once
instructed
that
oliver
twist
and
his
indentures
were
to
be
conveyed
before
the
magistrate
*punct* ,
for
signature
and
approval
*punct* ,
that
very
afternoon
*punct* .
*break*
in
pursuance
of
this
determination
*punct* ,
little
oliver
*punct* ,
to
his
excessive
astonishment
*punct* ,
was
released
from
bondage
*punct* ,
and
ordered
to
put
himself
into
a
clean
shirt
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
hardly
achieved
this
very
unusual
gymnastic
performance
*punct* ,
when
mr.
bumble
brought
him
*punct* ,
with
his
own
hands
*punct* ,
a
basin
of
gruel
*punct* ,
and
the
holiday
allowance
of
two
ounces
and
a
quarter
of
bread
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
tremendous
sight
*punct* ,
oliver
began
to
cry
very
piteously
*punct* :
thinking
*punct* ,
not
unaturally
*punct* ,
that
the
board
must
have
determined
to
kill
him
for
some
useful
purpose
*punct* ,
or
they
never
would
have
begun
to
fatten
him
up
in
that
way
*punct* .
*break*
don't
make
your
eyes
red
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ,
but
eat
your
food
and
be
thankful
*punct* ,
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
in
a
tone
of
impressive
pomposity
*punct* .
*break*
you're
a
going
to
be
made
a
prentice
of
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
a
prentice
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
child
*punct* ,
trembling
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ,
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
the
kind
and
blessed
gentleman
which
is
so
amny
parents
to
you
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ,
when
you
have
none
of
your
own
*punct* :
are
a
going
to
prentice
you
*punct* :
and
to
set
you
up
in
life
*punct* ,
and
make
a
man
of
you
*punct* :
although
the
expense
to
the
parish
is
three
pound
ten!
*punct* ,
three
pound
ten
*punct* ,
oliver!
*punct* ,
seventy
shillins
*punct* ,
one
hundred
and
forty
sixpences!
*punct* ,
and
all
for
a
naughty
orphan
which
noboday
can't
love
*punct* .
*break*
as
mr.
bumble
paused
to
take
breath
*punct* ,
after
delivering
this
address
in
an
awful
voice
*punct* ,
the
tears
rolled
down
the
poor
child's
face
*punct* ,
and
he
sobbed
bitterly
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
somewhat
less
pompously
*punct* ,
for
it
was
gratifying
to
his
feelings
to
observe
the
effect
his
eloquence
had
produced
*punct* ;
come
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* !
*break*
wipe
your
eyes
with
the
cuffs
of
your
jacket
*punct* ,
and
don't
cry
into
your
gruel
*punct* ;
that's
a
very
foolish
action
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
it
certainly
was
*punct* ,
for
there
was
quite
enough
water
in
it
already
*punct* .
*break*
on
their
way
to
the
magistrate
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
instructed
oliver
that
all
he
would
have
to
do
*punct* ,
would
be
to
look
very
happy
*punct* ,
and
say
*punct* ,
when
the
gentleman
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
be
apprenticed
*punct* ,
that
he
should
like
it
very
much
indeed
*punct* ;
both
of
which
injunctions
oliver
promised
to
obey
*punct* :
the
rather
as
mr.
bumble
threw
in
a
gentle
hint
*punct* ,
that
if
he
failed
in
either
particular
*punct* ,
there
was
no
telling
what
would
be
done
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
when
they
arrived
at
the
office
*punct* ,
he
was
shut
up
in
a
little
room
by
himself
*punct* ,
and
admonished
by
mr.
bumble
to
stay
there
*punct* ,
until
he
came
back
to
fetch
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
the
boy
remained
*punct* ,
with
a
palpitating
heart
*punct* ,
for
half
an
hour
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
mr.
bumble
thrust
in
his
head
*punct* ,
unadorned
with
the
cocked
hat
*punct* ,
and
said
aloud
*punct* :
now
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
come
to
the
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
as
mr.
bumble
said
this
*punct* ,
he
put
on
a
grim
and
threatening
look
*punct* ,
and
added
*punct* ,
in
a
low
voice
*punct* ,
mind
what
i
told
you
*punct* ,
you
young
rascal
*punct* !
*break*
oliver
stared
innocently
in
mr.
bumble's
face
at
this
somewhat
contradictory
style
of
address
*punct* ;
but
that
gentleman
prevented
his
offering
any
remark
thereupon
*punct* ,
by
leading
him
at
once
into
an
adjoining
room
*punct* :
the
door
of
which
was
open
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
large
room
*punct* ,
with
a
great
window
*punct* .
*break*
behind
a
desk
*punct* ,
sat
two
old
gentleman
with
powdered
heads
*punct* :
one
of
whom
was
reading
the
newspaper
*punct* ;
while
the
other
was
perusing
*punct* ,
with
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
tortoise-shell
spectacles
*punct* ,
a
small
piece
of
parchment
which
lay
before
him
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
limbkins
was
standing
in
front
of
the
desk
on
one
side
*punct* ;
and
mr.
gamfield
*punct* ,
with
a
partially
washed
face
*punct* ,
on
the
other
*punct* ;
while
two
or
three
bluff-looking
men
*punct* ,
in
top-boots
*punct* ,
were
lounging
about
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
gentleman
with
the
spectacles
gradually
dozed
off
*punct* ,
over
the
little
bit
of
parchment
*punct* ;
and
there
was
a
short
pause
*punct* ,
after
oliver
had
been
stationed
by
mr.
bumble
in
front
of
the
desk
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
the
boy
*punct* ,
your
worship
*punct* ,
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
gentleman
who
was
reading
the
newspaper
raised
his
head
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
and
pulled
the
other
old
gentleman
by
the
sleeve
*punct* ;
whereupon
*punct* ,
the
last-mentioned
old
gentleman
woke
up
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
is
this
the
boy
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
him
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
bow
to
the
magistrate
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
roused
himself
*punct* ,
and
made
his
best
obeisance
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
wondering
*punct* ,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
magistrates
powder
*punct* ,
whether
all
boards
were
born
with
that
white
stuff
on
their
heads
*punct* ,
and
were
boards
from
thenceforth
on
that
account
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
i
suppose
he's
fond
of
chimney-sweeping
*punct* ?
*break*
he
doats
on
it
*punct* ,
your
worship
*punct* ,
replied
bumble
*punct* ;
giving
oliver
a
sly
pinch
*punct* ,
to
intimate
that
he
had
better
not
say
he
didn't
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
will
be
a
sweep
*punct* ,
will
he
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
the
old
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
was
to
bind
him
to
any
other
trade
to-morrow
*punct* ,
he'd
run
away
simultaneous
*punct* ,
your
worship
*punct* ,
replied
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
man
that's
to
be
his
master
*punct* ,
you
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
you'll
treat
him
well
*punct* ,
and
feed
him
*punct* ,
and
do
all
that
sort
of
thing
*punct* ,
will
you
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
says
i
will
*punct* ,
i
means
i
will
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
gamfield
doggedly
*punct* .
*break*
you're
a
rough
speaker
*punct* ,
my
friend
*punct* ,
but
you
look
an
honest
*punct* ,
open-hearted
man
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* :
turning
his
spectacles
in
the
direction
of
the
candidate
for
oliver's
premium
*punct* ,
whose
villainous
countenance
was
a
regular
stamped
receipt
for
cruelty
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
magistrate
was
half
blind
and
half
childish
*punct* ,
so
he
couldn't
reasonably
be
expected
to
discern
what
other
people
did
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
i
am
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
mr.
gamfield
*punct* ,
with
an
ugly
leer
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
doubt
you
are
*punct* ,
my
friend
*punct* ,
replied
the
old
gentleman
*punct* :
fixing
his
spectacles
more
firmly
on
his
nose
*punct* ,
and
looking
about
him
for
the
inkstand
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
critical
moment
of
oliver's
fate
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
inkstand
had
been
where
the
old
gentleman
though
it
was
*punct* ,
he
would
have
dipped
his
pen
into
it
*punct* ,
and
signed
the
indentures
*punct* ,
and
oliver
would
have
been
straightway
hurried
off
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
it
chanced
to
be
immediately
under
his
nose
*punct* ,
it
followed
*punct* ,
as
a
matter
of
course
*punct* ,
that
he
looked
all
over
his
desk
for
it
*punct* ,
without
finding
it
*punct* ;
and
happening
in
the
course
of
his
search
to
look
straight
before
him
*punct* ,
his
gaze
encountered
the
pale
and
terrified
face
of
oliver
twist
*punct* :
who
*punct* ,
despite
all
the
admonitory
looks
and
pinches
of
bumble
*punct* ,
was
regarding
the
repulsive
countenance
of
his
future
master
*punct* ,
with
a
mingled
expression
of
horror
and
fear
*punct* ,
too
palpable
to
be
mistaken
*punct* ,
even
by
a
half-blind
magistrate
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
gentleman
stopped
*punct* ,
laid
down
his
pen
*punct* ,
and
looked
from
oliver
to
mr.
limbkins
*punct* ;
who
attempted
to
take
snuff
with
a
cheerful
and
unconcerned
aspect
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
you
look
pale
and
alarmed
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
the
matter
*punct* ?
*break*
stand
a
little
away
from
him
*punct* ,
beadle
*punct* ,
said
the
other
magistrate
*punct* :
laying
aside
the
paper
*punct* ,
and
leaning
forward
with
an
expression
of
interest
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* ,
tell
us
what's
the
matter
*punct* :
don't
be
afraid
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
fell
on
his
knees
*punct* ,
and
clasping
his
hands
together
*punct* ,
prayed
that
they
would
order
him
back
to
the
dark
room
*punct* ,
that
they
would
starve
him
*punct* ,
beat
him
*punct* ,
kill
him
if
they
pleased
*punct* ,
rather
than
send
him
away
with
that
dreadful
man
*punct* .
*break*
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
raising
his
hands
and
eyes
with
most
impressive
solemnite
*punct* .
*break*
of
all
the
artful
and
designing
orphans
that
ever
i
see
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ,
you
are
one
of
the
most
bare-facedest
*punct* .
*break*
hold
your
tongue
*punct* ,
beadle
*punct* ,
said
the
second
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
when
mr.
bumble
had
given
vent
to
this
compound
adjective
*punct* .
*break*
i
beg
your
worship's
pardon
*punct* ,
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
incredulous
of
having
heard
aright
*punct* .
*break*
did
your
worship
speak
to
me
*punct* ?
*break*
hold
your
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
bumble
was
stupefied
with
astonishment
*punct* .
*break*
a
beadle
ordered
to
hold
his
tongue
*punct* !
*break*
a
moral
revolution
*punct* !
*break*
the
old
gentleman
in
the
tortoise-shell
spectacles
looked
at
his
companion
*punct* ,
he
nodded
significantly
*punct* .
*break*
we
refuse
to
sanction
these
indentures
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* :
tossing
aside
the
piece
of
parchment
as
he
spoke
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
*punct* ,
stammered
mr.
limbkins
*punct* :
i
hope
the
magistrates
will
not
form
the
opinion
that
the
authorities
have
been
guilty
of
any
improper
conduct
*punct* ,
on
the
unsupported
testimony
of
a
child
*punct* .
*break*
the
magistrates
are
not
called
upon
to
pronounce
any
opinion
on
the
matter
*punct* ,
said
the
second
old
gentleman
sharply
*punct* .
*break*
take
the
boy
back
to
the
workhouse
*punct* ,
and
treat
him
kindly
*punct* .
*break*
he
seems
to
want
it
*punct* .
*break*
that
same
evening
*punct* ,
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
most
positively
and
decidedly
affirmed
*punct* ,
not
only
that
oliver
would
be
hung
*punct* ,
but
that
he
would
be
drawn
and
quartered
into
the
bargain
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
bumble
shook
his
head
with
gloomy
mystery
*punct* ,
and
said
he
wished
he
might
come
to
good
*punct* ;
whereunto
mr.
gamfield
replied
*punct* ,
that
he
wished
he
might
come
to
him
*punct* ;
which
*punct* ,
although
he
agreed
with
the
beadle
in
most
matters
*punct* ,
would
seem
to
be
a
wish
of
a
totaly
opposite
description
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
morning
*punct* ,
the
public
were
once
informed
that
oliver
twist
was
again
to
let
*punct* ,
and
that
five
pounds
would
be
paid
to
anybody
who
would
take
possession
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
in
great
families
*punct* ,
when
an
advantageous
place
cannot
be
obtained
*punct* ,
either
in
possession
*punct* ,
reversion
*punct* ,
remainder
*punct* ,
or
expectancy
*punct* ,
for
the
young
man
who
is
growing
up
*punct* ,
it
is
a
very
general
custom
to
send
him
to
sea
*punct* .
*break*
the
board
*punct* ,
in
imitation
of
so
wise
and
salutary
an
example
*punct* ,
took
counsel
together
on
the
expediency
of
shipping
off
oliver
twist
*punct* ,
in
some
small
trading
vessel
bound
to
a
good
unhealthy
port
*punct* .
*break*
this
suggested
itself
as
the
very
best
thing
that
could
possibly
be
done
with
him
*punct* :
the
probability
being
*punct* ,
that
the
skipper
would
flog
him
to
death
*punct* ,
in
a
playful
mood
*punct* ,
some
day
after
dinner
*punct* ,
or
would
knock
his
brains
out
with
an
iron
bar
*punct* ;
both
pastimes
being
*punct* ,
as
is
pretty
generally
known
*punct* ,
very
favourite
and
common
recreations
among
gentleman
of
that
class
*punct* .
*break*
the
more
the
case
presented
itself
to
the
board
*punct* ,
in
this
point
of
view
*punct* ,
the
more
manifold
the
advantages
of
the
step
appeared
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
way
of
providing
for
oliver
effectually
*punct* ,
was
to
send
him
to
sea
without
delay
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
bumble
had
been
despatched
to
make
various
preliminary
inquiries
*punct* ,
with
the
view
of
finding
out
some
captain
or
other
who
wanted
a
cabin-boy
without
any
friends
*punct* ;
and
was
returning
to
the
workhouse
to
communicate
the
result
of
his
mission
*punct* ;
when
he
encountered
at
the
gate
*punct* ,
no
less
a
person
than
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
the
parochial
undertaker
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
sowerberry
was
a
tall
gaunt
*punct* ,
large-jointed
man
*punct* ,
attired
in
a
suit
of
threadbare
black
*punct* ,
with
darned
cotton
stockings
of
the
same
colour
*punct* ,
and
shoes
to
answer
*punct* .
*break*
his
features
were
not
naturally
intended
to
wear
a
smiling
aspect
*punct* ,
but
he
was
in
general
rather
given
to
professional
jocosity
*punct* .
*break*
his
step
was
elastic
*punct* ,
and
his
face
betokened
inward
pleasantry
*punct* ,
as
he
advanced
to
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
and
shook
him
cordially
by
the
hand
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
taken
the
measure
of
the
two
women
that
died
last
night
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
said
the
undertaker
*punct* .
*break*
you'll
make
your
fortune
*punct* ,
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
said
the
beadle
*punct* ,
as
he
thrust
his
thumb
and
forefinger
into
the
proferred
snuff-box
of
the
undertaker
*punct* :
which
was
an
ingenious
little
model
of
a
patent
coffin
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
you'll
make
your
fortune
*punct* ,
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
repeated
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
tapping
the
undertaker
on
the
shoulder
*punct* ,
in
a
friendly
manner
*punct* ,
with
his
cane
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
undertaker
in
a
tone
which
half
admitted
and
half
disputed
the
probability
of
the
event
*punct* .
*break*
the
prices
allowed
by
the
board
are
very
small
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
so
are
the
coffins
*punct* ,
replied
the
beadle
*punct* :
with
precisely
as
near
an
approach
to
a
laugh
as
a
great
official
ought
to
indulge
in
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
sowerberry
was
much
tickled
at
this
*punct* :
as
of
course
he
ought
to
be
*punct* ;
and
laughed
a
long
time
without
cessation
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
he
said
at
length
*punct* ,
there's
no
denying
that
*punct* ,
since
the
new
system
of
feeding
has
come
in
*punct* ,
the
coffins
are
something
narrower
and
more
shallow
than
they
used
to
be
*punct* ;
but
we
must
have
some
profit
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
well-seasoned
timber
is
an
expensive
article
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
and
all
the
iron
handles
come
*punct* ,
by
canal
*punct* ,
from
birmingham
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
every
trade
has
its
drawbacks
*punct* .
*break*
a
fair
profit
is
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
allowable
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
replied
the
undertaker
*punct* ;
and
if
i
don't
get
a
profit
upon
this
or
that
particular
article
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
i
make
it
up
in
the
long-run
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* ,
he
*punct* !
*break*
just
so
*punct* ,
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
though
i
must
say
*punct* ,
continued
the
undertaker
*punct* ,
resuming
the
current
of
observations
which
the
beadle
had
interrupted
*punct* :
though
i
must
say
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
that
i
have
to
contend
against
one
very
great
disadvantage
*punct* :
which
is
*punct* ,
that
all
the
stout
people
go
off
the
quickest
*punct* .
*break*
the
people
who
have
been
better
off
*punct* ,
and
have
paid
rates
for
many
years
*punct* ,
are
the
first
to
sink
when
they
come
into
the
house
*punct* ;
and
let
me
tell
you
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
that
three
or
four
inches
over
one's
calculation
makes
a
great
hole
in
one's
profits
*punct* :
especially
when
one
has
a
family
to
provide
for
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
as
mr.
sowerberry
said
this
*punct* ,
with
the
becoming
indignation
of
an
ill-used
man
*punct* ;
and
as
mr.
bumble
felt
that
it
rather
tended
to
convey
a
reflection
on
the
honour
of
the
parish
*punct* ;
the
latter
gentleman
thought
it
advisable
to
change
the
subject
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
twist
being
uppermost
in
his
mind
*punct* ,
he
made
him
his
theme
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
bye
*punct* ,
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
you
don't
know
anybody
who
wants
a
boy
*punct* ,
do
you
*punct* ?
*break*
a
porochial
prentis
*punct* ,
who
is
at
present
a
dead-weight
*punct* ;
a
millstone
*punct* ,
as
i
may
say
*punct* ,
round
the
porochial
throat
*punct* ?
*break*
liberal
terms
*punct* ,
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
liberal
terms
*punct* ?
*break*
as
mr.
bumble
spoke
*punct* ,
he
raised
his
cane
to
the
bill
above
him
*punct* ,
and
gave
three
distinct
raps
upon
the
words
five
pounds'
*punct* :
which
were
printed
thereon
in
roman
capitals
of
gigantic
size
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
undertaker
*punct* :
taking
mr.
bumble
by
the
gilt-edged
lappel
of
his
official
coat
*punct* ;
that's
just
the
very
thing
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
*punct* ,
dear
me
*punct* ,
what
a
very
elegant
button
this
is
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* !
*break*
i
never
noticed
it
before
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
think
it
rather
pretty
*punct* ,
said
the
beadle
*punct* ,
glancing
proudly
downwards
at
the
large
brass
buttons
which
embellished
his
coat
*punct* .
*break*
the
die
is
the
same
as
the
porochial
seal
*punct* ,
the
good
samaritan
healing
the
sick
and
bruised
man
*punct* .
*break*
the
board
presented
it
to
me
on
newyear's
morning
*punct* ,
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* .
*break*
i
put
it
on
*punct* ,
i
remember
*punct* ,
for
the
first
time
*punct* ,
to
attend
the
inquest
on
that
reduced
tradesman
*punct* ,
who
died
in
a
doorway
at
midnight
*punct* .
*break*
i
recollect
*punct* ,
said
the
undertaker
*punct* .
*break*
the
jury
brought
it
in
*punct* ,
died
from
exposure
to
the
cold
*punct* ,
and
want
of
the
common
necessaries
of
life
*punct* ,
didn't
they
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
bumble
nodded
*punct* .
*break*
and
they
made
it
a
special
verdict
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
said
the
undertaker
*punct* ,
by
adding
some
words
to
the
effect
*punct* ,
that
if
the
relieving
officer
had
*punct* ,
tush
*punct* !
*break*
interposed
the
beadle
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
board
attended
to
all
the
nonsense
that
ignorant
jurymen
talk
*punct* ,
they'd
have
enough
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
very
true
*punct* ,
said
the
undertaker
*punct* ;
they
would
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
juries
*punct* ,
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
grasping
his
cane
tightly
*punct* ,
as
was
his
wont
when
working
into
a
passion
*punct* :
juries
is
ineddicated
*punct* ,
vulgar
*punct* ,
grovelling
wretches
*punct* .
*break*
so
they
are
*punct* ,
said
the
undertaker
*punct* .
*break*
they
haven't
no
more
philosophy
nor
political
economy
about
em
than
that
*punct* ,
said
the
beadle
*punct* ,
snapping
his
fingers
contemptuously
*punct* .
*break*
no
more
they
have
*punct* ,
acquiesced
the
undertaker
*punct* .
*break*
i
despise
em
*punct* ,
said
the
beadle
*punct* ,
growing
very
red
in
the
face
*punct* .
*break*
so
do
i
*punct* ,
rejoined
the
undertaker
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
only
wish
we'd
a
jury
of
the
independent
sort
*punct* ,
in
the
house
for
a
week
or
two
*punct* ,
said
the
beadle
*punct* ;
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board
would
soon
bring
their
spirit
down
for
em
*punct* .
*break*
let
em
alone
for
that
*punct* ,
replied
the
undertaker
*punct* .
*break*
so
saying
*punct* ,
he
smiled
*punct* ,
approvingly
*punct* :
to
calm
the
rising
wrath
of
the
indignant
parish
officer
*punct* .
*break*
mr
bumble
lifted
off
his
cocked
hat
*punct* ;
took
a
handkerchief
from
the
inside
of
the
crown
*punct* ;
wiped
from
his
forehead
the
perspiration
which
his
rage
had
engendered
*punct* ;
fixed
the
cocked
hat
on
again
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
turning
to
the
undertaker
*punct* ,
said
in
a
calmer
voice
*punct* :
well
*punct* ;
what
about
the
boy
*punct* ?
*break*
replied
the
undertaker
*punct* ;
why
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
i
pay
a
good
deal
towards
the
poor's
rates
*punct* .
*break*
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
replied
the
undertaker
*punct* ,
i
was
thinking
that
if
i
pay
so
much
towards
em
*punct* ,
i've
a
right
to
get
as
much
out
of
em
as
i
can
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* ;
and
so
*punct* ,
i
think
i'll
take
the
boy
myself
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
bumble
grasped
the
undertaker
by
the
arm
*punct* ,
and
led
him
into
the
building
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
sowerberry
was
closeted
with
the
board
for
five
minutes
*punct* ;
and
it
was
arranged
that
oliver
should
go
to
him
that
evening
upon
liking'
*punct* ,
a
phrase
which
means
*punct* ,
in
the
case
of
a
parish
apprentice
*punct* ,
that
if
the
master
find
*punct* ,
upon
a
short
trial
*punct* ,
that
he
can
get
enough
work
out
of
a
boy
without
putting
too
much
food
into
him
*punct* ,
he
shall
have
him
for
a
term
of
years
*punct* ,
to
do
what
he
likes
with
*punct* .
*break*
when
little
oliver
was
taken
before
the
gentlemen
that
evening
*punct* ;
and
informed
that
he
was
to
go
*punct* ,
that
night
*punct* ,
as
general
house-lad
to
a
coffin-maker's
*punct* ;
and
that
if
he
complained
of
his
situation
*punct* ,
or
ever
came
back
to
the
parish
again
*punct* ,
he
would
be
sent
to
sea
*punct* ,
there
to
be
drowned
*punct* ,
or
knocked
on
the
head
*punct* ,
as
the
case
might
be
*punct* ,
he
evinced
so
little
emotion
*punct* ,
that
they
by
common
consent
pronounced
him
a
hardened
young
rascal
*punct* ,
and
orered
mr.
bumble
to
remove
him
forthwith
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
although
it
was
very
natural
that
the
board
*punct* ,
of
all
people
in
the
world
*punct* ,
should
feel
in
a
great
state
of
virtuous
astonishment
and
horror
at
the
smallest
tokens
of
want
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
anybody
*punct* ,
they
were
rather
out
*punct* ,
in
this
particular
instance
*punct* .
*break*
the
simple
fact
was
*punct* ,
that
oliver
*punct* ,
instead
of
possessing
too
little
feeling
*punct* ,
possessed
rather
too
much
*punct* ;
and
was
in
a
fair
way
of
being
reduced
*punct* ,
for
life
*punct* ,
to
a
state
of
brutal
stupidity
and
sullenness
by
the
ill
usage
he
had
received
*punct* .
*break*
he
heard
the
news
of
his
destination
*punct* ,
in
perfect
silence
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
having
had
his
luggage
put
into
his
hand
*punct* ,
which
was
not
very
difficult
to
carry
*punct* ,
inasmuch
as
it
was
all
comprised
within
the
limits
of
a
brown
paper
parcel
*punct* ,
about
half
a
foot
square
by
three
inches
deep
*punct* ,
he
pulled
his
cap
over
his
eyes
*punct* ;
and
once
more
attaching
himself
to
mr.
bumble's
coat
cuff
*punct* ,
was
led
away
by
that
dignitary
to
a
new
scene
of
suffering
*punct* .
*break*
for
some
time
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
drew
oliver
along
*punct* ,
without
notice
or
remark
*punct* ;
for
the
beadle
carried
his
head
very
erect
*punct* ,
as
a
beadle
always
should
*punct* :
and
*punct* ,
it
being
a
windy
day
*punct* ,
little
oliver
was
completely
enshrouded
by
the
skirts
of
mr.
bumble's
coat
as
they
blew
open
*punct* ,
and
disclosed
to
great
advantage
his
flapped
waistcoat
and
drab
plush
knee-breeches
*punct* .
*break*
as
they
drew
near
to
their
destination
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
thought
it
expedient
to
look
down
*punct* ,
and
see
that
the
boy
was
in
good
order
for
inspection
by
his
new
master
*punct* :
which
he
accordingly
did
*punct* ,
with
a
fit
and
becoming
air
of
gracious
patronage
*punct* .
*break*
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* ,
in
a
low
*punct* ,
tremulous
voice
*punct* .
*break*
pull
that
cap
off
your
eyes
*punct* ,
and
hold
up
your
head
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
although
oliver
did
as
he
was
desired
*punct* ,
at
once
*punct* ;
and
passed
the
back
of
his
unoccupied
hand
briskly
across
his
eyes
*punct* ,
he
left
a
tear
in
them
when
he
looked
up
at
his
conductor
*punct* .
*break*
as
mr.
bumble
gazed
sternly
upon
him
*punct* ,
it
rolled
down
his
cheek
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
followed
by
another
*punct* ,
and
another
*punct* .
*break*
the
child
made
a
strong
effort
*punct* ,
but
it
was
an
unsuccessful
one
*punct* .
*break*
withdrawing
his
other
hand
from
mr.
bumble's
he
covered
his
face
with
both
*punct* ;
and
wept
until
the
tears
sprung
out
from
between
his
chin
and
bony
fingers
*punct* .
*break*
exclaimed
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
stopping
short
*punct* ,
and
darting
at
his
little
charge
a
look
of
intense
malignity
*punct* .
*break*
of
all
the
ungratefullest
*punct* ,
and
worst-disposed
boys
as
ever
i
see
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ,
you
are
the
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
sobbed
oliver
*punct* ,
clinging
to
the
hand
which
held
the
well-known
cane
*punct* ;
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
i
will
be
good
indeed
*punct* ;
indeed
*punct* ,
indeed
i
will
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
a
very
little
boy
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
and
it
is
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ,
so
what
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
mr.
bumble
in
amazement
*punct* .
*break*
so
lonely
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
so
very
lonely
*punct* !
*break*
cried
the
child
*punct* .
*break*
everybody
hates
me
*punct* .
*break*
sir
*punct* ,
don't
*punct* ,
don't
pray
be
cross
to
me
*punct* !
*break*
the
child
beat
his
hand
upon
his
heart
*punct* ;
and
looked
in
his
companion's
face
*punct* ,
with
tears
of
real
agony
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
bumble
regarded
oliver's
piteous
and
helpless
look
*punct* ,
with
some
astonishment
*punct* ,
for
a
few
seconds
*punct* ;
hemmed
three
or
four
times
in
a
husky
manner
*punct* ;
and
after
muttering
something
about
that
troublesome
cough
*punct* ,
bade
oliver
dry
his
eyes
and
be
a
good
boy
*punct* .
*break*
then
once
more
taking
his
hand
*punct* ,
he
walked
on
with
him
in
silence
*punct* .
*break*
the
undertaker
*punct* ,
who
had
just
putup
the
shutters
of
his
shop
*punct* ,
was
making
some
entries
in
his
day-book
by
the
light
of
a
most
appropriate
dismal
candle
*punct* ,
when
mr.
bumble
entered
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
undertaker
*punct* ;
looking
up
from
the
book
*punct* ,
and
pausing
in
the
middle
of
a
word
*punct* ;
is
that
you
*punct* ,
bumble
*punct* ?
*break*
no
one
else
*punct* ,
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
replied
the
beadle
*punct* .
*break*
i've
brought
the
boy
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
made
a
bow
*punct* .
*break*
that's
the
boy
*punct* ,
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
undertaker
*punct* :
raising
the
candle
above
his
head
*punct* ,
to
get
a
better
view
of
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
come
here
a
moment
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ?
*break*
mrs.
sowerberry
emerged
from
a
little
room
behind
the
shop
*punct* ,
and
presented
the
form
of
a
short
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
squeezed-up
woman
*punct* ,
with
a
vixenish
countenance
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
deferentially
*punct* ,
this
is
the
boy
from
the
workhouse
that
i
told
you
of
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
bowed
again
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
undertaker's
wife
*punct* ,
he's
very
small
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
he
is
rather
small
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
bumble
*punct* :
looking
at
oliver
as
if
it
were
his
fault
that
he
was
no
bigger
*punct* ;
he
is
small
*punct* .
*break*
there's
no
denying
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
he'll
grow
*punct* ,
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
he'll
grow
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
he
will
*punct* ,
replied
the
lady
pettishly
*punct* ,
on
our
victuals
and
our
drink
*punct* .
*break*
i
see
no
saving
in
parish
children
*punct* ,
not
i
*punct* ;
for
they
always
cost
more
to
keep
*punct* ,
than
they're
worth
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
men
always
think
they
know
best
*punct* .
*break*
get
downstairs
*punct* ,
little
bag
o
bones
*punct* .
*break*
with
this
*punct* ,
the
undertaker's
wife
opened
a
side
door
*punct* ,
and
pushed
oliver
down
a
steep
flight
of
stairs
into
a
stone
cell
*punct* ,
damp
and
dark
*punct* :
forming
the
ante-room
to
the
coal-cellar
*punct* ,
and
denominated
kitchen'
*punct* ;
wherein
sat
a
slatternly
girl
*punct* ,
in
shoes
down
at
heel
*punct* ,
and
blue
worsted
stockings
very
much
out
of
repair
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
charlotte
*punct* ,
said
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
who
had
followed
oliver
down
*punct* ,
give
this
boy
some
of
the
cold
bits
that
were
put
by
for
trip
*punct* .
*break*
he
hasn't
come
home
since
the
morning
*punct* ,
so
he
may
go
without
em
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
the
boy
isn't
too
dainty
to
eat
em
*punct* ,
are
you
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* ?
*break*
oliver
*punct* ,
whose
eyes
had
glistened
at
the
mention
of
meat
*punct* ,
and
who
was
trembling
with
eagerness
to
devour
it
*punct* ,
replied
in
the
negative
*punct* ;
and
a
plateful
of
coarse
broken
victuals
was
set
before
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
some
well-fed
philosopher
*punct* ,
whose
meat
and
drink
turn
to
gall
within
him
*punct* ;
whose
blood
is
ice
*punct* ,
whose
heart
is
iron
*punct* ;
could
have
seen
oliver
twist
clutching
at
the
dainty
viands
that
the
dog
had
neglected
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
he
could
have
witnessed
the
horrible
avidity
with
which
oliver
tore
the
bits
asunder
with
all
the
ferocity
of
famine
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
only
one
thing
i
should
like
better
*punct* ;
and
that
would
be
to
see
the
philosopher
making
the
same
sort
of
meal
himself
*punct* ,
with
the
same
relish
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
the
undertaker's
wife
*punct* ,
when
oliver
had
finished
his
supper
*punct* :
which
she
had
regarded
in
silent
horror
*punct* ,
and
with
fearful
auguries
of
his
future
appetite
*punct* :
have
you
done
*punct* ?
*break*
there
being
nothing
eatable
within
his
reach
*punct* ,
oliver
replied
in
the
affirmative
*punct* .
*break*
then
come
with
me
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* :
taking
up
a
dim
and
dirty
lamp
*punct* ,
and
leading
the
way
upstairs
*punct* ;
your
bed's
under
the
counter
*punct* .
*break*
you
don't
mind
sleeping
among
the
coffins
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ?
*break*
but
it
doesn't
much
matter
whether
you
do
or
don't
*punct* ,
for
you
can't
sleep
anywhere
else
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ;
don't
keep
me
here
all
night
*punct* !
*break*
oliver
lingered
no
longer
*punct* ,
but
meekly
followed
his
new
mistress
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
*punct* ,
being
left
to
himself
in
the
undertaker's
shop
*punct* ,
set
the
lamp
down
on
a
workman's
bench
*punct* ,
and
gazed
timidly
about
him
with
a
feeling
of
awe
and
dread
*punct* ,
which
many
people
a
good
deal
older
than
he
will
be
at
no
loss
to
understand
*punct* .
*break*
an
unfinished
coffin
on
black
tressels
*punct* ,
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
*punct* ,
looked
so
gloomy
and
death-like
that
a
cold
tremble
came
over
him
*punct* ,
every
time
his
eyes
wandered
in
the
direction
of
the
dismal
object
*punct* :
from
which
he
almost
expected
to
see
some
frightful
form
slowly
rear
its
head
*punct* ,
to
drive
him
mad
with
terror
*punct* .
*break*
against
the
wall
were
ranged
*punct* ,
in
regular
array
*punct* ,
a
long
row
of
elm
boards
cut
in
the
same
shape
*punct* :
looking
in
the
dim
light
*punct* ,
like
high-shouldered
ghosts
with
their
hands
in
their
breeches
pockets
*punct* .
*break*
coffin-plates
*punct* ,
elm-chips
*punct* ,
bright-headed
nails
*punct* ,
and
shreds
of
black
cloth
*punct* ,
lay
scattered
on
the
floor
*punct* ;
and
the
wall
behind
the
counter
was
ornamented
with
a
lively
representation
of
two
mutes
in
very
stiff
neckcloths
*punct* ,
on
duty
at
a
large
private
door
*punct* ,
with
a
hearse
drawn
by
four
black
steeds
*punct* ,
approaching
in
the
distance
*punct* .
*break*
the
shop
was
close
and
hot
*punct* .
*break*
the
atmosphere
seemed
tainted
with
the
smell
of
coffins
*punct* .
*break*
the
recess
beneath
the
counter
in
which
his
flock
mattress
was
thrust
*punct* ,
looked
like
a
grave
*punct* .
*break*
nor
were
these
the
only
dismal
feelings
which
depressed
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
alone
in
a
strange
place
*punct* ;
and
we
all
know
how
chilled
and
desolate
the
best
of
us
will
sometimes
feel
in
such
a
situation
*punct* .
*break*
the
boy
had
no
friends
to
care
for
*punct* ,
or
to
care
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
regret
of
no
recent
separation
was
fresh
in
his
mind
*punct* ;
the
absence
of
no
loved
and
well-remembered
face
sank
heavily
into
his
heart
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
heart
was
heavy
*punct* ,
notwithstanding
*punct* ;
and
he
wished
*punct* ,
as
he
crept
into
his
narrow
bed
*punct* ,
that
that
were
his
coffin
*punct* ,
and
that
he
could
be
lain
in
a
calm
and
lasting
sleep
in
the
churchyard
ground
*punct* ,
with
the
tall
grass
waving
gently
above
his
head
*punct* ,
and
the
sound
of
the
old
deep
bell
to
soothe
him
in
his
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
was
awakened
in
the
morning
*punct* ,
by
a
loud
kicking
at
the
outside
of
the
shop-door
*punct* :
which
*punct* ,
before
he
could
huddle
on
his
clothes
*punct* ,
was
repeated
*punct* ,
in
an
angry
and
impetuous
manner
*punct* ,
about
twenty-five
times
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
began
to
undo
the
chain
*punct* ,
the
legs
desisted
*punct* ,
and
a
voice
began
*punct* .
*break*
open
the
door
*punct* ,
will
yer
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
the
voice
which
belonged
to
the
legs
which
had
kicked
at
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
*punct* ,
directly
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* :
undoing
the
chain
*punct* ,
and
turning
the
key
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
yer
the
new
boy
*punct* ,
ain't
yer
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
voice
through
the
key-hole
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
how
old
are
yer
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
the
voice
*punct* .
*break*
ten
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
then
i'll
whop
yer
when
i
get
in
*punct* ,
said
the
voice
*punct* ;
you
just
see
if
i
don't
*punct* ,
that's
all
*punct* ,
my
work'us
brat
*punct* !
*break*
and
having
made
this
obliging
promise
*punct* ,
the
voice
began
to
whistle
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
had
been
too
often
subjected
to
the
process
to
which
the
very
expressive
monosyllable
just
recorded
bears
reference
*punct* ,
to
entertain
the
smallest
doubt
that
the
owner
of
the
voice
*punct* ,
whoever
he
might
be
*punct* ,
would
redeem
his
pledge
*punct* ,
most
honourably
*punct* .
*break*
he
drew
back
the
bolts
with
a
trembling
hand
*punct* ,
and
opened
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
second
or
two
*punct* ,
oliver
glanced
up
the
street
*punct* ,
and
down
the
street
*punct* ,
and
over
the
way
*punct* :
impressed
with
the
belief
that
the
unknown
*punct* ,
who
had
addressed
him
through
the
key-hole
*punct* ,
had
walked
a
few
paces
off
*punct* ,
to
warm
himself
*punct* ;
for
nobody
did
he
see
but
a
big
charity-boy
*punct* ,
sitting
on
a
post
in
front
of
the
house
*punct* ,
eating
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
*punct* :
which
he
cut
into
wedges
*punct* ,
the
size
of
his
mouth
*punct* ,
with
a
clasp-knife
*punct* ,
and
then
consumed
with
great
dexterity
*punct* .
*break*
i
beg
your
pardon
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
oliver
at
length
*punct* :
seeing
that
no
other
visitor
made
his
appearance
*punct* ;
did
you
knock
*punct* ?
*break*
i
kicked
*punct* ,
replied
the
charity-boy
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
want
a
coffin
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
oliver
*punct* ,
innocently
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
*punct* ,
the
charity-boy
looked
monstrous
fierce
*punct* ;
and
said
that
oliver
would
want
one
before
long
*punct* ,
if
he
cut
jokes
with
his
superiors
in
that
way
*punct* .
*break*
yer
don't
know
who
i
am
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
work'us
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
charity-boy
*punct* ,
in
continuation
*punct* :
descending
from
the
top
of
the
post
*punct* ,
meanwhile
*punct* ,
with
edifying
gravity
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
rejoined
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
i'm

noah
claypole

said

and
you're
under
me
*punct* .
*break*
take
down
the
shutters
*punct* ,
yer
idle
young
ruffian
*punct* !
*break*
with
this
*punct* ,
mr.
claypole
administered
a
kick
to
oliver
*punct* ,
and
entered
the
shop
with
a
dignified
air
*punct* ,
which
did
him
great
credit
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
difficult
for
a
large-headed
*punct* ,
small-eyed
youth
*punct* ,
of
lumbering
make
and
heavy
countenance
*punct* ,
to
look
dignified
under
any
circumstances
*punct* ;
but
it
is
more
especially
so
*punct* ,
when
superadded
to
these
personal
attractions
are
a
red
nose
and
yellow
smalls
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
*punct* ,
having
taken
down
the
shutters
*punct* ,
and
broken
a
pane
of
glass
in
his
effort
to
stagger
away
beneath
the
weight
of
the
first
one
to
a
small
court
at
the
side
of
the
house
in
which
they
were
kept
during
the
day
*punct* ,
was
graciously
assisted
by
noah
*punct* :
who
having
consoled
him
with
the
assurance
that
he'd
catch
it
*punct* ,
condescended
to
help
him
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
sowerberry
came
down
soon
after
*punct* .
*break*
shortly
afterwards
*punct* ,
mrs.
sowerberry
appeared
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
having
caught
it
*punct* ,
in
fulfilment
of
noah's
prediction
*punct* ,
followed
that
young
gentleman
down
the
stairs
to
breakfast
*punct* .
*break*
come
near
the
fire
*punct* ,
noah
*punct* ,
said
charlotte
*punct* .
*break*
i
saved
a
nice
little
bit
of
bacon
for
you
from
master's
breakfast
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
*punct* ,
shut
that
door
at
mister
noah's
back
*punct* ,
and
take
them
bits
that
i've
put
out
on
the
cover
of
the
bread-pan
*punct* .
*break*
there's
your
tea
*punct* ;
take
it
away
to
that
box
*punct* ,
and
drink
it
there
*punct* ,
and
make
haste
*punct* ,
for
they'll
want
you
to
mind
the
shop
*punct* .
*break*
d'ye
hear
*punct* ,
work'us
*punct* ?
*break*
said
noah
claypole
*punct* .
*break*
lor
*punct* ,
noah
*punct* !
*break*
said
charlotte
*punct* ,
what
a
rum
creature
you
are
*punct* !
*break*
why
don't
you
let
the
boy
alone
*punct* ?
*break*
let
him
alone
*punct* !
*break*
why
everybody
lets
him
alone
enough
*punct* ,
for
the
matter
of
that
*punct* .
*break*
neither
his
father
nor
his
mother
will
ever
interfere
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
all
his
relations
let
him
have
his
own
way
pretty
well
*punct* .
*break*
eh
*punct* ,
charlotte
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
you
queer
soul
*punct* !
*break*
said
charlotte
*punct* ,
bursting
into
a
hearty
laugh
*punct* ,
in
which
she
was
joined
by
noah
*punct* ;
after
which
they
both
looked
scornfully
at
poor
oliver
twist
*punct* ,
as
he
sat
shivering
on
the
box
in
the
coldest
corner
of
the
room
*punct* ,
and
ate
the
stale
pieces
which
had
been
specially
reserved
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
noah
was
a
charity-boy
*punct* ,
but
not
a
workhouse
orphan
*punct* .
*break*
no
chance-child
was
he
*punct* ,
for
he
could
trace
his
genealogy
all
the
way
back
to
his
parents
*punct* ,
who
lived
hard
by
*punct* ;
his
mother
being
a
washerwoman
*punct* ,
and
his
father
a
drunken
soldier
*punct* ,
discharged
with
a
wooden
leg
*punct* ,
and
a
diurnal
pension
of
twopence-halfpenny
and
an
unstateable
fraction
*punct* .
*break*
the
shop-boys
in
the
neighbourhood
had
long
been
in
the
habit
of
branding
noah
in
the
public
streets
*punct* ,
with
the
ignominious
epithets
of
leathers
*punct* ,
charity
*punct* ,
and
the
like
*punct* ;
and
noah
had
bourne
them
without
reply
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
now
that
fortune
had
cast
in
his
way
a
nameless
orphan
*punct* ,
at
whom
even
the
meanest
could
point
the
finger
of
scorn
*punct* ,
he
retorted
on
him
with
interest
*punct* .
*break*
this
affords
charming
food
for
contemplation
*punct* .
*break*
it
shows
us
what
a
beautiful
thing
human
nature
may
be
made
to
be
*punct* ;
and
how
impartially
the
same
amiable
qualities
are
developed
in
the
finest
lord
and
the
dirtiest
charity-boy
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
had
been
sojourning
at
the
undertaker's
some
three
weeks
or
a
month
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
and
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
the
shop
being
shut
up
*punct* ,
were
taking
their
supper
in
the
little
back-parlour
*punct* ,
when
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
after
several
deferential
glances
at
his
wife
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
he
was
going
to
say
more
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
mrs.
sowerberry
looking
up
*punct* ,
with
a
peculiarly
unpropitious
aspect
*punct* ,
he
stopped
short
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
sharply
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
nothing
*punct* ,
said
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* .
*break*
ugh
*punct* ,
you
brute
*punct* !
*break*
said
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* .
*break*
not
at
all
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
mr.
sowerberry
humbly
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
you
didn't
want
to
hear
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
only
going
to
say
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
don't
tell
me
what
you
were
going
to
say
*punct* ,
interposed
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
nobody
*punct* ;
don't
consult
me
*punct* ,
pray
*punct* .
*break*
_i_
don't
want
to
intrude
upon
your
secrets
*punct* .
*break*
as
mrs.
sowerberry
said
this
*punct* ,
she
gave
an
hysterical
laugh
*punct* ,
which
threatened
violent
consequences
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
sowerberry
*punct* ,
i
want
to
ask
your
advice
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
don't
ask
mine
*punct* ,
replied
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
in
an
affecting
manner
*punct* :
ask
somebody
else's
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
there
was
another
hysterical
laugh
*punct* ,
which
frightened
mr.
sowerberry
very
much
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
a
very
common
and
much-approved
matrimonial
course
of
treatment
*punct* ,
which
is
often
very
effective
it
at
once
reduced
mr.
sowerberry
to
begging
*punct* ,
as
a
special
favour
*punct* ,
to
be
allowed
to
say
what
mrs.
sowerberry
was
most
curious
to
hear
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
short
duration
*punct* ,
the
permission
was
most
graciously
conceded
*punct* .
*break*
it's
only
about
young
twist
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* .
*break*
a
very
good-looking
boy
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
he
need
be
*punct* ,
for
he
eats
enough
*punct* ,
observed
the
lady
*punct* .
*break*
there's
an
expression
of
melancholy
in
his
face
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
resumed
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
which
is
very
interesting
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
make
a
delightful
mute
*punct* ,
my
love
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
sowerberry
looked
up
with
an
expression
of
considerable
wonderment
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
sowerberry
remarked
it
and
*punct* ,
without
allowing
time
for
any
observation
on
the
good
lady's
part
*punct* ,
proceeded
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
mean
a
regular
mute
to
attend
grown-up
people
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
but
only
for
children's
practice
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
very
new
to
have
a
mute
in
proportion
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
depend
upon
it
*punct* ,
it
would
have
a
superb
effect
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
who
had
a
good
deal
of
taste
in
the
undertaking
way
*punct* ,
was
much
struck
by
the
novelty
of
this
idea
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
it
would
have
been
compromising
her
dignity
to
have
said
so
*punct* ,
under
existing
circumstances
*punct* ,
she
merely
inquired
*punct* ,
with
much
sharpness
*punct* ,
why
such
an
obvious
suggestion
had
not
presented
itself
to
her
husband's
mind
before
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
sowerberry
rightly
construed
this
*punct* ,
as
an
acquiescence
in
his
proposition
*punct* ;
it
was
speedily
determined
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
that
oliver
should
be
at
once
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
trade
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
with
this
view
*punct* ,
that
he
should
accompany
his
master
on
the
very
next
occasion
of
his
services
being
required
*punct* .
*break*
the
occasion
was
not
long
in
coming
*punct* .
*break*
half
an
hour
after
breakfast
next
morning
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
entered
the
shop
*punct* ;
and
supporting
his
cane
against
the
counter
*punct* ,
drew
forth
his
large
leathern
pocket-book
*punct* :
from
which
he
selected
a
small
scrap
of
paper
*punct* ,
which
he
handed
over
to
sowerberry
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
undertaker
*punct* ,
glancing
over
it
with
a
lively
countenance
*punct* ;
an
order
for
a
coffin
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
for
a
coffin
first
*punct* ,
and
a
porochial
funeral
afterwards
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
fastening
the
strap
of
the
leathern
pocket-book
*punct* :
which
*punct* ,
like
himself
*punct* ,
was
very
corpulent
*punct* .
*break*
bayton
*punct* ,
said
the
undertaker
*punct* ,
looking
from
the
scrap
of
paper
to
mr.
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
heard
the
name
before
*punct* .
*break*
bumble
shook
his
head
*punct* ,
as
he
replied
*punct* ,
obstinate
people
*punct* ,
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* ;
very
obstinate
*punct* .
*break*
proud
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
i'm
afraid
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
proud
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
exclaimed
mr.
sowerberry
with
a
sneer
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
that's
too
much
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
it's
sickening
*punct* ,
replied
the
beadle
*punct* .
*break*
antimonial
*punct* ,
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* !
*break*
so
it
is
*punct* ,
asquiesced
the
undertaker
*punct* .
*break*
we
only
heard
of
the
family
the
night
before
last
*punct* ,
said
the
beadle
*punct* ;
and
we
shouldn't
have
known
anything
about
them
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
only
a
woman
who
lodges
in
the
same
house
made
an
application
to
the
porochial
committee
for
them
to
send
the
porochial
surgeon
to
see
a
woman
as
was
very
bad
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
gone
out
to
dinner
*punct* ;
but
his
prentice
*punct* ,
which
is
a
very
clever
lad
*punct* ,
sent
em
some
medicine
in
a
blacking-bottle
*punct* ,
offhand
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
there's
promptness
*punct* ,
said
the
undertaker
*punct* .
*break*
promptness
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
replied
the
beadle
*punct* .
*break*
but
what's
the
consequence
*punct* ;
what's
the
ungrateful
behaviour
of
these
rebels
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
the
husband
sends
back
word
that
the
medicine
won't
suit
his
wife's
complaint
*punct* ,
and
so
she
shan't
take
it
*punct* ,
says
she
shan't
take
it
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
good
*punct* ,
strong
*punct* ,
wholesome
medicine
*punct* ,
as
was
given
with
great
success
to
two
irish
labourers
and
a
coal-heaver
*punct* ,
ony
a
week
before
*punct* ,
sent
em
for
nothing
*punct* ,
with
a
blackin'-bottle
in,
*punct* ,
and
he
sends
back
word
that
she
shan't
take
it
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
as
the
atrocity
presented
itself
to
mr.
bumble's
mind
in
full
force
*punct* ,
he
struck
the
counter
sharply
with
his
cane
*punct* ,
and
became
flushed
with
indignation
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
the
undertaker
*punct* ,
i
ne
*punct* ,
ver
*punct* ,
did
*punct* ,
never
did
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
ejaculated
the
beadle
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
nor
nobody
never
did
*punct* ;
but
now
she's
dead
*punct* ,
we've
got
to
bury
her
*punct* ;
and
that's
the
direction
*punct* ;
and
the
sooner
it's
done
*punct* ,
the
better
*punct* .
*break*
thus
saying
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
put
on
his
cocked
hat
wrong
side
first
*punct* ,
in
a
fever
of
parochial
excietment
*punct* ;
and
flounced
out
of
the
shop
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
he
was
so
angry
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ,
that
he
forgot
even
to
ask
after
you
*punct* !
*break*
said
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
looking
after
the
beadle
as
he
strode
down
the
street
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* ,
who
had
carefully
kept
himself
out
of
sight
*punct* ,
during
the
interview
*punct* ;
and
who
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
at
the
mere
recollection
of
the
sound
of
mr.
bumble's
voice
*punct* .
*break*
he
needn't
haven
taken
the
trouble
to
shrink
from
mr.
bumble's
glance
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ;
for
that
functionary
*punct* ,
on
whom
the
prediction
of
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
had
made
a
very
strong
impression
*punct* ,
thought
that
now
the
undertaker
had
got
oliver
upon
trial
the
subject
was
better
avoided
*punct* ,
until
such
time
as
he
should
be
firmly
bound
for
seven
years
*punct* ,
and
all
danger
of
his
being
returned
upon
the
hands
of
the
parish
should
be
thus
effectually
and
legally
overcome
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
mr.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
taking
up
his
hat
*punct* .
*break*
the
sooner
this
job
is
done
*punct* ,
the
better
*punct* .
*break*
noah
*punct* ,
look
after
the
shop
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
*punct* ,
put
on
your
cap
*punct* ,
and
come
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
obeyed
*punct* ,
and
followed
his
master
on
his
professional
mission
*punct* .
*break*
they
walked
on
*punct* ,
for
some
time
*punct* ,
through
the
most
crowded
and
densely
inhabited
part
of
the
town
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
striking
down
a
narrow
street
more
dirty
and
miserable
than
any
they
had
yet
passed
through
*punct* ,
paused
to
look
for
the
house
which
was
the
object
of
their
search
*punct* .
*break*
the
houses
on
either
side
were
high
and
large
*punct* ,
but
very
old
*punct* ,
and
tenanted
by
people
of
the
poorest
class
*punct* :
as
their
neglected
appearance
would
have
sufficiently
dentoed
*punct* ,
without
the
concurrent
testimony
afforded
by
the
squalid
looks
of
the
few
men
and
women
who
*punct* ,
with
folded
arms
and
bodies
half
doubled
*punct* ,
occasionally
skulked
along
*punct* .
*break*
a
great
many
of
the
tenements
had
shop-fronts
*punct* ;
but
these
were
fast
closed
*punct* ,
and
mouldering
away
*punct* ;
only
the
upper
rooms
being
inhabited
*punct* .
*break*
some
houses
which
had
become
insecure
from
age
and
decay
*punct* ,
were
prevented
from
falling
into
the
street
*punct* ,
by
huge
beams
of
wood
reared
against
the
walls
*punct* ,
and
firmly
planted
in
the
road
*punct* ;
but
even
these
crazy
dens
seemed
to
have
been
selected
as
the
nightly
haunts
of
some
houseless
wretches
*punct* ,
for
many
of
the
rough
boards
which
supplied
the
place
of
door
and
window
*punct* ,
were
wrenched
from
their
positions
*punct* ,
to
afford
an
aperture
wide
enough
for
the
passage
of
a
human
body
*punct* .
*break*
the
kennel
was
stagnant
and
filthy
*punct* .
*break*
the
very
rats
*punct* ,
which
here
and
there
lay
putrefying
in
its
rottenness
*punct* ,
were
hideous
with
famine
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
neither
knocker
nor
bell-handle
at
the
open
door
where
oliver
and
his
master
stopped
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
groping
his
way
cautiously
through
the
dark
passage
*punct* ,
and
bidding
oliver
keep
close
to
him
and
not
be
afraid
the
undertaker
mounted
to
the
top
of
the
first
flight
of
stairs
*punct* .
*break*
stumbling
against
a
door
on
the
landing
*punct* ,
he
rapped
at
it
with
his
knuckles
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
opened
by
a
young
girl
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
*punct* .
*break*
the
undertaker
at
once
saw
enough
of
what
the
room
contained
*punct* ,
to
know
it
was
the
apartment
to
which
he
had
been
directed
*punct* .
*break*
he
stepped
in
*punct* ;
oliver
followed
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
fire
in
the
room
*punct* ;
but
a
man
was
crouching
*punct* ,
mechanically
*punct* ,
over
the
empty
stove
*punct* .
*break*
an
old
woman
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
had
drawn
a
low
stool
to
the
cold
hearth
*punct* ,
and
was
sitting
beside
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
some
ragged
children
in
another
corner
*punct* ;
and
in
a
small
recess
*punct* ,
opposite
the
door
*punct* ,
there
lay
upon
the
ground
*punct* ,
something
covered
with
an
old
blanket
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
shuddered
as
he
cast
his
eyes
toward
the
place
*punct* ,
and
crept
involuntarily
closer
to
his
master
*punct* ;
for
though
it
was
covered
up
*punct* ,
the
boy
felt
that
it
was
a
corpse
*punct* .
*break*
the
man's
face
was
thin
and
very
pale
*punct* ;
his
hair
and
beard
were
grizzly
*punct* ;
his
eyes
were
blookshot
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
woman's
face
was
wrinkled
*punct* ;
her
two
remaining
teeth
protruded
over
her
under
lip
*punct* ;
and
her
eyes
were
bright
and
piercing
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
was
afriad
to
look
at
either
her
or
the
man
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
so
like
the
rats
he
had
seen
outside
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
shall
go
near
her
*punct* ,
said
the
man
*punct* ,
starting
fiercely
up
*punct* ,
as
the
undertaker
approached
the
recess
*punct* .
*break*
damn
you
*punct* ,
keep
back
*punct* ,
if
you've
a
life
to
lose
*punct* !
*break*
nonsense
*punct* ,
my
good
man
*punct* ,
said
the
undertaker
*punct* ,
who
was
pretty
well
used
to
misery
in
all
its
shapes
*punct* .
*break*
i
tell
you
*punct* ,
said
the
man
*punct* :
clenching
his
hands
*punct* ,
and
stamping
furiously
on
the
floor,
*punct* ,
'i
tell
you
i
won't
have
her
put
into
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
she
couldn't
rest
there
*punct* .
*break*
the
worms
would
worry
her
*punct* ,
not
eat
her
*punct* ,
she
is
so
worn
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
undertaker
offered
no
reply
to
this
raving
*punct* ;
but
producing
a
tape
from
his
pocket
*punct* ,
knelt
down
for
a
moment
by
the
side
of
the
body
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
man
*punct* :
bursting
into
tears
*punct* ,
and
sinking
on
his
knees
at
the
feet
of
the
dead
woman
*punct* ;
kneel
down
*punct* ,
kneel
down
*punct* ,
kneel
round
her
*punct* ,
every
one
of
you
*punct* ,
and
mark
my
words
*punct* !
*break*
i
say
she
was
starved
to
death
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
knew
how
bad
she
was
*punct* ,
till
the
fever
came
upon
her
*punct* ;
and
then
her
bones
were
starting
through
the
skin
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
neither
fire
nor
candle
*punct* ;
she
died
in
the
dark
*punct* ,
in
the
dark
*punct* !
*break*
she
couldn't
even
see
her
children's
faces
*punct* ,
though
we
heard
her
gasping
out
their
names
*punct* .
*break*
i
begged
for
her
in
the
streets
*punct* :
and
they
sent
me
to
prison
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
came
back
*punct* ,
she
was
dying
*punct* ;
and
all
the
blood
in
my
heart
has
dried
up
*punct* ,
for
they
starved
her
to
death
*punct* .
*break*
i
swear
it
before
the
god
that
saw
it
*punct* !
*break*
they
starved
her
*punct* !
*break*
he
twined
his
hands
in
his
hair
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
with
a
loud
scream
*punct* ,
rolled
grovelling
upon
the
floor
*punct* :
his
eyes
fixed
*punct* ,
and
the
foam
covering
his
lips
*punct* .
*break*
the
terrified
children
cried
bitterly
*punct* ;
but
the
old
woman
*punct* ,
who
had
hitherto
remained
as
quiet
as
if
she
had
been
wholly
deaf
to
all
that
passed
*punct* ,
menaced
them
into
silence
*punct* .
*break*
having
unloosened
the
cravat
of
the
man
who
still
remained
extended
on
the
ground
*punct* ,
she
tottered
towards
the
undertaker
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
my
daughter
*punct* ,
said
the
old
woman
*punct* ,
nodding
her
head
in
the
direction
of
the
corpse
*punct* ;
and
speaking
with
an
idiotic
leer
*punct* ,
more
ghastly
than
even
the
presence
of
death
in
such
a
place
*punct* .
*break*
lord
*punct* ,
lord
*punct* !
*break*
well
*punct* ,
it
is
strange
that
i
who
gave
birth
to
her
*punct* ,
and
was
a
woman
then
*punct* ,
should
be
alive
and
merry
now
*punct* ,
and
she
lying
ther
*punct* :
so
cold
and
stiff
*punct* !
*break*
lord
*punct* ,
lord!
*punct* ,
to
think
of
it
*punct* ;
it's
as
good
as
a
play
*punct* ,
as
good
as
a
play
*punct* !
*break*
as
the
wretched
creature
mumbled
and
chuckled
in
her
hideous
merriment
*punct* ,
the
undertaker
turned
to
go
away
*punct* .
*break*
stop
*punct* ,
stop
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
old
woman
in
a
loud
whisper
*punct* .
*break*
will
she
be
buried
to-morrow
*punct* ,
or
next
day
*punct* ,
or
to-night
*punct* ?
*break*
i
laid
her
out
*punct* ;
and
i
must
walk
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
send
me
a
large
cloak
*punct* :
a
good
warm
one
*punct* :
for
it
is
bitter
cold
*punct* .
*break*
we
should
have
cake
and
wine
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
before
we
go
*punct* !
*break*
never
mind
*punct* ;
send
some
bread
*punct* ,
only
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
water
*punct* .
*break*
shall
we
have
some
bread
*punct* ,
dear
*punct* ?
*break*
she
said
eagerly
*punct* :
catching
at
the
undertaker's
coat
*punct* ,
as
he
once
more
moved
towards
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
said
the
undertaker,'of
course
*punct* .
*break*
anything
you
like
*punct* !
*break*
he
disengaged
himself
from
the
old
woman's
grasp
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
drawing
oliver
after
him
*punct* ,
hurried
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
day
*punct* ,
the
family
having
been
meanwhile
relieved
with
a
half-quartern
loaf
and
a
piece
of
cheese
*punct* ,
left
with
them
by
mr.
bumble
himself,
*punct* ,
oliver
and
his
master
returned
to
the
miserable
abode
*punct* ;
where
mr.
bumble
had
already
arrived
*punct* ,
accompanied
by
four
men
from
the
workhouse
*punct* ,
who
were
to
act
as
bearers
*punct* .
*break*
an
old
black
cloak
had
been
thrown
over
the
rags
of
the
old
woman
and
the
man
*punct* ;
and
the
bare
coffin
having
been
screwed
down
*punct* ,
was
hoisted
on
the
shoulders
of
the
bearers
*punct* ,
and
carried
into
the
street
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
you
must
put
your
best
leg
foremost
*punct* ,
old
lady
*punct* !
*break*
whispered
sowerberry
in
the
old
woman's
ear
*punct* ;
we
are
rather
late
*punct* ;
and
it
won't
do
*punct* ,
to
keep
the
clergyman
waiting
*punct* .
*break*
move
on
*punct* ,
my
men,
*punct* ,
as
quick
as
you
like
*punct* !
*break*
thus
directed
*punct* ,
the
bearers
trotted
on
under
their
light
burden
*punct* ;
and
the
two
mourners
kept
as
near
them
*punct* ,
as
they
could
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
bumble
and
sowerberry
walked
at
a
good
smart
pace
in
front
*punct* ;
and
oliver
*punct* ,
whose
legs
were
not
so
long
as
his
master's
*punct* ,
ran
by
the
side
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
not
so
great
a
necessity
for
hurrying
as
mr.
sowerberry
had
anticipated
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ;
for
when
they
reached
the
obscure
corner
of
the
churchyard
in
which
the
nettles
grew
*punct* ,
and
where
the
parish
graves
were
made
*punct* ,
the
clergyman
had
not
arrived
*punct* ;
and
the
clerk
*punct* ,
who
was
sitting
by
the
vestry-room
fire
*punct* ,
seemed
to
think
it
by
no
means
improbable
that
it
might
be
an
hour
or
so
*punct* ,
before
he
came
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
they
put
the
bier
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
*punct* ;
and
the
two
mourners
waited
patiently
in
the
damp
clay
*punct* ,
with
a
cold
rain
drizzling
down
*punct* ,
while
the
ragged
boys
whom
the
spectacle
had
attracted
into
the
churchyard
played
a
noisy
game
at
hide-and-seek
among
the
tombstones
*punct* ,
or
varied
their
amusements
by
jumping
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
coffin
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
sowerberry
and
bumble
*punct* ,
being
personal
friends
of
the
clerk
*punct* ,
sat
by
the
fire
with
him
*punct* ,
and
read
the
paper
*punct* .
*break*
at
length
*punct* ,
after
a
lapse
of
something
more
than
an
hour
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
and
sowerberry
*punct* ,
and
the
clerk
*punct* ,
were
seen
running
towards
the
grave
*punct* .
*break*
immediately
afterwards
*punct* ,
the
clergyman
appeared
*punct* :
putting
on
his
surplice
as
he
came
along
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
bumble
then
thrashed
a
boy
or
two
*punct* ,
to
keep
up
appearances
*punct* ;
and
the
reverend
gentleman
*punct* ,
having
read
as
much
of
the
burial
service
as
could
be
compressed
into
four
minutes
*punct* ,
gave
his
surplice
to
the
clerk
*punct* ,
and
walked
away
again
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
bill
*punct* !
*break*
said
sowerberry
to
the
grave-digger
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
no
very
difficult
task
*punct* ,
for
the
grave
was
so
full
*punct* ,
that
the
uppermost
coffin
was
within
a
few
feet
of
the
surface
*punct* .
*break*
the
grave-digger
shovelled
in
the
earth
*punct* ;
stamped
it
loosely
down
with
his
feet
*punct* :
shouldered
his
spade
*punct* ;
and
walked
off
*punct* ,
followed
by
the
boys
*punct* ,
who
murmured
very
loud
complaints
at
the
fun
being
over
so
soon
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
my
good
fellow
*punct* !
*break*
said
bumble
*punct* ,
tapping
the
man
on
the
back
*punct* .
*break*
they
want
to
shut
up
the
yard
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
who
had
never
once
moved
*punct* ,
since
he
had
taken
his
station
by
the
grave
side
*punct* ,
started
*punct* ,
raised
his
head
*punct* ,
stared
at
the
person
who
had
addressed
him
*punct* ,
walked
forward
for
a
few
paces
*punct* ;
and
fell
down
in
a
swoon
*punct* .
*break*
the
crazy
old
woman
was
too
much
occupied
in
bewailing
the
loss
of
her
cloak
*punct* ,
which
the
undertaker
had
taken
off
*punct* ,
to
pay
him
any
attention
*punct* ;
so
they
threw
a
can
of
cold
water
over
him
*punct* ;
and
when
he
came
to
*punct* ,
saw
him
safely
out
of
the
churchyard
*punct* ,
locked
the
gate
*punct* ,
and
departed
on
their
different
ways
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ,
said
sowerberry
*punct* ,
as
they
walked
home
*punct* ,
how
do
you
like
it
*punct* ?
*break*
pretty
well
*punct* ,
thank
you
*punct* ,
sir
replied
oliver
*punct* ,
with
considerable
hesitation
*punct* .
*break*
not
very
much
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
you'll
get
used
to
it
in
time
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ,
said
sowerberry
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
when
you
are
used
to
it
*punct* ,
my
boy
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
wondered
*punct* ,
in
his
own
mind
*punct* ,
whether
it
had
taken
a
very
long
time
to
get
mr.
sowerberry
used
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
thought
it
better
not
to
ask
the
question
*punct* ;
and
walked
back
to
the
shop
*punct* :
thinking
over
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
*punct* .
*break*
the
month's
trial
over
*punct* ,
oliver
was
formally
apprenticed
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
nice
sickly
season
just
at
this
time
*punct* .
*break*
in
commercial
phrase
*punct* ,
coffins
were
looking
up
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
*punct* ,
oliver
acquired
a
great
deal
of
experience
*punct* .
*break*
the
success
of
mr.
sowerberry's
ingenious
speculation
*punct* ,
exceeded
even
his
most
sanguine
hopes
*punct* .
*break*
the
oldest
inhabitants
recollected
no
period
at
which
measles
had
been
so
prevalent
*punct* ,
or
so
fatal
to
infant
existence
*punct* ;
and
many
were
the
mournful
processions
which
little
oliver
headed
*punct* ,
in
a
hat-band
reaching
down
to
his
knees
*punct* ,
to
the
indescribable
admiration
and
emotion
of
all
the
mothers
in
the
town
*punct* .
*break*
as
oliver
accompanied
his
master
in
most
of
his
adult
expeditions
too
*punct* ,
in
order
that
he
might
acquire
that
equanimity
of
demeanour
and
full
command
of
nerve
which
was
essential
to
a
finished
undertaker
*punct* ,
he
had
many
opportunities
of
observing
the
beautiful
resignation
and
fortitude
with
which
some
strong-minded
people
bear
their
trials
and
losses
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ;
when
sowerberry
had
an
order
for
the
burial
of
some
rich
old
lady
or
gentleman
*punct* ,
who
was
surrounded
by
a
great
number
of
nephews
and
nieces
*punct* ,
who
had
been
perfectly
inconsolable
during
the
previous
illness
*punct* ,
and
whose
grief
had
been
wholly
irrepressible
even
on
the
most
public
occasions
*punct* ,
they
would
be
as
happy
among
themselves
as
need
be
*punct* ,
quite
cheerful
and
contented
*punct* ,
conversing
together
with
as
much
freedom
and
gaiety
*punct* ,
as
if
nothing
whatever
had
happened
to
disturb
them
*punct* .
*break*
husbands
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
bore
the
loss
of
their
wives
with
the
most
heroic
calmness
*punct* .
*break*
wives
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
put
on
weeds
for
their
husbands
*punct* ,
as
if
*punct* ,
so
far
from
grieving
in
the
garb
of
sorrow
*punct* ,
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
render
it
as
becoming
and
attractive
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
observable
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
were
in
passions
of
anguish
during
the
ceremony
of
interment
*punct* ,
recovered
almost
as
soon
as
they
reached
home
*punct* ,
and
became
quite
composed
before
the
tea-drinking
was
over
*punct* .
*break*
all
this
was
very
pleasant
and
improving
to
see
*punct* ;
and
oliver
beheld
it
with
great
admiration
*punct* .
*break*
that
oliver
twist
was
moved
to
resignation
by
the
example
of
these
good
people
*punct* ,
i
cannot
*punct* ,
although
i
am
his
biographer
*punct* ,
undertake
to
affirm
with
any
degree
of
confidence
*punct* ;
but
i
can
most
distinctly
say
*punct* ,
that
for
many
months
he
continued
meekly
to
submit
to
the
domination
and
ill-treatment
of
noah
claypole
*punct* :
who
used
him
far
worse
than
before
*punct* ,
now
that
his
jealousy
was
roused
by
seeing
the
new
boy
promoted
to
the
black
stick
and
hatband
*punct* ,
while
he
*punct* ,
the
old
one
*punct* ,
remained
stationary
in
the
muffin-cap
and
leathers
*punct* .
*break*
charlotte
treated
him
ill
*punct* ,
because
noah
did
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
sowerberry
was
his
decided
enemy
*punct* ,
because
mr.
sowerberry
was
disposed
to
be
his
friend
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
between
these
three
on
one
side
*punct* ,
and
a
glut
of
funerals
on
the
other
*punct* ,
oliver
was
not
altogether
as
comfortable
as
the
hungry
pig
was
*punct* ,
when
he
was
shut
up
*punct* ,
by
mistake
*punct* ,
in
the
grain
department
of
a
brewery
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
*punct* ,
i
come
to
a
very
important
passage
in
oliver's
history
*punct* ;
for
i
have
to
record
an
act
*punct* ,
slight
and
unimportant
perhaps
in
appearance
*punct* ,
but
which
indirectly
produced
a
material
change
in
all
his
future
prospects
and
proceedings
*punct* .
*break*
one
day
*punct* ,
oliver
and
noah
had
descended
into
the
kitchen
at
the
usual
dinner-hour
*punct* ,
to
banquet
upon
a
small
joint
of
mutton
*punct* ,
a
pound
and
a
half
of
the
worst
end
of
the
neck
*punct* ,
when
charlotte
being
called
out
of
the
way
*punct* ,
there
ensued
a
brief
interval
of
time
*punct* ,
which
noah
claypole
*punct* ,
being
hungry
and
vicious
*punct* ,
considered
he
could
not
possibly
devote
to
a
worthier
purpose
than
aggravating
and
tantalising
young
oliver
twist
*punct* .
*break*
intent
upon
this
innocent
amusement
*punct* ,
noah
put
his
feet
on
the
table-cloth
*punct* ;
and
pulled
oliver's
hair
*punct* ;
and
twitched
his
ears
*punct* ;
and
expressed
his
opinion
that
he
was
a
sneak'
*punct* ;
and
furthermore
announced
his
intention
of
coming
to
see
him
hanged
*punct* ,
whenever
that
desirable
event
should
take
place
*punct* ;
and
entered
upon
various
topics
of
petty
annoyance
*punct* ,
like
a
malicious
and
ill-conditioned
charity-boy
as
he
was
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
making
oliver
cry
*punct* ,
noah
attempted
to
be
more
facetious
still
*punct* ;
and
in
his
attempt
*punct* ,
did
what
many
sometimes
do
to
this
day
*punct* ,
when
they
want
to
be
funny
*punct* .
*break*
he
got
rather
personal
*punct* .
*break*
work'us
*punct* ,
said
noah
*punct* ,
how's
your
mother
*punct* ?
*break*
she's
dead
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* ;
don't
you
say
anything
about
her
to
me
*punct* !
*break*
oliver's
colour
rose
as
he
said
this
*punct* ;
he
breathed
quickly
*punct* ;
and
there
was
a
curious
working
of
the
mouth
and
nostrils
*punct* ,
which
mr.
claypole
thought
must
be
the
immediate
precursor
of
a
violent
fit
of
crying
*punct* .
*break*
under
this
impression
he
returned
to
the
charge
*punct* .
*break*
what
did
she
die
of
*punct* ,
work'us
*punct* ?
*break*
of
a
broken
heart
*punct* ,
some
of
our
old
nurses
told
me
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* :
more
as
if
he
were
talking
to
himself
*punct* ,
than
answering
noah
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
i
know
what
it
must
be
to
die
of
that
*punct* !
*break*
tol
de
rol
lol
lol
*punct* ,
right
fol
lairy
*punct* ,
work'us
*punct* ,
said
noah
*punct* ,
as
a
tear
rolled
down
oliver's
cheek
*punct* .
*break*
what's
set
you
a
snivelling
now
*punct* ?
*break*
not
you
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* ,
sharply
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ;
that's
enough
*punct* .
*break*
don't
say
anything
more
to
me
about
her
*punct* ;
you'd
better
not
*punct* !
*break*
work'us
*punct* ,
don't
be
impudent
*punct* .
*break*
your
mother
*punct* ,
too
*punct* !
*break*
she
was
a
nice
un
she
was
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
lor
*punct* !
*break*
and
here
*punct* ,
noah
nodded
his
head
expressively
*punct* ;
and
curled
up
as
much
of
his
small
red
nose
as
muscular
action
could
collect
together
*punct* ,
for
the
occasion
*punct* .
*break*
yer
know
*punct* ,
work'us
*punct* ,
continued
noah
*punct* ,
emboldened
by
oliver's
silence
*punct* ,
and
speaking
in
a
jeering
tone
of
affected
pity
*punct* :
of
all
tones
the
most
annoying
*punct* :
yer
know
*punct* ,
work'us
*punct* ,
it
can't
be
helped
now
*punct* ;
and
of
course
yer
couldn't
help
it
then
*punct* ;
and
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
*punct* ;
and
i'm
sure
we
all
are
*punct* ,
and
pity
yer
very
much
*punct* .
*break*
but
yer
must
know
*punct* ,
work'us
*punct* ,
yer
mother
was
a
regular
right-down
bad
un
*punct* .
*break*
what
did
you
say
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
oliver
*punct* ,
looking
up
very
quickly
*punct* .
*break*
a
regular
right-down
bad
un
*punct* ,
work'us
*punct* ,
replied
noah
*punct* ,
coolly
*punct* .
*break*
and
it's
a
great
deal
better
*punct* ,
work'us
*punct* ,
that
she
died
when
she
did
*punct* ,
or
else
she'd
have
been
hard
labouring
in
bridewell
*punct* ,
or
transported
*punct* ,
or
hung
*punct* ;
which
is
more
likely
than
either
*punct* ,
isn't
it
*punct* ?
*break*
crimson
with
fury
*punct* ,
oliver
started
up
*punct* ;
overthrew
the
chair
and
table
*punct* ;
seized
noah
by
the
throat
*punct* ;
shook
him
*punct* ,
in
the
violence
of
his
rage
*punct* ,
till
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
*punct* ;
and
collecting
his
whole
force
into
one
heavy
blow
*punct* ,
felled
him
to
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
a
minute
ago
*punct* ,
the
boy
had
looked
the
quiet
child
*punct* ,
mild
*punct* ,
dejected
creature
that
harsh
treatment
had
made
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
spirit
was
roused
at
last
*punct* ;
the
cruel
insult
to
his
dead
mother
had
set
his
blood
on
fire
*punct* .
*break*
his
breast
heaved
*punct* ;
his
attitude
was
erect
*punct* ;
his
eye
bright
and
vivid
*punct* ;
his
whole
person
changed
*punct* ,
as
he
stood
glaring
over
the
cowardly
tormentor
who
now
lay
crouching
at
his
feet
*punct* ;
and
defied
him
with
an
energy
he
had
never
known
before
*punct* .
*break*
he'll
murder
me
*punct* !
*break*
here's
the
new
boy
a
murdering
of
me
*punct* !
*break*
oliver's
gone
mad
*punct* !
*break*
char
*punct* ,
lotte
*punct* !
*break*
noah's
shouts
were
responded
to
*punct* ,
by
a
loud
scream
from
charlotte
*punct* ,
and
a
louder
from
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* ;
the
former
of
whom
rushed
into
the
kitchen
by
a
side-door
*punct* ,
while
the
latter
paused
on
the
staircase
till
she
was
quite
certain
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
preservation
of
human
life
*punct* ,
to
come
further
down
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
you
little
wretch
*punct* !
*break*
screamed
charlotte
*punct* :
seizing
oliver
with
her
utmost
force
*punct* ,
which
was
about
equal
to
that
of
a
moderately
strong
man
in
particularly
good
training
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
you
little
un-grate-ful
*punct* ,
mur-de-rous
*punct* ,
hor-rid
villain
*punct* !
*break*
and
between
every
syllable
*punct* ,
charlotte
gave
oliver
a
blow
with
all
her
might
*punct* :
accompanying
it
with
a
scream
*punct* ,
for
the
benefit
of
society
*punct* .
*break*
charlotte's
fist
was
by
no
means
a
light
one
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
lest
it
should
not
be
effectual
in
calming
oliver's
wrath
*punct* ,
mrs.
sowerberry
plunged
into
the
kitchen
*punct* ,
and
assisted
to
hold
him
with
one
hand
*punct* ,
while
she
scratched
his
face
with
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
favourable
position
of
affairs
*punct* ,
noah
rose
from
the
ground
*punct* ,
and
pommelled
him
behind
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
rather
too
violent
exercise
to
last
long
*punct* .
*break*
when
they
were
all
wearied
out
*punct* ,
and
could
tear
and
beat
no
longer
*punct* ,
they
dragged
oliver
*punct* ,
struggling
and
shouting
*punct* ,
but
nothing
daunted
*punct* ,
into
the
dust-cellar
*punct* ,
and
there
locked
him
up
*punct* .
*break*
this
being
done
*punct* ,
mrs.
sowerberry
sunk
into
a
chair
*punct* ,
and
burst
into
tears
*punct* .
*break*
bless
her
*punct* ,
she's
going
off
*punct* !
*break*
a
glass
of
water
*punct* ,
noah
*punct* ,
dear
*punct* .
*break*
charlotte
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* :
speaking
as
well
as
she
could
*punct* ,
through
a
deficiency
of
breath
*punct* ,
and
a
sufficiency
of
cold
water
*punct* ,
which
noah
had
poured
over
her
head
and
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
charlotte
*punct* ,
what
a
mercy
we
have
not
all
been
murdered
in
our
beds
*punct* !
*break*
mercy
indeed
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ,
was
the
reply
*punct* .
*break*
i
only
hope
this'll
teach
master
not
to
have
any
more
of
these
dreadful
creatures
*punct* ,
that
are
born
to
be
murderers
and
robbers
from
their
very
cradle
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
all
but
killed
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ,
when
i
come
in
*punct* .
*break*
said
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* :
looking
piteously
on
the
charity-boy
*punct* .
*break*
noah
*punct* ,
whose
top
waistcoat-button
might
have
been
somewhere
on
a
level
with
the
crown
of
oliver's
head
*punct* ,
rubbed
his
eyes
with
the
inside
of
his
wrists
while
this
commiseration
was
bestowed
upon
him
*punct* ,
and
performed
some
affecting
tears
and
sniffs
*punct* .
*break*
what's
to
be
done
*punct* !
*break*
exclaimed
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* .
*break*
your
master's
not
at
home
*punct* ;
there's
not
a
man
in
the
house
*punct* ,
and
he'll
kick
that
door
down
in
ten
minutes
*punct* .
*break*
oliver's
vigorous
plunges
against
the
bit
of
timber
in
question
*punct* ,
rendered
this
occurance
highly
probable
*punct* .
*break*
dear
*punct* ,
dear
*punct* !
*break*
i
don't
know
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ,
said
charlotte
*punct* ,
unless
we
send
for
the
police-officers
*punct* .
*break*
or
the
millingtary
*punct* ,
suggested
mr.
claypole
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* :
bethinking
herself
of
oliver's
old
friend
*punct* .
*break*
run
to
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
noah
*punct* ,
and
tell
him
to
come
here
directly
*punct* ,
and
not
to
lose
a
minute
*punct* ;
never
mind
your
cap
*punct* !
*break*
you
can
hold
a
knife
to
that
black
eye
*punct* ,
as
you
run
along
*punct* .
*break*
it'll
keep
the
swelling
down
*punct* .
*break*
noah
stopped
to
make
no
reply
*punct* ,
but
started
off
at
his
fullest
speed
*punct* ;
and
very
much
it
astonished
the
people
who
were
out
walking
*punct* ,
to
see
a
charity-boy
tearing
through
the
streets
pell-mell
*punct* ,
with
no
cap
on
his
head
*punct* ,
and
a
clasp-knife
at
his
eye
*punct* .
*break*
noah
claypole
ran
along
the
streets
at
his
swiftest
pace
*punct* ,
and
paused
not
once
for
breath
*punct* ,
until
he
reached
the
workhouse-gate
*punct* .
*break*
having
rested
here
*punct* ,
for
a
minute
or
so
*punct* ,
to
collect
a
good
burst
of
sobs
and
an
imposing
show
of
tears
and
terror
*punct* ,
he
knocked
loudly
at
the
wicket
*punct* ;
and
presented
such
a
rueful
face
to
the
aged
pauper
who
opened
it
*punct* ,
that
even
he
*punct* ,
who
saw
nothing
but
rueful
faces
about
him
at
the
best
of
times
*punct* ,
started
back
in
astonishment
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
what's
the
matter
with
the
boy
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
old
pauper
*punct* .
*break*
cried
noah
*punct* ,
wit
well-affected
dismay
*punct* :
and
in
tones
so
loud
and
agitated
*punct* ,
that
they
not
only
caught
the
ear
of
mr.
bumble
himself
*punct* ,
who
happened
to
be
hard
by
*punct* ,
but
alarmed
him
so
much
that
he
rushed
into
the
yard
without
his
cocked
hat,
*punct* ,
which
is
a
very
curious
and
remarkable
circumstance
*punct* :
as
showing
that
even
a
beadle
*punct* ,
acted
upon
a
sudden
and
powerful
impulse
*punct* ,
may
be
afflicted
with
a
momentary
visitation
of
loss
of
self-possession
*punct* ,
and
forgetfulness
of
personal
dignity
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
said
noah
*punct* :
oliver
*punct* ,
sir,
*punct* ,
oliver
has
*punct* ,
what
*punct* ?
*break*
interposed
mr.
bumble
*punct* :
with
a
gleam
of
pleasure
in
his
metallic
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
not
run
away
*punct* ;
he
hasn't
run
away
*punct* ,
has
he
*punct* ,
noah
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
no
*punct* .
*break*
not
run
away
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
but
he's
turned
wicious
*punct* ,
replied
noah
*punct* .
*break*
he
tried
to
murder
me
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
and
then
he
tried
to
murder
charlotte
*punct* ;
and
then
missis
*punct* .
*break*
what
dreadful
pain
it
is
*punct* !
*break*
such
agony
*punct* ,
please
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
and
here
*punct* ,
noah
writhed
and
twisted
his
body
into
an
extensive
variety
of
eel-like
positions
*punct* ;
thereby
giving
mr.
bumble
to
understand
that
*punct* ,
from
the
violent
and
sanguinary
onset
of
oliver
twist
*punct* ,
he
had
sustained
severe
internal
injury
and
damage
*punct* ,
from
which
he
was
at
that
moment
suffering
the
acutest
torture
*punct* .
*break*
when
noah
saw
that
the
intelligence
he
communicated
perfectly
paralysed
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
he
imparted
additional
effect
thereunto
*punct* ,
by
bewailing
his
dreadful
wounds
ten
times
louder
than
before
*punct* ;
and
when
he
observed
a
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
crossing
the
yard
*punct* ,
he
was
more
tragic
in
his
lamentations
than
ever
*punct* :
rightly
conceiving
it
highly
expedient
to
attract
the
notice
*punct* ,
and
rouse
the
indignation
*punct* ,
of
the
gentleman
aforesaid
*punct* .
*break*
the
gentleman's
notice
was
very
soon
attracted
*punct* ;
for
he
had
not
walked
three
paces
*punct* ,
when
he
turned
angrily
round
*punct* ,
and
inquired
what
that
young
cur
was
howling
for
*punct* ,
and
why
mr.
bumble
did
not
favour
him
with
something
which
would
render
the
series
of
vocular
exclamations
so
designated
*punct* ,
an
involuntary
process
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
a
poor
boy
from
the
free-school
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
who
has
been
nearly
murdered
*punct* ,
all
but
murdered
*punct* ,
sir,
*punct* ,
by
young
twist
*punct* .
*break*
exclaimed
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
*punct* ,
stopping
short
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
it
*punct* !
*break*
i
felt
a
strange
presentiment
from
the
very
first
*punct* ,
that
that
audacious
young
savage
would
come
to
be
hung
*punct* !
*break*
he
has
likewise
attempted
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
to
murder
the
female
servant
*punct* ,
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
with
a
face
of
ashy
paleness
*punct* .
*break*
and
his
missis
*punct* ,
interposed
mr.
claypole
*punct* .
*break*
and
his
master
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
i
think
you
said
*punct* ,
noah
*punct* ?
*break*
added
mr.
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
he's
out
*punct* ,
or
he
would
have
murdered
him
*punct* ,

*break*
inquired
the
gentleman
in

*punct* .
*break*
yes

replied
noah

*break*

please
*punct* ,
sir

missis
wants
to
know
whether
mr.

can
spare
time
to
step
up
there
*punct* ,
directly
*punct* ,
and
flog
him
*punct* ,
cause
master's
out
*punct* .
*break*
certainly
*punct* ,
my
boy
*punct* ;
certainly
*punct* ,
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
*punct* :
smiling
benignly
*punct* ,
and
patting
noah's
head
*punct* ,
which
was
about
three
inches
higher
than
his
own
*punct* .
*break*
you're
a
good
boy
*punct* ,
a
very
good
boy
*punct* .
*break*
here's
a
penny
for
you
*punct* .
*break*
bumble
*punct* ,
just
step
up
to
sowerberry's
with
your
cane
*punct* ,
and
seed
what's
best
to
be
done
*punct* .
*break*
don't
spare
him
*punct* ,
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
will
not
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
the
beadle
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
cocked
hat
and
cane
having
been
*punct* ,
by
this
time
*punct* ,
adjusted
to
their
owner's
satisfaction
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
and
noah
claypole
betook
themselves
with
all
speed
to
the
undertaker's
shop
*punct* .
*break*
here
the
position
of
affairs
had
not
at
all
improved
*punct* .
*break*
sowerberry
had
not
yet
returned
*punct* ,
and
oliver
continued
to
kick
*punct* ,
with
undiminished
vigour
*punct* ,
at
the
cellar-door
*punct* .
*break*
the
accounts
of
his
ferocity
as
related
by
mrs.
sowerberry
and
charlotte
*punct* ,
were
of
so
startling
a
nature
*punct* ,
that
mr.
bumble
judged
it
prudent
to
parley
*punct* ,
before
opening
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
with
this
view
he
gave
a
kick
at
the
outside
*punct* ,
by
way
of
prelude
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
applying
his
mouth
to
the
keyhole
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
in
a
deep
and
impressive
tone
*punct* :
oliver
*punct* !
*break*
come
*punct* ;
you
let
me
out
*punct* !
*break*
replied
oliver
*punct* ,
from
the
inside
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
know
this
here
voice
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
ain't
you
afraid
of
it
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
ain't
you
a-trembling
while
i
speak
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* .
*break*
replied
oliver
*punct* ,
boldly
*punct* .
*break*
an
answer
so
different
from
the
one
he
had
expected
to
elicit
*punct* ,
and
was
in
the
habit
of
receiving
*punct* ,
staggered
mr.
bumble
not
a
little
*punct* .
*break*
he
stepped
back
from
the
keyhole
*punct* ;
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
*punct* ;
and
looked
from
one
to
another
of
the
three
bystanders
*punct* ,
in
mute
astonishment
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
he
must
be
mad
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* .
*break*
no
boy
in
half
his
senses
could
venture
to
speak
so
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
it's
not
madness
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
after
a
few
moments
of
deep
meditation
*punct* .
*break*
exclaimed
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* .
*break*
meat
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ,
meat
*punct* ,
replied
bumble
*punct* ,
with
stern
emphasis
*punct* .
*break*
you've
over-fed
him
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* .
*break*
you've
raised
a
artificial
soul
and
spirit
in
him
*punct* ,
ma'am
unbecoming
a
person
of
his
condition
*punct* :
as
the
board
*punct* ,
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
who
are
practical
philosophers
*punct* ,
will
tell
you
*punct* .
*break*
what
have
paupers
to
do
with
soul
or
spirit
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
quite
enough
that
we
let
em
have
live
bodies
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
had
kept
the
boy
on
gruel
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ,
this
would
never
have
happened
*punct* .
*break*
dear
*punct* ,
dear
*punct* !
*break*
ejaculated
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
piously
raising
her
eyes
to
the
kitchen
ceiling
*punct* :
this
comes
of
being
liberal
*punct* !
*break*
the
liberality
of
mrs.
sowerberry
to
oliver
*punct* ,
had
consisted
of
a
profuse
bestowal
upon
him
of
all
the
dirty
odds
and
ends
which
nobody
else
would
eat
*punct* ;
so
there
was
a
great
deal
of
meekness
and
self-devotion
in
her
voluntarily
remaining
under
mr.
bumble's
heavy
accusation
*punct* .
*break*
of
which
*punct* ,
to
do
her
justice
*punct* ,
she
was
wholly
innocent
*punct* ,
in
thought
*punct* ,
word
*punct* ,
or
deed
*punct* .
*break*
said
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
when
the
lady
brought
her
eyes
down
to
earth
again
*punct* ;
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
now
*punct* ,
that
i
know
of
*punct* ,
is
to
leave
him
in
the
cellar
for
a
day
or
so
*punct* ,
till
he's
a
little
starved
down
*punct* ;
and
then
to
take
him
out
*punct* ,
and
keep
him
on
gruel
all
through
the
apprenticeship
*punct* .
*break*
he
comes
of
a
bad
family
*punct* .
*break*
excitable
natures
*punct* ,
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* !
*break*
both
the
nurse
and
doctor
said
*punct* ,
that
that
mother
of
his
made
her
way
here
*punct* ,
against
difficulties
and
pain
that
would
have
killed
any
well-disposed
woman
*punct* ,
weeks
before
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
point
of
mr.
bumble's
discourse
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ,
just
hearing
enough
to
know
that
some
allusion
was
being
made
to
his
mother
*punct* ,
recommenced
kicking
*punct* ,
with
a
violence
that
rendered
every
other
sound
inaudible
*punct* .
*break*
sowerberry
returned
at
this
juncture
*punct* .
*break*
oliver's
offence
having
been
explained
to
him
*punct* ,
with
such
exaggerations
as
the
ladies
thought
best
calculated
to
rouse
his
ire
*punct* ,
he
unlocked
the
cellar-door
in
a
twinkling
*punct* ,
and
dragged
his
rebellious
apprentice
out
*punct* ,
by
the
collar
*punct* .
*break*
oliver's
clothes
had
been
torn
in
the
beating
he
had
received
*punct* ;
his
face
was
bruised
and
scratched
*punct* ;
and
his
hair
scattered
over
his
forehead
*punct* .
*break*
the
angry
flush
had
not
disappeared
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ;
and
when
he
was
pulled
out
of
his
prison
*punct* ,
he
scowled
boldly
on
noah
*punct* ,
and
looked
quite
undismayed
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
you
are
a
nice
young
fellow
*punct* ,
ain't
you
*punct* ?
*break*
said
sowerberry
*punct* ;
giving
oliver
a
shake
*punct* ,
and
a
box
on
the
ear
*punct* .
*break*
he
called
my
mother
names
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
and
what
if
he
did
*punct* ,
you
little
ungrateful
wretch
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* .
*break*
she
deserved
what
he
said
*punct* ,
and
worse
*punct* .
*break*
she
didn't
said
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
she
did
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* .
*break*
it's
a
lie
*punct* !
*break*
mrs.
sowerberry
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
*punct* .
*break*
this
flood
of
tears
left
mr.
sowerberry
no
alternative
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
had
hesitated
for
one
instant
to
punish
oliver
most
severely
*punct* ,
it
must
be
quite
clear
to
every
experienced
reader
that
he
would
have
been
*punct* ,
according
to
all
precedents
in
disputes
of
matrimony
established
*punct* ,
a
brute
*punct* ,
an
unnatural
husband
*punct* ,
an
insulting
creature
*punct* ,
a
base
imitation
of
a
man
*punct* ,
and
various
other
agreeable
characters
too
numerous
for
recital
within
the
limits
of
this
chapter
*punct* .
*break*
to
do
him
justice
*punct* ,
he
was
*punct* ,
as
far
as
his
power
went
*punct* ,
it
was
not
very
extensive
*punct* ,
kindly
disposed
towards
the
boy
*punct* ;
perhaps
*punct* ,
because
it
was
his
interest
to
be
so
*punct* ;
perhaps
*punct* ,
because
his
wife
disliked
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
flood
of
tears
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
left
him
no
resource
*punct* ;
so
he
at
once
gave
him
a
drubbing
*punct* ,
which
satisfied
even
mrs.
sowerberry
herself
*punct* ,
and
rendered
mr.
bumble's
subsequent
application
of
the
parochial
cane
*punct* ,
rather
unnecessary
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
rest
of
the
day
*punct* ,
he
was
shut
up
in
the
back
kitchen
*punct* ,
in
company
with
a
pump
and
a
slice
of
bread
*punct* ;
and
at
night
*punct* ,
mrs.
sowerberry
*punct* ,
after
making
various
remarks
outside
the
door
*punct* ,
by
no
means
complimentary
to
the
memory
of
his
mother
*punct* ,
looked
into
the
room
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
amidst
the
jeers
and
pointings
of
noah
and
charlotte
*punct* ,
ordered
him
upstairs
to
his
dismal
bed
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
until
he
was
left
alone
in
the
silence
and
stillness
of
the
gloomy
workshop
of
the
undertaker
*punct* ,
that
oliver
gave
way
to
the
feelings
which
the
day's
treatment
may
be
supposed
likely
to
have
awakened
in
a
mere
child
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
listened
to
their
taunts
with
a
look
of
contempt
*punct* ;
he
had
borne
the
lash
without
a
cry
*punct* :
for
he
felt
that
pride
swelling
in
his
heart
which
would
have
kept
down
a
shriek
to
the
last
*punct* ,
though
they
had
roasted
him
alive
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
*punct* ,
when
there
were
none
to
see
or
hear
him
*punct* ,
he
fell
upon
his
knees
on
the
floor
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
*punct* ,
wept
such
tears
as
*punct* ,
god
send
for
the
credit
of
our
nature
*punct* ,
few
so
young
may
ever
have
cause
to
pour
out
before
him
*punct* !
*break*
for
a
long
time
*punct* ,
oliver
remained
motionless
in
this
attitude
*punct* .
*break*
the
candle
was
burning
low
in
the
socket
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
having
gazed
cautiously
round
him
*punct* ,
and
listened
intently
*punct* ,
he
gently
undid
the
fastenings
of
the
door
*punct* ,
and
looked
abroad
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
cold
*punct* ,
dark
night
*punct* .
*break*
the
stars
seemed
*punct* ,
to
the
boy's
eyes
*punct* ,
farther
from
the
earth
than
he
had
ever
seen
them
before
*punct* ;
there
was
no
wind
*punct* ;
and
the
sombre
shadows
thrown
by
the
trees
upon
the
ground
*punct* ,
looked
sepulchral
and
death-like
*punct* ,
from
being
so
still
*punct* .
*break*
he
softly
reclosed
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
having
availed
himself
of
the
expiring
light
of
the
candle
to
tie
up
in
a
handkerchief
the
few
articles
of
wearing
apparel
he
had
*punct* ,
sat
himself
down
upon
a
bench
*punct* ,
to
wait
for
morning
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
first
ray
of
light
that
struggled
through
the
crevices
in
the
shutters
*punct* ,
oliver
arose
*punct* ,
and
again
unbarred
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
one
timid
look
around
*punct* ,
one
moment's
pause
of
hesitation
*punct* ,
he
had
closed
it
behind
him
*punct* ,
and
was
in
the
open
street
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
*punct* ,
uncertain
whither
to
fly
*punct* .
*break*
he
remembered
to
have
seen
the
waggons
*punct* ,
as
they
went
out
*punct* ,
toiling
up
the
hill
*punct* .
*break*
he
took
the
same
route
*punct* ;
and
arriving
at
a
footpath
across
the
fields
*punct* :
which
he
knew
*punct* ,
after
some
distance
*punct* ,
led
out
again
into
the
road
*punct* ;
struck
into
it
*punct* ,
and
walked
quickly
on
*punct* .
*break*
along
this
same
footpath
*punct* ,
oliver
well-remembered
he
had
trotted
beside
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
when
he
first
carried
him
to
the
workhouse
from
the
farm
*punct* .
*break*
his
way
lay
directly
in
front
of
the
cottage
*punct* .
*break*
his
heart
beat
quickly
when
he
bethought
himself
of
this
*punct* ;
and
he
half
resolved
to
turn
back
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
come
a
long
way
though
*punct* ,
and
should
lose
a
great
deal
of
time
by
doing
so
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
it
was
so
early
that
there
was
very
little
fear
of
his
being
seen
*punct* ;
so
he
walked
on
*punct* .
*break*
he
reached
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
appearance
of
its
inmates
stirring
at
that
early
hour
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
stopped
*punct* ,
and
peeped
into
the
garden
*punct* .
*break*
a
child
was
weeding
one
of
the
little
beds
*punct* ;
as
he
stopped
*punct* ,
he
raised
his
pale
face
and
disclosed
the
features
of
one
of
his
former
companions
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
felt
glad
to
see
him
*punct* ,
before
he
went
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
though
younger
than
himself
*punct* ,
he
had
been
his
little
friend
and
playmate
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
been
beaten
*punct* ,
and
starved
*punct* ,
and
shut
up
together
*punct* ,
many
and
many
a
time
*punct* .
*break*
hush
*punct* ,
dick
*punct* !
*break*
said
oliver
*punct* ,
as
the
boy
ran
to
the
gate
*punct* ,
and
thrust
his
thin
arm
between
the
rails
to
greet
him
*punct* .
*break*
is
any
one
up
*punct* ?
*break*
nobody
but
me
*punct* ,
replied
the
child
*punct* .
*break*
you
musn't
say
you
saw
me
*punct* ,
dick
*punct* ,
said
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
running
away
*punct* .
*break*
they
beat
and
ill-use
me
*punct* ,
dick
*punct* ;
and
i
am
going
to
seek
my
fortune
*punct* ,
some
long
way
off
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
where
*punct* .
*break*
how
pale
you
are
*punct* !
*break*
i
heard
the
doctor
tell
them
i
was
dying
*punct* ,
replied
the
child
with
a
faint
smile
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
*punct* ,
dear
*punct* ;
but
don't
stop
*punct* ,
don't
stop
*punct* !
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
i
will
*punct* ,
to
say
good-b'ye
to
you
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
see
you
again
*punct* ,
dick
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
i
shall
*punct* !
*break*
you
will
be
well
and
happy
*punct* !
*break*
i
hope
so
*punct* ,
replied
the
child
*punct* .
*break*
after
i
am
dead
*punct* ,
but
not
before
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
the
doctor
must
be
right
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ,
because
i
dream
so
much
of
heaven
*punct* ,
and
angels
*punct* ,
and
kind
faces
that
i
never
see
when
i
am
awake
*punct* .
*break*
kiss
me
*punct* ,
said
the
child
*punct* ,
climbing
up
the
low
gate
*punct* ,
and
flinging
his
little
arms
round
oliver's
neck
*punct* .
*break*
good-b'ye
*punct* ,
dear
*punct* !
*break*
god
bless
you
*punct* !
*break*
the
blessing
was
from
a
young
child's
lips
*punct* ,
but
it
was
the
first
that
oliver
had
ever
heard
invoked
upon
his
head
*punct* ;
and
through
the
struggles
and
sufferings
*punct* ,
and
troubles
and
changes
*punct* ,
of
his
after
life
*punct* ,
he
never
once
forgot
it
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
reached
the
stile
at
which
the
by-path
terminated
*punct* ;
and
once
more
gained
the
high-road
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
eight
o'clock
now
*punct* .
*break*
though
he
was
nearly
five
miles
away
from
the
town
*punct* ,
he
ran
*punct* ,
and
hid
behind
the
hedges
*punct* ,
by
turns
*punct* ,
till
noon
*punct* :
fearing
that
he
might
be
pursued
and
overtaken
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
sat
down
to
rest
by
the
side
of
the
milestone
*punct* ,
and
began
to
think
*punct* ,
for
the
first
time
*punct* ,
where
he
had
better
go
and
try
to
live
*punct* .
*break*
the
stone
by
which
he
was
seated
*punct* ,
bore
*punct* ,
in
large
characters
*punct* ,
an
intimation
that
it
was
just
seventy
miles
from
that
spot
to
london
*punct* .
*break*
the
name
awakened
a
new
train
of
ideas
in
the
boy's
mind
*punct* .
*break*
london!
*punct* ,
that
great
place!
*punct* ,
nobody
*punct* ,
not
even
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
could
ever
find
him
there
*punct* !
*break*
he
had
often
heard
the
old
men
in
the
workhouse
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
say
that
no
lad
of
spirit
need
want
in
london
*punct* ;
and
that
there
were
ways
of
living
in
that
vast
city
*punct* ,
which
those
who
had
been
bred
up
in
country
parts
had
no
idea
of
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
very
place
for
a
homeless
boy
*punct* ,
who
must
die
in
the
streets
unless
some
one
helped
him
*punct* .
*break*
as
these
things
passed
through
his
thoughts
*punct* ,
he
jumped
upon
his
feet
*punct* ,
and
again
walked
forward
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
diminished
the
distance
between
himself
and
london
by
full
four
miles
more
*punct* ,
before
he
recollected
how
much
he
must
undergo
ere
he
could
hope
to
reach
his
place
of
destination
*punct* .
*break*
as
this
consideration
forced
itself
upon
him
*punct* ,
he
slackened
his
pace
a
little
*punct* ,
and
meditated
upon
his
means
of
getting
there
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
crust
of
bread
*punct* ,
a
coarse
shirt
*punct* ,
and
two
pairs
of
stockings
*punct* ,
in
his
bundle
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
penny
too
*punct* ,
a
gift
of
sowerberry's
after
some
funeral
in
which
he
had
acquitted
himself
more
than
ordinarily
well
*punct* ,
in
his
pocket
*punct* .
*break*
a
clean
shirt
*punct* ,
thought
oliver
*punct* ,
is
a
very
comfortable
thing
*punct* ;
and
so
are
two
pairs
of
darned
stockings
*punct* ;
and
so
is
a
penny
*punct* ;
but
they
small
helps
to
a
sixty-five
miles
walk
in
winter
time
*punct* .
*break*
but
oliver's
thoughts
*punct* ,
like
those
of
most
other
people
*punct* ,
although
they
were
extremely
ready
and
active
to
point
out
his
difficulties
*punct* ,
were
wholly
at
a
loss
to
suggest
any
feasible
mode
of
surmounting
them
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
after
a
good
deal
of
thinking
to
no
particular
purpose
*punct* ,
he
changed
his
little
bundle
over
to
the
other
shoulder
*punct* ,
and
trudged
on
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
walked
twenty
miles
that
day
*punct* ;
and
all
that
time
tasted
nothing
but
the
crust
of
dry
bread
*punct* ,
and
a
few
draughts
of
water
*punct* ,
which
he
begged
at
the
cottage-doors
by
the
road-side
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
night
came
*punct* ,
he
turned
into
a
meadow
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
creeping
close
under
a
hay-rick
*punct* ,
determined
to
lie
there
*punct* ,
till
morning
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
frightened
at
first
*punct* ,
for
the
wind
moaned
dismally
over
the
empty
fields
*punct* :
and
he
was
cold
and
hungry
*punct* ,
and
more
alone
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
*punct* .
*break*
being
very
tired
with
his
walk
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
soon
fell
asleep
and
forgot
his
troubles
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
cold
and
stiff
*punct* ,
when
he
got
up
next
morning
*punct* ,
and
so
hungry
that
he
was
obliged
to
exchange
the
penny
for
a
small
loaf
*punct* ,
in
the
very
first
village
through
which
he
passed
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
walked
no
more
than
twelve
miles
*punct* ,
when
night
closed
in
again
*punct* .
*break*
his
feet
were
sore
*punct* ,
and
his
legs
so
weak
that
they
trembled
beneath
him
*punct* .
*break*
another
night
passed
in
the
bleak
damp
air
*punct* ,
made
him
worse
*punct* ;
when
he
set
forward
on
his
journey
next
morning
he
could
hardly
crawl
along
*punct* .
*break*
he
waited
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
hill
till
a
stage-coach
came
up
*punct* ,
and
then
begged
of
the
outside
passengers
*punct* ;
but
there
were
very
few
who
took
any
notice
of
him
*punct* :
and
even
those
told
him
to
wait
till
they
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
*punct* ,
and
then
let
them
see
how
far
he
could
run
for
a
halfpenny
*punct* .
*break*
poor
oliver
tried
to
keep
up
with
the
coach
a
little
way
*punct* ,
but
was
unable
to
do
it
*punct* ,
by
reason
of
his
fatigue
and
sore
feet
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
outsides
saw
this
*punct* ,
they
put
their
halfpence
back
into
their
pockets
again
*punct* ,
declaring
that
he
was
an
idle
young
dog
*punct* ,
and
didn't
deserve
anything
*punct* ;
and
the
coach
rattled
away
and
left
only
a
cloud
of
dust
behind
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
villages
*punct* ,
large
painted
boards
were
fixed
up
*punct* :
warning
all
persons
who
begged
within
the
district
*punct* ,
that
they
would
be
sent
to
jail
*punct* .
*break*
this
frightened
oliver
very
much
*punct* ,
and
made
him
glad
to
get
out
of
those
villages
with
all
possible
expedition
*punct* .
*break*
in
others
*punct* ,
he
would
stand
about
the
inn-yards
*punct* ,
and
look
mournfully
at
every
one
who
passed
*punct* :
a
proceeding
which
generally
terminated
in
the
landlady's
ordering
one
of
the
post-boys
who
were
lounging
about
*punct* ,
to
drive
that
strange
boy
out
of
the
place
*punct* ,
for
she
was
sure
he
had
come
to
steal
something
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
begged
at
a
farmer's
house
*punct* ,
ten
to
one
but
they
threatened
to
set
the
dog
on
him
*punct* ;
and
when
he
showed
his
nose
in
a
shop
*punct* ,
they
talked
about
the
beadle
*punct* ,
which
brought
oliver's
heart
into
his
mouth,
*punct* ,
very
often
the
only
thing
he
had
there
*punct* ,
for
many
hours
together
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
good-hearted
turnpike-man
*punct* ,
and
a
benevolent
old
lady
*punct* ,
oliver's
troubles
would
have
been
shortened
by
the
very
same
process
which
had
put
an
end
to
his
mother's
*punct* ;
in
other
words
*punct* ,
he
would
most
assuredly
have
fallen
dead
upon
the
king's
highway
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
turnpike-man
gave
him
a
meal
of
bread
and
cheese
*punct* ;
and
the
old
lady
*punct* ,
who
had
a
shipwrecked
grandson
wandering
barefoot
in
some
distant
part
of
the
earth
*punct* ,
took
pity
upon
the
poor
orphan
*punct* ,
and
gave
him
what
little
she
could
afford
*punct* ,
and
more
*punct* ,
with
such
kind
and
gently
words
*punct* ,
and
such
tears
of
sympathy
and
compassion
*punct* ,
that
they
sank
deeper
into
oliver's
soul
*punct* ,
than
all
the
sufferings
he
had
ever
undergone
*punct* .
*break*
early
on
the
seventh
morning
after
he
had
left
his
native
place
*punct* ,
oliver
limped
slowly
into
the
little
town
of
barnet
*punct* .
*break*
the
window-shutters
were
closed
*punct* ;
the
street
was
empty
*punct* ;
not
a
soul
had
awakened
to
the
business
of
the
day
*punct* .
*break*
the
sun
was
rising
in
all
its
splendid
beauty
*punct* ;
but
the
light
only
served
to
show
the
boy
his
own
lonesomeness
and
desolation
*punct* ,
as
he
sat
*punct* ,
with
bleeding
feet
and
covered
with
dust
*punct* ,
upon
a
door-step
*punct* .
*break*
by
degrees
*punct* ,
the
shutters
were
opened
*punct* ;
the
window-blinds
were
drawn
up
*punct* ;
and
people
began
passing
to
and
fro
*punct* .
*break*
some
few
stopped
to
gaze
at
oliver
for
a
moment
or
two
*punct* ,
or
turned
round
to
stare
at
him
as
they
hurried
by
*punct* ;
but
none
relieved
him
*punct* ,
or
troubled
themselves
to
inquire
how
he
came
there
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
no
heart
to
beg
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
he
sat
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
crouching
on
the
step
for
some
time
*punct* :
wondering
at
the
great
number
of
public-houses
*punct* ,
every
other
house
in
barnet
was
a
tavern
*punct* ,
large
or
small
*punct* ,
gazing
listlessly
at
the
coaches
as
they
passed
through
*punct* ,
and
thinking
how
strange
it
seemed
that
they
could
do
*punct* ,
with
ease
*punct* ,
in
a
few
hours
*punct* ,
what
it
had
taken
him
a
whole
week
of
courage
and
determination
beyond
his
years
to
accomplish
*punct* :
when
he
was
roused
by
observing
that
a
boy
*punct* ,
who
had
passed
him
carelessly
some
minutes
before
*punct* ,
had
returned
*punct* ,
and
was
now
surveying
him
most
earnestly
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
he
took
little
heed
of
this
at
first
*punct* ;
but
the
boy
remained
in
the
same
attitude
of
close
observation
so
long
*punct* ,
that
oliver
raised
his
head
*punct* ,
and
returned
his
steady
look
*punct* .
*break*
upon
this
*punct* ,
the
boy
crossed
over
*punct* ;
and
walking
close
up
to
oliver
*punct* ,
said
hullo
*punct* ,
my
covey
*punct* !
*break*
what's
the
row
*punct* ?
*break*
the
boy
who
addressed
this
inquiry
to
the
young
wayfarer
*punct* ,
was
about
his
own
age
*punct* :
but
one
of
the
queerest
looking
boys
that
oliver
had
even
seen
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
snub-nosed
*punct* ,
flat-browed
*punct* ,
common-faced
boy
enough
*punct* ;
and
as
dirty
a
juvenile
as
one
would
wish
to
see
*punct* ;
but
he
had
about
him
all
the
airs
and
manners
of
a
man
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
short
of
his
age
*punct* :
with
rather
bow-legs
*punct* ,
and
little
*punct* ,
sharp
*punct* ,
ugly
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
his
hat
was
stuck
on
the
top
of
his
head
so
lightly
*punct* ,
that
it
threatened
to
fall
off
every
moment
*punct* ,
and
would
have
done
so
*punct* ,
very
often
*punct* ,
if
the
wearer
had
not
had
a
knack
of
every
now
and
then
giving
his
head
a
sudden
twitch
*punct* ,
which
brought
it
back
to
its
old
place
again
*punct* .
*break*
he
wore
a
man's
coat
*punct* ,
which
reached
nearly
to
his
heels
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
turned
the
cuffs
back
*punct* ,
half-way
up
his
arm
*punct* ,
to
get
his
hands
out
of
the
sleeves
*punct* :
apparently
with
the
ultimated
view
of
thrusting
them
into
the
pockets
of
his
corduroy
trousers
*punct* ;
for
there
he
kept
them
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
*punct* ,
altogether
*punct* ,
as
roystering
and
swaggering
a
young
gentleman
as
ever
stood
four
feet
six
*punct* ,
or
something
less
*punct* ,
in
the
bluchers
*punct* .
*break*
hullo
*punct* ,
my
covey
*punct* !
*break*
what's
the
row
*punct* ?
*break*
said
this
strange
young
gentleman
to
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
very
hungry
and
tired
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* :
the
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
walked
a
long
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
been
walking
these
seven
days
*punct* .
*break*
walking
for
sivin
days
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
young
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
i
see
*punct* .
*break*
beak's
order
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
but
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* ,
noticing
oliver's
look
of
surprise
*punct* ,
i
suppose
you
don't
know
what
a
beak
is
*punct* ,
my
flash
com-pan-i-on
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
mildly
replied
*punct* ,
that
he
had
always
heard
a
bird's
mouth
described
by
the
term
in
question
*punct* .
*break*
my
eyes
*punct* ,
how
green
*punct* !
*break*
exclaimed
the
young
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
a
beak's
a
madgst'rate
*punct* ;
and
when
you
walk
by
a
beak's
order
*punct* ,
it's
not
straight
forerd
*punct* ,
but
always
agoing
up
*punct* ,
and
niver
a
coming
down
agin
*punct* .
*break*
was
you
never
on
the
mill
*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
the
mill
*punct* ,
the
mill
as
takes
up
so
little
room
that
it'll
work
inside
a
stone
jug
*punct* ;
and
always
goes
better
when
the
wind's
low
with
people
*punct* ,
than
when
it's
high
*punct* ;
acos
then
they
can't
get
workmen
*punct* .
*break*
but
come
*punct* ,
said
the
young
gentleman
*punct* ;
you
want
grub
*punct* ,
and
you
shall
have
it
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
at
low-water-mark
myself
*punct* ,
only
one
bob
and
a
magpie
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
far
as
it
goes
*punct* ,
i'll
fork
out
and
stump
*punct* .
*break*
up
with
you
on
your
pins
*punct* .
*break*
assisting
oliver
to
rise
*punct* ,
the
young
gentleman
took
him
to
an
adjacent
chandler's
shop
*punct* ,
where
he
purchased
a
sufficiency
of
ready-dressed
ham
and
a
half-quartern
loaf
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
as
he
himself
expressed
it
*punct* ,
a
fourpenny
bran
*punct* !
*break*
the
ham
being
kept
clean
and
preserved
from
dust
*punct* ,
by
the
ingenious
expedient
of
making
a
hole
in
the
loaf
by
pulling
out
a
portion
of
the
crumb
*punct* ,
and
stuffing
it
therein
*punct* .
*break*
taking
the
bread
under
his
arm
*punct* ,
the
young
gentlman
turned
into
a
small
public-house
*punct* ,
and
led
the
way
to
a
tap-room
in
the
rear
of
the
premises
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
a
pot
of
beer
was
brought
in
*punct* ,
by
direction
of
the
mysterious
youth
*punct* ;
and
oliver
*punct* ,
falling
to
*punct* ,
at
his
new
friend's
bidding
*punct* ,
made
a
long
and
hearty
meal
*punct* ,
during
the
progress
of
which
the
strange
boy
eyed
him
from
time
to
time
with
great
attention
*punct* .
*break*
going
to
london
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
strange
boy
*punct* ,
when
oliver
had
at
length
concluded
*punct* .
*break*
got
any
lodgings
*punct* ?
*break*
the
strange
boy
whistled
*punct* ;
and
put
his
arms
into
his
pockets
*punct* ,
as
far
as
the
big
coat-sleeves
would
let
them
go
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
live
in
london
*punct* ?
*break*
i
do
*punct* ,
when
i'm
at
home
*punct* ,
replied
the
boy
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
you
want
some
place
to
sleep
in
to-night
*punct* ,
don't
you
*punct* ?
*break*
i
do
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
answered
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
not
slept
under
a
roof
since
i
left
the
country
*punct* .
*break*
don't
fret
your
eyelids
on
that
score
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
young
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
i've
got
to
be
in
london
to-night
*punct* ;
and
i
know
a
spectable
old
gentleman
as
lives
there
*punct* ,
wot'll
give
you
lodgings
for
nothink
*punct* ,
and
never
ask
for
the
change
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
if
any
genelman
he
knows
interduces
you
*punct* .
*break*
and
don't
he
know
me
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
no
*punct* !
*break*
not
in
the
least
*punct* !
*break*
by
no
means
*punct* .
*break*
the
young
gentelman
smiled
*punct* ,
as
if
to
intimate
that
the
latter
fragments
of
discourse
were
playfully
ironical
*punct* ;
and
finished
the
beer
as
he
did
so
*punct* .
*break*
this
unexpected
offer
of
shelter
was
too
tempting
to
be
resisted
*punct* ;
especially
as
it
was
immediately
followed
up
*punct* ,
by
the
assurance
that
the
old
gentleman
referred
to
*punct* ,
would
doubtless
provide
oliver
with
a
comfortable
place
*punct* ,
without
loss
of
time
*punct* .
*break*
this
led
to
a
more
friendly
and
confidential
dialogue
*punct* ;
from
which
oliver
discovered
that
his
friend's
name
was
jack
dawkins
*punct* ,
and
that
he
was
a
peculiar
pet
and
protege
of
the
elderly
gentleman
before
mentioned
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
dawkin's
appearance
did
not
say
a
vast
deal
in
favour
of
the
comforts
which
his
patron's
interest
obtained
for
those
whom
he
took
under
his
protection
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
he
had
a
rather
flightly
and
dissolute
mode
of
conversing
*punct* ,
and
furthermore
avowed
that
among
his
intimate
friends
he
was
better
known
by
the
sobriquet
of
the
artful
dodger
*punct* ,
oliver
concluded
that
*punct* ,
being
of
a
dissipated
and
careless
turn
*punct* ,
the
moral
precepts
of
his
benefactor
had
hitherto
been
thrown
away
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
under
this
impression
*punct* ,
he
secretly
resolved
to
cultivate
the
good
opinion
of
the
old
gentleman
as
quickly
as
possible
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
if
he
found
the
dodger
incorrigible
*punct* ,
as
he
more
than
half
suspected
he
should
*punct* ,
to
decline
the
honour
of
his
farther
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
as
john
dawkins
objected
to
their
entering
london
before
nightfall
*punct* ,
it
was
nearly
eleven
o'clock
when
they
reached
the
turnpike
at
islington
*punct* .
*break*
they
crossed
from
the
angel
into
st
*punct* .
*break*
john's
road
*punct* ;
struck
down
the
small
street
which
terminates
at
sadler's
wells
theatre
*punct* ;
through
exmouth
street
and
coppice
row
*punct* ;
down
the
little
court
by
the
side
of
the
workhouse
*punct* ;
across
the
classic
ground
which
once
bore
the
name
of
hockley-in-the-hole
*punct* ;
thence
into
little
saffron
hill
*punct* ;
and
so
into
saffron
hill
the
great
*punct* :
along
which
the
dodger
scudded
at
a
rapid
pace
*punct* ,
directing
oliver
to
follow
close
at
his
heels
*punct* .
*break*
although
oliver
had
enough
to
occupy
his
attention
in
keeping
sight
of
his
leader
*punct* ,
he
could
not
help
bestowing
a
few
hasty
glances
on
either
side
of
the
way
*punct* ,
as
he
passed
along
*punct* .
*break*
a
dirtier
or
more
wretched
place
he
had
never
seen
*punct* .
*break*
the
street
was
very
narrow
and
muddy
*punct* ,
and
the
air
was
impregnated
with
filthy
odours
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
a
good
many
small
shops
*punct* ;
but
the
only
stock
in
trade
appeared
to
be
heaps
of
children
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
even
at
that
time
of
night
*punct* ,
were
crawling
in
and
out
at
the
doors
*punct* ,
or
screaming
from
the
inside
*punct* .
*break*
the
sole
places
that
seemed
to
prosper
amid
the
general
blight
of
the
place
*punct* ,
were
the
public-houses
*punct* ;
and
in
them
*punct* ,
the
lowest
orders
of
irish
were
wrangling
with
might
and
main
*punct* .
*break*
covered
ways
and
yards
*punct* ,
which
here
and
there
diverged
from
the
main
street
*punct* ,
disclosed
little
knots
of
houses
*punct* ,
where
drunken
men
and
women
were
positively
wallowing
in
filth
*punct* ;
and
from
several
of
the
door-ways
*punct* ,
great
ill-looking
fellows
were
cautiously
emerging
*punct* ,
bound
*punct* ,
to
all
appearance
*punct* ,
on
no
very
well-disposed
or
harmless
errands
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
was
just
considering
whether
he
hadn't
better
run
away
*punct* ,
when
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
*punct* .
*break*
his
conductor
*punct* ,
catching
him
by
the
arm
*punct* ,
pushed
open
the
door
of
a
house
near
field
lane
*punct* ;
and
drawing
him
into
the
passage
*punct* ,
closed
it
behind
them
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
then
*punct* !
*break*
cried
a
voice
from
below
*punct* ,
in
reply
to
a
whistle
from
the
dodger
*punct* .
*break*
plummy
and
slam
*punct* !
*break*
was
the
reply
*punct* .
*break*
this
seemed
to
be
some
watchword
or
signal
that
all
was
right
*punct* ;
for
the
light
of
a
feeble
candle
gleamed
on
the
wall
at
the
remote
end
of
the
passage
*punct* ;
and
a
man's
face
peeped
out
*punct* ,
from
where
a
balustrade
of
the
old
kitchen
staircase
had
been
broken
away
*punct* .
*break*
there's
two
on
you
*punct* ,
said
the
man
*punct* ,
thrusting
the
candle
farther
out
*punct* ,
and
shielding
his
eyes
with
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
who's
the
t'other
one
*punct* ?
*break*
a
new
pal
*punct* ,
replied
jack
dawkins
*punct* ,
pulling
oliver
forward
*punct* .
*break*
where
did
he
come
from
*punct* ?
*break*
is
fagin
upstairs
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
he's
a
sortin
the
wipes
*punct* .
*break*
up
with
you
*punct* !
*break*
the
candle
was
drawn
back
*punct* ,
and
the
face
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
*punct* ,
groping
his
way
with
one
hand
*punct* ,
and
having
the
other
firmly
grasped
by
his
companion
*punct* ,
ascended
with
much
difficulty
the
dark
and
broken
stairs
*punct* :
which
his
conductor
mounted
with
an
ease
and
expedition
that
showed
he
was
well
acquainted
with
them
*punct* .
*break*
he
threw
open
the
door
of
a
back-room
*punct* ,
and
drew
oliver
in
after
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
walls
and
ceiling
of
the
room
were
perfectly
black
with
age
and
dirt
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
deal
table
before
the
fire
*punct* :
upon
which
were
a
candle
*punct* ,
stuck
in
a
ginger-beer
bottle
*punct* ,
two
or
three
pewter
pots
*punct* ,
a
loaf
and
butter
*punct* ,
and
a
plate
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
frying-pan
*punct* ,
which
was
on
the
fire
*punct* ,
and
which
was
secured
to
the
mantelshelf
by
a
string
*punct* ,
some
sausages
were
cooking
*punct* ;
and
standing
over
them
*punct* ,
with
a
toasting-fork
in
his
hand
*punct* ,
was
a
very
old
shrivelled
jew
*punct* ,
whose
villainous-looking
and
repulsive
face
was
obscured
by
a
quantity
of
matted
red
hair
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
dressed
in
a
greasy
flannel
gown
*punct* ,
with
his
throat
bare
*punct* ;
and
seemed
to
be
dividing
his
attention
between
the
frying-pan
and
the
clothes-horse
*punct* ,
over
which
a
great
number
of
silk
handkerchiefsl
were
hanging
*punct* .
*break*
several
rough
beds
made
of
old
sacks
*punct* ,
were
huddled
side
by
side
on
the
floor
*punct* .
*break*
seated
round
the
table
were
four
or
five
boys
*punct* ,
none
older
than
the
dodger
*punct* ,
smoking
long
clay
pipes
*punct* ,
and
drinking
spirits
with
the
air
of
middle-aged
men
*punct* .
*break*
these
all
crowded
about
their
associate
as
he
whispered
a
few
words
to
the
jew
*punct* ;
and
then
turned
round
and
grinned
at
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
so
did
the
jew
himself
*punct* ,
toasting-fork
in
hand
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
him
*punct* ,
fagin
*punct* ,
said
jack
dawkins
*punct* ;
my
friend
oliver
twist
*punct* .
*break*
the
jew
grinned
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
making
a
low
obeisance
to
oliver
*punct* ,
took
him
by
the
hand
*punct* ,
and
hoped
he
should
have
the
honour
of
his
intimate
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
upon
this
*punct* ,
the
young
gentleman
with
the
pipes
came
round
him
*punct* ,
and
shook
both
his
hands
very
hard
*punct* ,
especially
the
one
in
which
he
held
his
little
bundle
*punct* .
*break*
one
young
gentleman
was
very
anxious
to
hang
up
his
cap
for
him
*punct* ;
and
another
was
so
obliging
as
to
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
*punct* ,
in
order
that
*punct* ,
as
he
was
very
tired
*punct* ,
he
might
not
have
the
trouble
of
emptying
them
*punct* ,
himself
*punct* ,
when
he
went
to
bed
*punct* .
*break*
these
civilities
would
probably
be
extended
much
farther
*punct* ,
but
for
a
liberal
exercise
of
the
jew's
toasting-fork
on
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
the
affectionate
youths
who
offered
them
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
very
glad
to
see
you
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ,
very
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
*punct* .
*break*
dodger
*punct* ,
take
off
the
sausages
*punct* ;
and
draw
a
tub
near
the
fire
for
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
you're
a-staring
at
the
pocket-handkerchiefs
*punct* !
*break*
eh
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
a
good
many
of
em
*punct* ,
ain't
there
*punct* ?
*break*
we've
just
looked
em
out
*punct* ,
ready
for
the
wash
*punct* ;
that's
all
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ;
that's
all
*punct* .
*break*
the
latter
part
of
this
speech
*punct* ,
was
hailed
by
a
boisterous
shout
from
all
the
hopeful
pupils
of
the
merry
old
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
midst
of
which
they
went
to
supper
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
ate
his
share
*punct* ,
and
the
jew
then
mixed
him
a
glass
of
hot
gin-and-water
*punct* :
telling
him
he
must
drink
it
off
directly
*punct* ,
because
another
gentleman
wanted
the
tumbler
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
did
as
he
was
desired
*punct* .
*break*
immediately
afterwards
he
felt
himself
gently
lifted
on
to
one
of
the
sacks
*punct* ;
and
then
he
sunk
into
a
deep
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
late
next
morning
when
oliver
awoke
*punct* ,
from
a
sound
*punct* ,
long
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
other
person
in
the
room
but
the
old
jew
*punct* ,
who
was
boiling
some
coffee
in
a
saucepan
for
breakfast
*punct* ,
and
whistling
softly
to
himself
as
he
stirred
it
round
and
round
*punct* ,
with
an
iron
spoon
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
stop
every
now
and
then
to
listen
when
there
was
the
least
noise
below
*punct* :
and
when
he
had
satistified
himself
*punct* ,
he
would
go
on
whistling
and
stirring
again
*punct* ,
as
before
*punct* .
*break*
although
oliver
had
roused
himself
from
sleep
*punct* ,
he
was
not
thoroughly
awake
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
a
drowsy
state
*punct* ,
between
sleeping
and
waking
*punct* ,
when
you
dream
more
in
five
minutes
with
your
eyes
half
open
*punct* ,
and
yourself
half
conscious
of
everything
that
is
passing
around
you
*punct* ,
than
you
would
in
five
nights
with
your
eyes
fast
closed
*punct* ,
and
your
senses
wrapt
in
perfect
unconsciousness
*punct* .
*break*
at
such
time
*punct* ,
a
mortal
knows
just
enough
of
what
his
mind
is
doing
*punct* ,
to
form
some
glimmering
conception
of
its
mighty
powers
*punct* ,
its
bounding
from
earth
and
spurning
time
and
space
*punct* ,
when
freed
from
the
restraint
of
its
corporeal
associate
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
was
precisely
in
this
condition
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
the
jew
with
his
half-closed
eyes
*punct* ;
heard
his
low
whistling
*punct* ;
and
recognised
the
sound
of
the
spoon
grating
against
the
saucepan's
sides
*punct* :
and
yet
the
self-same
senses
were
mentally
engaged
*punct* ,
at
the
same
time
*punct* ,
in
busy
action
with
almost
everybody
he
had
ever
known
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
coffee
was
done
*punct* ,
the
jew
drew
the
saucepan
to
the
hob
*punct* .
*break*
standing
*punct* ,
then
in
an
irresolute
attitude
for
a
few
minutes
*punct* ,
as
if
he
did
not
well
know
how
to
employ
himself
*punct* ,
he
turned
round
and
looked
at
oliver
*punct* ,
and
called
him
by
his
name
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
answer
*punct* ,
and
was
to
all
appearances
asleep
*punct* .
*break*
after
satisfiying
himself
upon
this
head
*punct* ,
the
jew
stepped
gently
to
the
door
*punct* :
which
he
fastened
*punct* .
*break*
he
then
drew
forth
*punct* :
as
it
seemed
to
oliver
*punct* ,
from
some
trap
in
the
floor
*punct* :
a
small
box
*punct* ,
which
he
placed
carefully
on
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
his
eyes
glistened
as
he
raised
the
lid
*punct* ,
and
looked
in
*punct* .
*break*
dragging
an
old
chair
to
the
table
*punct* ,
he
sat
down
*punct* ;
and
took
from
it
a
magnificent
gold
watch
*punct* ,
sparkling
with
jewels
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
shrugging
up
his
shoulders
*punct* ,
and
distorting
every
feature
with
a
hideous
grin
*punct* .
*break*
staunch
to
the
last
*punct* !
*break*
never
told
the
old
parson
where
they
were
*punct* .
*break*
never
poached
upon
old
fagin
*punct* !
*break*
and
why
should
they
*punct* ?
*break*
it
wouldn't
have
loosened
the
knot
*punct* ,
or
kept
the
drop
up
*punct* ,
a
minute
longer
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* !
*break*
with
these
*punct* ,
and
other
muttered
reflections
of
the
like
nature
*punct* ,
the
jew
once
more
deposited
the
watch
in
its
place
of
safety
*punct* .
*break*
at
least
half
a
dozen
more
were
severally
drawn
forth
from
the
same
box
*punct* ,
and
surveyed
with
equal
pleasure
*punct* ;
besides
rings
*punct* ,
brooches
*punct* ,
bracelet
*punct* ,
and
other
articles
of
jewellery
*punct* ,
of
such
magnificent
materials
*punct* ,
and
costly
workmanship
*punct* ,
that
oliver
had
no
idea
*punct* ,
even
of
their
names
*punct* .
*break*
having
replaced
these
trinkets
*punct* ,
the
jew
took
out
another
*punct* :
so
small
that
it
lay
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
there
seemed
to
be
some
very
minute
inscription
on
it
*punct* ;
for
the
jew
laid
it
flat
upon
the
table
*punct* ,
and
shading
it
with
his
hand
*punct* ,
pored
over
it
*punct* ,
long
and
earnestly
*punct* .
*break*
at
length
he
put
it
down
*punct* ,
as
if
despairing
of
success
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
*punct* ,
muttered
*punct* :
what
a
fine
thing
capital
punishment
is
*punct* !
*break*
dead
men
never
repent
*punct* ;
dead
men
never
bring
awkward
stories
to
light
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
it's
a
fine
thing
for
the
trade
*punct* !
*break*
five
of
em
strung
up
in
a
row
*punct* ,
and
none
left
to
play
booty
*punct* ,
or
turn
white-livered
*punct* !
*break*
as
the
jew
uttered
these
words
*punct* ,
his
bright
dark
eyes
*punct* ,
which
had
been
staring
vacantly
before
him
*punct* ,
fell
on
oliver's
face
*punct* ;
the
boy's
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
in
mute
curiousity
*punct* ;
and
although
the
recognition
was
only
for
an
instant
*punct* ,
for
the
briefest
space
of
time
that
can
possibly
be
conceived
*punct* ,
it
was
enough
to
show
the
old
man
that
he
had
been
observed
*punct* .
*break*
he
closed
the
lid
of
the
box
with
a
loud
crash
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
laying
his
hand
on
a
bread
knife
which
was
on
the
table
*punct* ,
started
furiously
up
*punct* .
*break*
he
trembled
very
much
though
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
even
in
his
terror
*punct* ,
oliver
could
see
that
the
knife
quivered
in
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
jew
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
watch
me
for
*punct* ?
*break*
why
are
you
awake
*punct* ?
*break*
what
have
you
seen
*punct* ?
*break*
speak
out
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* !
*break*
quick
*punct* ,
quick
*punct* !
*break*
for
your
life
*punct* .
*break*
i
wasn't
able
to
sleep
any
longer
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* ,
meekly
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
very
sorry
if
i
have
disturbed
you
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
you
were
not
awake
an
hour
ago
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
scowling
fiercely
on
the
boy
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
are
you
sure
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
the
jew
*punct* :
with
a
still
fiercer
look
than
before
*punct* :
and
a
threatening
attitude
*punct* .
*break*
upon
my
word
i
was
not
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* ,
earnestly
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
not
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
tush
*punct* ,
tush
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
abruptly
resuming
his
old
manner
*punct* ,
and
playing
with
the
knife
a
little
*punct* ,
before
he
laid
it
down
*punct* ;
as
if
to
induce
the
belief
that
he
had
caught
it
up
*punct* ,
in
mere
sport
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
i
know
that
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
i
only
tried
to
frighten
you
*punct* .
*break*
you're
a
brave
boy
*punct* .
*break*
you're
a
brave
boy
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
the
jew
rubbed
his
hands
with
a
chuckle
*punct* ,
but
glanced
uneasily
at
the
box
*punct* ,
notwithstanding
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
see
any
of
these
pretty
things
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
laying
his
hand
upon
it
after
a
short
pause
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
turning
rather
pale
*punct* .
*break*
they
*punct* ,
they're
mine
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ;
my
little
property
*punct* .
*break*
all
i
have
to
live
upon
*punct* ,
in
my
old
age
*punct* .
*break*
the
folks
call
me
a
miser
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
only
a
miser
*punct* ;
that's
all
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
thought
the
old
gentleman
must
be
a
decided
miser
to
live
in
such
a
dirty
place
*punct* ,
with
so
many
watches
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
thinking
that
perhaps
his
fondness
for
the
dodger
and
the
other
boys
*punct* ,
cost
him
a
good
deal
of
money
*punct* ,
he
only
cast
a
deferential
look
at
the
jew
*punct* ,
and
asked
if
he
might
get
up
*punct* .
*break*
certainly
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
certainly
*punct* ,
replied
the
old
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
there's
a
pitcher
of
water
in
the
corner
by
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
bring
it
here
*punct* ;
and
i'll
give
you
a
basin
to
wash
in
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
got
up
*punct* ;
walked
across
the
room
*punct* ;
and
stooped
for
an
instant
to
raise
the
pitcher
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
turned
his
head
*punct* ,
the
box
was
gone
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
scarcely
washed
himself
*punct* ,
and
made
everything
tidy
*punct* ,
by
emptying
the
basin
out
of
the
window
*punct* ,
agreeably
to
the
jew's
directions
*punct* ,
when
the
dodger
returned
*punct* :
accompanied
by
a
very
sprightly
young
friend
*punct* ,
whom
oliver
had
seen
smoking
on
the
previous
night
*punct* ,
and
who
was
now
formally
introduced
to
him
as
charley
bates
*punct* .
*break*
the
four
sat
down
*punct* ,
to
breakfast
*punct* ,
on
the
coffee
*punct* ,
and
some
hot
rolls
and
ham
which
the
dodger
had
brought
home
in
the
crown
of
his
hat
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
glancing
slyly
at
oliver
*punct* ,
and
addressing
himself
to
the
dodger
*punct* ,
i
hope
you've
been
at
work
this
morning
*punct* ,
my
dears
*punct* ?
*break*
hard
*punct* ,
replied
the
dodger
*punct* .
*break*
as
nails
*punct* ,
added
charley
bates
*punct* .
*break*
good
boys
*punct* ,
good
boys
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
jew
*punct* .
*break*
what
have
you
got
*punct* ,
dodger
*punct* ?
*break*
a
couple
of
pocket-books
*punct* ,
replied
that
young
gentlman
*punct* .
*break*
inquired
the
jew
*punct* ,
with
eagerness
*punct* .
*break*
pretty
well
*punct* ,
replied
the
dodger
*punct* ,
producing
two
pocket-books
*punct* ;
one
green
*punct* ,
and
the
other
red
*punct* .
*break*
not
so
heavy
as
they
might
be
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
after
looking
at
the
insides
carefully
*punct* ;
but
very
neat
and
nicely
made
*punct* .
*break*
ingenious
workman
*punct* ,
ain't
he
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ?
*break*
very
indeed
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
at
which
mr.
charles
bates
laughed
uproariously
*punct* ;
very
much
to
the
amazement
of
oliver
*punct* ,
who
saw
nothing
to
laugh
at
*punct* ,
in
anything
that
had
passed
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
have
you
got
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ?
*break*
said
fagin
to
charley
bates
*punct* .
*break*
wipes
*punct* ,
replied
master
bates
*punct* ;
at
the
same
time
producing
four
pocket-handkerchiefs
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
inspecting
them
closely
*punct* ;
they're
very
good
ones
*punct* ,
very
*punct* .
*break*
you
haven't
marked
them
well
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
charley
*punct* ;
so
the
marks
shall
be
picked
out
with
a
needle
*punct* ,
and
we'll
teach
oliver
how
to
do
it
*punct* .
*break*
shall
us
*punct* ,
oliver
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
if
you
please
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
you'd
like
to
be
able
to
make
pocket-handkerchiefs
as
easy
as
charley
bates
*punct* ,
wouldn't
you
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
jew
*punct* .
*break*
very
much
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
if
you'll
teach
me
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
master
bates
saw
something
so
exquisitely
ludicrous
in
this
reply
*punct* ,
that
he
burst
into
another
laugh
*punct* ;
which
laugh
*punct* ,
meeting
the
coffee
he
was
drinking
*punct* ,
and
carrying
it
down
some
wrong
channel
*punct* ,
very
nearly
terminated
in
his
premature
suffocation
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
so
jolly
green
*punct* !
*break*
said
charley
when
he
recovered
*punct* ,
as
an
apology
to
the
company
for
his
unpolite
behaviour
*punct* .
*break*
the
dodger
said
nothing
*punct* ,
but
he
smoothed
oliver's
hair
over
his
eyes
*punct* ,
and
said
he'd
know
better
*punct* ,
by
and
by
*punct* ;
upon
which
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
observing
oliver's
colour
mounting
*punct* ,
changed
the
subject
by
asking
whether
there
had
been
much
of
a
crowd
at
the
execution
that
morning
*punct* ?
*break*
this
made
him
wonder
more
and
more
*punct* ;
for
it
was
plain
from
the
replies
of
the
two
boys
that
they
had
both
been
there
*punct* ;
and
oliver
naturally
wondered
how
they
could
possibly
have
found
time
to
be
so
very
industrious
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
breakfast
was
cleared
away
*punct* ;
the
merry
old
gentlman
and
the
two
boys
played
at
a
very
curious
and
uncommon
game
*punct* ,
which
was
performed
in
this
way
*punct* .
*break*
the
merry
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
placing
a
snuff-box
in
one
pocket
of
his
trousers
*punct* ,
a
note-case
in
the
other
*punct* ,
and
a
watch
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
*punct* ,
with
a
guard-chain
round
his
neck
*punct* ,
and
sticking
a
mock
diamond
pin
in
his
shirt
*punct* :
buttoned
his
coat
tight
round
him
*punct* ,
and
putting
his
spectacle-case
and
handkerchief
in
his
pockets
*punct* ,
trotted
up
and
down
the
room
with
a
stick
*punct* ,
in
imitation
of
the
manner
in
which
old
gentlmen
walk
about
the
streets
any
hour
in
the
day
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
he
stopped
at
the
fire-place
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
at
the
door
*punct* ,
making
believe
that
he
was
staring
with
all
his
might
into
shop-windows
*punct* .
*break*
at
such
times
*punct* ,
he
would
look
constantly
round
him
*punct* ,
for
fear
of
thieves
*punct* ,
and
would
keep
slapping
all
his
pockets
in
turn
*punct* ,
to
see
that
he
hadn't
lost
anything
*punct* ,
in
such
a
very
funny
and
natural
manner
*punct* ,
that
oliver
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
all
this
time
*punct* ,
the
two
boys
followed
him
closely
about
*punct* :
getting
out
of
his
sight
*punct* ,
so
nimbly
*punct* ,
every
time
he
turned
round
*punct* ,
that
it
was
impossible
to
follow
their
motions
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
the
dodger
trod
upon
his
toes
*punct* ,
or
ran
upon
his
boot
accidently
*punct* ,
while
charley
bates
stumbled
up
against
him
behind
*punct* ;
and
in
that
one
moment
they
took
from
him
*punct* ,
with
the
most
extraordinary
rapidity
*punct* ,
snuff-box
*punct* ,
note-case
*punct* ,
watch-guard
*punct* ,
chain
*punct* ,
shirt-pin
*punct* ,
pocket-handkerchief
*punct* ,
even
the
spectacle-case
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
old
gentlman
felt
a
hand
in
any
one
of
his
pockets
*punct* ,
he
cried
out
where
it
was
*punct* ;
and
then
the
game
began
all
over
again
*punct* .
*break*
when
this
game
had
been
played
a
great
many
times
*punct* ,
a
couple
of
young
ladies
called
to
see
the
young
gentleman
*punct* ;
one
of
whom
was
named
bet
*punct* ,
and
the
other
nancy
*punct* .
*break*
they
wore
a
good
deal
of
hair
*punct* ,
not
very
neatly
turned
up
behind
*punct* ,
and
were
rather
untidy
about
the
shoes
and
stockings
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
not
exactly
pretty
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ;
but
they
had
a
great
deal
of
colour
in
their
faces
*punct* ,
and
looked
quite
stout
and
hearty
*punct* .
*break*
being
remarkably
free
and
agreeable
in
their
manners
*punct* ,
oliver
thought
them
very
nice
girls
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
as
there
is
no
doubt
they
were
*punct* .
*break*
the
visitors
stopped
a
long
time
*punct* .
*break*
spirits
were
produced
*punct* ,
in
consequence
of
one
of
the
young
ladies
complaining
of
a
coldness
in
her
inside
*punct* ;
and
the
conversation
took
a
very
convivial
and
improving
turn
*punct* .
*break*
at
length
*punct* ,
charley
bates
expressed
his
opinion
that
it
was
time
to
pad
the
hoof
*punct* .
*break*
this
*punct* ,
it
occurred
to
oliver
*punct* ,
must
be
french
for
going
out
*punct* ;
for
directly
afterwards
*punct* ,
the
dodger
*punct* ,
and
charley
*punct* ,
and
the
two
young
ladies
*punct* ,
went
away
together
*punct* ,
having
been
kindly
furnished
by
the
amiable
old
jew
with
money
to
spend
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
fagin
*punct* .
*break*
that's
a
pleasant
life
*punct* ,
isn't
it
*punct* ?
*break*
they
have
gone
out
for
the
day
*punct* .
*break*
have
they
done
work
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
unless
they
should
unexpectedly
come
across
any
*punct* ,
when
they
are
out
*punct* ;
and
they
won't
neglect
it
*punct* ,
if
they
do
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
depend
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
make
em
your
models
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
make
em
your
models
*punct* ,
tapping
the
fire-shovel
on
the
hearth
to
add
force
to
his
words
*punct* ;
do
everything
they
bid
you
*punct* ,
and
take
their
advice
in
all
matters
*punct* ,
especially
the
dodger's
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
he'll
be
a
great
man
himself
*punct* ,
and
will
make
you
one
too
*punct* ,
if
you
take
pattern
by
him.
*punct* ,
is
my
handkerchief
hanging
out
of
my
pocket
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
stopping
short
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
see
if
you
can
take
it
out
*punct* ,
without
my
feeling
it
*punct* ;
as
you
saw
them
do
*punct* ,
when
we
were
at
play
this
morning
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
held
up
the
bottom
of
the
pocket
with
one
hand
*punct* ,
as
he
had
seen
the
dodger
hold
it
*punct* ,
and
drew
the
handkerchief
lighty
out
of
it
with
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
is
it
gone
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
the
jew
*punct* .
*break*
here
it
is
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
oliver
*punct* ,
showing
it
in
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
you're
a
clever
boy
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
the
playful
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
patting
oliver
on
the
head
approvingly
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
saw
a
sharper
lad
*punct* .
*break*
here's
a
shilling
for
you
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
go
on
*punct* ,
in
this
way
*punct* ,
you'll
be
the
greatest
man
of
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
come
here
*punct* ,
and
i'll
show
you
how
to
take
the
marks
out
of
the
handkerchiefs
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
wondered
what
picking
the
old
gentleman's
pocket
in
play
*punct* ,
had
to
do
with
his
chances
of
being
a
great
man
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
thinking
that
the
jew
*punct* ,
being
so
much
his
senior
*punct* ,
must
know
best
*punct* ,
he
followed
him
quietly
to
the
table
*punct* ,
and
was
soon
deeply
involved
in
his
new
study
*punct* .
*break*
for
many
days
*punct* ,
oliver
remained
in
the
jew's
room
*punct* ,
picking
the
marks
out
of
the
pocket-handkerchief
*punct* ,
of
which
a
great
number
were
brought
home,
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
taking
part
in
the
game
already
described
*punct* :
which
the
two
boys
and
the
jew
played
*punct* ,
regularly
*punct* ,
every
morning
*punct* .
*break*
at
length
*punct* ,
he
began
to
languish
for
fresh
air
*punct* ,
and
took
many
occasions
of
earnestly
entreating
the
old
gentleman
to
allow
him
to
go
out
to
work
with
his
two
companions
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
was
rendered
the
more
anxious
to
be
actively
employed
*punct* ,
by
what
he
had
seen
of
the
stern
morality
of
the
old
gentleman's
character
*punct* .
*break*
whenever
the
dodger
or
charley
bates
came
home
at
night
*punct* ,
empty-handed
*punct* ,
he
would
expatiate
with
great
vehemence
on
the
misery
of
idle
and
lazy
habits
*punct* ;
and
would
enforce
upon
them
the
necessity
of
an
active
life
*punct* ,
by
sending
them
supperless
to
bed
*punct* .
*break*
on
one
occasion
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
knock
them
both
down
a
flight
of
stairs
*punct* ;
but
this
was
carrying
out
his
virtuous
precepts
to
an
unusual
extent
*punct* .
*break*
at
length
*punct* ,
one
morning
*punct* ,
oliver
obtained
the
permission
he
had
so
eagerly
sought
*punct* .
*break*
there
had
been
no
handkerchiefs
to
work
upon
*punct* ,
for
two
or
three
days
*punct* ,
and
the
dinners
had
been
rather
meagre
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
these
were
reasons
for
the
old
gentleman's
giving
his
assent
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
whether
they
were
or
no
*punct* ,
he
told
oliver
he
might
go
*punct* ,
and
placed
him
under
the
joint
guardianship
of
charley
bates
*punct* ,
and
his
friend
the
dodger
*punct* .
*break*
the
three
boys
sallied
out
*punct* ;
the
dodger
with
his
coat-sleeves
tucked
up
*punct* ,
and
his
hat
cocked
*punct* ,
as
usual
*punct* ;
master
bates
sauntering
along
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
*punct* ;
and
oliver
between
them
*punct* ,
wondering
where
they
were
going
*punct* ,
and
what
branch
of
manufacture
he
would
be
instructed
in
*punct* ,
first
*punct* .
*break*
the
pace
at
which
they
went
*punct* ,
was
such
a
very
lazy
*punct* ,
ill-looking
saunter
*punct* ,
that
oliver
soon
began
to
think
his
companions
were
going
to
deceive
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
by
not
going
to
work
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
the
dodger
had
a
vicious
propensity
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
of
pulling
the
caps
from
the
heads
of
small
boys
and
tossing
them
down
areas
*punct* ;
while
charley
bates
exhibited
some
very
loose
notions
concerning
the
rights
of
property
*punct* ,
by
pilfering
divers
apples
and
onions
from
the
stalls
at
the
kennel
sides
*punct* ,
and
thrusting
them
into
pockets
which
were
so
surprisingly
capacious
*punct* ,
that
they
seemed
to
undermine
his
whole
suit
of
clothes
in
every
direction
*punct* .
*break*
these
things
looked
so
bad
*punct* ,
that
oliver
was
on
the
point
of
declaring
his
intention
of
seeking
his
way
back
*punct* ,
in
the
best
way
he
could
*punct* ;
when
his
thoughts
were
suddenly
directed
into
another
channel
*punct* ,
by
a
very
mysterious
change
of
behaviour
on
the
part
of
the
dodger
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
just
emerging
from
a
narrow
court
not
far
from
the
open
square
in
clerkenwell
*punct* ,
which
is
yet
called
*punct* ,
by
some
strange
perversion
of
terms
*punct* ,
the
green'
*punct* :
when
the
dodger
made
a
sudden
stop
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
laying
his
finger
on
his
lip
*punct* ,
drew
his
companions
back
again
*punct* ,
with
the
greatest
caution
and
circumspection
*punct* .
*break*
what's
the
matter
*punct* ?
*break*
replied
the
dodger
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
see
that
old
cove
at
the
book-stall
*punct* ?
*break*
the
old
gentleman
over
the
way
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
see
him
*punct* .
*break*
he'll
do
*punct* ,
said
the
doger
*punct* .
*break*
a
prime
plant
*punct* ,
observed
master
charley
bates
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
looked
from
one
to
the
other
*punct* ,
with
the
greatest
surprise
*punct* ;
but
he
was
not
permitted
to
make
any
inquiries
*punct* ;
for
the
two
boys
walked
stealthily
across
the
road
*punct* ,
and
slunk
close
behind
the
old
gentleman
towards
whom
his
attention
had
been
directed
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
walked
a
few
paces
after
them
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
not
knowing
whether
to
advance
or
retire
*punct* ,
stood
looking
on
in
silent
amazement
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
gentleman
was
a
very
respectable-looking
personage
*punct* ,
with
a
powdered
head
and
gold
spectacles
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
dressed
in
a
bottle-green
coat
with
a
black
velvet
collar
*punct* ;
wore
white
trousers
*punct* ;
and
carried
a
smart
bamboo
cane
under
his
arm
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
taken
up
a
book
from
the
stall
*punct* ,
and
there
he
stood
*punct* ,
reading
away
*punct* ,
as
hard
as
if
he
were
in
his
elbow-chair
*punct* ,
in
his
own
study
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
very
possible
that
he
fancied
himself
there
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ;
for
it
was
plain
*punct* ,
from
his
abstraction
*punct* ,
that
he
saw
not
the
book-stall
*punct* ,
nor
the
street
*punct* ,
nor
the
boys
*punct* ,
nor
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
anything
but
the
book
itself
*punct* :
which
he
was
reading
straight
through
*punct* :
turning
over
the
leaf
when
he
got
to
the
bottom
of
a
page
*punct* ,
beginning
at
the
top
line
of
the
next
one
*punct* ,
and
going
regularly
on
*punct* ,
with
the
greatest
interest
and
eagerness
*punct* .
*break*
what
was
oliver's
horror
and
alarm
as
he
stood
a
few
paces
off
*punct* ,
looking
on
with
his
eyelids
as
wide
open
as
they
would
possibly
go
*punct* ,
to
see
the
dodger
plunge
his
hand
into
the
old
gentleman's
pocket
*punct* ,
and
draw
from
thence
a
handkerchief
*punct* !
*break*
to
see
him
hand
the
same
to
charley
bates
*punct* ;
and
finally
to
behold
them
*punct* ,
both
running
away
round
the
corner
at
full
speed
*punct* !
*break*
in
an
instant
the
whole
mystery
of
the
hankerchiefs
*punct* ,
and
the
watches
*punct* ,
and
the
jewels
*punct* ,
and
the
jew
*punct* ,
rushed
upon
the
boy's
mind
*punct* .
*break*
he
stood
*punct* ,
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
with
the
blood
so
tingling
through
all
his
veins
from
terror
*punct* ,
that
he
felt
as
if
he
were
in
a
burning
fire
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
confused
and
frightened
*punct* ,
he
took
to
his
heels
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
not
knowing
what
he
did
*punct* ,
made
off
as
fast
as
he
could
lay
his
feet
to
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
all
done
in
a
minute's
space
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
very
instant
when
oliver
began
to
run
*punct* ,
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
putting
his
hand
to
his
pocket
*punct* ,
and
missing
his
handkerchief
*punct* ,
turned
sharp
round
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
the
boy
scudding
away
at
such
a
rapid
pace
*punct* ,
he
very
naturally
concluded
him
to
be
the
depredator
*punct* ;
and
shouting
stop
thief
*punct* !
*break*
with
all
his
might
*punct* ,
made
off
after
him
*punct* ,
book
in
hand
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
old
gentleman
was
not
the
only
person
who
raised
the
hue-and-cry
*punct* .
*break*
the
dodger
and
master
bates
*punct* ,
unwilling
to
attract
public
attention
by
running
down
the
open
street
*punct* ,
had
merely
retured
into
the
very
first
doorway
round
the
corner
*punct* .
*break*
they
no
sooner
heard
the
cry
*punct* ,
and
saw
oliver
running
*punct* ,
than
*punct* ,
guessing
exactly
how
the
matter
stood
*punct* ,
they
issued
forth
with
great
promptitude
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
shouting
stop
thief
*punct* !
*break*
too
*punct* ,
joined
in
the
pursuit
like
good
citizens
*punct* .
*break*
although
oliver
had
been
brought
up
by
philosophers
*punct* ,
he
was
not
theoretically
acquainted
with
the
beautiful
axiom
that
self-preservation
is
the
first
law
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
had
been
*punct* ,
perhaps
he
would
have
been
prepared
for
this
*punct* .
*break*
not
being
prepared
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
it
alarmed
him
the
more
*punct* ;
so
away
he
went
like
the
wind
*punct* ,
with
the
old
gentleman
and
the
two
boys
roaring
and
shouting
behind
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
a
magic
in
the
sound
*punct* .
*break*
the
tradesman
leaves
his
counter
*punct* ,
and
the
car-man
his
waggon
*punct* ;
the
butcher
throws
down
his
tray
*punct* ;
the
baker
his
basket
*punct* ;
the
milkman
his
pail
*punct* ;
the
errand-boy
his
parcels
*punct* ;
the
school-boy
his
marbles
*punct* ;
the
paviour
his
pickaxe
*punct* ;
the
child
his
battledore
*punct* .
*break*
away
they
run
*punct* ,
pell-mell
*punct* ,
helter-skelter
*punct* ,
slap-dash
*punct* :
tearing
*punct* ,
yelling
*punct* ,
screaming
*punct* ,
knocking
down
the
passengers
as
they
turn
the
corners
*punct* ,
rousing
up
the
dogs
*punct* ,
and
astonishing
the
fowls
*punct* :
and
streets
*punct* ,
squares
*punct* ,
and
courts
*punct* ,
re-echo
with
the
sound
*punct* .
*break*
the
cry
is
taken
up
by
a
hundred
voices
*punct* ,
and
the
crowd
accumulate
at
every
turning
*punct* .
*break*
away
they
fly
*punct* ,
splashing
through
the
mud
*punct* ,
and
rattling
along
the
pavements
*punct* :
up
go
the
windows
*punct* ,
out
run
the
people
*punct* ,
onward
bear
the
mob
*punct* ,
a
whole
audience
desert
punch
in
the
very
thickest
of
the
plot
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
joining
the
rushing
throng
*punct* ,
swell
the
shout
*punct* ,
and
lend
fresh
vigour
to
the
cry
*punct* ,
stop
thief
*punct* !
*break*
there
is
a
passion
for
hunting
something
deeply
implanted
in
the
human
breast
*punct* .
*break*
one
wretched
breathless
child
*punct* ,
panting
with
exhaustion
*punct* ;
terror
in
his
looks
*punct* ;
agaony
in
his
eyes
*punct* ;
large
drops
of
perspiration
streaming
down
his
face
*punct* ;
strains
every
nerve
to
make
head
upon
his
pursuers
*punct* ;
and
as
they
follow
on
his
track
*punct* ,
and
gain
upon
him
every
instant
*punct* ,
they
hail
his
decreasing
strength
with
joy
*punct* .
*break*
ay
*punct* ,
stop
him
for
god's
sake
*punct* ,
were
it
only
in
mercy
*punct* !
*break*
stopped
at
last
*punct* !
*break*
a
clever
blow
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
down
upon
the
pavement
*punct* ;
and
the
crowd
eagerly
gather
round
him
*punct* :
each
new
comer
*punct* ,
jostling
and
struggling
with
the
others
to
catch
a
glimpse
*punct* .
*break*
give
him
a
little
air
*punct* !
*break*
he
don't
deserve
it
*punct* .
*break*
where's
the
gentleman
*punct* ?
*break*
here
his
is
*punct* ,
coming
down
the
street
*punct* .
*break*
make
room
there
for
the
gentleman
*punct* !
*break*
is
this
the
boy
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
oliver
lay
*punct* ,
covered
with
mud
and
dust
*punct* ,
and
bleeding
from
the
mouth
*punct* ,
looking
wildly
round
upon
the
heap
of
faces
that
surrounded
him
*punct* ,
when
the
old
gentleman
was
officiously
dragged
and
pushed
into
the
circle
by
the
foremost
of
the
pursuers
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
the
gentleman
*punct* ,
i
am
afraid
it
is
the
boy
*punct* .
*break*
murmured
the
crowd
*punct* .
*break*
that's
a
good
un
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
gentleman
*punct* ,
he
has
hurt
himself
*punct* .
*break*
_i_
did
that
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
a
great
lubberly
fellow
*punct* ,
stepping
forward
*punct* ;
and
preciously
i
cut
my
knuckle
agin
his
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
i
stopped
him
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
the
follow
touched
his
hat
with
a
grin
*punct* ,
expecting
something
for
his
pains
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
eyeing
him
with
an
expression
of
dislike
*punct* ,
look
anxiously
round
*punct* ,
as
if
he
contemplated
running
away
himself
*punct* :
which
it
is
very
possible
he
might
have
attempted
to
do
*punct* ,
and
thus
have
afforded
another
chase
*punct* ,
had
not
a
police
officer
*punct* ,
who
is
generally
the
last
person
to
arrive
in
such
cases
*punct* ,
at
that
moment
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
*punct* ,
and
seized
oliver
by
the
collar
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
get
up
*punct* ,
said
the
man
*punct* ,
roughly
*punct* .
*break*
it
wasn't
me
indeed
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
it
was
two
other
boys
*punct* ,
said
oliver
*punct* ,
clasping
his
hands
passionately
*punct* ,
and
looking
round
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
here
somewhere
*punct* .
*break*
oh
no
*punct* ,
they
ain't
*punct* ,
said
the
officer
*punct* .
*break*
he
meant
this
to
be
ironical
*punct* ,
but
it
was
true
besides
*punct* ;
for
the
dodger
and
charley
bates
had
filed
off
down
the
first
convenient
court
they
came
to
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
get
up
*punct* !
*break*
don't
hurt
him
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
compassionately
*punct* .
*break*
oh
no
*punct* ,
i
won't
hurt
him
*punct* ,
replied
the
officer
*punct* ,
tearing
his
jacket
half
off
his
back
*punct* ,
in
proof
thereof
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
i
know
you
*punct* ;
it
won't
do
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
stand
upon
your
legs
*punct* ,
you
young
devil
*punct* ?
*break*
oliver
*punct* ,
who
could
hardly
stand
*punct* ,
made
a
shift
to
raise
himself
on
his
feet
*punct* ,
and
was
at
once
lugged
along
the
streets
by
the
jacket-collar
*punct* ,
at
a
rapid
pace
*punct* .
*break*
the
gentleman
walked
on
with
them
by
the
officer's
side
*punct* ;
and
as
many
of
the
crowd
as
could
achieve
the
feat
*punct* ,
got
a
little
ahead
*punct* ,
and
stared
back
at
oliver
from
time
to
time
*punct* .
*break*
the
boys
shouted
in
triumph
*punct* ;
and
on
they
went
*punct* .
*break*
the
offence
had
been
committed
within
the
district
*punct* ,
and
indeed
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
*punct* ,
a
very
notorious
metropolitan
police
office
*punct* .
*break*
the
crowd
had
only
the
satisfaction
of
accompanying
oliver
through
two
or
three
streets
*punct* ,
and
down
a
place
called
mutton
hill
*punct* ,
when
he
was
led
beneath
a
low
archway
*punct* ,
and
up
a
dirty
court
*punct* ,
into
this
dispensary
of
summary
justice
*punct* ,
by
the
back
way
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
small
paved
yard
into
which
they
turned
*punct* ;
and
here
they
encountered
a
stout
man
with
a
bunch
of
whiskers
on
his
face
*punct* ,
and
a
bunch
of
keys
in
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
what's
the
matter
now
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
man
carelessly
*punct* .
*break*
a
young
fogle-hunter
*punct* ,
replied
the
man
who
had
oliver
in
charge
*punct* .
*break*
are
you
the
party
that's
been
robbed
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
the
man
with
the
keys
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
am
*punct* ,
replied
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ;
but
i
am
not
sure
that
this
boy
actually
took
the
handkerchief
*punct* .
*break*
i
*punct* ,
i
would
rather
not
press
the
case
*punct* .
*break*
must
go
before
the
magistrate
now
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
the
man
*punct* .
*break*
his
worship
will
be
disengaged
in
half
a
minute
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
young
gallows
*punct* !
*break*
this
was
an
invitation
for
oliver
to
enter
through
a
door
which
he
unlocked
as
he
spoke
*punct* ,
and
which
led
into
a
stone
cell
*punct* .
*break*
here
he
was
searched
*punct* ;
and
nothing
being
found
upon
him
*punct* ,
locked
up
*punct* .
*break*
this
cell
was
in
shape
and
size
something
like
an
area
cellar
*punct* ,
only
not
so
light
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
most
intolably
dirty
*punct* ;
for
it
was
monday
morning
*punct* ;
and
it
had
been
tenanted
by
six
drunken
people
*punct* ,
who
had
been
locked
up
*punct* ,
elsewhere
*punct* ,
since
saturday
night
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
is
little
*punct* .
*break*
in
our
station-houses
*punct* ,
men
and
women
are
every
night
confined
on
the
most
trivial
charges
*punct* ,
the
word
is
worth
noting
*punct* ,
in
dungeons
*punct* ,
compared
with
which
*punct* ,
those
in
newgate
*punct* ,
occupied
by
the
most
atrocious
felons
*punct* ,
tried
*punct* ,
found
guilty
*punct* ,
and
under
sentence
of
death
*punct* ,
are
palaces
*punct* .
*break*
let
any
one
who
doubts
this
*punct* ,
compare
the
two
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
gentleman
looked
almost
as
rueful
as
oliver
when
the
key
grated
in
the
lock
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
with
a
sigh
to
the
book
*punct* ,
which
had
been
the
innocent
cause
of
all
this
disturbance
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
something
in
that
boy's
face
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gentleman
to
himself
as
he
walked
slowly
away
*punct* ,
tapping
his
chin
with
the
cover
of
the
book
*punct* ,
in
a
thoughtful
manner
*punct* ;
something
that
touches
and
interests
me
*punct* .
*break*
can
he
be
innocent
*punct* ?
*break*
he
looked
like
*punct* ,
bye
the
bye
*punct* ,
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
halting
very
abruptly
*punct* ,
and
staring
up
into
the
sky
*punct* ,
bless
my
soul!
*punct* ,
where
have
i
seen
something
like
that
look
before
*punct* ?
*break*
after
musing
for
some
minutes
*punct* ,
the
old
gentleman
walked
*punct* ,
with
the
same
meditative
face
*punct* ,
into
a
back
anteroom
opening
from
the
yard
*punct* ;
and
there
*punct* ,
retiring
into
a
corner
*punct* ,
called
up
before
his
mind's
eye
a
vast
amphitheatre
of
faces
over
which
a
dusky
curtain
had
hung
for
many
years
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
shaking
his
head
*punct* ;
it
must
be
imagination
*punct* .
*break*
he
wandered
over
them
again
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
called
them
into
view
*punct* ,
and
it
was
not
easy
to
replace
the
shroud
that
had
so
long
concealed
them
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
the
faces
of
friends
*punct* ,
and
foes
*punct* ,
and
of
many
that
had
been
almost
strangers
peering
intrusively
from
the
crowd
*punct* ;
there
were
the
faces
of
young
and
blooming
girls
that
were
now
old
women
*punct* ;
there
were
faces
that
the
grave
had
changed
and
closed
upon
*punct* ,
but
which
the
mind
*punct* ,
superior
to
its
power
*punct* ,
still
dressed
in
their
old
freshness
and
beauty
*punct* ,
calling
back
the
lustre
of
the
eyes
*punct* ,
the
brightness
of
the
smile
*punct* ,
the
beaming
of
the
soul
through
its
mask
of
clay
*punct* ,
and
whispering
of
beauty
beyond
the
tomb
*punct* ,
changed
but
to
be
heightened
*punct* ,
and
taken
from
earth
only
to
be
set
up
as
a
light
*punct* ,
to
shed
a
soft
and
gentle
glow
upon
the
path
to
heaven
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
old
gentleman
could
recall
no
one
countenance
of
which
oliver's
features
bore
a
trace
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
he
heaved
a
sigh
over
the
recollections
he
awakened
*punct* ;
and
being
*punct* ,
happily
for
himself
*punct* ,
an
absent
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
buried
them
again
in
the
pages
of
the
musty
book
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
roused
by
a
touch
on
the
shoulder
*punct* ,
and
a
request
from
the
man
with
the
keys
to
follow
him
into
the
office
*punct* .
*break*
he
closed
his
book
hastily
*punct* ;
and
was
at
once
ushered
into
the
imposing
presence
of
the
renowned
mr.
fang
*punct* .
*break*
the
office
was
a
front
parlour
*punct* ,
with
a
panelled
wall
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
fang
sat
behind
a
bar
*punct* ,
at
the
upper
end
*punct* ;
and
on
one
side
the
door
was
a
sort
of
wooden
pen
in
which
poor
little
oliver
was
already
deposited
*punct* ;
trembling
very
much
at
the
awfulness
of
the
scene
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
fang
was
a
lean
*punct* ,
long-backed
*punct* ,
stiff-necked
*punct* ,
middle-sized
man
*punct* ,
with
no
great
quantity
of
hair
*punct* ,
and
what
he
had
*punct* ,
growing
on
the
back
and
sides
of
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
was
stern
*punct* ,
and
much
flushed
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
were
really
not
in
the
habit
of
drinking
rather
more
than
was
exactly
good
for
him
*punct* ,
he
might
have
brought
action
against
his
countenance
for
libel
*punct* ,
and
have
recovered
heavy
damages
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
gentleman
bowed
respectfully
*punct* ;
and
advancing
to
the
magistrate's
desk
*punct* ,
said
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
*punct* ,
that
is
my
name
and
address
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
he
then
withdrew
a
pace
or
two
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
with
another
polite
and
gentlemanly
inclination
of
the
head
*punct* ,
waited
to
be
questioned
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
it
so
happened
that
mr.
fang
was
at
that
moment
perusing
a
leading
article
in
a
newspaper
of
the
morning
*punct* ,
adverting
to
some
recent
decision
of
his
*punct* ,
and
commending
him
*punct* ,
for
the
three
hundred
and
fiftieth
time
*punct* ,
to
the
special
and
particular
notice
of
the
secretary
of
state
for
the
home
department
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
out
of
temper
*punct* ;
and
he
looked
up
with
an
angry
scowl
*punct* .
*break*
who
are
you
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mr.
fang
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
gentleman
pointed
*punct* ,
with
some
surprise
*punct* ,
to
his
card
*punct* .
*break*
said
mr.
fang
*punct* ,
tossing
the
card
contemptuously
away
with
the
newspaper
*punct* .
*break*
who
is
this
fellow
*punct* ?
*break*
my
name
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
speaking
like
a
gentleman
*punct* ,
my
name
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
is
brownlow
*punct* .
*break*
permit
me
to
inquire
the
name
of
the
magistrate
who
offers
a
gratuitous
and
unprovoked
insult
to
a
respectable
person
*punct* ,
under
the
protection
of
the
bench
*punct* .
*break*
saying
this
*punct* ,
mr.
brownlow
looked
around
the
office
as
if
in
search
of
some
person
who
would
afford
him
the
required
information
*punct* .
*break*
said
mr.
fang
*punct* ,
throwing
the
paper
on
one
side
*punct* ,
what's
this
fellow
charged
with
*punct* ?
*break*
he's
not
charged
at
all
*punct* ,
your
worship
*punct* ,
replied
the
officer
*punct* .
*break*
he
appears
against
this
boy
*punct* ,
your
worship
*punct* .
*break*
his
worshp
knew
this
perfectly
well
*punct* ;
but
it
was
a
good
annoyance
*punct* ,
and
a
safe
one
*punct* .
*break*
appears
against
the
boy
*punct* ,
does
he
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mr.
fang
*punct* ,
surveying
mr.
brownlow
contemptuously
from
head
to
foot
*punct* .
*break*
before
i
am
sworn
*punct* ,
i
must
beg
to
say
one
word
*punct* ,
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ;
and
that
is
*punct* ,
that
i
really
never
*punct* ,
without
actual
experience
*punct* ,
could
have
believed
*punct* ,
hold
your
tongue
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
said
mr.
fang
*punct* ,
peremptorily
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
not
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
replied
the
old
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
hold
your
tongue
this
instant
*punct* ,
or
i'll
have
you
turned
out
of
the
office
*punct* !
*break*
said
mr.
fang
*punct* .
*break*
you're
an
insolent
impertinent
fellow
*punct* .
*break*
how
dare
you
bully
a
magistrate
*punct* !
*break*
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
reddening
*punct* .
*break*
swear
this
person
*punct* !
*break*
said
fang
to
the
clerk
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
not
hear
another
word
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
brownlow's
indignaton
was
greatly
roused
*punct* ;
but
reflecting
perhaps
*punct* ,
that
he
might
only
injure
the
boy
by
giving
vent
to
it
*punct* ,
he
suppressed
his
feelings
and
submitted
to
be
sworn
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
said
fang
*punct* ,
what's
the
charge
against
this
boy
*punct* ?
*break*
what
have
you
got
to
say
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
i
was
standing
at
a
bookstall
*punct* ,
mr.
brownlow
began
*punct* .
*break*
hold
your
tongue
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
mr.
fang
*punct* .
*break*
where's
the
policeman
*punct* ?
*break*
here
*punct* ,
swear
this
policeman
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
policeman
*punct* ,
what
is
this
*punct* ?
*break*
the
policeman
*punct* ,
with
becoming
humility
*punct* ,
related
how
he
had
taken
the
charge
*punct* ;
how
he
had
searched
oliver
*punct* ,
and
found
nothing
on
his
person
*punct* ;
and
how
that
was
all
he
knew
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
are
there
any
witnesses
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
mr.
fang
*punct* .
*break*
none
*punct* ,
your
worship
*punct* ,
replied
the
policeman
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
fang
sat
silent
for
some
minutes
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
turning
round
to
the
prosecutor
*punct* ,
said
in
a
towering
passion
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
mean
to
state
what
your
complaint
against
this
boy
is
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
or
do
you
not
*punct* ?
*break*
you
have
been
sworn
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
if
you
stand
there
*punct* ,
refusing
to
give
evidence
*punct* ,
i'll
punish
you
for
disrespect
to
the
bench
*punct* ;
i
will
*punct* ,
by
*punct* ,
by
what
*punct* ,
or
by
whom
*punct* ,
nobody
knows
*punct* ,
for
the
clerk
and
jailor
coughed
very
loud
*punct* ,
just
at
the
right
moment
*punct* ;
and
the
former
dropped
a
heavy
book
upon
the
floor
*punct* ,
thus
preventing
the
word
from
being
heard
*punct* ,
accidently
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* .
*break*
with
many
interruptions
*punct* ,
and
repeated
insults
*punct* ,
mr.
brownlow
contrived
to
state
his
case
*punct* ;
observing
that
*punct* ,
in
the
surprise
of
the
moment
*punct* ,
he
had
run
after
the
boy
because
he
had
saw
him
running
away
*punct* ;
and
expressing
his
hope
that
*punct* ,
if
the
magistrate
should
believe
him
*punct* ,
although
not
actually
the
thief
*punct* ,
to
be
connected
with
the
thieves
*punct* ,
he
would
deal
as
leniently
with
him
as
justice
would
allow
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
been
hurt
already
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gentleman
in
conclusion
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
fear
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* ,
with
great
energy
*punct* ,
looking
towards
the
bar
*punct* ,
i
really
fear
that
he
is
ill
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* !
*break*
said
mr.
fang
*punct* ,
with
a
sneer
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
none
of
your
tricks
here
*punct* ,
you
young
vagabond
*punct* ;
they
won't
do
*punct* .
*break*
what's
your
name
*punct* ?
*break*
oliver
tried
to
reply
but
his
tongue
failed
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
deadly
pale
*punct* ;
and
the
whole
place
seemed
turning
round
and
round
*punct* .
*break*
what's
your
name
*punct* ,
you
hardened
scoundrel
*punct* ?
*break*
demanded
mr.
fang
*punct* .
*break*
officer
*punct* ,
what's
his
name
*punct* ?
*break*
this
was
addressed
to
a
bluff
old
fellow
*punct* ,
in
a
striped
waistcoat
*punct* ,
who
was
standing
by
the
bar
*punct* .
*break*
he
bent
over
oliver
*punct* ,
and
repeated
the
inquiry
*punct* ;
but
finding
him
really
incapable
of
understanding
the
question
*punct* ;
and
knowing
that
his
not
replying
would
only
infuriate
the
magistrate
the
more
*punct* ,
and
add
to
the
severity
of
his
sentence
*punct* ;
he
hazarded
a
guess
*punct* .
*break*
he
says
his
name's
tom
white
*punct* ,
your
worship
*punct* ,
said
the
kind-hearted
thief-taker
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
he
won't
speak
out
*punct* ,
won't
he
*punct* ?
*break*
very
well
*punct* ,
very
well
*punct* .
*break*
where
does
he
live
*punct* ?
*break*
where
he
can
*punct* ,
your
worship
*punct* ,
replied
the
officer
*punct* ;
again
pretending
to
receive
oliver's
answer
*punct* .
*break*
has
he
any
parents
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
mr.
fang
*punct* .
*break*
he
says
they
died
in
his
infancy
*punct* ,
your
worship
*punct* ,
replied
the
officer
*punct* :
hazarding
the
usual
reply
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
point
of
the
inquiry
*punct* ,
oliver
raised
his
head
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
looking
round
with
imploring
eyes
*punct* ,
murmured
a
feeble
prayer
for
a
draught
of
water
*punct* .
*break*
stuff
and
nonsense
*punct* !
*break*
said
mr.
fang
*punct* :
don't
try
to
make
a
fool
of
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
he
really
is
ill
*punct* ,
your
worship
*punct* ,
remonstrated
the
officer
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
better
*punct* ,
said
mr.
fang
*punct* .
*break*
take
care
of
him
*punct* ,
officer
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
raising
his
hands
instinctively
*punct* ;
he'll
fall
down
*punct* .
*break*
stand
away
*punct* ,
officer
*punct* ,
cried
fang
*punct* ;
let
him
*punct* ,
if
he
likes
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
availed
himself
of
the
kind
permission
*punct* ,
and
fell
to
the
floor
in
a
fainting
fit
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
in
the
office
looked
at
each
other
*punct* ,
but
no
one
dared
to
stir
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
he
was
shamming
*punct* ,
said
fang
*punct* ,
as
if
this
were
incontestable
proof
of
the
fact
*punct* .
*break*
let
him
lie
there
*punct* ;
he'll
soon
be
tired
of
that
*punct* .
*break*
how
do
you
propose
to
deal
with
the
case
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
the
clerk
in
a
low
voice
*punct* .
*break*
summarily
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
fang
*punct* .
*break*
he
stands
committed
for
three
months
*punct* ,
hard
labour
of
course
*punct* .
*break*
clear
the
office
*punct* .
*break*
the
door
was
opened
for
this
purpose
*punct* ,
and
a
couple
of
men
were
preparing
to
carry
the
insensible
boy
to
his
cell
*punct* ;
when
an
elderly
man
of
decent
but
poor
appearance
*punct* ,
clad
in
an
old
suit
of
black
*punct* ,
rushed
hastily
into
the
office
*punct* ,
and
advanced
towards
the
bench
*punct* .
*break*
stop
*punct* ,
stop
*punct* !
*break*
don't
take
him
away
*punct* !
*break*
for
heaven's
sake
stop
a
moment
*punct* !
*break*
cried
the
new
comer
*punct* ,
breathless
with
haste
*punct* .
*break*
although
the
presiding
genii
in
such
an
office
as
this
*punct* ,
exercise
a
summary
and
arbitrary
power
over
the
liberties
*punct* ,
the
good
name
*punct* ,
the
character
*punct* ,
almost
the
lives
*punct* ,
of
her
majesty's
subjects
*punct* ,
expecially
of
the
poorer
class
*punct* ;
and
although
*punct* ,
within
such
walls
*punct* ,
enough
fantastic
tricks
are
daily
played
to
make
the
angels
blind
with
weeping
*punct* ;
they
are
closed
to
the
public
*punct* ,
save
through
the
medium
of
the
daily
press.

*punct* :
or
were
virtually

*punct* ,
mr.
fang
was
consequently
not
a
little
indignant
to
see
an
unbidden
guest
enter
in
such
irreverent
disorder
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
this
*punct* ?
*break*
who
is
this
*punct* ?
*break*
turn
this
man
out
*punct* .
*break*
clear
the
office
*punct* !
*break*
cried
mr.
fang
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
speak
*punct* ,
cried
the
man
*punct* ;
i
will
not
be
turned
out
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
it
all
*punct* .
*break*
i
keep
the
book-stall
*punct* .
*break*
i
demand
to
be
sworn
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
not
be
put
down
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
fang
*punct* ,
you
must
hear
me
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
not
refuse
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
was
right
*punct* .
*break*
his
manner
was
determined
*punct* ;
and
the
matter
was
growing
rather
too
serious
to
be
hushed
up
*punct* .
*break*
swear
the
man
*punct* ,
growled
mr.
fang
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
very
ill
grace
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
what
have
you
got
to
say
*punct* ?
*break*
this
*punct* ,
said
the
man
*punct* :
i
saw
three
boys
*punct* :
two
others
and
the
prisoner
here
*punct* :
loitering
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
*punct* ,
when
this
gentleman
was
reading
*punct* .
*break*
the
robbery
was
committed
by
another
boy
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
it
done
*punct* ;
and
i
saw
that
this
boy
was
perfectly
amazed
and
stupified
by
it
*punct* .
*break*
having
by
this
time
recovered
a
little
breath
*punct* ,
the
worthy
book-stall
keeper
proceeded
to
relate
*punct* ,
in
a
more
coherent
manner
the
exact
circumstances
of
the
robbery
*punct* .
*break*
why
didn't
you
come
here
before
*punct* ?
*break*
said
fang
*punct* ,
after
a
pause
*punct* .
*break*
i
hadn't
a
soul
to
mind
the
shop
*punct* ,
replied
the
man
*punct* .
*break*
everybody
who
could
have
helped
me
*punct* ,
had
joined
in
the
pursuit
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
get
nobody
till
five
minutes
ago
*punct* ;
and
i've
run
here
all
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
the
prosecutor
was
reading
*punct* ,
was
he
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
fang
*punct* ,
after
another
pause
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
replied
the
man
*punct* .
*break*
the
very
book
he
has
in
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
that
book
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
is
it
paid
for
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
it
is
not
*punct* ,
replied
the
man
*punct* ,
with
a
smile
*punct* .
*break*
dear
me
*punct* ,
i
forgot
all
about
it
*punct* !
*break*
exclaimed
the
absent
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
innocently
*punct* .
*break*
a
nice
person
to
prefer
a
charge
against
a
poor
boy
*punct* !
*break*
said
fang
*punct* ,
with
a
comical
effort
to
look
humane
*punct* .
*break*
i
consider
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
that
you
have
obtained
possession
of
that
book
*punct* ,
under
very
suspicious
and
disreputable
circumstances
*punct* ;
and
you
may
think
yourself
very
fortunate
that
the
owner
of
the
property
declines
to
prosecute
*punct* .
*break*
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
*punct* ,
my
man
*punct* ,
or
the
law
will
overtake
you
yet
*punct* .
*break*
the
boy
is
discharged
*punct* .
*break*
clear
the
office
*punct* !
*break*
i'll
*punct* ,
clear
the
office
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
magistrate
*punct* .
*break*
officers
*punct* ,
do
you
hear
*punct* ?
*break*
clear
the
office
*punct* !
*break*
the
mandate
was
obeyed
*punct* ;
and
the
indignant
mr.
brownlow
was
conveyed
out
*punct* ,
with
the
book
in
one
hand
*punct* ,
and
the
bamboo
cane
in
the
other
*punct* :
in
a
perfect
phrenzy
of
rage
and
defiance
*punct* .
*break*
he
reached
the
yard
*punct* ;
and
his
passion
vanished
in
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
little
oliver
twist
lay
on
his
back
on
the
pavement
*punct* ,
with
his
shirt
unbuttoned
*punct* ,
and
his
temples
bathed
with
water
*punct* ;
his
face
a
deadly
white
*punct* ;
and
a
cold
tremble
convulsing
his
whole
frame
*punct* .
*break*
poor
boy
*punct* ,
poor
boy
*punct* !
*break*
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
bending
over
him
*punct* .
*break*
call
a
coach
*punct* ,
somebody
*punct* ,
pray
*punct* .
*break*
a
coach
was
obtained
*punct* ,
and
oliver
having
been
carefully
laid
on
the
seat
*punct* ,
the
old
gentleman
got
in
and
sat
himself
on
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
may
i
accompany
you
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
book-stall
keeper
*punct* ,
looking
in
*punct* .
*break*
bless
me
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
said
mr.
brownlow
quickly
*punct* .
*break*
i
forgot
you
*punct* .
*break*
dear
*punct* ,
dear
*punct* !
*break*
i
have
this
unhappy
book
still
*punct* !
*break*
there's
no
time
to
lose
*punct* .
*break*
the
book-stall
keeper
got
into
the
coach
*punct* ;
and
away
they
drove
*punct* .
*break*
the
coach
rattled
away
*punct* ,
over
nearly
the
same
ground
as
that
which
oliver
had
traversed
when
he
first
entered
london
in
company
with
the
dodger
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
turning
a
different
way
when
it
reached
the
angel
at
islington
*punct* ,
stopped
at
length
before
a
neat
house
*punct* ,
in
a
quiet
shady
street
near
pentonville
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
a
bed
was
prepared
*punct* ,
without
loss
of
time
*punct* ,
in
which
mr.
brownlow
saw
his
young
charge
carefully
and
comfortably
deposited
*punct* ;
and
here
*punct* ,
he
was
tended
with
a
kindness
and
solicitude
that
knew
no
bounds
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
for
many
days
*punct* ,
oliver
remained
insensible
to
all
the
goodness
of
his
new
friends
*punct* .
*break*
the
sun
rose
and
sank
*punct* ,
and
rose
and
sank
again
*punct* ,
and
many
times
after
that
*punct* ;
and
still
the
boy
lay
stretched
on
his
uneasy
bed
*punct* ,
dwindling
away
beneath
the
dry
and
wasting
heat
of
fever
*punct* .
*break*
the
worm
does
not
work
more
surely
on
the
dead
body
*punct* ,
than
does
this
slow
creeping
fire
upon
the
living
frame
*punct* .
*break*
weak
*punct* ,
and
thin
*punct* ,
and
pallid
*punct* ,
he
awoke
at
last
from
what
seemed
to
have
been
a
long
and
troubled
dream
*punct* .
*break*
feebly
raising
himself
in
the
bed
*punct* ,
with
his
head
resting
on
his
trembling
arm
*punct* ,
he
looked
anxiously
around
*punct* .
*break*
what
room
is
this
*punct* ?
*break*
where
have
i
been
brought
to
*punct* ?
*break*
this
is
not
the
place
i
went
to
sleep
in
*punct* .
*break*
he
uttered
these
words
in
a
feeble
voice
*punct* ,
being
very
faint
and
weak
*punct* ;
but
they
were
overheard
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
the
curtain
at
the
bed's
head
was
hastily
drawn
back
*punct* ,
and
a
motherly
old
lady
*punct* ,
very
neatly
and
precisely
dressed
*punct* ,
rose
as
she
undrew
it
*punct* ,
from
an
arm-chair
close
by
*punct* ,
in
which
she
had
been
sitting
at
needle-work
*punct* .
*break*
hush
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
the
old
lady
softly
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
be
very
quiet
*punct* ,
or
you
will
be
ill
again
*punct* ;
and
you
have
been
very
bad,
*punct* ,
as
bad
as
bad
could
be
*punct* ,
pretty
nigh
*punct* .
*break*
lie
down
again
*punct* ;
there's
a
dear
*punct* !
*break*
with
those
words
*punct* ,
the
old
lady
very
gently
placed
oliver's
head
upon
the
pillow
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
smoothing
back
his
hair
from
his
forehead
*punct* ,
looked
so
kindly
and
loving
in
his
face
*punct* ,
that
he
could
not
help
placing
his
little
withered
hand
in
hers
*punct* ,
and
drawing
it
round
his
neck
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
old
lady
*punct* ,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
grateful
little
dear
it
is
*punct* .
*break*
what
would
his
mother
feel
if
she
had
sat
by
him
as
i
have
*punct* ,
and
could
see
him
now
*punct* !
*break*
perhaps
she
does
see
me
*punct* ,
whispered
oliver
*punct* ,
folding
his
hands
together
*punct* ;
perhaps
she
has
sat
by
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
almost
feel
as
if
she
had
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
the
fever
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
the
old
lady
mildly
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
it
was
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* ,
because
heaven
is
a
long
way
off
*punct* ;
and
they
are
too
happy
there
*punct* ,
to
come
down
to
the
bedside
of
a
poor
boy
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
she
knew
i
was
ill
*punct* ,
she
must
have
pitied
me
*punct* ,
even
there
*punct* ;
for
she
was
very
ill
herself
before
she
died
*punct* .
*break*
she
can't
know
anything
about
me
though
*punct* ,
added
oliver
after
a
moment's
silence
*punct* .
*break*
if
she
had
seen
me
hurt
*punct* ,
it
would
have
made
here
sorrowful
*punct* ;
and
her
face
has
always
looked
sweet
and
happy
*punct* ,
when
i
have
dreamed
of
her
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
lady
made
no
reply
to
this
*punct* ;
but
wiping
her
eyes
first
*punct* ,
and
her
spectacles
*punct* ,
which
lay
on
the
counterpane
*punct* ,
afterwards
*punct* ,
as
if
they
were
part
and
parcel
of
those
features
*punct* ,
brought
some
cool
stuff
for
oliver
to
drink
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
patting
him
on
the
cheek
*punct* ,
told
him
he
must
lie
very
quiet
*punct* ,
or
he
would
be
ill
again
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
oliver
kept
very
still
*punct* ;
partly
because
he
was
anxious
to
obey
the
kind
old
lady
in
all
things
*punct* ;
and
partly
*punct* ,
to
tell
the
truth
*punct* ,
because
he
was
completely
exhausted
with
what
he
had
already
said
*punct* .
*break*
he
soon
fell
into
a
gentle
doze
*punct* ,
from
which
he
was
awakened
by
the
light
of
a
candle
*punct* :
which
*punct* ,
being
brought
near
the
bed
*punct* ,
showed
him
a
gentleman
with
a
very
large
and
loud-ticking
gold
watch
in
his
hand
*punct* ,
who
felt
his
pulse
*punct* ,
and
said
he
was
a
great
deal
better
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
a
great
deal
better
*punct* ,
are
you
not
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
thank
you
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
know
you
are
*punct* ,
said
the
gentleman
*punct* :
you're
hungry
too
*punct* ,
an't
you
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
answered
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
know
you're
not
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
not
hungry
*punct* ,
mrs.
bedwin
*punct* ,
said
the
gentleman
*punct* :
looking
very
wise
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
lady
made
a
respectful
inclination
of
the
head
*punct* ,
which
seemed
to
say
that
she
thought
the
doctor
was
a
very
clever
man
*punct* .
*break*
the
doctor
appeared
much
of
the
same
opinion
himself
*punct* .
*break*
you
feel
sleepy
*punct* ,
don't
you
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
doctor
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
said
the
doctor
*punct* ,
with
a
very
shrewd
and
satisfied
look
*punct* .
*break*
you're
not
sleepy
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
rather
thirsty
*punct* ,
answered
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
just
as
i
expected
*punct* ,
mrs.
bedwin
*punct* ,
said
the
doctor
*punct* .
*break*
it's
very
natu
ral
that
he
should
be
thirsty
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
give
him
a
little
tea
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ,
and
some
dry
toast
without
any
butter
*punct* .
*break*
don't
keep
him
too
warm
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ;
but
be
careful
that
you
don't
let
him
be
too
cold
*punct* ;
will
you
have
the
goodness
*punct* ?
*break*
the
old
lady
dropped
a
curtsey
*punct* .
*break*
the
doctor
*punct* ,
after
tasting
the
cool
stuff
*punct* ,
and
expressing
a
qualified
approval
of
it
*punct* ,
hurried
away
*punct* :
his
boots
creaking
in
a
very
important
and
wealthy
manner
as
he
went
downstairs
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
dozed
off
again
*punct* ,
soon
after
this
*punct* ;
when
he
awoke
*punct* ,
it
was
nearly
twelve
o'clock
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
lady
tenderly
bade
him
good-night
shortly
afterwards
*punct* ,
and
left
him
in
charge
of
a
fat
old
woman
who
had
just
come
*punct* :
bringing
with
her
*punct* ,
in
a
little
bundle
*punct* ,
a
small
prayer
book
and
a
large
nightcap
*punct* .
*break*
putting
the
latter
on
her
head
and
the
former
on
the
table
*punct* ,
the
old
woman
*punct* ,
after
telling
oliver
that
she
had
come
to
sit
up
with
him
*punct* ,
drew
her
chair
close
to
the
fire
and
went
off
into
a
series
of
short
naps
*punct* ,
chequered
at
frequent
intervals
with
sundry
tumblings
forward
*punct* ,
and
divers
moans
and
chokings
*punct* .
*break*
these
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
had
no
worse
effect
than
causing
her
to
rub
her
nose
very
hard
*punct* ,
and
then
fall
asleep
again
*punct* .
*break*
and
thus
the
night
crept
slowly
on
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
lay
awake
for
some
time
*punct* ,
counting
the
little
circles
of
light
which
the
reflection
of
the
rushlight-shade
threw
upon
the
ceiling
*punct* ;
or
tracing
with
his
languid
eyes
the
intricate
pattern
of
the
paper
on
the
wall
*punct* .
*break*
the
darkness
and
the
deep
stillness
of
the
room
were
very
solemn
*punct* ;
as
they
brought
into
the
boy's
mind
the
thought
that
death
had
been
hovering
there
*punct* ,
for
many
days
and
nights
*punct* ,
and
might
yet
fill
it
with
the
gloom
and
dread
of
his
awful
presence
*punct* ,
he
turned
his
face
upon
the
pillow
*punct* ,
and
fervently
prayed
to
heaven
*punct* .
*break*
gradually
*punct* ,
he
fell
into
that
deep
tranquil
sleep
which
ease
from
recent
suffering
alone
imparts
*punct* ;
that
calm
and
peaceful
rest
which
it
is
pain
to
wake
from
*punct* .
*break*
who
*punct* ,
if
this
were
death
*punct* ,
would
be
roused
again
to
all
the
struggles
and
turmoils
of
life
*punct* ;
to
all
its
cares
for
the
present
*punct* ;
its
anxieties
for
the
future
*punct* ;
more
than
all
*punct* ,
its
weary
recollections
of
the
past
*punct* !
*break*
it
had
been
bright
day
*punct* ,
for
hours
*punct* ,
when
oliver
opened
his
eyes
*punct* ;
he
felt
cheerful
and
happy
*punct* .
*break*
the
crisis
of
the
disease
was
safely
past
*punct* .
*break*
he
belonged
to
the
world
again
*punct* .
*break*
in
three
days
time
he
was
able
to
sit
in
an
easy-chair
*punct* ,
well
propped
up
with
pillows
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
as
he
was
still
too
weak
to
walk
*punct* ,
mrs.
bedwin
had
him
carried
downstairs
into
the
little
housekeeper's
room
*punct* ,
which
belonged
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
having
him
set
*punct* ,
here
*punct* ,
by
the
fire-side
*punct* ,
the
good
old
lady
sat
herself
down
too
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
being
in
a
state
of
considerable
delight
at
seeing
him
so
much
better
*punct* ,
forthwith
began
to
cry
most
violently
*punct* .
*break*
never
mind
me
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
the
old
lady
*punct* ;
i'm
only
having
a
regular
good
cry
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ;
it's
all
over
now
*punct* ;
and
i'm
quite
comfortable
*punct* .
*break*
you're
very
*punct* ,
very
kind
to
me
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ,
said
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
never
you
mind
that
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
the
old
lady
*punct* ;
that's
got
nothing
to
do
with
your
broth
*punct* ;
and
it's
full
time
you
had
it
*punct* ;
for
the
doctor
says
mr.
brownlow
may
come
in
to
see
you
this
morning
*punct* ;
and
we
must
get
up
our
best
looks
*punct* ,
because
the
better
we
look
*punct* ,
the
more
he'll
be
pleased
*punct* .
*break*
and
with
this
*punct* ,
the
old
lady
applied
herself
to
warming
up
*punct* ,
in
a
little
saucepan
*punct* ,
a
basin
full
of
broth
*punct* :
strong
enough
*punct* ,
oliver
thought
*punct* ,
to
furnish
an
ample
dinner
*punct* ,
when
reduced
to
the
regulation
strength
*punct* ,
for
three
hundred
and
fifty
paupers
*punct* ,
at
the
lowest
computation
*punct* .
*break*
are
you
fond
of
pictures
*punct* ,
dear
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
the
old
lady
*punct* ,
seeing
that
oliver
had
fixed
his
eyes
*punct* ,
most
intently
*punct* ,
on
a
portrait
which
hung
against
the
wall
*punct* ;
just
opposite
his
chair
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
quite
know
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ,
said
oliver
*punct* ,
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
canvas
*punct* ;
i
have
seen
so
few
that
i
hardly
know
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
beautiful
*punct* ,
mild
face
that
lady's
is
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
old
lady
*punct* ,
painters
always
make
ladies
out
prettier
than
they
are
*punct* ,
or
they
wouldn't
get
any
custom
*punct* ,
child
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
that
invented
the
machine
for
taking
likenesses
might
have
known
that
would
never
succeed
*punct* ;
it's
a
deal
too
honest
*punct* .
*break*
a
deal
*punct* ,
said
the
old
lady
*punct* ,
laughing
very
heartily
at
her
own
acuteness
*punct* .
*break*
is
*punct* ,
is
that
a
likeness
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
the
old
lady
*punct* ,
looking
up
for
a
moment
from
the
broth
*punct* ;
that's
a
portrait
*punct* .
*break*
whose
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
really
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
i
don't
know
*punct* ,
answered
the
old
lady
in
a
good-humoured
manner
*punct* .
*break*
it's
not
a
likeness
of
anybody
that
you
or
i
know
*punct* ,
i
expect
*punct* .
*break*
it
seems
to
strike
your
fancy
*punct* ,
dear
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
so
pretty
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
sure
you're
not
afraid
of
it
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
old
lady
*punct* :
observing
in
great
surprise
*punct* ,
the
look
of
awe
with
which
the
child
regarded
the
painting
*punct* .
*break*
oh
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
returned
oliver
quickly
*punct* ;
but
the
eyes
look
so
sorrowful
*punct* ;
and
where
i
sit
*punct* ,
they
seem
fixed
upon
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
makes
my
heart
beat
*punct* ,
added
oliver
in
a
low
voice
*punct* ,
as
if
it
was
alive
*punct* ,
and
wanted
to
speak
to
me
*punct* ,
but
couldn't
*punct* .
*break*
lord
save
us
*punct* !
*break*
exclaimed
the
old
lady
*punct* ,
starting
*punct* ;
don't
talk
in
that
way
*punct* ,
child
*punct* .
*break*
you're
weak
and
nervous
after
your
illness
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
wheel
your
chair
round
to
the
other
side
*punct* ;
and
then
you
won't
see
it
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
old
lady
*punct* ,
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
*punct* ;
you
don't
see
it
now
*punct* ,
at
all
events
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
did
see
it
in
his
mind's
eye
as
distinctly
as
if
he
had
not
altered
his
position
*punct* ;
but
he
thought
it
better
not
to
worry
the
kind
old
lady
*punct* ;
so
he
smiled
gently
when
she
looked
at
him
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
bedwin
*punct* ,
satisfied
that
he
felt
more
comfortable
*punct* ,
salted
and
broke
bits
of
toasted
bread
into
the
broth
*punct* ,
with
all
the
bustle
befitting
so
solemn
a
preparation
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
got
through
it
with
extraordinary
expedition
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
scarcely
swallowed
the
last
spoonful
*punct* ,
when
there
came
a
soft
rap
at
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
come
in
*punct* ,
said
the
old
lady
*punct* ;
and
in
walked
mr.
brownlow
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
the
old
gentleman
came
in
as
brisk
as
need
be
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
he
had
no
sooner
raised
his
spectacles
on
his
forehead
*punct* ,
and
thrust
his
hands
behind
the
skirts
of
his
dressing-gown
to
take
a
good
long
look
at
oliver
*punct* ,
than
his
countenance
underwent
a
very
great
variety
of
odd
contortions
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
looked
very
worn
and
shadowy
from
sickness
*punct* ,
and
made
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
stand
up
*punct* ,
out
of
respect
to
his
benefactor
*punct* ,
which
terminated
in
his
sinking
back
into
the
chair
again
*punct* ;
and
the
fact
is
*punct* ,
if
the
truth
must
be
told
*punct* ,
that
mr.
brownlow's
heart
*punct* ,
being
large
enough
for
any
six
ordinary
old
gentlemen
of
humane
disposition
*punct* ,
forced
a
supply
of
tears
into
his
eyes
*punct* ,
by
some
hydraulic
process
which
we
are
not
sufficiently
philosophical
to
be
in
a
condition
to
explain
*punct* .
*break*
poor
boy
*punct* ,
poor
boy
*punct* !
*break*
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
clearing
his
throat
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
rather
hoarse
this
morning
*punct* ,
mrs.
bedwin
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
afraid
i
have
caught
cold
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
not
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
bedwin
*punct* .
*break*
everything
you
have
had
*punct* ,
has
been
well
aired
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
*punct* ,
bedwin
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
*punct* ,
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ;
i
rather
think
i
had
a
damp
napkin
at
dinner-time
yesterday
*punct* ;
but
never
mind
that
*punct* .
*break*
how
do
you
feel
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ?
*break*
very
happy
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
and
very
grateful
indeed
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
for
your
goodness
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
good
by
*punct* ,
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
stoutly
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
given
him
any
nourishment
*punct* ,
bedwin
*punct* ?
*break*
any
slops
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
he
has
just
had
a
basin
of
beautiful
strong
broth
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
mrs.
bedwin
*punct* :
drawing
herself
up
slightly
*punct* ,
and
laying
strong
emphasis
on
the
last
word
*punct* :
to
intimate
that
between
slops
*punct* ,
and
broth
will
compounded
*punct* ,
there
existed
no
affinity
or
connection
whatsoever
*punct* .
*break*
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
with
a
slight
shudder
*punct* ;
a
couple
of
glasses
of
port
wine
would
have
done
him
a
great
deal
more
good
*punct* .
*break*
wouldn't
they
*punct* ,
tom
white
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
my
name
is
oliver
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
the
little
invalid
*punct* :
with
a
look
of
great
astonishment
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
*punct* ,
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ;
oliver
what
*punct* ?
*break*
oliver
white
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
twist
*punct* ,
oliver
twist
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
what
made
you
tell
the
magistrate
your
name
was
white
*punct* ?
*break*
i
never
told
him
so
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
returned
oliver
in
amazement
*punct* .
*break*
this
sounded
so
like
a
falsehood
*punct* ,
that
the
old
gentleman
looked
somewhat
sternly
in
oliver's
face
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
impossible
to
doubt
him
*punct* ;
there
was
truth
in
every
one
of
its
thin
and
sharpened
lineaments
*punct* .
*break*
some
mistake
*punct* ,
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
although
his
motive
for
looking
steadily
at
oliver
no
longer
existed
*punct* ,
the
old
idea
of
the
resemblance
between
his
features
and
some
familiar
face
came
upon
him
so
strongly
*punct* ,
that
he
could
not
withdraw
his
gaze
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
you
are
not
angry
with
me
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
said
oliver
*punct* ,
raising
his
eyes
beseechingly
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
replied
the
old
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
bedwin
*punct* ,
look
there
*punct* !
*break*
as
he
spoke
*punct* ,
he
pointed
hastily
to
the
picture
over
oliver's
head
*punct* ,
and
then
to
the
boy's
face
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
its
living
copy
*punct* .
*break*
the
eyes
*punct* ,
the
head
*punct* ,
the
mouth
*punct* ;
every
feature
was
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
the
expression
was
*punct* ,
for
the
instant
*punct* ,
so
precisely
alike
*punct* ,
that
the
minutest
line
seemed
copied
with
startling
accuracy
*punct* !
*break*
oliver
knew
not
the
cause
of
this
sudden
exclamation
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
not
being
strong
enough
to
bear
the
start
it
gave
him
*punct* ,
he
fainted
away
*punct* .
*break*
a
weakness
on
his
part
*punct* ,
which
affords
the
narrative
an
opportunity
of
relieving
the
reader
from
suspense
*punct* ,
in
behalf
of
the
two
young
pupils
of
the
merry
old
gentleman
*punct* ;
and
of
recording
*punct* ,
that
when
the
dodger
*punct* ,
and
his
accomplished
friend
master
bates
*punct* ,
joined
in
the
hue-and-cry
which
was
raised
at
oliver's
heels
*punct* ,
in
consequence
of
their
executing
an
illegal
conveyance
of
mr.
brownlow's
personal
property
*punct* ,
as
has
been
already
described
*punct* ,
they
were
actuated
by
a
very
laudable
and
becoming
regard
for
themselves
*punct* ;
and
forasmuch
as
the
freedom
of
the
subject
and
the
liberty
of
the
individual
are
among
the
first
and
proudest
boasts
of
a
true-hearted
englishman
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ,
i
need
hardly
beg
the
reader
to
observe
*punct* ,
that
this
action
should
tend
to
exalt
them
in
the
opinion
of
all
public
and
patriotic
men
*punct* ,
in
almost
as
great
a
degree
as
this
strong
proof
of
their
anxiety
for
their
own
preservation
and
safety
goes
to
corroborate
and
confirm
the
little
code
of
laws
which
certain
profound
and
sound-judging
philosophers
have
laid
down
as
the
main-springs
of
all
nature's
deeds
and
actions
*punct* :
the
said
philosophers
very
wisely
reducing
the
good
lady's
proceedings
to
matters
of
maxim
and
theory
*punct* :
and
*punct* ,
by
a
very
neat
and
pretty
compliment
to
her
exalted
wisdom
and
understanding
*punct* ,
putting
entirely
out
of
sight
any
considerations
of
heart
*punct* ,
or
generous
impulse
and
feeling
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
these
are
matters
totally
beneath
a
female
who
is
acknowledged
by
universal
admission
to
be
far
above
the
numerous
little
foibles
and
weaknesses
of
her
sex
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
wanted
any
further
proof
of
the
strictly
philosophical
nature
of
the
conduct
of
these
young
gentlemen
in
their
very
delicate
predicament
*punct* ,
i
should
at
once
find
it
in
the
fact
*punct* ,
also
recorded
in
a
foregoing
part
of
this
narrative
*punct* ,
of
their
quitting
the
pursuit
*punct* ,
when
the
general
attention
was
fixed
upon
oliver
*punct* ;
and
making
immediately
for
their
home
by
the
shortest
possible
cut
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
to
do
a
great
right
*punct* ,
you
may
do
a
little
wrong
*punct* ;
and
you
may
take
any
means
which
the
end
to
be
attained
*punct* ,
will
justify
*punct* ;
the
amount
of
the
right
*punct* ,
or
the
amount
of
the
wrong
*punct* ,
or
indeed
the
distinction
between
the
two
*punct* ,
being
left
entirely
to
the
philosopher
concerned
*punct* ,
to
be
settled
and
determined
by
his
clear
*punct* ,
comprehensive
*punct* ,
and
impartial
view
of
his
own
particular
case
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
until
the
two
boys
had
scoured
*punct* ,
with
great
rapidity
*punct* ,
through
a
most
intricate
maze
of
narrow
streets
and
courts
*punct* ,
that
they
ventured
to
halt
beneath
a
low
and
dark
archway
*punct* .
*break*
having
remained
silent
here
*punct* ,
just
long
enough
to
recover
breath
to
speak
*punct* ,
master
bates
uttered
an
exclamation
of
amusement
and
delight
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
bursting
into
an
uncontrollable
fit
of
laughter
*punct* ,
flung
himself
upon
a
doorstep
*punct* ,
and
rolled
thereon
in
a
transport
of
mirth
*punct* .
*break*
what's
the
matter
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
the
dodger
*punct* .
*break*
roared
charley
bates
*punct* .
*break*
hold
your
noise
*punct* ,
remonstrated
the
dodger
*punct* ,
looking
cautiously
round
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
want
to
be
grabbed
*punct* ,
stupid
*punct* ?
*break*
i
can't
help
it
*punct* ,
said
charley
*punct* ,
i
can't
help
it
*punct* !
*break*
to
see
him
splitting
away
at
that
pace
*punct* ,
and
cutting
round
the
corners
*punct* ,
and
knocking
up
again
the
posts
*punct* ,
and
starting
on
again
as
if
he
was
made
of
iron
as
well
as
them
*punct* ,
and
me
with
the
wipe
in
my
pocket
*punct* ,
singing
out
arter
him
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
my
eye
*punct* !
*break*
the
vivid
imagination
of
master
bates
presented
the
scene
before
him
in
too
strong
colours
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
arrived
at
this
apostrophe
*punct* ,
he
again
rolled
upon
the
door-step
*punct* ,
and
laughed
louder
than
before
*punct* .
*break*
what'll
fagin
say
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
the
dodger
*punct* ;
taking
advantage
of
the
next
interval
of
breathlessness
on
the
part
of
his
friend
to
propound
the
question
*punct* .
*break*
repeated
charley
bates
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
what
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
dodger
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
what
should
he
say
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
charley
*punct* :
stopping
rather
suddenly
in
his
merriment
*punct* ;
for
the
dodger's
manner
was
impressive
*punct* .
*break*
what
should
he
say
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
dawkins
whistled
for
a
couple
of
minutes
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
taking
off
his
hat
*punct* ,
scratched
his
head
*punct* ,
and
nodded
thrice
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
toor
rul
lol
loo
*punct* ,
gammon
and
spinnage
*punct* ,
the
frog
he
wouldn't
*punct* ,
and
high
cockolorum
*punct* ,
said
the
dodger
*punct* :
with
a
slight
sneer
on
his
intellectual
countenance
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
explanatory
*punct* ,
but
not
satisfactory
*punct* .
*break*
master
bates
felt
it
so
*punct* ;
and
again
said
*punct* ,
what
do
you
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
the
dodger
made
no
reply
*punct* ;
but
putting
his
hat
on
again
*punct* ,
and
gathering
the
skirts
of
his
long-tailed
coat
under
his
arm
*punct* ,
thrust
his
tongue
into
his
cheek
*punct* ,
slapped
the
bridge
of
his
nose
some
half-dozen
times
in
a
familiar
but
expressive
manner
*punct* ,
and
turning
on
his
heel
*punct* ,
slunk
down
the
court
*punct* .
*break*
master
bates
followed
*punct* ,
with
a
thoughtful
countenance
*punct* .
*break*
the
noise
of
footsteps
on
the
creaking
stairs
*punct* ,
a
few
minutes
after
the
occurrence
of
this
conversation
*punct* ,
roused
the
merry
old
gentleman
as
he
sat
over
the
fire
with
a
saveloy
and
a
small
loaf
in
his
hand
*punct* ;
a
pocket-knife
in
his
right
*punct* ;
and
a
pewter
pot
on
the
trivet
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
rascally
smile
on
his
white
face
as
he
turned
round
*punct* ,
and
looking
sharply
out
from
under
his
thick
red
eyebrows
*punct* ,
bent
his
ear
towards
the
door
*punct* ,
and
listened
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
how's
this
*punct* ?
*break*
muttered
the
jew
*punct* :
changing
countenance
*punct* ;
only
two
of
em
*punct* ?
*break*
where's
the
third
*punct* ?
*break*
they
can't
have
got
into
trouble
*punct* .
*break*
the
footsteps
approached
nearer
*punct* ;
they
reached
the
landing
*punct* .
*break*
the
door
was
slowly
opened
*punct* ;
and
the
dodger
and
charley
bates
entered
*punct* ,
closing
it
behind
them
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
rising
with
a
menacing
look
*punct* .
*break*
where's
the
boy
*punct* ?
*break*
the
young
thieves
eyed
their
preceptor
as
if
they
were
alarmed
at
his
violence
*punct* ;
and
looked
uneasily
at
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
but
they
made
no
reply
*punct* .
*break*
what's
become
of
the
boy
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
seizing
the
dodger
tightly
by
the
collar
*punct* ,
and
threatening
him
with
horrid
imprecations
*punct* .
*break*
speak
out
*punct* ,
or
i'll
throttle
you
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
fagin
looked
so
very
much
in
earnest
*punct* ,
that
charley
bates
*punct* ,
who
deemed
it
prudent
in
all
cases
to
be
on
the
safe
side
*punct* ,
and
who
conceived
it
by
no
means
improbable
that
it
might
be
his
turn
to
be
throttled
second
*punct* ,
dropped
upon
his
knees
*punct* ,
and
raised
a
loud
*punct* ,
well-sustained
*punct* ,
and
continuous
roar
*punct* ,
something
between
a
mad
bull
and
a
speaking
trumpet
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
speak
*punct* ?
*break*
thundered
the
jew
*punct* :
shaking
the
dodger
so
much
that
his
keeping
in
the
big
coat
at
all
*punct* ,
seemed
perfectly
miraculous
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
the
traps
have
got
him
*punct* ,
and
that's
all
about
it
*punct* ,
said
the
dodger
*punct* ,
sullenly
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
let
go
o
me
*punct* ,
will
you
*punct* !
*break*
and
*punct* ,
swinging
himself
*punct* ,
at
one
jerk
*punct* ,
clean
out
of
the
big
coat
*punct* ,
which
he
left
in
the
jew's
hands
*punct* ,
the
dodger
snatched
up
the
toasting
fork
*punct* ,
and
made
a
pass
at
the
merry
old
gentleman's
waistcoat
*punct* ;
which
*punct* ,
if
it
had
taken
effect
*punct* ,
would
have
let
a
little
more
merriment
out
*punct* ,
than
could
have
been
easily
replaced
*punct* .
*break*
the
jew
stepped
back
in
this
emergency
*punct* ,
with
more
agility
than
could
have
been
anticipated
in
a
man
of
his
apparent
decrepitude
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
seizing
up
the
pot
*punct* ,
prepared
to
hurl
it
at
his
assailant's
head
*punct* .
*break*
but
charley
bates
*punct* ,
at
this
moment
*punct* ,
calling
his
attention
by
a
perfectly
terrific
howl
*punct* ,
he
suddenly
altered
its
destination
*punct* ,
and
flung
it
full
at
that
young
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
what
the
blazes
is
in
the
wind
now
*punct* !
*break*
growled
a
deep
voice
*punct* .
*break*
who
pitched
that
ere
at
me
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
well
it's
the
beer
*punct* ,
and
not
the
pot
*punct* ,
as
hit
me
*punct* ,
or
i'd
have
settled
somebody
*punct* .
*break*
i
might
have
know'd
*punct* ,
as
nobody
but
an
infernal
*punct* ,
rich
*punct* ,
plundering
*punct* ,
thundering
old
jew
could
afford
to
throw
away
any
drink
but
water
*punct* ,
and
not
that
*punct* ,
unless
he
done
the
river
company
every
quarter
*punct* .
*break*
wot's
it
all
about
*punct* ,
fagin
*punct* ?
*break*
come
in
*punct* ,
you
sneaking
warmint
*punct* ;
wot
are
you
stopping
outside
for
*punct* ,
as
if
you
was
ashamed
of
your
master
*punct* !
*break*
the
man
who
growled
out
these
words
*punct* ,
was
a
stoutly-built
fellow
of
about
five-and-thirty
*punct* ,
in
a
black
velveteen
coat
*punct* ,
very
soiled
drab
breeches
*punct* ,
lace-up
half
boots
*punct* ,
and
grey
cotton
stockings
which
inclosed
a
bulky
pair
of
legs
*punct* ,
with
large
swelling
calves;
*punct* ,
the
kind
of
legs
*punct* ,
which
in
such
costume
*punct* ,
always
look
in
an
unfinished
and
incomplete
state
without
a
set
of
fetters
to
garnish
them
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
brown
hat
on
his
head
*punct* ,
and
a
dirty
belcher
handkerchief
round
his
neck
*punct* :
with
the
long
frayed
ends
of
which
he
smeared
the
beer
from
his
face
as
he
spoke
*punct* .
*break*
he
disclosed
*punct* ,
when
he
had
done
so
*punct* ,
a
broad
heavy
countenance
with
a
beard
of
three
days
growth
*punct* ,
and
two
scowling
eyes
*punct* ;
one
of
which
displayed
various
parti-coloured
symptoms
of
having
been
recently
damaged
by
a
blow
*punct* .
*break*
come
in
*punct* ,
d'ye
hear
*punct* ?
*break*
growled
this
engaging
ruffian
*punct* .
*break*
a
white
shaggy
dog
*punct* ,
with
his
face
scratched
and
torn
in
twenty
different
places
*punct* ,
skulked
into
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
why
didn't
you
come
in
afore
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
man
*punct* .
*break*
you're
getting
too
proud
to
own
me
afore
company
*punct* ,
are
you
*punct* ?
*break*
this
command
was
accompanied
with
a
kick
*punct* ,
which
sent
the
animal
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
he
appeared
well
used
to
it
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ;
for
he
coiled
himself
up
in
a
corner
very
quietly
*punct* ,
without
uttering
a
sound
*punct* ,
and
winking
his
very
ill-looking
eyes
twenty
times
in
a
minute
*punct* ,
appeared
to
occupy
himself
in
taking
a
survey
of
the
apartment
*punct* .
*break*
what
are
you
up
to
*punct* ?
*break*
ill-treating
the
boys
*punct* ,
you
covetous
*punct* ,
avaricious
*punct* ,
in-sa-ti-a-ble
old
fence
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
man
*punct* ,
seating
himself
deliberately
*punct* .
*break*
i
wonder
they
don't
murder
you
*punct* !
*break*
i
would
if
i
was
them
*punct* .
*break*
if
i'd
been
your
prentice
*punct* ,
i'd
have
done
it
long
ago
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
i
couldn't
have
sold
you
afterwards
*punct* ,
for
you're
fit
for
nothing
but
keeping
as
a
curiousity
of
ugliness
in
a
glass
bottle
*punct* ,
and
i
suppose
they
don't
blow
glass
bottles
large
enough
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
sikes
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
trembling
*punct* ;
don't
speak
so
loud
*punct* !
*break*
none
of
your
mistering
*punct* ,
replied
the
ruffian
*punct* ;
you
always
mean
mischief
when
you
come
that
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
my
name
*punct* :
out
with
it
*punct* !
*break*
i
shan't
disgrace
it
when
the
time
comes
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
bill
sikes
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
with
abject
humility
*punct* .
*break*
you
seem
out
of
humour
*punct* ,
bill
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
i
am
*punct* ,
replied
sikes
*punct* ;
i
should
think
you
was
rather
out
of
sorts
too
*punct* ,
unless
you
mean
as
little
harm
when
you
throw
pewter
pots
about
*punct* ,
as
you
do
when
you
blab
and
*punct* ,
are
you
mad
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
catching
the
man
by
the
sleeve
*punct* ,
and
pointing
towards
the
boys
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
sikes
contented
himself
with
tying
an
imaginary
knot
under
his
left
ear
*punct* ,
and
jerking
his
head
over
on
the
right
shoulder
*punct* ;
a
piece
of
dumb
show
which
the
jew
appeared
to
understand
perfectly
*punct* .
*break*
he
then
*punct* ,
in
cant
terms
*punct* ,
with
which
his
whole
conversation
was
plentifully
besprinkled
*punct* ,
but
which
would
be
quite
unintelligible
if
they
were
recorded
here
*punct* ,
demanded
a
glass
of
liquor
*punct* .
*break*
and
mind
you
don't
poison
it
*punct* ,
said
mr.
sikes
*punct* ,
laying
his
hat
upon
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
said
in
jest
*punct* ;
but
if
the
speaker
could
have
seen
the
evil
leer
with
which
the
jew
bit
his
pale
lip
as
he
turned
round
to
the
cupboard
*punct* ,
he
might
have
thought
the
caution
not
wholly
unnecessary
*punct* ,
or
the
wish
*punct* ,
at
all
events
*punct* ,
to
improve
upon
the
distiller's
ingenuity
not
very
far
from
the
old
gentleman's
merry
heart
*punct* .
*break*
after
swallowing
two
of
three
glasses
of
spirits
*punct* ,
mr.
sikes
condescended
to
take
some
notice
of
the
young
gentlemen
*punct* ;
which
gracious
act
led
to
a
conversation
*punct* ,
in
which
the
cause
and
manner
of
oliver's
capture
were
circumstantially
detailed
*punct* ,
with
such
alterations
and
improvements
on
the
truth
*punct* ,
as
to
the
dodger
appeared
most
advisable
under
the
circumstances
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
afraid
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
that
he
may
say
something
which
will
get
us
into
trouble
*punct* .
*break*
that's
very
likely
*punct* ,
returned
sikes
with
a
malicious
grin
*punct* .
*break*
you're
blowed
upon
*punct* ,
fagin
*punct* .
*break*
and
i'm
afraid
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* ,
added
the
jew
*punct* ,
speaking
as
if
he
had
not
noticed
the
interruption
*punct* ;
and
regarding
the
other
closely
as
he
did
so,
*punct* ,
'i'm
afraid
that
*punct* ,
if
the
game
was
up
with
us
*punct* ,
it
might
be
up
with
a
good
many
more
*punct* ,
and
that
it
would
come
out
rather
worse
for
you
than
it
would
for
me
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
started
*punct* ,
and
turned
round
upon
the
jew
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
old
gentleman's
shoulders
were
shrugged
up
to
his
ears
*punct* ;
and
his
eyes
were
vacantly
staring
on
the
opposite
wall
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
long
pause
*punct* .
*break*
every
member
of
the
respectable
coterie
appeared
plunged
in
his
own
reflections
*punct* ;
not
excepting
the
dog
*punct* ,
who
by
a
certain
malicious
licking
of
his
lips
seemed
to
be
meditating
an
attack
upon
the
legs
of
the
first
gentleman
or
lady
he
might
encounter
in
the
streets
when
he
went
out
*punct* .
*break*
somebody
must
find
out
wot's
been
done
at
the
office
*punct* ,
said
mr.
sikes
in
a
much
lower
tone
than
he
had
taken
since
he
came
in
*punct* .
*break*
the
jew
nodded
assent
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
hasn't
peached
*punct* ,
and
is
committed
*punct* ,
there's
no
fear
till
he
comes
out
again
*punct* ,
said
mr.
sikes
*punct* ,
and
then
he
must
be
taken
care
on
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
get
hold
of
him
somehow
*punct* .
*break*
again
the
jew
nodded
*punct* .
*break*
the
prudence
of
this
line
of
action
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
was
obvious
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
unfortunately
*punct* ,
there
was
one
very
strong
objection
to
its
being
adopted
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
*punct* ,
that
the
dodger
*punct* ,
and
charley
bates
*punct* ,
and
fagin
*punct* ,
and
mr.
william
sikes
*punct* ,
happened
*punct* ,
one
and
all
*punct* ,
to
entertain
a
violent
and
deeply-rooted
antipathy
to
going
near
a
police-office
on
any
ground
or
pretext
whatever
*punct* .
*break*
how
long
they
might
have
sat
and
looked
at
each
other
*punct* ,
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
not
the
most
pleasant
of
its
kind
*punct* ,
it
is
difficult
to
guess
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
necessary
to
make
any
guesses
on
the
subject
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ;
for
the
sudden
entrance
of
the
two
young
ladies
whom
oliver
had
seen
on
a
former
occasion
*punct* ,
caused
the
conversation
to
flow
afresh
*punct* .
*break*
the
very
thing
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
jew
*punct* .
*break*
bet
will
go
*punct* ;
won't
you
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
the
young
lady
*punct* .
*break*
only
just
up
to
the
office
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
coaxingly
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
due
to
the
young
lady
to
say
that
she
did
not
positively
affirm
that
she
would
not
*punct* ,
but
that
she
merely
expressed
an
emphatic
and
earnest
desire
to
be
blessed
if
she
would
*punct* ;
a
polite
and
delicate
evasion
of
the
request
*punct* ,
which
shows
the
young
lady
to
have
been
possessed
of
that
natural
good
breeding
which
cannot
bear
to
inflict
upon
a
fellow-creature
*punct* ,
the
pain
of
a
direct
and
pointed
refusal
*punct* .
*break*
the
jew's
countenance
fell
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
from
this
young
lady
*punct* ,
who
was
gaily
*punct* ,
not
to
say
gorgeously
attired
*punct* ,
in
a
red
gown
*punct* ,
green
boots
*punct* ,
and
yellow
curl-papers
*punct* ,
to
the
other
female
*punct* .
*break*
nancy
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
in
a
soothing
manner
*punct* ,
what
do
you
say
*punct* ?
*break*
that
it
won't
do
*punct* ;
so
it's
no
use
a-trying
it
on
*punct* ,
fagin
*punct* ,
replied
nancy
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
mean
by
that
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mr.
sikes
*punct* ,
looking
up
in
a
surly
manner
*punct* .
*break*
what
i
say
*punct* ,
bill
*punct* ,
replied
the
lady
collectedly
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
you're
just
the
very
person
for
it
*punct* ,
reasoned
mr.
sikes
*punct* :
nobody
about
here
knows
anything
of
you
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
i
don't
want
em
to
*punct* ,
neither
*punct* ,
replied
nancy
in
the
same
composed
manner
*punct* ,
it's
rather
more
no
than
yes
with
me
*punct* ,
bill
*punct* .
*break*
she'll
go
*punct* ,
fagin
*punct* ,
said
sikes
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
she
won't
*punct* ,
fagin
*punct* ,
said
nancy
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
she
will
*punct* ,
fagin
*punct* ,
said
sikes
*punct* .
*break*
and
mr.
sikes
was
right
*punct* .
*break*
by
dint
of
alternate
threats
*punct* ,
promises
*punct* ,
and
bribes
*punct* ,
the
lady
in
question
was
ultimately
prevailed
upon
to
undertake
the
commission
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
not
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
withheld
by
the
same
considerations
as
her
agreeable
friend
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
having
recently
removed
into
the
neighborhood
of
field
lane
from
the
remote
but
genteel
suburb
of
ratcliffe
*punct* ,
she
was
not
under
the
same
apprehension
of
being
recognised
by
any
of
her
numerous
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
accordingly
*punct* ,
with
a
clean
white
apron
tied
over
her
gown
*punct* ,
and
her
curl-papers
tucked
up
under
a
straw
bonnet,
*punct* ,
both
articles
of
dress
being
provided
from
the
jew's
inexhaustible
stock,
*punct* ,
miss
nancy
prepared
to
issue
forth
on
her
errand
*punct* .
*break*
stop
a
minute
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
producing
*punct* ,
a
little
covered
basket
*punct* .
*break*
carry
that
in
one
hand
*punct* .
*break*
it
looks
more
respectable
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
give
her
a
door-key
to
carry
in
her
t'other
one
*punct* ,
fagin
*punct* ,
said
sikes
*punct* ;
it
looks
real
and
genivine
like
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
so
it
does
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
hanging
a
large
street-door
key
on
the
forefinger
of
the
young
lady's
right
hand
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ;
very
good
*punct* !
*break*
very
good
indeed
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
rubbing
his
hands
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
my
brother
*punct* !
*break*
my
poor
*punct* ,
dear
*punct* ,
sweet
*punct* ,
innocent
little
brother
*punct* !
*break*
exclaimed
nancy
*punct* ,
bursting
into
tears
*punct* ,
and
wringing
the
little
basket
and
the
street-door
key
in
an
agony
of
distress
*punct* .
*break*
what
has
become
of
him
*punct* !
*break*
where
have
they
taken
him
to
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
do
have
pity
*punct* ,
and
tell
me
what's
been
done
with
the
dear
boy
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ;
do
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* !
*break*
having
uttered
those
words
in
a
most
lamentable
and
heart-broken
tone
*punct* :
to
the
immeasurable
delight
of
her
hearers
*punct* :
miss
nancy
paused
*punct* ,
winked
to
the
company
*punct* ,
nodded
smilingly
round
*punct* ,
and
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
she's
a
clever
girl
*punct* ,
my
dears
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
turning
round
to
his
young
friends
*punct* ,
and
shaking
his
head
gravely
*punct* ,
as
if
in
mute
admonition
to
them
to
follow
the
bright
example
they
had
just
beheld
*punct* .
*break*
she's
a
honour
to
her
sex
*punct* ,
said
mr.
sikes
*punct* ,
filling
his
glass
*punct* ,
and
smiting
the
table
with
his
enormous
fist
*punct* .
*break*
here's
her
health
*punct* ,
and
wishing
they
was
all
like
her
*punct* !
*break*
while
these
*punct* ,
and
many
other
encomiums
*punct* ,
were
being
passed
on
the
accomplished
nancy
*punct* ,
that
young
lady
made
the
best
of
her
way
to
the
police-office
*punct* ;
whither
*punct* ,
notwithstanding
a
little
natural
timidity
consequent
upon
walking
through
the
streets
alone
and
unprotected
*punct* ,
she
arrived
in
perfect
safety
shortly
afterwards
*punct* .
*break*
entering
by
the
back
way
*punct* ,
she
tapped
softly
with
the
key
at
one
of
the
cell-doors
*punct* ,
and
listened
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
sound
within
*punct* :
so
she
coughed
and
listened
again
*punct* .
*break*
still
there
was
no
reply
*punct* :
so
she
spoke
*punct* .
*break*
nolly
*punct* ,
dear
*punct* ?
*break*
murmured
nancy
in
a
gentle
voice
*punct* ;
nolly
*punct* ?
*break*
there
was
nobody
inside
but
a
miserable
shoeless
criminal
*punct* ,
who
had
been
taken
up
for
playing
the
flute
*punct* ,
and
who
*punct* ,
the
offence
against
society
having
been
clearly
proved
*punct* ,
had
been
very
properly
committed
by
mr.
fang
to
the
house
of
correction
for
one
month
*punct* ;
with
the
appropriate
and
amusing
remark
that
since
he
had
so
much
breath
to
spare
*punct* ,
it
would
be
more
wholesomely
expended
on
the
treadmill
than
in
a
musical
instrument
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
no
answer
*punct* :
being
occupied
mentally
bewailing
the
loss
of
the
flute
*punct* ,
which
had
been
confiscated
for
the
use
of
the
county
*punct* :
so
nancy
passed
on
to
the
next
cell
*punct* ,
and
knocked
there
*punct* .
*break*
cried
a
faint
and
feeble
voice
*punct* .
*break*
is
there
a
little
boy
here
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
nancy
*punct* ,
with
a
preliminary
sob
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
replied
the
voice
*punct* ;
god
forbid
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
a
vagrant
of
sixty-five
*punct* ,
who
was
going
to
prison
for
not
playing
the
flute
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
in
other
words
*punct* ,
for
begging
in
the
streets
*punct* ,
and
doing
nothing
for
his
livelihood
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
next
cell
was
another
man
*punct* ,
who
was
going
to
the
same
prison
for
hawking
tin
saucepans
without
license
*punct* ;
thereby
doing
something
for
his
living
*punct* ,
in
defiance
of
the
stamp-office
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
neither
of
these
criminals
answered
to
the
name
of
oliver
*punct* ,
or
knew
anything
about
him
*punct* ,
nancy
made
straight
up
to
the
bluff
officer
in
the
striped
waistcoat
*punct* ;
and
with
the
most
piteous
wailings
and
lamentations
*punct* ,
rendered
more
piteous
by
a
prompt
and
efficient
use
of
the
street-door
key
and
the
little
basket
*punct* ,
demanded
her
own
dear
brother
*punct* .
*break*
i
haven't
got
him
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
the
old
man
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
he
*punct* ?
*break*
screamed
nancy
*punct* ,
in
a
distracted
manner
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
the
gentleman's
got
him
*punct* ,
replied
the
officer
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
gracious
heavens
*punct* !
*break*
in
reply
to
this
incoherent
questioning
*punct* ,
the
old
man
informed
the
deeply
affected
sister
that
oliver
had
been
taken
ill
in
the
office
*punct* ,
and
discharged
in
consequence
of
a
witness
having
proved
the
robbery
to
have
been
committed
by
another
boy
*punct* ,
not
in
custody
*punct* ;
and
that
the
prosecutor
had
carried
him
away
*punct* ,
in
an
insensible
condition
*punct* ,
to
his
own
residence
*punct* :
of
and
concerning
which
*punct* ,
all
the
informant
knew
was
*punct* ,
that
it
was
somewhere
in
pentonville
*punct* ,
he
having
heard
that
word
mentioned
in
the
directions
to
the
coachman
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
dreadful
state
of
doubt
and
uncertainty
*punct* ,
the
agonised
young
woman
staggered
to
the
gate
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
exchanging
her
faltering
walk
for
a
swift
run
*punct* ,
returned
by
the
most
devious
and
complicated
route
she
could
think
of
*punct* ,
to
the
domicile
of
the
jew
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
bill
sikes
no
sooner
heard
the
account
of
the
expedition
delivered
*punct* ,
than
he
very
hastily
called
up
the
white
dog
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
putting
on
his
hat
*punct* ,
expeditiously
departed
*punct* :
without
devoting
any
time
to
the
formality
of
wishing
the
company
good-morning
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
know
where
he
is
*punct* ,
my
dears
*punct* ;
he
must
be
found
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
greatly
excited
*punct* .
*break*
charley
*punct* ,
do
nothing
but
skulk
about
*punct* ,
till
you
bring
home
some
news
of
him
*punct* !
*break*
nancy
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
i
must
have
him
found
*punct* .
*break*
i
trust
to
you
*punct* ,
my
dear,
*punct* ,
to
you
and
the
artful
for
everything
*punct* !
*break*
stay
*punct* ,
stay
*punct* ,
added
the
jew
*punct* ,
unlocking
a
drawer
with
a
shaking
hand
*punct* ;
there's
money
*punct* ,
my
dears
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
shut
up
this
shop
to-night
*punct* .
*break*
you'll
know
where
to
find
me
*punct* !
*break*
don't
stop
here
a
minute
*punct* .
*break*
not
an
instant
*punct* ,
my
dears
*punct* !
*break*
with
these
words
*punct* ,
he
pushed
them
from
the
room
*punct* :
and
carefully
double-locking
and
barring
the
door
behind
them
*punct* ,
drew
from
its
place
of
concealment
the
box
which
he
had
unintentionally
disclosed
to
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
he
hastily
proceeded
to
dispose
the
watches
and
jewellery
beneath
his
clothing
*punct* .
*break*
a
rap
at
the
door
startled
him
in
this
occupation
*punct* .
*break*
he
cried
in
a
shrill
tone
*punct* .
*break*
replied
the
voice
of
the
dodger
*punct* ,
through
the
key-hole
*punct* .
*break*
cried
the
jew
impatiently
*punct* .
*break*
is
he
to
be
kidnapped
to
the
other
ken
*punct* ,
nancy
says
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
the
dodger
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
replied
the
jew
*punct* ,
wherever
she
lays
hands
on
him
*punct* .
*break*
find
him
*punct* ,
find
him
out
*punct* ,
that's
all
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
know
what
to
do
next
*punct* ;
never
fear
*punct* .
*break*
the
boy
murmured
a
reply
of
intelligence
*punct* :
and
hurried
downstairs
after
his
companions
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
not
peached
so
far
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
as
he
pursued
his
occupation
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
means
to
blab
us
among
his
new
friends
*punct* ,
we
may
stop
his
mouth
yet
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
soon
recovering
from
the
fainting-fit
into
which
mr.
brownlow's
abrupt
exclamation
had
thrown
him
*punct* ,
the
subject
of
the
picture
was
carefully
avoided
*punct* ,
both
by
the
old
gentleman
and
mrs.
bedwin
*punct* ,
in
the
conversation
that
ensued
*punct* :
which
indeed
bore
no
reference
to
oliver's
history
or
prospects
*punct* ,
but
was
confined
to
such
topics
as
might
amuse
without
exciting
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
still
too
weak
to
get
up
to
breakfast
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
when
he
came
down
into
the
housekeeper's
room
next
day
*punct* ,
his
first
act
was
to
cast
an
eager
glance
at
the
wall
*punct* ,
in
the
hope
of
again
looking
on
the
face
of
the
beautiful
lady
*punct* .
*break*
his
expectations
were
disappointed
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
for
the
picture
had
been
removed
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
housekeeper
*punct* ,
watching
the
direction
of
oliver's
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
gone
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* .
*break*
i
see
it
is
ma'am
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
why
have
they
taken
it
away
*punct* ?
*break*
it
has
been
taken
down
*punct* ,
child
*punct* ,
because
mr.
brownlow
said
*punct* ,
that
as
it
seemed
to
worry
you
*punct* ,
perhaps
it
might
prevent
your
getting
well
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
rejoined
the
old
lady
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
it
didn't
worry
me
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ,
said
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
i
liked
to
see
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
quite
loved
it
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
old
lady
*punct* ,
good-humouredly
*punct* ;
you
get
well
as
fast
as
ever
you
can
*punct* ,
dear
*punct* ,
and
it
shall
be
hung
up
again
*punct* .
*break*
i
promise
you
that
*punct* !
*break*
now
*punct* ,
let
us
talk
about
something
else
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
all
the
information
oliver
could
obtain
about
the
picture
at
that
time
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
old
lady
had
been
so
kind
to
him
in
his
illness
*punct* ,
he
endeavoured
to
think
no
more
of
the
subject
just
then
*punct* ;
so
he
listened
attentively
to
a
great
many
stories
she
told
him
*punct* ,
about
an
amiable
and
handsome
daughter
of
hers
*punct* ,
who
was
married
to
an
amiable
and
handsome
man
*punct* ,
and
lived
in
the
country
*punct* ;
and
about
a
son
*punct* ,
who
was
clerk
to
a
merchant
in
the
west
indies
*punct* ;
and
who
was
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
such
a
good
young
man
*punct* ,
and
wrote
such
dutiful
letters
home
four
times
a-year
*punct* ,
that
it
brought
the
tears
into
her
eyes
to
talk
about
them
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
old
lady
had
expatiated
*punct* ,
a
long
time
*punct* ,
on
the
excellences
of
her
children
*punct* ,
and
the
merits
of
her
kind
good
husband
besides
*punct* ,
who
had
been
dead
and
gone
*punct* ,
poor
dear
soul
*punct* !
*break*
just
six-and-twenty
years
*punct* ,
it
was
time
to
have
tea
*punct* .
*break*
after
tea
she
began
to
teach
oliver
cribbage
*punct* :
which
he
learnt
as
quickly
as
she
could
teach
*punct* :
and
at
which
game
they
played
*punct* ,
with
great
interest
and
gravity
*punct* ,
until
it
was
time
for
the
invalid
to
have
some
warm
wine
and
water
*punct* ,
with
a
slice
of
dry
toast
*punct* ,
and
then
to
go
cosily
to
bed
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
happy
days
*punct* ,
those
of
oliver's
recovery
*punct* .
*break*
everything
was
so
quiet
*punct* ,
and
neat
*punct* ,
and
orderly
*punct* ;
everybody
so
kind
and
gentle
*punct* ;
that
after
the
noise
and
turbulence
in
the
midst
of
which
he
had
always
lived
*punct* ,
it
seemed
like
heaven
itself
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
no
sooner
strong
enough
to
put
his
clothes
on
*punct* ,
properly
*punct* ,
than
mr.
brownlow
caused
a
complete
new
suit
*punct* ,
and
a
new
cap
*punct* ,
and
a
new
pair
of
shoes
*punct* ,
to
be
provided
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
as
oliver
was
told
that
he
might
do
what
he
liked
with
the
old
clothes
*punct* ,
he
gave
them
to
a
servant
who
had
been
very
kind
to
him
*punct* ,
and
asked
her
to
sell
them
to
a
jew
*punct* ,
and
keep
the
money
for
herself
*punct* .
*break*
this
she
very
readily
did
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
as
oliver
looked
out
of
the
parlour
window
*punct* ,
and
saw
the
jew
roll
them
up
in
his
bag
and
walk
away
*punct* ,
he
felt
quite
delighted
to
think
that
they
were
safely
gone
*punct* ,
and
that
there
was
now
no
possible
danger
of
his
ever
being
able
to
wear
them
again
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
sad
rags
*punct* ,
to
tell
the
truth
*punct* ;
and
oliver
had
never
had
a
new
suit
before
*punct* .
*break*
one
evening
*punct* ,
about
a
week
after
the
affair
of
the
picture
*punct* ,
as
he
was
sitting
talking
to
mrs.
bedwin
*punct* ,
there
came
a
message
down
from
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
that
if
oliver
twist
felt
pretty
well
*punct* ,
he
should
like
to
see
him
in
his
study
*punct* ,
and
talk
to
him
a
little
while
*punct* .
*break*
bless
us
*punct* ,
and
save
us
*punct* !
*break*
wash
your
hands
*punct* ,
and
let
me
part
your
hair
nicely
for
you
*punct* ,
child
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
bedwin
*punct* .
*break*
dear
heart
alive
*punct* !
*break*
if
we
had
known
he
would
have
asked
for
you
*punct* ,
we
would
have
put
you
a
clean
collar
on
*punct* ,
and
made
you
as
smart
as
sixpence
*punct* !
*break*
oliver
did
as
the
old
lady
bade
him
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
although
she
lamented
grievously
*punct* ,
meanwhile
*punct* ,
that
there
was
not
even
time
to
crimp
the
little
frill
that
bordered
his
shirt-collar
*punct* ;
he
looked
so
delicate
and
handsome
*punct* ,
despite
that
important
personal
advantage
*punct* ,
that
she
went
so
far
as
to
say
*punct* :
looking
at
him
with
great
complacency
from
head
to
foot
*punct* ,
that
she
really
didn't
think
it
would
have
been
possible
*punct* ,
on
the
longest
notice
*punct* ,
to
have
made
much
difference
in
him
for
the
better
*punct* .
*break*
thus
encouraged
*punct* ,
oliver
tapped
at
the
study
door
*punct* .
*break*
on
mr.
brownlow
calling
to
him
to
come
in
*punct* ,
he
found
himself
in
a
little
back
room
*punct* ,
quite
full
of
books
*punct* ,
with
a
window
*punct* ,
looking
into
some
pleasant
little
gardens
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
table
drawn
up
before
the
window
*punct* ,
at
which
mr.
brownlow
was
seated
reading
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
saw
oliver
*punct* ,
he
pushed
the
book
away
from
him
*punct* ,
and
told
him
to
come
near
the
table
*punct* ,
and
sit
down
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
complied
*punct* ;
marvelling
where
the
people
could
be
found
to
read
such
a
great
number
of
books
as
seemed
to
be
written
to
make
the
world
wiser
*punct* .
*break*
which
is
still
a
marvel
to
more
experienced
people
than
oliver
twist
*punct* ,
every
day
of
their
lives
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
a
good
many
books
*punct* ,
are
there
not
*punct* ,
my
boy
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
observing
the
curiosity
with
which
oliver
surveyed
the
shelves
that
reached
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
*punct* .
*break*
a
great
number
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
saw
so
many
*punct* .
*break*
you
shall
read
them
*punct* ,
if
you
behave
well
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gentleman
kindly
*punct* ;
and
you
will
like
that
*punct* ,
better
than
looking
at
the
outsides,
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
some
cases
*punct* ;
because
there
are
books
of
which
the
backs
and
covers
are
by
far
the
best
parts
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
they
are
those
heavy
ones
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
oliver
*punct* ,
pointing
to
some
large
quartos
*punct* ,
with
a
good
deal
of
gilding
about
the
binding
*punct* .
*break*
not
always
those
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
patting
oliver
on
the
head
*punct* ,
and
smiling
as
he
did
so
*punct* ;
there
are
other
equally
heavy
ones
*punct* ,
though
of
a
much
smaller
size
*punct* .
*break*
how
should
you
like
to
grow
up
a
clever
man
*punct* ,
and
write
books
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
i
think
i
would
rather
read
them
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
wouldn't
you
like
to
be
a
book-writer
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
considered
a
little
while
*punct* ;
and
at
last
said
*punct* ,
he
should
think
it
would
be
a
much
better
thing
to
be
a
book-seller
*punct* ;
upon
which
the
old
gentleman
laughed
heartily
*punct* ,
and
declared
he
had
said
a
very
good
thing
*punct* .
*break*
which
oliver
felt
glad
to
have
done
*punct* ,
though
he
by
no
means
knew
what
it
was
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
composing
his
features
*punct* .
*break*
don't
be
afraid
*punct* !
*break*
we
won't
make
an
author
of
you
*punct* ,
while
there's
an
honest
trade
to
be
learnt
*punct* ,
or
brick-making
to
turn
to
*punct* .
*break*
thank
you
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
earnest
manner
of
his
reply
*punct* ,
the
old
gentleman
laughed
again
*punct* ;
and
said
something
about
a
curious
instinct
*punct* ,
which
oliver
*punct* ,
not
understanding
*punct* ,
paid
no
very
great
attention
to
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
speaking
if
possible
in
a
kinder
*punct* ,
but
at
the
same
time
in
a
much
more
serious
manner
*punct* ,
than
oliver
had
ever
known
him
assume
yet
*punct* ,
i
want
you
to
pay
great
attention
*punct* ,
my
boy
*punct* ,
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
talk
to
you
without
any
reserve
*punct* ;
because
i
am
sure
you
are
well
able
to
understand
me
*punct* ,
as
many
older
persons
would
be
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
don't
tell
you
are
going
to
send
me
away
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
pray
*punct* !
*break*
exclaimed
oliver
*punct* ,
alarmed
at
the
serious
tone
of
the
old
gentleman's
commencement
*punct* !
*break*
don't
turn
me
out
of
doors
to
wander
in
the
streets
again
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
stay
here
*punct* ,
and
be
a
servant
*punct* .
*break*
don't
send
me
back
to
the
wretched
place
i
came
from
*punct* .
*break*
have
mercy
upon
a
poor
boy
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
my
dear
child
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
moved
by
the
warmth
of
oliver's
sudden
appeal
*punct* ;
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
my
deserting
you
*punct* ,
unless
you
give
me
cause
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
*punct* ,
never
will
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
interposed
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
not
*punct* ,
rejoined
the
old
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
think
you
ever
will
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
been
deceived
*punct* ,
before
*punct* ,
in
the
objects
whom
i
have
endeavoured
to
benefit
*punct* ;
but
i
feel
strongly
disposed
to
trust
you
*punct* ,
nevertheless
*punct* ;
and
i
am
more
interested
in
your
behalf
than
i
can
well
account
for
*punct* ,
even
to
myself
*punct* .
*break*
the
persons
on
whom
i
have
bestowed
my
dearest
love
*punct* ,
lie
deep
in
their
graves
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
although
the
happiness
and
delight
of
my
life
lie
buried
there
too
*punct* ,
i
have
not
made
a
coffin
of
my
heart
*punct* ,
and
sealed
it
up
*punct* ,
forever
*punct* ,
on
my
best
affections
*punct* .
*break*
deep
affliction
has
but
strengthened
and
refined
them
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
old
gentleman
said
this
in
a
low
voice
*punct* :
more
to
himself
than
to
his
companion
*punct* :
and
as
he
remained
silent
for
a
short
time
afterwards
*punct* :
oliver
sat
quite
still
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
old
gentleman
at
length
*punct* ,
in
a
more
cheerful
tone
*punct* ,
i
only
say
this
*punct* ,
because
you
have
a
young
heart
*punct* ;
and
knowing
that
i
have
suffered
great
pain
and
sorrow
*punct* ,
you
will
be
more
careful
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
not
to
wound
me
again
*punct* .
*break*
you
say
you
are
an
orphan
*punct* ,
without
a
friend
in
the
world
*punct* ;
all
the
inquiries
i
have
been
able
to
make
*punct* ,
confirm
the
statement
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
hear
your
story
*punct* ;
where
you
come
from
*punct* ;
who
brought
you
up
*punct* ;
and
how
you
got
into
the
company
in
which
i
found
you
*punct* .
*break*
speak
the
truth
*punct* ,
and
you
shall
not
be
friendless
while
i
live
*punct* .
*break*
oliver's
sobs
checked
his
utterance
for
some
minutes
*punct* ;
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
beginning
to
relate
how
he
had
been
brought
up
at
the
farm
*punct* ,
and
carried
to
the
workhouse
by
mr.
bumble
*punct* ,
a
peculiarly
impatient
little
double-knock
was
heard
at
the
street-door
*punct* :
and
the
servant
*punct* ,
running
upstairs
*punct* ,
announced
mr.
grimwig
*punct* .
*break*
is
he
coming
up
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
mr.
brownlow
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
the
servant
*punct* .
*break*
he
asked
if
there
were
any
muffins
in
the
house
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
when
i
told
him
yes
*punct* ,
he
said
he
had
come
to
tea
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
brownlow
smiled
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
turning
to
oliver
*punct* ,
said
that
mr.
grimwig
was
an
old
friend
of
his
*punct* ,
and
he
must
not
mind
his
being
a
little
rough
in
his
manners
*punct* ;
for
he
was
a
worthy
creature
at
bottom
*punct* ,
as
he
had
reason
to
know
*punct* .
*break*
shall
i
go
downstairs
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
i
would
rather
you
remained
here
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
moment
*punct* ,
there
walked
into
the
room
*punct* :
supporting
himself
by
a
thick
stick
*punct* :
a
stout
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
rather
lame
in
one
leg
*punct* ,
who
was
dressed
in
a
blue
coat
*punct* ,
striped
waistcoat
*punct* ,
nankeen
breeches
and
gaiters
*punct* ,
and
a
broad-brimmed
white
hat
*punct* ,
with
the
sides
turned
up
with
green
*punct* .
*break*
a
very
small-plaited
shirt
frill
stuck
out
from
his
waistcoat
*punct* ;
and
a
very
long
steel
watch-chain
*punct* ,
with
nothing
but
a
key
at
the
end
*punct* ,
dangled
loosely
below
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
ends
of
his
white
neckerchief
were
twisted
into
a
ball
about
the
size
of
an
orange
*punct* ;
the
variety
of
shapes
into
which
his
countenance
was
twisted
*punct* ,
defy
description
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
manner
of
screwing
his
head
on
one
side
when
he
spoke
*punct* ;
and
of
looking
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
at
the
same
time
*punct* :
which
irresistibly
reminded
the
beholder
of
a
parrot
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
attitude
*punct* ,
he
fixed
himself
*punct* ,
the
moment
he
made
his
appearance
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
holding
out
a
small
piece
of
orange-peel
at
arm's
length
*punct* ,
exclaimed
*punct* ,
in
a
growling
*punct* ,
discontented
voice
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
see
this
*punct* !
*break*
isn't
it
a
most
wonderful
and
extraordinary
thing
that
i
can't
call
at
a
man's
house
but
i
find
a
piece
of
this
poor
surgeon's
friend
on
the
staircase
*punct* ?
*break*
i've
been
lamed
with
orange-peel
once
*punct* ,
and
i
know
orange-peel
will
be
my
death
*punct* ,
or
i'll
be
content
to
eat
my
own
head
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
this
was
the
handsome
offer
with
which
mr.
grimwig
backed
and
confirmed
nearly
every
assertion
he
made
*punct* ;
and
it
was
the
more
singular
in
his
case
*punct* ,
because
*punct* ,
even
admitting
for
the
sake
of
argument
*punct* ,
the
possibility
of
scientific
improvements
being
brought
to
that
pass
which
will
enable
a
gentleman
to
eat
his
own
head
in
the
event
of
his
being
so
disposed
*punct* ,
mr.
grimwig's
head
was
such
a
particularly
large
one
*punct* ,
that
the
most
sanguine
man
alive
could
hardly
entertain
a
hope
of
being
able
to
get
through
it
at
a
sitting
*punct* ,
to
put
entirely
out
of
the
question
*punct* ,
a
very
thick
coating
of
powder
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
eat
my
head
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
repeated
mr.
grimwig
*punct* ,
striking
his
stick
upon
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
looking
at
oliver
*punct* ,
and
retreating
a
pace
or
two
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
young
oliver
twist
*punct* ,
whom
we
were
speaking
about
*punct* ,
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* .
*break*
you
don't
mean
to
say
that's
the
boy
who
had
the
fever
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mr.
grimwig
*punct* ,
recoiling
a
little
more
*punct* .
*break*
wait
a
minute
*punct* !
*break*
stop
*punct* ,
continued
mr.
grimwig
*punct* ,
abruptly
*punct* ,
losing
all
dread
of
the
fever
in
his
triumph
at
the
discovery
*punct* ;
that's
the
boy
who
had
the
orange
*punct* !
*break*
if
that's
not
the
boy
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
who
had
the
orange
*punct* ,
and
threw
this
bit
of
peel
upon
the
staircase
*punct* ,
i'll
eat
my
head
*punct* ,
and
his
too
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
he
has
not
had
one
*punct* ,
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
laughing
*punct* .
*break*
put
down
your
hat
*punct* ;
and
speak
to
my
young
friend
*punct* .
*break*
i
feel
strongly
on
this
subject
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
the
irritable
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
drawing
off
his
gloves
*punct* .
*break*
there's
always
more
or
less
orange-peel
on
the
pavement
in
our
street
*punct* ;
and
i
know
it's
put
there
by
the
surgeon's
boy
at
the
corner
*punct* .
*break*
a
young
woman
stumbled
over
a
bit
last
night
*punct* ,
and
fell
against
my
garden-railings
*punct* ;
directly
she
got
up
i
saw
her
look
towards
his
infernal
red
lamp
with
the
pantomime-light
*punct* .
*break*
don't
go
to
him
*punct* ,
i
called
out
of
the
window
*punct* ,
he's
an
assassin
*punct* !
*break*
so
he
is
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
is
not
*punct* ,
here
the
irascible
old
gentleman
gave
a
great
knock
on
the
ground
with
his
stick
*punct* ;
which
was
always
understood
*punct* ,
by
his
friends
*punct* ,
to
imply
the
customary
offer
*punct* ,
whenever
it
was
not
expressed
in
words
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
still
keeping
his
stick
in
his
hand
*punct* ,
he
sat
down
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
opening
a
double
eye-glass
*punct* ,
which
he
wore
attached
to
a
broad
black
riband
*punct* ,
took
a
view
of
oliver
*punct* :
who
*punct* ,
seeing
that
he
was
the
object
of
inspection
*punct* ,
coloured
*punct* ,
and
bowed
again
*punct* .
*break*
that's
the
boy
*punct* ,
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mr.
grimwig
*punct* ,
at
length
*punct* .
*break*
that's
the
boy
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
brownlow
*punct* .
*break*
how
are
you
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mr.
grimwig
*punct* .
*break*
a
great
deal
better
*punct* ,
thank
you
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
mr
brownlow
*punct* ,
seeming
to
apprehend
that
his
singular
friend
was
about
to
say
something
disagreeable
*punct* ,
asked
oliver
to
step
downstairs
and
tell
mrs.
bedwin
they
were
ready
for
tea
*punct* ;
which
*punct* ,
as
he
did
not
half
like
the
visitor's
manner
*punct* ,
he
was
very
happy
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
a
nice-looking
boy
*punct* ,
is
he
not
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
mr.
brownlow
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
grimwig
*punct* ,
pettishly
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
see
any
difference
in
boys
*punct* .
*break*
i
only
knew
two
sort
of
boys
*punct* .
*break*
mealy
boys
*punct* ,
and
beef-faced
boys
*punct* .
*break*
and
which
is
oliver
*punct* ?
*break*
i
know
a
friend
who
has
a
beef-faced
boy
*punct* ;
a
fine
boy
*punct* ,
they
call
him
*punct* ;
with
a
round
head
*punct* ,
and
red
cheeks
*punct* ,
and
glaring
eyes
*punct* ;
a
horrid
boy
*punct* ;
with
a
body
and
limbs
that
appear
to
be
swelling
out
of
the
seams
of
his
blue
clothes
*punct* ;
with
the
voice
of
a
pilot
*punct* ,
and
the
appetite
of
a
wolf
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
him
*punct* !
*break*
come
*punct* ,
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
these
are
not
the
characteristics
of
young
oliver
twist
*punct* ;
so
he
needn't
excite
your
wrath
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
not
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
grimwig
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
have
worse
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
mr.
brownlow
coughed
impatiently
*punct* ;
which
appeared
to
afford
mr.
grimwig
the
most
exquisite
delight
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
have
worse
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
repeated
mr.
grimwig
*punct* .
*break*
where
does
he
come
from
*punct* !
*break*
who
is
he
*punct* ?
*break*
what
is
he
*punct* ?
*break*
he
has
had
a
fever
*punct* .
*break*
what
of
that
*punct* ?
*break*
fevers
are
not
peculiar
to
good
peope
*punct* ;
are
they
*punct* ?
*break*
bad
people
have
fevers
sometimes
*punct* ;
haven't
they
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
i
knew
a
man
who
was
hung
in
jamaica
for
murdering
his
master
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
had
a
fever
six
times
*punct* ;
he
wasn't
recommended
to
mercy
on
that
account
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
the
fact
was
*punct* ,
that
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
his
own
heart
*punct* ,
mr.
grimwig
was
strongly
disposed
to
admit
that
oliver's
appearance
and
manner
were
unusually
prepossessing
*punct* ;
but
he
had
a
strong
appetite
for
contradiction
*punct* ,
sharpened
on
this
occasion
by
the
finding
of
the
orange-peel
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
inwardly
determining
that
no
man
should
dictate
to
him
whether
a
boy
was
well-looking
or
not
*punct* ,
he
had
resolved
*punct* ,
from
the
first
*punct* ,
to
oppose
his
friend
*punct* .
*break*
when
mr.
brownlow
admitted
that
on
no
one
point
of
inquiry
could
he
yet
return
a
satisfactory
answer
*punct* ;
and
that
he
had
postponed
any
investigation
into
oliver's
previous
history
until
he
thought
the
boy
was
strong
enough
to
hear
it
*punct* ;
mr.
grimwig
chuckled
maliciously
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
demanded
*punct* ,
with
a
sneer
*punct* ,
whether
the
housekeeper
was
in
the
habit
of
counting
the
plate
at
night
*punct* ;
because
if
she
didn't
find
a
table-spoon
or
two
missing
some
sunshiny
morning
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
he
would
be
content
to
*punct* ,
and
so
forth
*punct* .
*break*
all
this
*punct* ,
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
although
himself
somewhat
of
an
impetuous
gentleman
*punct* :
knowing
his
friend's
peculiarities
*punct* ,
bore
with
great
good
humour
*punct* ;
as
mr.
grimwig
*punct* ,
at
tea
*punct* ,
was
graciously
pleased
to
express
his
entire
approval
of
the
muffins
*punct* ,
matters
went
on
very
smoothly
*punct* ;
and
oliver
*punct* ,
who
made
one
of
the
party
*punct* ,
began
to
feel
more
at
his
ease
than
he
had
yet
done
in
the
fierce
old
gentleman's
presence
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
are
you
going
to
hear
at
full
*punct* ,
true
*punct* ,
and
particular
account
of
the
life
and
adventures
of
oliver
twist
*punct* ?
*break*
asked
grimwig
of
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
at
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
*punct* ;
looking
sideways
at
oliver
*punct* ,
as
he
resumed
his
subject
*punct* .
*break*
to-morrow
morning
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
brownlow
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
rather
he
was
alone
with
me
at
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
come
up
to
me
to-morrow
morning
at
ten
o'clock
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
he
answered
with
some
hesitation
*punct* ,
because
he
was
confused
by
mr.
grimwig's
looking
so
hard
at
him
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
tell
you
what
*punct* ,
whispered
that
gentleman
to
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ;
he
won't
come
up
to
you
to-morrow
morning
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
him
hesitate
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
deceiving
you
*punct* ,
my
good
friend
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
swear
he
is
not
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
warmly
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
is
not
*punct* ,
said
mr.
grimwig
*punct* ,
i'll
*punct* ,
and
down
went
the
stick
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
answer
for
that
boy's
truth
with
my
life
*punct* !
*break*
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
knocking
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
for
his
falsehood
with
my
head
*punct* !
*break*
rejoined
mr.
grimwig
*punct* ,
knocking
the
table
also
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
see
*punct* ,
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
checking
his
rising
anger
*punct* .
*break*
we
will
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
grimwig
*punct* ,
with
a
provoking
smile
*punct* ;
we
will
*punct* .
*break*
as
fate
would
have
it
*punct* ,
mrs.
bedwin
chanced
to
bring
in
*punct* ,
at
this
moment
*punct* ,
a
small
parcel
of
books
*punct* ,
which
mr.
brownlow
had
that
morning
purchased
of
the
identical
bookstall-keeper
*punct* ,
who
has
already
figured
in
this
history
*punct* ;
having
laid
them
on
the
table
*punct* ,
she
prepared
to
leave
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
stop
the
boy
*punct* ,
mrs.
bedwin
*punct* !
*break*
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ;
there
is
something
to
go
back
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
gone
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
mrs.
bedwin
*punct* .
*break*
call
after
him
*punct* ,
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ;
it's
particular
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
a
poor
man
*punct* ,
and
they
are
not
paid
for
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
some
books
to
be
taken
back
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
the
street-door
was
opened
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
ran
one
way
*punct* ;
and
the
girl
ran
another
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
bedwin
stood
on
the
step
and
screamed
for
the
boy
*punct* ;
but
there
was
no
boy
in
sight
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
and
the
girl
returned
*punct* ,
in
a
breathless
state
*punct* ,
to
report
that
there
were
no
tidings
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
dear
me
*punct* ,
i
am
very
sorry
for
that
*punct* ,
exclaimed
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ;
i
particularly
wished
those
books
to
be
returned
to-night
*punct* .
*break*
send
oliver
with
them
*punct* ,
said
mr.
grimwig
*punct* ,
with
an
ironical
smile
*punct* ;
he
will
be
sure
to
deliver
them
safely
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ;
do
let
me
take
them
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
oliver
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
run
all
the
way
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
gentleman
was
just
going
to
say
that
oliver
should
not
go
out
on
any
account
*punct* ;
when
a
most
malicious
cough
from
mr.
grimwig
determined
him
that
he
should
*punct* ;
and
that
*punct* ,
by
his
prompt
discharge
of
the
commission
*punct* ,
he
should
prove
to
him
the
injustice
of
his
suspicions
*punct* :
on
this
head
at
least
*punct* :
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
you
shall
go
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
the
books
are
on
a
chair
by
my
table
*punct* .
*break*
fetch
them
down
*punct* .
*break*
oliver
*punct* ,
delighted
to
be
of
use
*punct* ,
brought
down
the
books
under
his
arm
in
a
great
bustle
*punct* ;
and
waited
*punct* ,
cap
in
hand
*punct* ,
to
hear
what
message
he
was
to
take
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
to
say
*punct* ,
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
glancing
steadily
at
grimwig
*punct* ;
you
are
to
say
that
you
have
brought
those
books
back
*punct* ;
and
that
you
have
come
to
pay
the
four
pound
ten
i
owe
him
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
a
five-pound
note
*punct* ,
so
you
will
have
to
bring
me
back
*punct* ,
ten
shillings
change
*punct* .
*break*
i
won't
be
ten
minutes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
oliver
*punct* ,
eagerly
*punct* .
*break*
having
buttoned
up
the
bank-note
in
his
jacket
pocket
*punct* ,
and
placed
the
books
carefully
under
his
arm
*punct* ,
he
made
a
respectful
bow
*punct* ,
and
left
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
bedwin
followed
him
to
the
street-door
*punct* ,
giving
him
many
directions
about
the
nearest
way
*punct* ,
and
the
name
of
the
bookseller
*punct* ,
and
the
name
of
the
street
*punct* :
all
of
which
oliver
said
he
clearly
understood
*punct* .
*break*
having
superadded
many
injunctions
to
be
sure
and
not
take
cold
*punct* ,
the
old
lady
at
length
permitted
him
to
depart
*punct* .
*break*
bless
his
sweet
face
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
old
lady
*punct* ,
looking
after
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
can't
bear
*punct* ,
somehow
*punct* ,
to
let
him
go
out
of
my
sight
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
moment
*punct* ,
oliver
looked
gaily
round
*punct* ,
and
nodded
before
he
turned
the
corner
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
lady
smilingly
returned
his
salutation
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
closing
the
door
*punct* ,
went
back
*punct* ,
to
her
own
room
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
see
*punct* ;
he'll
be
back
in
twenty
minutes
*punct* ,
at
the
longest
*punct* ,
said
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
pulling
out
his
watch
*punct* ,
and
placing
it
on
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
be
dark
by
that
time
*punct* .
*break*
you
really
expect
him
to
come
back
*punct* ,
do
you
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
mr.
grimwig
*punct* .
*break*
asked
mr.
brownlow
*punct* ,
smiling
*punct* .
*break*
the
spirit
of
contradiction
was
strong
in
mr.
grimwig's
breast
*punct* ,
at
the
moment
*punct* ;
and
it
was
rendered
stronger
by
his
friend's
confident
smile
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
smiting
the
table
with
his
fist
*punct* ,
i
do
not
*punct* .
*break*
the
boy
has
a
new
suit
of
clothes
on
his
back
*punct* ,
a
set
of
valuable
books
under
his
arm
*punct* ,
and
a
five-pound
note
in
his
pocket
*punct* .
*break*
he'll
join
his
old
friends
the
thieves
*punct* ,
and
laugh
at
you
*punct* .
*break*
if
ever
that
boy
returns
to
this
house
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
i'll
eat
my
head
*punct* .
*break*
with
these
words
he
drew
his
chair
closer
to
the
table
*punct* ;
and
there
the
two
friends
sat
*punct* ,
in
silent
expectation
*punct* ,
with
the
watch
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
worthy
of
remark
*punct* ,
as
illustrating
the
importance
we
attach
to
our
own
judgments
*punct* ,
and
the
pride
with
which
we
put
forth
our
most
rash
and
hasty
conclusions
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
although
mr.
grimwig
was
not
by
any
means
a
bad-hearted
man
*punct* ,
and
though
he
would
have
been
unfeignedly
sorry
to
see
his
respected
friend
duped
and
deceived
*punct* ,
he
really
did
most
earnestly
and
strongly
hope
at
that
moment
*punct* ,
that
oliver
twist
might
not
come
back
*punct* .
*break*
it
grew
so
dark
*punct* ,
that
the
figures
on
the
dial-plate
were
scarcely
discernible
*punct* ;
but
there
the
two
old
gentlemen
continued
to
sit
*punct* ,
in
silence
*punct* ,
with
the
watch
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
obscure
parlour
of
a
low
public-house
*punct* ,
in
the
filthiest
part
of
little
saffron
hill
*punct* ;
a
dark
and
gloomy
den
*punct* ,
where
a
flaring
gas-light
burnt
all
day
in
the
winter-time
*punct* ;
and
where
no
ray
of
sun
ever
shone
in
the
summer
*punct* :
there
sat
*punct* ,
brooding
over
a
little
pewter
measure
and
a
small
glass
*punct* ,
strongly
impregnated
with
the
smell
of
liquor
*punct* ,
a
man
in
a
velveteen
coat
*punct* ,
drab
shorts
*punct* ,
half-boots
and
stockings
*punct* ,
whom
even
by
that
dim
light
no
experienced
agent
of
the
police
would
have
hesitated
to
recognise
as
mr.
william
sikes
*punct* .
*break*
at
his
feet
*punct* ,
sat
a
white-coated
*punct* ,
red-eyed
dog
*punct* ;
who
occupied
himself
*punct* ,
alternately
*punct* ,
in
winking
at
his
master
with
both
eyes
at
the
same
time
*punct* ;
and
in
licking
a
large
*punct* ,
fresh
cut
on
one
side
of
his
mouth
*punct* ,
which
appeared
to
be
the
result
of
some
recent
conflict
*punct* .
*break*
keep
quiet
*punct* ,
you
warmint
*punct* !
*break*
said
mr.
sikes
*punct* ,
suddenly
breaking
silence
*punct* .
*break*
whether
his
meditations
were
so
intense
as
to
be
disturbed
by
the
dog's
winking
*punct* ,
or
whether
his
feelings
were
so
wrought
upon
by
his
reflections
that
they
required
all
the
relief
derivable
from
kicking
an
unoffending
animal
to
allay
them
*punct* ,
is
matter
for
argument
and
consideration
*punct* .
*break*
whatever
was
the
cause
*punct* ,
the
effect
was
a
kick
and
a
curse
*punct* ,
bestowed
upon
the
dog
simultaneously
*punct* .
*break*
dogs
are
not
generally
apt
to
revenge
injuries
inflicted
upon
them
by
their
masters
*punct* ;
but
mr.
sikes's
dog
*punct* ,
having
faults
of
temper
in
common
with
his
owner
*punct* ,
and
labouring
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
at
this
moment
*punct* ,
under
a
powerful
sense
of
injury
*punct* ,
made
no
more
ado
but
at
once
fixed
his
teeth
in
one
of
the
half-boots
*punct* .
*break*
having
given
in
a
hearty
shake
*punct* ,
he
retired
*punct* ,
growling
*punct* ,
under
a
form
*punct* ;
just
escaping
the
pewter
measure
which
mr.
sikes
levelled
at
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
you
would
*punct* ,
would
you
*punct* ?
*break*
said
sikes
*punct* ,
seizing
the
poker
in
one
hand
*punct* ,
and
deliberately
opening
with
the
other
a
large
clasp-knife
*punct* ,
which
he
drew
from
his
pocket
*punct* .
*break*
come
here
*punct* ,
you
born
devil
*punct* !
*break*
the
dog
no
doubt
heard
*punct* ;
because
mr.
sikes
spoke
in
the
very
harshest
key
of
a
very
harsh
voice
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
appearing
to
entertain
some
unaccountable
objection
to
having
his
throat
cut
*punct* ,
he
remained
where
he
was
*punct* ,
and
growled
more
fiercely
than
before
*punct* :
at
the
same
time
grasping
the
end
of
the
poker
between
his
teeth
*punct* ,
and
biting
at
it
like
a
wild
beast
*punct* .
*break*
this
resistance
only
infuriated
mr.
sikes
the
more
*punct* ;
who
*punct* ,
dropping
on
his
knees
*punct* ,
began
to
assail
the
animal
most
furiously
*punct* .
*break*
the
dog
jumped
from
right
to
left
*punct* ,
and
from
left
to
right
*punct* ;
snapping
*punct* ,
growling
*punct* ,
and
barking
*punct* ;
the
man
thrust
and
swore
*punct* ,
and
struck
and
blasphemed
*punct* ;
and
the
struggle
was
reaching
a
most
critical
point
for
one
or
other
*punct* ;
when
*punct* ,
the
door
suddenly
opening
*punct* ,
the
dog
darted
out
*punct* :
leaving
bill
sikes
with
the
poker
and
the
clasp-knife
in
his
hands
*punct* .
*break*
there
must
always
be
two
parties
to
a
quarrel
*punct* ,
says
the
old
adage
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
sikes
*punct* ,
being
disappointed
of
the
dog's
participation
*punct* ,
at
once
transferred
his
share
in
the
quarrel
to
the
new
comer
*punct* .
*break*
what
the
devil
do
you
come
in
between
me
and
my
dog
for
*punct* ?
*break*
said
sikes
*punct* ,
with
a
fierce
gesture
*punct* .
*break*
i
didn't
know
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
i
didn't
know
*punct* ,
replied
fagin
*punct* ,
humbly
*punct* ;
for
the
jew
was
the
new
comer
*punct* .
*break*
didn't
know
*punct* ,
you
white-livered
thief
*punct* !
*break*
couldn't
you
hear
the
noise
*punct* ?
*break*
not
a
sound
of
it
*punct* ,
as
i'm
a
living
man
*punct* ,
bill
*punct* ,
replied
the
jew
*punct* .
*break*
you
hear
nothing
*punct* ,
you
don't
*punct* ,
retorted
sikes
with
a
fierce
sneer
*punct* .
*break*
sneaking
in
and
out
*punct* ,
so
as
nobody
hears
how
you
come
or
go
*punct* !
*break*
i
wish
you
had
been
the
dog
*punct* ,
fagin
*punct* ,
half
a
minute
ago
*punct* .
*break*
inquired
the
jew
with
a
forced
smile
*punct* .
*break*
cause
the
government
*punct* ,
as
cares
for
the
lives
of
such
men
as
you
*punct* ,
as
haven't
half
the
pluck
of
curs
*punct* ,
lets
a
man
kill
a
dog
how
he
likes
*punct* ,
replied
sikes
*punct* ,
shutting
up
the
knife
with
a
very
expressive
look
*punct* ;
that's
why
*punct* .
*break*
the
jew
rubbed
his
hands
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
sitting
down
at
the
table
*punct* ,
affected
to
laugh
at
the
pleasantry
of
his
friend
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
obviously
very
ill
at
ease
*punct* ,
however
*punct* .
*break*
grin
away
*punct* ,
said
sikes
*punct* ,
replacing
the
poker
*punct* ,
and
surveying
him
with
savage
contempt
*punct* ;
grin
away
*punct* .
*break*
you'll
never
have
the
laugh
at
me
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
unless
it's
behind
a
nightcap
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
go
*punct* ,
you
go
*punct* ;
so
take
care
of
me
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
the
jew
*punct* ,
i
know
all
that
*punct* ;
we
*punct* ,
we
*punct* ,
have
a
mutual
interest
*punct* ,
bill,
*punct* ,
a
mutual
interest
*punct* .
*break*
humph
*punct* ,
said
sikes
*punct* ,
as
if
he
though
the
interest
lay
rather
more
on
the
jew's
side
than
on
his
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
all
passed
safe
through
the
melting-pot
*punct* ,
replied
fagin
*punct* ,
and
this
is
your
share
*punct* .
*break*
it's
rather
more
than
it
ought
to
be
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ;
but
as
i
know
you'll
do
me
a
good
turn
another
time
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
stow
that
gammon
*punct* ,
interposed
the
robber
*punct* ,
impatiently
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
bill
*punct* ;
give
me
time
*punct* ,
give
me
time
*punct* ,
replied
the
jew
*punct* ,
soothingly
*punct* .
*break*
here
it
is
*punct* !
*break*
as
he
spoke
*punct* ,
he
drew
forth
an
old
cotton
handkerchief
from
his
breast
*punct* ;
and
untying
a
large
knot
in
one
corner
*punct* ,
produced
a
small
brown-paper
packet
*punct* .
*break*
sikes
*punct* ,
snatching
it
from
him
*punct* ,
hastily
opened
it
*punct* ;
and
proceeded
to
count
the
sovereigns
it
contained
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
all
*punct* ,
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
all
*punct* ,
replied
the
jew
*punct* .
*break*
you
haven't
opened
the
parcel
and
swallowed
one
or
two
as
you
come
along
*punct* ,
have
you
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
sikes
*punct* ,
suspiciously
*punct* .
*break*
don't
put
on
an
injured
look
at
the
question
*punct* ;
you've
done
it
many
a
time
*punct* .
*break*
jerk
the
tinkler
*punct* .
*break*
these
words
*punct* ,
in
plain
english
*punct* ,
conveyed
an
injunction
to
ring
the
bell
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
answered
by
another
jew
*punct* :
younger
than
fagin
*punct* ,
but
nearly
as
vile
and
repulsive
in
appearance
*punct* .
*break*
bill
sikes
merely
pointed
to
the
empty
measure
*punct* .
*break*
the
jew
*punct* ,
perfectly
understanding
the
hint
*punct* ,
retired
to
fill
it
*punct* :
previously
exchanging
a
remarkable
look
with
fagin
*punct* ,
who
raised
his
eyes
for
an
instant
*punct* ,
as
if
in
expectation
of
it
*punct* ,
and
shook
his
head
in
reply
*punct* ;
so
slightly
that
the
action
would
have
been
almost
imperceptible
to
an
observant
third
person
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
lost
upon
sikes
*punct* ,
who
was
stooping
at
the
moment
to
tie
the
boot-lace
which
the
dog
had
torn
*punct* .
*break*
possibly
*punct* ,
if
he
had
observed
the
brief
interchange
of
signals
*punct* ,
he
might
have
thought
that
it
boded
no
good
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
is
anybody
here
*punct* ,
barney
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
fagin
*punct* ;
speaking
*punct* ,
now
that
that
sikes
was
looking
on
*punct* ,
without
raising
his
eyes
from
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
dot
a
shoul
*punct* ,
replied
barney
*punct* ;
whose
words
*punct* :
whether
they
came
from
the
heart
or
not
*punct* :
made
their
way
through
the
nose
*punct* .
*break*
inquired
fagin
*punct* ,
in
a
tone
of
surprise
*punct* :
which
perhaps
might
mean
that
barney
was
at
liberty
to
tell
the
truth
*punct* .
*break*
dobody
but
biss
dadsy
*punct* ,
replied
barney
*punct* .
*break*
strike
me
blind
*punct* ,
if
i
don't
honour
that
ere
girl
*punct* ,
for
her
native
talents
*punct* .
*break*
she's
bid
havid
a
plate
of
boiled
beef
id

bar
*punct* ,
replied
barney
*punct* .
