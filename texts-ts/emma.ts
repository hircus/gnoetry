author: Jane Austen
title: Emma
emma
woodhouse
*punct* ,
handsome
*punct* ,
clever
*punct* ,
and
rich
*punct* ,
with
a
comfortable
home
and
happy
disposition
*punct* ,
seemed
to
unite
some
of
the
best
blessings
of
existence
*punct* ;
and
had
lived
nearly
twenty-one
years
in
the
world
with
very
little
to
distress
or
vex
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
the
youngest
of
the
two
daughters
of
a
most
affectionate
*punct* ,
indulgent
father
*punct* ;
and
had
*punct* ,
in
consequence
of
her
sister's
marriage
*punct* ,
been
mistress
of
his
house
from
a
very
early
period
*punct* .
*break*
her
mother
had
died
too
long
ago
for
her
to
have
more
than
an
indistinct
remembrance
of
her
caresses
*punct* ;
and
her
place
had
been
supplied
by
an
excellent
woman
as
governess
*punct* ,
who
had
fallen
little
short
of
a
mother
in
affection
*punct* .
*break*
sixteen
years
had
miss
taylor
been
in
mr.
woodhouse's
family
*punct* ,
less
as
a
governess
than
a
friend
*punct* ,
very
fond
of
both
daughters
*punct* ,
but
particularly
of
emma
*punct* .
*break*
between
them
it
was
more
the
intimacy
of
sisters
*punct* .
*break*
even
before
miss
taylor
had
ceased
to
hold
the
nominal
office
of
governess
*punct* ,
the
mildness
of
her
temper
had
hardly
allowed
her
to
impose
any
restraint
*punct* ;
and
the
shadow
of
authority
being
now
long
passed
away
*punct* ,
they
had
been
living
together
as
friend
and
friend
very
mutually
attached
*punct* ,
and
emma
doing
just
what
she
liked
*punct* ;
highly
esteeming
miss
taylor's
judgment
*punct* ,
but
directed
chiefly
by
her
own
*punct* .
*break*
the
real
evils
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
of
emma's
situation
were
the
power
of
having
rather
too
much
her
own
way
*punct* ,
and
a
disposition
to
think
a
little
too
well
of
herself
*punct* ;
these
were
the
disadvantages
which
threatened
alloy
to
her
many
enjoyments
*punct* .
*break*
the
danger
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
was
at
present
so
unperceived
*punct* ,
that
they
did
not
by
any
means
rank
as
misfortunes
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
sorrow
came
*punct* ,
a
gentle
sorrow
*punct* ,
but
not
at
all
in
the
shape
of
any
disagreeable
consciousness.
*punct* ,
miss
taylor
married
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
miss
taylor's
loss
which
first
brought
grief
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
on
the
wedding-day
of
this
beloved
friend
that
emma
first
sat
in
mournful
thought
of
any
continuance
*punct* .
*break*
the
wedding
over
*punct* ,
and
the
bride-people
gone
*punct* ,
her
father
and
herself
were
left
to
dine
together
*punct* ,
with
no
prospect
of
a
third
to
cheer
a
long
evening
*punct* .
*break*
her
father
composed
himself
to
sleep
after
dinner
*punct* ,
as
usual
*punct* ,
and
she
had
then
only
to
sit
and
think
of
what
she
had
lost
*punct* .
*break*
the
event
had
every
promise
of
happiness
for
her
friend
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
was
a
man
of
unexceptionable
character
*punct* ,
easy
fortune
*punct* ,
suitable
age
*punct* ,
and
pleasant
manners
*punct* ;
and
there
was
some
satisfaction
in
considering
with
what
self-denying
*punct* ,
generous
friendship
she
had
always
wished
and
promoted
the
match
*punct* ;
but
it
was
a
black
morning's
work
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
the
want
of
miss
taylor
would
be
felt
every
hour
of
every
day
*punct* .
*break*
she
recalled
her
past
kindness
*punct* ,
the
kindness
*punct* ,
the
affection
of
sixteen
years
*punct* ,
how
she
had
taught
and
how
she
had
played
with
her
from
five
years
old
*punct* ,
how
she
had
devoted
all
her
powers
to
attach
and
amuse
her
in
health
*punct* ,
and
how
nursed
her
through
the
various
illnesses
of
childhood
*punct* .
*break*
a
large
debt
of
gratitude
was
owing
here
*punct* ;
but
the
intercourse
of
the
last
seven
years
*punct* ,
the
equal
footing
and
perfect
unreserve
which
had
soon
followed
isabella's
marriage
*punct* ,
on
their
being
left
to
each
other
*punct* ,
was
yet
a
dearer
*punct* ,
tenderer
recollection
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
been
a
friend
and
companion
such
as
few
possessed
*punct* :
intelligent
*punct* ,
well-informed
*punct* ,
useful
*punct* ,
gentle
*punct* ,
knowing
all
the
ways
of
the
family
*punct* ,
interested
in
all
its
concerns
*punct* ,
and
peculiarly
interested
in
herself
*punct* ,
in
every
pleasure
*punct* ,
every
scheme
of
hers
*punct* ,
one
to
whom
she
could
speak
every
thought
as
it
arose
*punct* ,
and
who
had
such
an
affection
for
her
as
could
never
find
fault
*punct* .
*break*
how
was
she
to
bear
the
change?
*punct* ,
it
was
true
that
her
friend
was
going
only
half
a
mile
from
them
*punct* ;
but
emma
was
aware
that
great
must
be
the
difference
between
a
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
only
half
a
mile
from
them
*punct* ,
and
a
miss
taylor
in
the
house
*punct* ;
and
with
all
her
advantages
*punct* ,
natural
and
domestic
*punct* ,
she
was
now
in
great
danger
of
suffering
from
intellectual
solitude
*punct* .
*break*
she
dearly
loved
her
father
*punct* ,
but
he
was
no
companion
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
meet
her
in
conversation
*punct* ,
rational
or
playful
*punct* .
*break*
the
evil
of
the
actual
disparity
in
their
ages
*punct* ,
and
mr.
woodhouse
had
not
married
early
*punct* ,
was
much
increased
by
his
constitution
and
habits
*punct* ;
for
having
been
a
valetudinarian
all
his
life
*punct* ,
without
activity
of
mind
or
body
*punct* ,
he
was
a
much
older
man
in
ways
than
in
years
*punct* ;
and
though
everywhere
beloved
for
the
friendliness
of
his
heart
and
his
amiable
temper
*punct* ,
his
talents
could
not
have
recommended
him
at
any
time
*punct* .
*break*
her
sister
*punct* ,
though
comparatively
but
little
removed
by
matrimony
*punct* ,
being
settled
in
london
*punct* ,
only
sixteen
miles
off
*punct* ,
was
much
beyond
her
daily
reach
*punct* ;
and
many
a
long
october
and
november
evening
must
be
struggled
through
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
before
christmas
brought
the
next
visit
from
isabella
and
her
husband
*punct* ,
and
their
little
children
*punct* ,
to
fill
the
house
*punct* ,
and
give
her
pleasant
society
again
*punct* .
*break*
highbury
*punct* ,
the
large
and
populous
village
*punct* ,
almost
amounting
to
a
town
*punct* ,
to
which
hartfield
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
its
separate
lawn
*punct* ,
and
shrubberies
*punct* ,
and
name
*punct* ,
did
really
belong
*punct* ,
afforded
her
no
equals
*punct* .
*break*
the
woodhouses
were
first
in
consequence
there
*punct* .
*break*
all
looked
up
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
many
acquaintance
in
the
place
*punct* ,
for
her
father
was
universally
civil
*punct* ,
but
not
one
among
them
who
could
be
accepted
in
lieu
of
miss
taylor
for
even
half
a
day
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
melancholy
change
*punct* ;
and
emma
could
not
but
sigh
over
it
*punct* ,
and
wish
for
impossible
things
*punct* ,
till
her
father
awoke
*punct* ,
and
made
it
necessary
to
be
cheerful
*punct* .
*break*
his
spirits
required
support
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
nervous
man
*punct* ,
easily
depressed
*punct* ;
fond
of
every
body
that
he
was
used
to
*punct* ,
and
hating
to
part
with
them
*punct* ;
hating
change
of
every
kind
*punct* .
*break*
matrimony
*punct* ,
as
the
origin
of
change
*punct* ,
was
always
disagreeable
*punct* ;
and
he
was
by
no
means
yet
reconciled
to
his
own
daughter's
marrying
*punct* ,
nor
could
ever
speak
of
her
but
with
compassion
*punct* ,
though
it
had
been
entirely
a
match
of
affection
*punct* ,
when
he
was
now
obliged
to
part
with
miss
taylor
too
*punct* ;
and
from
his
habits
of
gentle
selfishness
*punct* ,
and
of
being
never
able
to
suppose
that
other
people
could
feel
differently
from
himself
*punct* ,
he
was
very
much
disposed
to
think
miss
taylor
had
done
as
sad
a
thing
for
herself
as
for
them
*punct* ,
and
would
have
been
a
great
deal
happier
if
she
had
spent
all
the
rest
of
her
life
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
emma
smiled
and
chatted
as
cheerfully
as
she
could
*punct* ,
to
keep
him
from
such
thoughts
*punct* ;
but
when
tea
came
*punct* ,
it
was
impossible
for
him
not
to
say
exactly
as
he
had
said
at
dinner
*punct* ,
poor
miss
taylor!
*punct* ,
i
wish
she
were
here
again
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
pity
it
is
that
mr.
weston
ever
thought
of
her
*punct* !
*break*
i
cannot
agree
with
you
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* ;
you
know
i
cannot
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
is
such
a
good-humoured
*punct* ,
pleasant
*punct* ,
excellent
man
*punct* ,
that
he
thoroughly
deserves
a
good
wife;
*punct* ,
and
you
would
not
have
had
miss
taylor
live
with
us
for
ever
*punct* ,
and
bear
all
my
odd
humours
*punct* ,
when
she
might
have
a
house
of
her
own
*punct* ?
*break*
a
house
of
her
own!
*punct* ,
but
where
is
the
advantage
of
a
house
of
her
own
*punct* ?
*break*
this
is
three
times
as
large.
*punct* ,
and
you
have
never
any
odd
humours
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
how
often
we
shall
be
going
to
see
them
*punct* ,
and
they
coming
to
see
us!
*punct* ,
we
shall
be
always
meeting
*punct* !
*break*
we
must
begin
*punct* ;
we
must
go
and
pay
wedding
visit
very
soon
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
how
am
i
to
get
so
far
*punct* ?
*break*
randalls
is
such
a
distance
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
walk
half
so
far
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* ,
nobody
thought
of
your
walking
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
go
in
the
carriage
*punct* ,
to
be
sure
*punct* .
*break*
but
james
will
not
like
to
put
the
horses
to
for
such
a
little
way;
*punct* ,
and
where
are
the
poor
horses
to
be
while
we
are
paying
our
visit
*punct* ?
*break*
they
are
to
be
put
into
mr.
weston's
stable
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
we
have
settled
all
that
already
*punct* .
*break*
we
talked
it
all
over
with
mr.
weston
last
night
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
for
james
*punct* ,
you
may
be
very
sure
he
will
always
like
going
to
randalls
*punct* ,
because
of
his
daughter's
being
housemaid
there
*punct* .
*break*
i
only
doubt
whether
he
will
ever
take
us
anywhere
else
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
your
doing
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* .
*break*
you
got
hannah
that
good
place
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
thought
of
hannah
till
you
mentioned
her
*punct* ,
james
is
so
obliged
to
you
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
very
glad
i
did
think
of
her
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
very
lucky
*punct* ,
for
i
would
not
have
had
poor
james
think
himself
slighted
upon
any
account
*punct* ;
and
i
am
sure
she
will
make
a
very
good
servant
*punct* :
she
is
a
civil
*punct* ,
pretty-spoken
girl
*punct* ;
i
have
a
great
opinion
of
her
*punct* .
*break*
whenever
i
see
her
*punct* ,
she
always
curtseys
and
asks
me
how
i
do
*punct* ,
in
a
very
pretty
manner
*punct* ;
and
when
you
have
had
her
here
to
do
needlework
*punct* ,
i
observe
she
always
turns
the
lock
of
the
door
the
right
way
and
never
bangs
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
she
will
be
an
excellent
servant
*punct* ;
and
it
will
be
a
great
comfort
to
poor
miss
taylor
to
have
somebody
about
her
that
she
is
used
to
see
*punct* .
*break*
whenever
james
goes
over
to
see
his
daughter
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
she
will
be
hearing
of
us
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
be
able
to
tell
her
how
we
all
are
*punct* .
*break*
emma
spared
no
exertions
to
maintain
this
happier
flow
of
ideas
*punct* ,
and
hoped
*punct* ,
by
the
help
of
backgammon
*punct* ,
to
get
her
father
tolerably
through
the
evening
*punct* ,
and
be
attacked
by
no
regrets
but
her
own
*punct* .
*break*
the
backgammon-table
was
placed
*punct* ;
but
a
visitor
immediately
afterwards
walked
in
and
made
it
unnecessary
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
a
sensible
man
about
seven
or
eight-and-thirty
*punct* ,
was
not
only
a
very
old
and
intimate
friend
of
the
family
*punct* ,
but
particularly
connected
with
it
*punct* ,
as
the
elder
brother
of
isabella's
husband
*punct* .
*break*
he
lived
about
a
mile
from
highbury
*punct* ,
was
a
frequent
visitor
*punct* ,
and
always
welcome
*punct* ,
and
at
this
time
more
welcome
than
usual
*punct* ,
as
coming
directly
from
their
mutual
connexions
in
london
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
returned
to
a
late
dinner
*punct* ,
after
some
days
absence
*punct* ,
and
now
walked
up
to
hartfield
to
say
that
all
were
well
in
brunswick
square
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
happy
circumstance
*punct* ,
and
animated
mr.
woodhouse
for
some
time
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
had
a
cheerful
manner
*punct* ,
which
always
did
him
good
*punct* ;
and
his
many
inquiries
after
poor
isabella
and
her
children
were
answered
most
satisfactorily
*punct* .
*break*
when
this
was
over
*punct* ,
mr.
woodhouse
gratefully
observed
*punct* ,
it
is
very
kind
of
you
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
to
come
out
at
this
late
hour
to
call
upon
us
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
afraid
you
must
have
had
a
shocking
walk
*punct* .
*break*
not
at
all
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
*punct* ;
and
so
mild
that
i
must
draw
back
from
your
great
fire
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
must
have
found
it
very
damp
and
dirty
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
you
may
not
catch
cold
*punct* .
*break*
dirty
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
look
at
my
shoes
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
speck
on
them
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
quite
surprising
*punct* ,
for
we
have
had
a
vast
deal
of
rain
here
*punct* .
*break*
it
rained
dreadfully
hard
for
half
an
hour
while
we
were
at
breakfast
*punct* .
*break*
i
wanted
them
to
put
off
the
wedding
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
bye
*punct* ,
i
have
not
wished
you
joy
*punct* .
*break*
being
pretty
well
aware
of
what
sort
of
joy
you
must
both
be
feeling
*punct* ,
i
have
been
in
no
hurry
with
my
congratulations
*punct* ;
but
i
hope
it
all
went
off
tolerably
well
*punct* .
*break*
how
did
you
all
behave
*punct* ?
*break*
who
cried
most
*punct* ?
*break*
poor
miss
taylor
*punct* !
*break*
tis
a
sad
business
*punct* .
*break*
poor
mr.
and
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* ;
but
i
cannot
possibly
say
poor
miss
taylor
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
a
great
regard
for
you
and
emma
*punct* ;
but
when
it
comes
to
the
question
of
dependence
or
independence!
*punct* ,
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
it
must
be
better
to
have
only
one
to
please
than
two
*punct* .
*break*
especially
when
one
of
those
two
is
such
a
fanciful
*punct* ,
troublesome
creature
*punct* !
*break*
said
emma
playfully
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
what
you
have
in
your
head
*punct* ,
i
know
*punct* ,
and
what
you
would
certainly
say
if
my
father
were
not
by
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
it
is
very
true
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
said
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
with
a
sigh
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
afraid
i
am
sometimes
very
fanciful
and
troublesome
*punct* .
*break*
my
dearest
papa
*punct* !
*break*
you
do
not
think
i
could
mean
you
*punct* ,
or
suppose
mr.
knightley
to
mean
you
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
horrible
idea
*punct* !
*break*
i
meant
only
myself
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
loves
to
find
fault
with
me
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
in
a
joke
*punct* ,
it
is
all
a
joke
*punct* .
*break*
we
always
say
what
we
like
to
one
another
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
was
one
of
the
few
people
who
could
see
faults
in
emma
woodhouse
*punct* ,
and
the
only
one
who
ever
told
her
of
them
*punct* :
and
though
this
was
not
particularly
agreeable
to
emma
herself
*punct* ,
she
knew
it
would
be
so
much
less
so
to
her
father
*punct* ,
that
she
would
not
have
him
really
suspect
such
a
circumstance
as
her
not
being
thought
perfect
by
every
body
*punct* .
*break*
emma
knows
i
never
flatter
her
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
but
i
meant
no
reflection
on
any
body
*punct* .
*break*
miss
taylor
has
been
used
to
have
two
persons
to
please
*punct* ;
she
will
now
have
but
one
*punct* .
*break*
the
chances
are
that
she
must
be
a
gainer
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
willing
to
let
it
pass
*punct* ,
you
want
to
hear
about
the
wedding
*punct* ;
and
i
shall
be
happy
to
tell
you
*punct* ,
for
we
all
behaved
charmingly
*punct* .
*break*
every
body
was
punctual
*punct* ,
every
body
in
their
best
looks
*punct* :
not
a
tear
*punct* ,
and
hardly
a
long
face
to
be
seen
*punct* .
*break*
oh
no
*punct* ;
we
all
felt
that
we
were
going
to
be
only
half
a
mile
apart
*punct* ,
and
were
sure
of
meeting
every
day
*punct* .
*break*
dear
emma
bears
every
thing
so
well
*punct* ,
said
her
father
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
she
is
really
very
sorry
to
lose
poor
miss
taylor
*punct* ,
and
i
am
sure
she
will
miss
her
more
than
she
thinks
for
*punct* .
*break*
emma
turned
away
her
head
*punct* ,
divided
between
tears
and
smiles
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
impossible
that
emma
should
not
miss
such
a
companion
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
we
should
not
like
her
so
well
as
we
do
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
if
we
could
suppose
it
*punct* ;
but
she
knows
how
much
the
marriage
is
to
miss
taylor's
advantage
*punct* ;
she
knows
how
very
acceptable
it
must
be
*punct* ,
at
miss
taylor's
time
of
life
*punct* ,
to
be
settled
in
a
home
of
her
own
*punct* ,
and
how
important
to
her
to
be
secure
of
a
comfortable
provision
*punct* ,
and
therefore
cannot
allow
herself
to
feel
so
much
pain
as
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
every
friend
of
miss
taylor
must
be
glad
to
have
her
so
happily
married
*punct* .
*break*
and
you
have
forgotten
one
matter
of
joy
to
me
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
and
a
very
considerable
one
*punct* ,
that
i
made
the
match
myself
*punct* .
*break*
i
made
the
match
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
four
years
ago
*punct* ;
and
to
have
it
take
place
*punct* ,
and
be
proved
in
the
right
*punct* ,
when
so
many
people
said
mr.
weston
would
never
marry
again
*punct* ,
may
comfort
me
for
any
thing
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
shook
his
head
at
her
*punct* .
*break*
her
father
fondly
replied
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* !
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
i
wish
you
would
not
make
matches
and
foretell
things
*punct* ,
for
whatever
you
say
always
comes
to
pass
*punct* .
*break*
pray
do
not
make
any
more
matches
*punct* .
*break*
i
promise
you
to
make
none
for
myself
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* ;
but
i
must
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
for
other
people
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
the
greatest
amusement
in
the
world
*punct* !
*break*
and
after
such
success
*punct* ,
you
know!
*punct* ,
every
body
said
that
mr.
weston
would
never
marry
again
*punct* .
*break*
oh
dear
*punct* ,
no
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
who
had
been
a
widower
so
long
*punct* ,
and
who
seemed
so
perfectly
comfortable
without
a
wife
*punct* ,
so
constantly
occupied
either
in
his
business
in
town
or
among
his
friends
here
*punct* ,
always
acceptable
wherever
he
went
*punct* ,
always
cheerful
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
need
not
spend
a
single
evening
in
the
year
alone
if
he
did
not
like
it
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
certainly
would
never
marry
again
*punct* .
*break*
some
people
even
talked
of
a
promise
to
his
wife
on
her
deathbed
*punct* ,
and
others
of
the
son
and
the
uncle
not
letting
him
*punct* .
*break*
all
manner
of
solemn
nonsense
was
talked
on
the
subject
*punct* ,
but
i
believed
none
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
ever
since
the
day
*punct* ,
about
four
years
ago
*punct* ,
that
miss
taylor
and
i
met
with
him
in
broadway
lane
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
because
it
began
to
drizzle
*punct* ,
he
darted
away
with
so
much
gallantry
*punct* ,
and
borrowed
two
umbrellas
for
us
from
farmer
mitchell's
*punct* ,
i
made
up
my
mind
on
the
subject
*punct* .
*break*
i
planned
the
match
from
that
hour
*punct* ;
and
when
such
success
has
blessed
me
in
this
instance
*punct* ,
dear
papa
*punct* ,
you
cannot
think
that
i
shall
leave
off
match-making
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
by
success
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
success
supposes
endeavour
*punct* .
*break*
your
time
has
been
properly
and
delicately
spent
*punct* ,
if
you
have
been
endeavouring
for
the
last
four
years
to
bring
about
this
marriage
*punct* .
*break*
a
worthy
employment
for
a
young
lady's
mind
*punct* !
*break*
but
if
*punct* ,
which
i
rather
imagine
*punct* ,
your
making
the
match
*punct* ,
as
you
call
it
*punct* ,
means
only
your
planning
it
*punct* ,
your
saying
to
yourself
one
idle
day
*punct* ,
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
thing
for
miss
taylor
if
mr.
weston
were
to
marry
her
*punct* ,
and
saying
it
again
to
yourself
every
now
and
then
afterwards
*punct* ,
why
do
you
talk
of
success
*punct* ?
*break*
where
is
your
merit
*punct* ?
*break*
what
are
you
proud
of
*punct* ?
*break*
you
made
a
lucky
guess
*punct* ;
and
that
is
all
that
can
be
said
*punct* .
*break*
and
have
you
never
known
the
pleasure
and
triumph
of
a
lucky
guess?
*punct* ,
i
pity
you.
*punct* ,
i
thought
you
cleverer
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
depend
upon
it
a
lucky
guess
is
never
merely
luck
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
always
some
talent
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
to
my
poor
word
success
*punct* ,
which
you
quarrel
with
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
that
i
am
so
entirely
without
any
claim
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
drawn
two
pretty
pictures
*punct* ;
but
i
think
there
may
be
a
third
*punct* ,
a
something
between
the
do-nothing
and
the
do-all
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
had
not
promoted
mr.
weston's
visits
here
*punct* ,
and
given
many
little
encouragements
*punct* ,
and
smoothed
many
little
matters
*punct* ,
it
might
not
have
come
to
any
thing
after
all
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
you
must
know
hartfield
enough
to
comprehend
that
*punct* .
*break*
a
straightforward
*punct* ,
open-hearted
man
like
weston
*punct* ,
and
a
rational
*punct* ,
unaffected
woman
like
miss
taylor
*punct* ,
may
be
safely
left
to
manage
their
own
concerns
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
more
likely
to
have
done
harm
to
yourself
*punct* ,
than
good
to
them
*punct* ,
by
interference
*punct* .
*break*
emma
never
thinks
of
herself
*punct* ,
if
she
can
do
good
to
others
*punct* ,
rejoined
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
understanding
but
in
part
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
pray
do
not
make
any
more
matches
*punct* ;
they
are
silly
things
*punct* ,
and
break
up
one's
family
circle
grievously
*punct* .
*break*
only
one
more
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* ;
only
for
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
poor
mr.
elton
*punct* !
*break*
you
like
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
papa,
*punct* ,
i
must
look
about
for
a
wife
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
nobody
in
highbury
who
deserves
him
*punct* ,
and
he
has
been
here
a
whole
year
*punct* ,
and
has
fitted
up
his
house
so
comfortably
*punct* ,
that
it
would
be
a
shame
to
have
him
single
any
longer
*punct* ,
and
i
thought
when
he
was
joining
their
hands
to-day
*punct* ,
he
looked
so
very
much
as
if
he
would
like
to
have
the
same
kind
office
done
for
him
*punct* !
*break*
i
think
very
well
of
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
and
this
is
the
only
way
i
have
of
doing
him
a
service
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
is
a
very
pretty
young
man
*punct* ,
to
be
sure
*punct* ,
and
a
very
good
young
man
*punct* ,
and
i
have
a
great
regard
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
you
want
to
shew
him
any
attention
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
ask
him
to
come
and
dine
with
us
some
day
*punct* .
*break*
that
will
be
a
much
better
thing
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
mr.
knightley
will
be
so
kind
as
to
meet
him
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
at
any
time
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
laughing
*punct* ,
and
i
agree
with
you
entirely
*punct* ,
that
it
will
be
a
much
better
thing
*punct* .
*break*
invite
him
to
dinner
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
and
help
him
to
the
best
of
the
fish
and
the
chicken
*punct* ,
but
leave
him
to
chuse
his
own
wife
*punct* .
*break*
depend
upon
it
*punct* ,
a
man
of
six
or
seven-and-twenty
can
take
care
of
himself
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
was
a
native
of
highbury
*punct* ,
and
born
of
a
respectable
family
*punct* ,
which
for
the
last
two
or
three
generations
had
been
rising
into
gentility
and
property
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
received
a
good
education
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
on
succeeding
early
in
life
to
a
small
independence
*punct* ,
had
become
indisposed
for
any
of
the
more
homely
pursuits
in
which
his
brothers
were
engaged
*punct* ,
and
had
satisfied
an
active
*punct* ,
cheerful
mind
and
social
temper
by
entering
into
the
militia
of
his
county
*punct* ,
then
embodied
*punct* .
*break*
captain
weston
was
a
general
favourite
*punct* ;
and
when
the
chances
of
his
military
life
had
introduced
him
to
miss
churchill
*punct* ,
of
a
great
yorkshire
family
*punct* ,
and
miss
churchill
fell
in
love
with
him
*punct* ,
nobody
was
surprized
*punct* ,
except
her
brother
and
his
wife
*punct* ,
who
had
never
seen
him
*punct* ,
and
who
were
full
of
pride
and
importance
*punct* ,
which
the
connexion
would
offend
*punct* .
*break*
miss
churchill
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
being
of
age
*punct* ,
and
with
the
full
command
of
her
fortune
*punct* ,
though
her
fortune
bore
no
proportion
to
the
family-estate
*punct* ,
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
from
the
marriage
*punct* ,
and
it
took
place
*punct* ,
to
the
infinite
mortification
of
mr.
and
mrs.
churchill
*punct* ,
who
threw
her
off
with
due
decorum
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
an
unsuitable
connexion
*punct* ,
and
did
not
produce
much
happiness
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
ought
to
have
found
more
in
it
*punct* ,
for
she
had
a
husband
whose
warm
heart
and
sweet
temper
made
him
think
every
thing
due
to
her
in
return
for
the
great
goodness
of
being
in
love
with
him
*punct* ;
but
though
she
had
one
sort
of
spirit
*punct* ,
she
had
not
the
best
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
resolution
enough
to
pursue
her
own
will
in
spite
of
her
brother
*punct* ,
but
not
enough
to
refrain
from
unreasonable
regrets
at
that
brother's
unreasonable
anger
*punct* ,
nor
from
missing
the
luxuries
of
her
former
home
*punct* .
*break*
they
lived
beyond
their
income
*punct* ,
but
still
it
was
nothing
in
comparison
of
enscombe
*punct* :
she
did
not
cease
to
love
her
husband
*punct* ,
but
she
wanted
at
once
to
be
the
wife
of
captain
weston
*punct* ,
and
miss
churchill
of
enscombe
*punct* .
*break*
captain
weston
*punct* ,
who
had
been
considered
*punct* ,
especially
by
the
churchills
*punct* ,
as
making
such
an
amazing
match
*punct* ,
was
proved
to
have
much
the
worst
of
the
bargain
*punct* ;
for
when
his
wife
died
*punct* ,
after
a
three
years
marriage
*punct* ,
he
was
rather
a
poorer
man
than
at
first
*punct* ,
and
with
a
child
to
maintain
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
expense
of
the
child
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
was
soon
relieved
*punct* .
*break*
the
boy
had
*punct* ,
with
the
additional
softening
claim
of
a
lingering
illness
of
his
mother's
*punct* ,
been
the
means
of
a
sort
of
reconciliation
*punct* ;
and
mr.
and
mrs.
churchill
*punct* ,
having
no
children
of
their
own
*punct* ,
nor
any
other
young
creature
of
equal
kindred
to
care
for
*punct* ,
offered
to
take
the
whole
charge
of
the
little
frank
soon
after
her
decease
*punct* .
*break*
some
scruples
and
some
reluctance
the
widower-father
may
be
supposed
to
have
felt
*punct* ;
but
as
they
were
overcome
by
other
considerations
*punct* ,
the
child
was
given
up
to
the
care
and
the
wealth
of
the
churchills
*punct* ,
and
he
had
only
his
own
comfort
to
seek
*punct* ,
and
his
own
situation
to
improve
as
he
could
*punct* .
*break*
a
complete
change
of
life
became
desirable
*punct* .
*break*
he
quitted
the
militia
and
engaged
in
trade
*punct* ,
having
brothers
already
established
in
a
good
way
in
london
*punct* ,
which
afforded
him
a
favourable
opening
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
concern
which
brought
just
employment
enough
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
still
a
small
house
in
highbury
*punct* ,
where
most
of
his
leisure
days
were
spent
*punct* ;
and
between
useful
occupation
and
the
pleasures
of
society
*punct* ,
the
next
eighteen
or
twenty
years
of
his
life
passed
cheerfully
away
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
*punct* ,
by
that
time
*punct* ,
realised
an
easy
competence
*punct* ,
enough
to
secure
the
purchase
of
a
little
estate
adjoining
highbury
*punct* ,
which
he
had
always
longed
for
*punct* ,
enough
to
marry
a
woman
as
portionless
even
as
miss
taylor
*punct* ,
and
to
live
according
to
the
wishes
of
his
own
friendly
and
social
disposition

it
was
now
some
time
since
miss
taylor
had
begun
to
influence
his
schemes
*punct* ;
but
as
it
was
not
the
tyrannic
influence
of
youth
on
youth
*punct* ,
it
had
not
shaken
his
determination
of
never
settling
till
he
could
purchase
randalls
*punct* ,
and
the
sale
of
randalls
was
long
looked
forward
to
*punct* ;
but
he
had
gone
steadily
on
*punct* ,
with
these
objects
in
view
*punct* ,
till
they
were
accomplished
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
made
his
fortune
*punct* ,
bought
his
house
*punct* ,
and
obtained
his
wife
*punct* ;
and
was
beginning
a
new
period
of
existence
*punct* ,
with
every
probability
of
greater
happiness
than
in
any
yet
passed
through
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
never
been
an
unhappy
man
*punct* ;
his
own
temper
had
secured
him
from
that
*punct* ,
even
in
his
first
marriage
*punct* ;
but
his
second
must
shew
him
how
delightful
a
well-judging
and
truly
amiable
woman
could
be
*punct* ,
and
must
give
him
the
pleasantest
proof
of
its
being
a
great
deal
better
to
choose
than
to
be
chosen
*punct* ,
to
excite
gratitude
than
to
feel
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
only
himself
to
please
in
his
choice
*punct* :
his
fortune
was
his
own
*punct* ;
for
as
to
frank
*punct* ,
it
was
more
than
being
tacitly
brought
up
as
his
uncle's
heir
*punct* ,
it
had
become
so
avowed
an
adoption
as
to
have
him
assume
the
name
of
churchill
on
coming
of
age
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
most
unlikely
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
that
he
should
ever
want
his
father's
assistance
*punct* .
*break*
his
father
had
no
apprehension
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
aunt
was
a
capricious
woman
*punct* ,
and
governed
her
husband
entirely
*punct* ;
but
it
was
not
in
mr.
weston's
nature
to
imagine
that
any
caprice
could
be
strong
enough
to
affect
one
so
dear
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
he
believed
*punct* ,
so
deservedly
dear
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
his
son
every
year
in
london
*punct* ,
and
was
proud
of
him
*punct* ;
and
his
fond
report
of
him
as
a
very
fine
young
man
had
made
highbury
feel
a
sort
of
pride
in
him
too
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
looked
on
as
sufficiently
belonging
to
the
place
to
make
his
merits
and
prospects
a
kind
of
common
concern
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
frank
churchill
was
one
of
the
boasts
of
highbury
*punct* ,
and
a
lively
curiosity
to
see
him
prevailed
*punct* ,
though
the
compliment
was
so
little
returned
that
he
had
never
been
there
in
his
life
*punct* .
*break*
his
coming
to
visit
his
father
had
been
often
talked
of
but
never
achieved
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
upon
his
father's
marriage
*punct* ,
it
was
very
generally
proposed
*punct* ,
as
a
most
proper
attention
*punct* ,
that
the
visit
should
take
place
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
not
a
dissentient
voice
on
the
subject
*punct* ,
either
when
mrs.
perry
drank
tea
with
mrs.
and
miss
bates
*punct* ,
or
when
mrs.
and
miss
bates
returned
the
visit
*punct* .
*break*
now
was
the
time
for
mr.
frank
churchill
to
come
among
them
*punct* ;
and
the
hope
strengthened
when
it
was
understood
that
he
had
written
to
his
new
mother
on
the
occasion
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
few
days
*punct* ,
every
morning
visit
in
highbury
included
some
mention
of
the
handsome
letter
mrs.
weston
had
received
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
you
have
heard
of
the
handsome
letter
mr.
frank
churchill
has
written
to
mrs.
weston
*punct* ?
*break*
i
understand
it
was
a
very
handsome
letter
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
told
me
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
saw
the
letter
*punct* ,
and
he
says
he
never
saw
such
a
handsome
letter
in
his
life
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
a
highly
prized
letter
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
had
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
formed
a
very
favourable
idea
of
the
young
man
*punct* ;
and
such
a
pleasing
attention
was
an
irresistible
proof
of
his
great
good
sense
*punct* ,
and
a
most
welcome
addition
to
every
source
and
every
expression
of
congratulation
which
her
marriage
had
already
secured
*punct* .
*break*
she
felt
herself
a
most
fortunate
woman
*punct* ;
and
she
had
lived
long
enough
to
know
how
fortunate
she
might
well
be
thought
*punct* ,
where
the
only
regret
was
for
a
partial
separation
from
friends
whose
friendship
for
her
had
never
cooled
*punct* ,
and
who
could
ill
bear
to
part
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
knew
that
at
times
she
must
be
missed
*punct* ;
and
could
not
think
*punct* ,
without
pain
*punct* ,
of
emma's
losing
a
single
pleasure
*punct* ,
or
suffering
an
hour's
ennui
*punct* ,
from
the
want
of
her
companionableness
*punct* :
but
dear
emma
was
of
no
feeble
character
*punct* ;
she
was
more
equal
to
her
situation
than
most
girls
would
have
been
*punct* ,
and
had
sense
*punct* ,
and
energy
*punct* ,
and
spirits
that
might
be
hoped
would
bear
her
well
and
happily
through
its
little
difficulties
and
privations
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
there
was
such
comfort
in
the
very
easy
distance
of
randalls
from
hartfield
*punct* ,
so
convenient
for
even
solitary
female
walking
*punct* ,
and
in
mr.
weston's
disposition
and
circumstances
*punct* ,
which
would
make
the
approaching
season
no
hindrance
to
their
spending
half
the
evenings
in
the
week
together
*punct* .
*break*
her
situation
was
altogether
the
subject
of
hours
of
gratitude
to
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
and
of
moments
only
of
regret
*punct* ;
and
her
satisfaction
*punct* ,
her
more
than
satisfaction
*punct* ,
her
cheerful
enjoyment
*punct* ,
was
so
just
and
so
apparent
*punct* ,
that
emma
*punct* ,
well
as
she
knew
her
father
*punct* ,
was
sometimes
taken
by
surprize
at
his
being
still
able
to
pity
poor
miss
taylor
*punct* ,
when
they
left
her
at
randalls
in
the
centre
of
every
domestic
comfort
*punct* ,
or
saw
her
go
away
in
the
evening
attended
by
her
pleasant
husband
to
a
carriage
of
her
own
*punct* .
*break*
but
never
did
she
go
without
mr.
woodhouse's
giving
a
gentle
sigh
*punct* ,
and
saying
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* ,
poor
miss
taylor
*punct* !
*break*
she
would
be
very
glad
to
stay
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
recovering
miss
taylor
*punct* ,
nor
much
likelihood
of
ceasing
to
pity
her
*punct* ;
but
a
few
weeks
brought
some
alleviation
to
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* .
*break*
the
compliments
of
his
neighbours
were
over
*punct* ;
he
was
no
longer
teased
by
being
wished
joy
of
so
sorrowful
an
event
*punct* ;
and
the
wedding-cake
*punct* ,
which
had
been
a
great
distress
to
him
*punct* ,
was
all
eat
up
*punct* .
*break*
his
own
stomach
could
bear
nothing
rich
*punct* ,
and
he
could
never
believe
other
people
to
be
different
from
himself
*punct* .
*break*
what
was
unwholesome
to
him
he
regarded
as
unfit
for
any
body
*punct* ;
and
he
had
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
earnestly
tried
to
dissuade
them
from
having
any
wedding-cake
at
all
*punct* ,
and
when
that
proved
vain
*punct* ,
as
earnestly
tried
to
prevent
any
body's
eating
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
at
the
pains
of
consulting
mr.
perry
*punct* ,
the
apothecary
*punct* ,
on
the
subject
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
perry
was
an
intelligent
*punct* ,
gentlemanlike
man
*punct* ,
whose
frequent
visits
were
one
of
the
comforts
of
mr.
woodhouse's
life
*punct* ;
and
upon
being
applied
to
*punct* ,
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
*punct* ,
though
it
seemed
rather
against
the
bias
of
inclination
*punct* ,
that
wedding-cake
might
certainly
disagree
with
many
*punct* ,
perhaps
with
most
people
*punct* ,
unless
taken
moderately
*punct* .
*break*
with
such
an
opinion
*punct* ,
in
confirmation
of
his
own
*punct* ,
mr.
woodhouse
hoped
to
influence
every
visitor
of
the
newly
married
pair
*punct* ;
but
still
the
cake
was
eaten
*punct* ;
and
there
was
no
rest
for
his
benevolent
nerves
till
it
was
all
gone
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
strange
rumour
in
highbury
of
all
the
little
perrys
being
seen
with
a
slice
of
mrs.
weston's
wedding-cake
in
their
hands
*punct* :
but
mr.
woodhouse
would
never
believe
it
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
was
fond
of
society
in
his
own
way
*punct* .
*break*
he
liked
very
much
to
have
his
friends
come
and
see
him
*punct* ;
and
from
various
united
causes
*punct* ,
from
his
long
residence
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
and
his
good
nature
*punct* ,
from
his
fortune
*punct* ,
his
house
*punct* ,
and
his
daughter
*punct* ,
he
could
command
the
visits
of
his
own
little
circle
*punct* ,
in
a
great
measure
*punct* ,
as
he
liked
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
not
much
intercourse
with
any
families
beyond
that
circle
*punct* ;
his
horror
of
late
hours
*punct* ,
and
large
dinner-parties
*punct* ,
made
him
unfit
for
any
acquaintance
but
such
as
would
visit
him
on
his
own
terms
*punct* .
*break*
fortunately
for
him
*punct* ,
highbury
*punct* ,
including
randalls
in
the
same
parish
*punct* ,
and
donwell
abbey
in
the
parish
adjoining
*punct* ,
the
seat
of
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
comprehended
many
such
*punct* .
*break*
not
unfrequently
*punct* ,
through
emma's
persuasion
*punct* ,
he
had
some
of
the
chosen
and
the
best
to
dine
with
him
*punct* :
but
evening
parties
were
what
he
preferred
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
unless
he
fancied
himself
at
any
time
unequal
to
company
*punct* ,
there
was
scarcely
an
evening
in
the
week
in
which
emma
could
not
make
up
a
card-table
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
real
*punct* ,
long-standing
regard
brought
the
westons
and
mr.
knightley
*punct* ;
and
by
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
a
young
man
living
alone
without
liking
it
*punct* ,
the
privilege
of
exchanging
any
vacant
evening
of
his
own
blank
solitude
for
the
elegancies
and
society
of
mr.
woodhouse's
drawing-room
*punct* ,
and
the
smiles
of
his
lovely
daughter
*punct* ,
was
in
no
danger
of
being
thrown
away
*punct* .
*break*
after
these
came
a
second
set
*punct* ;
among
the
most
come-at-able
of
whom
were
mrs.
and
miss
bates
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
goddard
*punct* ,
three
ladies
almost
always
at
the
service
of
an
invitation
from
hartfield
*punct* ,
and
who
were
fetched
and
carried
home
so
often
*punct* ,
that
mr.
woodhouse
thought
it
no
hardship
for
either
james
or
the
horses
*punct* .
*break*
had
it
taken
place
only
once
a
year
*punct* ,
it
would
have
been
a
grievance
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
bates
*punct* ,
the
widow
of
a
former
vicar
of
highbury
*punct* ,
was
a
very
old
lady
*punct* ,
almost
past
every
thing
but
tea
and
quadrille
*punct* .
*break*
she
lived
with
her
single
daughter
in
a
very
small
way
*punct* ,
and
was
considered
with
all
the
regard
and
respect
which
a
harmless
old
lady
*punct* ,
under
such
untoward
circumstances
*punct* ,
can
excite
*punct* .
*break*
her
daughter
enjoyed
a
most
uncommon
degree
of
popularity
for
a
woman
neither
young
*punct* ,
handsome
*punct* ,
rich
*punct* ,
nor
married
*punct* .
*break*
miss
bates
stood
in
the
very
worst
predicament
in
the
world
for
having
much
of
the
public
favour
*punct* ;
and
she
had
no
intellectual
superiority
to
make
atonement
to
herself
*punct* ,
or
frighten
those
who
might
hate
her
into
outward
respect
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
never
boasted
either
beauty
or
cleverness
*punct* .
*break*
her
youth
had
passed
without
distinction
*punct* ,
and
her
middle
of
life
was
devoted
to
the
care
of
a
failing
mother
*punct* ,
and
the
endeavour
to
make
a
small
income
go
as
far
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
and
yet
she
was
a
happy
woman
*punct* ,
and
a
woman
whom
no
one
named
without
good-will
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
her
own
universal
good-will
and
contented
temper
which
worked
such
wonders
*punct* .
*break*
she
loved
every
body
*punct* ,
was
interested
in
every
body's
happiness
*punct* ,
quicksighted
to
every
body's
merits
*punct* ;
thought
herself
a
most
fortunate
creature
*punct* ,
and
surrounded
with
blessings
in
such
an
excellent
mother
*punct* ,
and
so
many
good
neighbours
and
friends
*punct* ,
and
a
home
that
wanted
for
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
the
simplicity
and
cheerfulness
of
her
nature
*punct* ,
her
contented
and
grateful
spirit
*punct* ,
were
a
recommendation
to
every
body
*punct* ,
and
a
mine
of
felicity
to
herself
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
a
great
talker
upon
little
matters
*punct* ,
which
exactly
suited
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
full
of
trivial
communications
and
harmless
gossip
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
goddard
was
the
mistress
of
a
school
*punct* ,
not
of
a
seminary
*punct* ,
or
an
establishment
*punct* ,
or
any
thing
which
professed
*punct* ,
in
long
sentences
of
refined
nonsense
*punct* ,
to
combine
liberal
acquirements
with
elegant
morality
*punct* ,
upon
new
principles
and
new
systems
*punct* ,
and
where
young
ladies
for
enormous
pay
might
be
screwed
out
of
health
and
into
vanity
*punct* ,
but
a
real
*punct* ,
honest
*punct* ,
old-fashioned
boarding-school
*punct* ,
where
a
reasonable
quantity
of
accomplishments
were
sold
at
a
reasonable
price
*punct* ,
and
where
girls
might
be
sent
to
be
out
of
the
way
*punct* ,
and
scramble
themselves
into
a
little
education
*punct* ,
without
any
danger
of
coming
back
prodigies
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
goddard's
school
was
in
high
repute
*punct* ,
and
very
deservedly
*punct* ;
for
highbury
was
reckoned
a
particularly
healthy
spot
*punct* :
she
had
an
ample
house
and
garden
*punct* ,
gave
the
children
plenty
of
wholesome
food
*punct* ,
let
them
run
about
a
great
deal
in
the
summer
*punct* ,
and
in
winter
dressed
their
chilblains
with
her
own
hands
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
no
wonder
that
a
train
of
twenty
young
couple
now
walked
after
her
to
church
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
a
plain
*punct* ,
motherly
kind
of
woman
*punct* ,
who
had
worked
hard
in
her
youth
*punct* ,
and
now
thought
herself
entitled
to
the
occasional
holiday
of
a
tea-visit
*punct* ;
and
having
formerly
owed
much
to
mr.
woodhouse's
kindness
*punct* ,
felt
his
particular
claim
on
her
to
leave
her
neat
parlour
*punct* ,
hung
round
with
fancy-work
*punct* ,
whenever
she
could
*punct* ,
and
win
or
lose
a
few
sixpences
by
his
fireside
*punct* .
*break*
these
were
the
ladies
whom
emma
found
herself
very
frequently
able
to
collect
*punct* ;
and
happy
was
she
*punct* ,
for
her
father's
sake
*punct* ,
in
the
power
*punct* ;
though
*punct* ,
as
far
as
she
was
herself
concerned
*punct* ,
it
was
no
remedy
for
the
absence
of
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
delighted
to
see
her
father
look
comfortable
*punct* ,
and
very
much
pleased
with
herself
for
contriving
things
so
well
*punct* ;
but
the
quiet
prosings
of
three
such
women
made
her
feel
that
every
evening
so
spent
was
indeed
one
of
the
long
evenings
she
had
fearfully
anticipated
*punct* .
*break*
as
she
sat
one
morning
*punct* ,
looking
forward
to
exactly
such
a
close
of
the
present
day
*punct* ,
a
note
was
brought
from
mrs.
goddard
*punct* ,
requesting
*punct* ,
in
most
respectful
terms
*punct* ,
to
be
allowed
to
bring
miss
smith
with
her
*punct* ;
a
most
welcome
request
*punct* :
for
miss
smith
was
a
girl
of
seventeen
*punct* ,
whom
emma
knew
very
well
by
sight
*punct* ,
and
had
long
felt
an
interest
in
*punct* ,
on
account
of
her
beauty
*punct* .
*break*
a
very
gracious
invitation
was
returned
*punct* ,
and
the
evening
no
longer
dreaded
by
the
fair
mistress
of
the
mansion
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
smith
was
the
natural
daughter
of
somebody
*punct* .
*break*
somebody
had
placed
her
*punct* ,
several
years
back
*punct* ,
at
mrs.
goddard's
school
*punct* ,
and
somebody
had
lately
raised
her
from
the
condition
of
scholar
to
that
of
parlour-boarder
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
all
that
was
generally
known
of
her
history
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
no
visible
friends
but
what
had
been
acquired
at
highbury
*punct* ,
and
was
now
just
returned
from
a
long
visit
in
the
country
to
some
young
ladies
who
had
been
at
school
there
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
a
very
pretty
girl
*punct* ,
and
her
beauty
happened
to
be
of
a
sort
which
emma
particularly
admired
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
short
*punct* ,
plump
*punct* ,
and
fair
*punct* ,
with
a
fine
bloom
*punct* ,
blue
eyes
*punct* ,
light
hair
*punct* ,
regular
features
*punct* ,
and
a
look
of
great
sweetness
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
before
the
end
of
the
evening
*punct* ,
emma
was
as
much
pleased
with
her
manners
as
her
person
*punct* ,
and
quite
determined
to
continue
the
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
not
struck
by
any
thing
remarkably
clever
in
miss
smith's
conversation
*punct* ,
but
she
found
her
altogether
very
engaging
*punct* ,
not
inconveniently
shy
*punct* ,
not
unwilling
to
talk
*punct* ,
and
yet
so
far
from
pushing
*punct* ,
shewing
so
proper
and
becoming
a
deference
*punct* ,
seeming
so
pleasantly
grateful
for
being
admitted
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
and
so
artlessly
impressed
by
the
appearance
of
every
thing
in
so
superior
a
style
to
what
she
had
been
used
to
*punct* ,
that
she
must
have
good
sense
*punct* ,
and
deserve
encouragement
*punct* .
*break*
encouragement
should
be
given
*punct* .
*break*
those
soft
blue
eyes
*punct* ,
and
all
those
natural
graces
*punct* ,
should
not
be
wasted
on
the
inferior
society
of
highbury
and
its
connexions
*punct* .
*break*
the
acquaintance
she
had
already
formed
were
unworthy
of
her
*punct* .
*break*
the
friends
from
whom
she
had
just
parted
*punct* ,
though
very
good
sort
of
people
*punct* ,
must
be
doing
her
harm
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
a
family
of
the
name
of
martin
*punct* ,
whom
emma
well
knew
by
character
*punct* ,
as
renting
a
large
farm
of
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
and
residing
in
the
parish
of
donwell
*punct* ,
very
creditably
*punct* ,
she
believed
*punct* ,
she
knew
mr.
knightley
thought
highly
of
them
*punct* ,
but
they
must
be
coarse
and
unpolished
*punct* ,
and
very
unfit
to
be
the
intimates
of
a
girl
who
wanted
only
a
little
more
knowledge
and
elegance
to
be
quite
perfect
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
notice
her
*punct* ;
she
would
improve
her
*punct* ;
she
would
detach
her
from
her
bad
acquaintance
*punct* ,
and
introduce
her
into
good
society
*punct* ;
she
would
form
her
opinions
and
her
manners
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
an
interesting
*punct* ,
and
certainly
a
very
kind
undertaking
*punct* ;
highly
becoming
her
own
situation
in
life
*punct* ,
her
leisure
*punct* ,
and
powers
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
so
busy
in
admiring
those
soft
blue
eyes
*punct* ,
in
talking
and
listening
*punct* ,
and
forming
all
these
schemes
in
the
in-betweens
*punct* ,
that
the
evening
flew
away
at
a
very
unusual
rate
*punct* ;
and
the
supper-table
*punct* ,
which
always
closed
such
parties
*punct* ,
and
for
which
she
had
been
used
to
sit
and
watch
the
due
time
*punct* ,
was
all
set
out
and
ready
*punct* ,
and
moved
forwards
to
the
fire
*punct* ,
before
she
was
aware
*punct* .
*break*
with
an
alacrity
beyond
the
common
impulse
of
a
spirit
which
yet
was
never
indifferent
to
the
credit
of
doing
every
thing
well
and
attentively
*punct* ,
with
the
real
good-will
of
a
mind
delighted
with
its
own
ideas
*punct* ,
did
she
then
do
all
the
honours
of
the
meal
*punct* ,
and
help
and
recommend
the
minced
chicken
and
scalloped
oysters
*punct* ,
with
an
urgency
which
she
knew
would
be
acceptable
to
the
early
hours
and
civil
scruples
of
their
guests
*punct* .
*break*
upon
such
occasions
poor
mr.
woodhouses
feelings
were
in
sad
warfare
*punct* .
*break*
he
loved
to
have
the
cloth
laid
*punct* ,
because
it
had
been
the
fashion
of
his
youth
*punct* ,
but
his
conviction
of
suppers
being
very
unwholesome
made
him
rather
sorry
to
see
any
thing
put
on
it
*punct* ;
and
while
his
hospitality
would
have
welcomed
his
visitors
to
every
thing
*punct* ,
his
care
for
their
health
made
him
grieve
that
they
would
eat
*punct* .
*break*
such
another
small
basin
of
thin
gruel
as
his
own
was
all
that
he
could
*punct* ,
with
thorough
self-approbation
*punct* ,
recommend
*punct* ;
though
he
might
constrain
himself
*punct* ,
while
the
ladies
were
comfortably
clearing
the
nicer
things
*punct* ,
to
say
*punct* :
mrs.
bates
*punct* ,
let
me
propose
your
venturing
on
one
of
these
eggs
*punct* .
*break*
an
egg
boiled
very
soft
is
not
unwholesome
*punct* .
*break*
serle
understands
boiling
an
egg
better
than
any
body
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
not
recommend
an
egg
boiled
by
any
body
else
*punct* ;
but
you
need
not
be
afraid
*punct* ,
they
are
very
small
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* ,
one
of
our
small
eggs
will
not
hurt
you
*punct* .
*break*
miss
bates
*punct* ,
let
emma
help
you
to
a
little
bit
of
tart
*punct* ,
a
very
little
bit
*punct* .
*break*
ours
are
all
apple-tarts
*punct* .
*break*
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
unwholesome
preserves
here
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
advise
the
custard
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
goddard
*punct* ,
what
say
you
to
half
a
glass
of
wine
*punct* ?
*break*
a
small
half-glass
*punct* ,
put
into
a
tumbler
of
water
*punct* ?
*break*
i
do
not
think
it
could
disagree
with
you
*punct* .
*break*
emma
allowed
her
father
to
talk
*punct* ,
but
supplied
her
visitors
in
a
much
more
satisfactory
style
*punct* ,
and
on
the
present
evening
had
particular
pleasure
in
sending
them
away
happy
*punct* .
*break*
the
happiness
of
miss
smith
was
quite
equal
to
her
intentions
*punct* .
*break*
miss
woodhouse
was
so
great
a
personage
in
highbury
*punct* ,
that
the
prospect
of
the
introduction
had
given
as
much
panic
as
pleasure
*punct* ;
but
the
humble
*punct* ,
grateful
little
girl
went
off
with
highly
gratified
feelings
*punct* ,
delighted
with
the
affability
with
which
miss
woodhouse
had
treated
her
all
the
evening
*punct* ,
and
actually
shaken
hands
with
her
at
last
*punct* !
*break*
harriet
smith's
intimacy
at
hartfield
was
soon
a
settled
thing
*punct* .
*break*
quick
and
decided
in
her
ways
*punct* ,
emma
lost
no
time
in
inviting
*punct* ,
encouraging
*punct* ,
and
telling
her
to
come
very
often
*punct* ;
and
as
their
acquaintance
increased
*punct* ,
so
did
their
satisfaction
in
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
as
a
walking
companion
*punct* ,
emma
had
very
early
foreseen
how
useful
she
might
find
her
*punct* .
*break*
in
that
respect
mrs.
weston's
loss
had
been
important
*punct* .
*break*
her
father
never
went
beyond
the
shrubbery
*punct* ,
where
two
divisions
of
the
ground
sufficed
him
for
his
long
walk
*punct* ,
or
his
short
*punct* ,
as
the
year
varied
*punct* ;
and
since
mrs.
weston's
marriage
her
exercise
had
been
too
much
confined
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
ventured
once
alone
to
randalls
*punct* ,
but
it
was
not
pleasant
*punct* ;
and
a
harriet
smith
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
one
whom
she
could
summon
at
any
time
to
a
walk
*punct* ,
would
be
a
valuable
addition
to
her
privileges
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
every
respect
*punct* ,
as
she
saw
more
of
her
*punct* ,
she
approved
her
*punct* ,
and
was
confirmed
in
all
her
kind
designs
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
certainly
was
not
clever
*punct* ,
but
she
had
a
sweet
*punct* ,
docile
*punct* ,
grateful
disposition
*punct* ,
was
totally
free
from
conceit
*punct* ,
and
only
desiring
to
be
guided
by
any
one
she
looked
up
to
*punct* .
*break*
her
early
attachment
to
herself
was
very
amiable
*punct* ;
and
her
inclination
for
good
company
*punct* ,
and
power
of
appreciating
what
was
elegant
and
clever
*punct* ,
shewed
that
there
was
no
want
of
taste
*punct* ,
though
strength
of
understanding
must
not
be
expected
*punct* .
*break*
altogether
she
was
quite
convinced
of
harriet
smith's
being
exactly
the
young
friend
she
wanted
*punct* ,
exactly
the
something
which
her
home
required
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
friend
as
mrs.
weston
was
out
of
the
question
*punct* .
*break*
two
such
could
never
be
granted
*punct* .
*break*
two
such
she
did
not
want
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
quite
a
different
sort
of
thing
*punct* ,
a
sentiment
distinct
and
independent
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
was
the
object
of
a
regard
which
had
its
basis
in
gratitude
and
esteem
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
would
be
loved
as
one
to
whom
she
could
be
useful
*punct* .
*break*
for
mrs.
weston
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
*punct* ;
for
harriet
every
thing
*punct* .
*break*
her
first
attempts
at
usefulness
were
in
an
endeavour
to
find
out
who
were
the
parents
*punct* ,
but
harriet
could
not
tell
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
ready
to
tell
every
thing
in
her
power
*punct* ,
but
on
this
subject
questions
were
vain
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
obliged
to
fancy
what
she
liked
*punct* ,
but
she
could
never
believe
that
in
the
same
situation
she
should
not
have
discovered
the
truth
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
had
no
penetration
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
been
satisfied
to
hear
and
believe
just
what
mrs.
goddard
chose
to
tell
her
*punct* ;
and
looked
no
farther
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
goddard
*punct* ,
and
the
teachers
*punct* ,
and
the
girls
and
the
affairs
of
the
school
in
general
*punct* ,
formed
naturally
a
great
part
of
the
conversation
*punct* ,
and
but
for
her
acquaintance
with
the
martins
of
abbey-mill
farm
*punct* ,
it
must
have
been
the
whole
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
martins
occupied
her
thoughts
a
good
deal
*punct* ;
she
had
spent
two
very
happy
months
with
them
*punct* ,
and
now
loved
to
talk
of
the
pleasures
of
her
visit
*punct* ,
and
describe
the
many
comforts
and
wonders
of
the
place
*punct* .
*break*
emma
encouraged
her
talkativeness
*punct* ,
amused
by
such
a
picture
of
another
set
of
beings
*punct* ,
and
enjoying
the
youthful
simplicity
which
could
speak
with
so
much
exultation
of
mrs.
martin's
having
two
parlours
*punct* ,
two
very
good
parlours
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ;
one
of
them
quite
as
large
as
mrs.
goddard's
drawing-room
*punct* ;
and
of
her
having
an
upper
maid
who
had
lived
five-and-twenty
years
with
her
*punct* ;
and
of
their
having
eight
cows
*punct* ,
two
of
them
alderneys
*punct* ,
and
one
a
little
welch
cow
*punct* ,
a
very
pretty
little
welch
cow
indeed
*punct* ;
and
of
mrs.
martin's
saying
as
she
was
so
fond
of
it
*punct* ,
it
should
be
called
her
cow
*punct* ;
and
of
their
having
a
very
handsome
summer-house
in
their
garden
*punct* ,
where
some
day
next
year
they
were
all
to
drink
tea:
*punct* ,
a
very
handsome
summer-house
*punct* ,
large
enough
to
hold
a
dozen
people
*punct* .
*break*
for
some
time
she
was
amused
*punct* ,
without
thinking
beyond
the
immediate
cause
*punct* ;
but
as
she
came
to
understand
the
family
better
*punct* ,
other
feelings
arose
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
taken
up
a
wrong
idea
*punct* ,
fancying
it
was
a
mother
and
daughter
*punct* ,
a
son
and
son's
wife
*punct* ,
who
all
lived
together
*punct* ;
but
when
it
appeared
that
the
mr.
martin
*punct* ,
who
bore
a
part
in
the
narrative
*punct* ,
and
was
always
mentioned
with
approbation
for
his
great
good-nature
in
doing
something
or
other
*punct* ,
was
a
single
man
*punct* ;
that
there
was
no
young
mrs.
martin
*punct* ,
no
wife
in
the
case
*punct* ;
she
did
suspect
danger
to
her
poor
little
friend
from
all
this
hospitality
and
kindness
*punct* ,
and
that
*punct* ,
if
she
were
not
taken
care
of
*punct* ,
she
might
be
required
to
sink
herself
forever
*punct* .
*break*
with
this
inspiriting
notion
*punct* ,
her
questions
increased
in
number
and
meaning
*punct* ;
and
she
particularly
led
harriet
to
talk
more
of
mr.
martin
*punct* ,
and
there
was
evidently
no
dislike
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
was
very
ready
to
speak
of
the
share
he
had
had
in
their
moonlight
walks
and
merry
evening
games
*punct* ;
and
dwelt
a
good
deal
upon
his
being
so
very
good-humoured
and
obliging
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
gone
three
miles
round
one
day
in
order
to
bring
her
some
walnuts
*punct* ,
because
she
had
said
how
fond
she
was
of
them
*punct* ,
and
in
every
thing
else
he
was
so
very
obliging
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
his
shepherd's
son
into
the
parlour
one
night
on
purpose
to
sing
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
very
fond
of
singing
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
sing
a
little
himself
*punct* .
*break*
she
believed
he
was
very
clever
*punct* ,
and
understood
every
thing
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
very
fine
flock
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
while
she
was
with
them
*punct* ,
he
had
been
bid
more
for
his
wool
than
any
body
in
the
country
*punct* .
*break*
she
believed
every
body
spoke
well
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
his
mother
and
sisters
were
very
fond
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
martin
had
told
her
one
day
*punct* ,
and
there
was
a
blush
as
she
said
it,
*punct* ,
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
body
to
be
a
better
son
*punct* ,
and
therefore
she
was
sure
*punct* ,
whenever
he
married
*punct* ,
he
would
make
a
good
husband
*punct* .
*break*
not
that
she
wanted
him
to
marry
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
in
no
hurry
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
well
done
*punct* ,
mrs.
martin
*punct* !
*break*
you
know
what
you
are
about
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
she
had
come
away
*punct* ,
mrs.
martin
was
so
very
kind
as
to
send
mrs.
goddard
a
beautiful
goose
*punct* ,
the
finest
goose
mrs.
goddard
had
ever
seen
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
goddard
had
dressed
it
on
a
sunday
*punct* ,
and
asked
all
the
three
teachers
*punct* ,
miss
nash
*punct* ,
and
miss
prince
*punct* ,
and
miss
richardson
*punct* ,
to
sup
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
martin
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
is
not
a
man
of
information
beyond
the
line
of
his
own
business
*punct* ?
*break*
he
does
not
read
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
yes!
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
*punct* ,
but
i
believe
he
has
read
a
good
deal
*punct* ,
but
not
what
you
would
think
any
thing
of
*punct* .
*break*
he
reads
the
agricultural
reports
*punct* ,
and
some
other
books
that
lay
in
one
of
the
window
seats
*punct* ,
but
he
reads
all
them
to
himself
*punct* .
*break*
but
sometimes
of
an
evening
*punct* ,
before
we
went
to
cards
*punct* ,
he
would
read
something
aloud
out
of
the
elegant
extracts
*punct* ,
very
entertaining
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
know
he
has
read
the
vicar
of
wakefield
*punct* .
*break*
he
never
read
the
romance
of
the
forest
*punct* ,
nor
the
children
of
the
abbey
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
never
heard
of
such
books
before
i
mentioned
them
*punct* ,
but
he
is
determined
to
get
them
now
as
soon
as
ever
he
can
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
question
was
*punct* ,
what
sort
of
looking
man
is
mr.
martin
*punct* ?
*break*
not
handsome
*punct* ,
not
at
all
handsome
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
him
very
plain
at
first
*punct* ,
but
i
do
not
think
him
so
plain
now
*punct* .
*break*
one
does
not
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
after
a
time
*punct* .
*break*
but
did
you
never
see
him
*punct* ?
*break*
he
is
in
highbury
every
now
and
then
*punct* ,
and
he
is
sure
to
ride
through
every
week
in
his
way
to
kingston
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
passed
you
very
often
*punct* .
*break*
that
may
be
*punct* ,
and
i
may
have
seen
him
fifty
times
*punct* ,
but
without
having
any
idea
of
his
name
*punct* .
*break*
a
young
farmer
*punct* ,
whether
on
horseback
or
on
foot
*punct* ,
is
the
very
last
sort
of
person
to
raise
my
curiosity
*punct* .
*break*
the
yeomanry
are
precisely
the
order
of
people
with
whom
i
feel
i
can
have
nothing
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
a
degree
or
two
lower
*punct* ,
and
a
creditable
appearance
might
interest
me
*punct* ;
i
might
hope
to
be
useful
to
their
families
in
some
way
or
other
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
farmer
can
need
none
of
my
help
*punct* ,
and
is
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
in
one
sense
*punct* ,
as
much
above
my
notice
as
in
every
other
he
is
below
it
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
sure
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
likely
you
should
ever
have
observed
him
*punct* ;
but
he
knows
you
very
well
indeed
*punct* ,
i
mean
by
sight
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
doubt
of
his
being
a
very
respectable
young
man
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
that
he
is
so
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
such
*punct* ,
wish
him
well
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
imagine
his
age
to
be
*punct* ?
*break*
he
was
four-and-twenty
the
8th
of
last
june
*punct* ,
and
my
birthday
is
the
23rd
just
a
fortnight
and
a
day's
difference
*punct* ,
which
is
very
odd
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
too
young
to
settle
*punct* .
*break*
his
mother
is
perfectly
right
not
to
be
in
a
hurry
*punct* .
*break*
they
seem
very
comfortable
as
they
are
*punct* ,
and
if
she
were
to
take
any
pains
to
marry
him
*punct* ,
she
would
probably
repent
it
*punct* .
*break*
six
years
hence
*punct* ,
if
he
could
meet
with
a
good
sort
of
young
woman
in
the
same
rank
as
his
own
*punct* ,
with
a
little
money
*punct* ,
it
might
be
very
desirable
*punct* .
*break*
six
years
hence
*punct* !
*break*
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
he
would
be
thirty
years
old
*punct* !
*break*
well
*punct* ,
and
that
is
as
early
as
most
men
can
afford
to
marry
*punct* ,
who
are
not
born
to
an
independence
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
martin
*punct* ,
i
imagine
*punct* ,
has
his
fortune
entirely
to
make
*punct* ,
cannot
be
at
all
beforehand
with
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
whatever
money
he
might
come
into
when
his
father
died
*punct* ,
whatever
his
share
of
the
family
property
*punct* ,
it
is
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* ,
all
afloat
*punct* ,
all
employed
in
his
stock
*punct* ,
and
so
forth
*punct* ;
and
though
*punct* ,
with
diligence
and
good
luck
*punct* ,
he
may
be
rich
in
time
*punct* ,
it
is
next
to
impossible
that
he
should
have
realised
any
thing
yet
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
sure
*punct* ,
so
it
is
*punct* .
*break*
but
they
live
very
comfortably
*punct* .
*break*
they
have
no
indoors
man
*punct* ,
else
they
do
not
want
for
any
thing
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
martin
talks
of
taking
a
boy
another
year
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
you
may
not
get
into
a
scrape
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
whenever
he
does
marry;
*punct* ,
i
mean
*punct* ,
as
to
being
acquainted
with
his
wife
*punct* ,
for
though
his
sisters
*punct* ,
from
a
superior
education
*punct* ,
are
not
to
be
altogether
objected
to
*punct* ,
it
does
not
follow
that
he
might
marry
any
body
at
all
fit
for
you
to
notice
*punct* .
*break*
the
misfortune
of
your
birth
ought
to
make
you
particularly
careful
as
to
your
associates
*punct* .
*break*
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
your
being
a
gentleman's
daughter
*punct* ,
and
you
must
support
your
claim
to
that
station
by
every
thing
within
your
own
power
*punct* ,
or
there
will
be
plenty
of
people
who
would
take
pleasure
in
degrading
you
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
to
be
sure
*punct* ,
i
suppose
there
are
*punct* .
*break*
but
while
i
visit
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
and
you
are
so
kind
to
me
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
i
am
not
afraid
of
what
any
body
can
do
*punct* .
*break*
you
understand
the
force
of
influence
pretty
well
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ;
but
i
would
have
you
so
firmly
established
in
good
society
*punct* ,
as
to
be
independent
even
of
hartfield
and
miss
woodhouse
*punct* .
*break*
i
want
to
see
you
permanently
well
connected
*punct* ,
and
to
that
end
it
will
be
advisable
to
have
as
few
odd
acquaintance
as
may
be
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
i
say
that
if
you
should
still
be
in
this
country
when
mr.
martin
marries
*punct* ,
i
wish
you
may
not
be
drawn
in
by
your
intimacy
with
the
sisters
*punct* ,
to
be
acquainted
with
the
wife
*punct* ,
who
will
probably
be
some
mere
farmer's
daughter
*punct* ,
without
education
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
sure
*punct* .
*break*
not
that
i
think
mr.
martin
would
ever
marry
any
body
but
what
had
had
some
education
*punct* ,
and
been
very
well
brought
up
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
i
do
not
mean
to
set
up
my
opinion
against
your's
*punct* ,
and
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
wish
for
the
acquaintance
of
his
wife
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
always
have
a
great
regard
for
the
miss
martins
*punct* ,
especially
elizabeth
*punct* ,
and
should
be
very
sorry
to
give
them
up
*punct* ,
for
they
are
quite
as
well
educated
as
me
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
he
marries
a
very
ignorant
*punct* ,
vulgar
woman
*punct* ,
certainly
i
had
better
not
visit
her
*punct* ,
if
i
can
help
it
*punct* .
*break*
emma
watched
her
through
the
fluctuations
of
this
speech
*punct* ,
and
saw
no
alarming
symptoms
of
love
*punct* .
*break*
the
young
man
had
been
the
first
admirer
*punct* ,
but
she
trusted
there
was
no
other
hold
*punct* ,
and
that
there
would
be
no
serious
difficulty
*punct* ,
on
harriet's
side
*punct* ,
to
oppose
any
friendly
arrangement
of
her
own
*punct* .
*break*
they
met
mr.
martin
the
very
next
day
*punct* ,
as
they
were
walking
on
the
donwell
road
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
on
foot
*punct* ,
and
after
looking
very
respectfully
at
her
*punct* ,
looked
with
most
unfeigned
satisfaction
at
her
companion
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
not
sorry
to
have
such
an
opportunity
of
survey
*punct* ;
and
walking
a
few
yards
forward
*punct* ,
while
they
talked
together
*punct* ,
soon
made
her
quick
eye
sufficiently
acquainted
with
mr.
robert
martin
*punct* .
*break*
his
appearance
was
very
neat
*punct* ,
and
he
looked
like
a
sensible
young
man
*punct* ,
but
his
person
had
no
other
advantage
*punct* ;
and
when
he
came
to
be
contrasted
with
gentlemen
*punct* ,
she
thought
he
must
lose
all
the
ground
he
had
gained
in
harriet's
inclination
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
was
not
insensible
of
manner
*punct* ;
she
had
voluntarily
noticed
her
father's
gentleness
with
admiration
as
well
as
wonder
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
martin
looked
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
manner
was
*punct* .
*break*
they
remained
but
a
few
minutes
together
*punct* ,
as
miss
woodhouse
must
not
be
kept
waiting
*punct* ;
and
harriet
then
came
running
to
her
with
a
smiling
face
*punct* ,
and
in
a
flutter
of
spirits
*punct* ,
which
miss
woodhouse
hoped
very
soon
to
compose
*punct* .
*break*
only
think
of
our
happening
to
meet
him!
*punct* ,
how
very
odd
*punct* !
*break*
it
was
quite
a
chance
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
that
he
had
not
gone
round
by
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
think
we
ever
walked
this
road
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
we
walked
towards
randalls
most
days
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
not
been
able
to
get
the
romance
of
the
forest
yet
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
so
busy
the
last
time
he
was
at
kingston
that
he
quite
forgot
it
*punct* ,
but
he
goes
again
to-morrow
*punct* .
*break*
so
very
odd
we
should
happen
to
meet
*punct* !
*break*
well
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
is
he
like
what
you
expected
*punct* ?
*break*
what
do
you
think
of
him
*punct* ?
*break*
do
you
think
him
so
very
plain
*punct* ?
*break*
he
is
very
plain
*punct* ,
undoubtedly
*punct* ,
remarkably
plain:
*punct* ,
but
that
is
nothing
compared
with
his
entire
want
of
gentility
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
no
right
to
expect
much
*punct* ,
and
i
did
not
expect
much
*punct* ;
but
i
had
no
idea
that
he
could
be
so
very
clownish
*punct* ,
so
totally
without
air
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
imagined
him
*punct* ,
i
confess
*punct* ,
a
degree
or
two
nearer
gentility
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
sure
*punct* ,
said
harriet
*punct* ,
in
a
mortified
voice
*punct* ,
he
is
not
so
genteel
as
real
gentlemen
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
since
your
acquaintance
with
us
*punct* ,
you
have
been
repeatedly
in
the
company
of
some
such
very
real
gentlemen
*punct* ,
that
you
must
yourself
be
struck
with
the
difference
in
mr.
martin
*punct* .
*break*
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
you
have
had
very
good
specimens
of
well
educated
*punct* ,
well
bred
men
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
be
surprized
if
*punct* ,
after
seeing
them
*punct* ,
you
could
be
in
company
with
mr.
martin
again
without
perceiving
him
to
be
a
very
inferior
creature
*punct* ,
and
rather
wondering
at
yourself
for
having
ever
thought
him
at
all
agreeable
before
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
you
begin
to
feel
that
now
*punct* ?
*break*
were
not
you
struck
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
sure
you
must
have
been
struck
by
his
awkward
look
and
abrupt
manner
*punct* ,
and
the
uncouthness
of
a
voice
which
i
heard
to
be
wholly
unmodulated
as
i
stood
here
*punct* .
*break*
certainly
*punct* ,
he
is
not
like
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
not
such
a
fine
air
and
way
of
walking
as
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
i
see
the
difference
plain
enough
*punct* .
*break*
but
mr.
knightley
is
so
very
fine
a
man
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
knightley's
air
is
so
remarkably
good
that
it
is
not
fair
to
compare
mr.
martin
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
you
might
not
see
one
in
a
hundred
with
gentleman
so
plainly
written
as
in
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
is
not
the
only
gentleman
you
have
been
lately
used
to
*punct* .
*break*
what
say
you
to
mr.
weston
and
mr.
elton
*punct* ?
*break*
compare
mr.
martin
with
either
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
compare
their
manner
of
carrying
themselves
*punct* ;
of
walking
*punct* ;
of
speaking
*punct* ;
of
being
silent
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
see
the
difference
*punct* .
*break*
oh
yes!
*punct* ,
there
is
a
great
difference
*punct* .
*break*
but
mr.
weston
is
almost
an
old
man
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
must
be
between
forty
and
fifty
*punct* .
*break*
which
makes
his
good
manners
the
more
valuable
*punct* .
*break*
the
older
a
person
grows
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
the
more
important
it
is
that
their
manners
should
not
be
bad
*punct* ;
the
more
glaring
and
disgusting
any
loudness
*punct* ,
or
coarseness
*punct* ,
or
awkwardness
becomes
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
passable
in
youth
is
detestable
in
later
age
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
martin
is
now
awkward
and
abrupt
*punct* ;
what
will
he
be
at
mr.
weston's
time
of
life
*punct* ?
*break*
there
is
no
saying
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
replied
harriet
rather
solemnly
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
may
be
pretty
good
guessing
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
be
a
completely
gross
*punct* ,
vulgar
farmer
*punct* ,
totally
inattentive
to
appearances
*punct* ,
and
thinking
of
nothing
but
profit
and
loss
*punct* .
*break*
will
he
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ?
*break*
that
will
be
very
bad
*punct* .
*break*
how
much
his
business
engrosses
him
already
is
very
plain
from
the
circumstance
of
his
forgetting
to
inquire
for
the
book
you
recommended
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
great
deal
too
full
of
the
market
to
think
of
any
thing
else
*punct* ,
which
is
just
as
it
should
be
*punct* ,
for
a
thriving
man
*punct* .
*break*
what
has
he
to
do
with
books
*punct* ?
*break*
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
thrive
*punct* ,
and
be
a
very
rich
man
in
time
*punct* ,
and
his
being
illiterate
and
coarse
need
not
disturb
us
*punct* .
*break*
i
wonder
he
did
not
remember
the
book
*punct* ,
was
all
harriet's
answer
*punct* ,
and
spoken
with
a
degree
of
grave
displeasure
which
emma
thought
might
be
safely
left
to
itself
*punct* .
*break*
she
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
said
no
more
for
some
time
*punct* .
*break*
her
next
beginning
was
*punct* ,
in
one
respect
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
mr.
elton's
manners
are
superior
to
mr.
knightley's
or
mr.
weston's
*punct* .
*break*
they
have
more
gentleness
*punct* .
*break*
they
might
be
more
safely
held
up
as
a
pattern
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
an
openness
*punct* ,
a
quickness
*punct* ,
almost
a
bluntness
in
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
which
every
body
likes
in
him
*punct* ,
because
there
is
so
much
good-humour
with
it
*punct* ,
but
that
would
not
do
to
be
copied
*punct* .
*break*
neither
would
mr.
knightley's
downright
*punct* ,
decided
*punct* ,
commanding
sort
of
manner
*punct* ,
though
it
suits
him
very
well
*punct* ;
his
figure
*punct* ,
and
look
*punct* ,
and
situation
in
life
seem
to
allow
it
*punct* ;
but
if
any
young
man
were
to
set
about
copying
him
*punct* ,
he
would
not
be
sufferable
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
contrary
*punct* ,
i
think
a
young
man
might
be
very
safely
recommended
to
take
mr.
elton
as
a
model
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
is
good-humoured
*punct* ,
cheerful
*punct* ,
obliging
*punct* ,
and
gentle
*punct* .
*break*
he
seems
to
me
to
be
grown
particularly
gentle
of
late
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
whether
he
has
any
design
of
ingratiating
himself
with
either
of
us
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
by
additional
softness
*punct* ,
but
it
strikes
me
that
his
manners
are
softer
than
they
used
to
be
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
means
any
thing
*punct* ,
it
must
be
to
please
you
*punct* .
*break*
did
not
i
tell
you
what
he
said
of
you
the
other
day
*punct* ?
*break*
she
then
repeated
some
warm
personal
praise
which
she
had
drawn
from
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
and
now
did
full
justice
to
*punct* ;
and
harriet
blushed
and
smiled
*punct* ,
and
said
she
had
always
thought
mr.
elton
very
agreeable
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
was
the
very
person
fixed
on
by
emma
for
driving
the
young
farmer
out
of
harriet's
head
*punct* .
*break*
she
thought
it
would
be
an
excellent
match
*punct* ;
and
only
too
palpably
desirable
*punct* ,
natural
*punct* ,
and
probable
*punct* ,
for
her
to
have
much
merit
in
planning
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
feared
it
was
what
every
body
else
must
think
of
and
predict
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
likely
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
that
any
body
should
have
equalled
her
in
the
date
of
the
plan
*punct* ,
as
it
had
entered
her
brain
during
the
very
first
evening
of
harriet's
coming
to
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
the
longer
she
considered
it
*punct* ,
the
greater
was
her
sense
of
its
expediency
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton's
situation
was
most
suitable
*punct* ,
quite
the
gentleman
himself
*punct* ,
and
without
low
connexions
*punct* ;
at
the
same
time
*punct* ,
not
of
any
family
that
could
fairly
object
to
the
doubtful
birth
of
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
comfortable
home
for
her
*punct* ,
and
emma
imagined
a
very
sufficient
income
*punct* ;
for
though
the
vicarage
of
highbury
was
not
large
*punct* ,
he
was
known
to
have
some
independent
property
*punct* ;
and
she
thought
very
highly
of
him
as
a
good-humoured
*punct* ,
well-meaning
*punct* ,
respectable
young
man
*punct* ,
without
any
deficiency
of
useful
understanding
or
knowledge
of
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
already
satisfied
herself
that
he
thought
harriet
a
beautiful
girl
*punct* ,
which
she
trusted
*punct* ,
with
such
frequent
meetings
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
was
foundation
enough
on
his
side
*punct* ;
and
on
harriet's
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
the
idea
of
being
preferred
by
him
would
have
all
the
usual
weight
and
efficacy
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
was
really
a
very
pleasing
young
man
*punct* ,
a
young
man
whom
any
woman
not
fastidious
might
like
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
reckoned
very
handsome
*punct* ;
his
person
much
admired
in
general
*punct* ,
though
not
by
her
*punct* ,
there
being
a
want
of
elegance
of
feature
which
she
could
not
dispense
with:
*punct* ,
but
the
girl
who
could
be
gratified
by
a
robert
martin's
riding
about
the
country
to
get
walnuts
for
her
might
very
well
be
conquered
by
mr.
elton's
admiration
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
what
your
opinion
may
be
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
of
this
great
intimacy
between
emma
and
harriet
smith
*punct* ,
but
i
think
it
a
bad
thing
*punct* .
*break*
a
bad
thing
*punct* !
*break*
do
you
really
think
it
a
bad
thing?
*punct* ,
why
so
*punct* ?
*break*
i
think
they
will
neither
of
them
do
the
other
any
good
*punct* .
*break*
you
surprize
me
*punct* !
*break*
emma
must
do
harriet
good
*punct* :
and
by
supplying
her
with
a
new
object
of
interest
*punct* ,
harriet
may
be
said
to
do
emma
good
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
been
seeing
their
intimacy
with
the
greatest
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
how
very
differently
we
feel!
*punct* ,
not
think
they
will
do
each
other
any
good
*punct* !
*break*
this
will
certainly
be
the
beginning
of
one
of
our
quarrels
about
emma
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
you
think
i
am
come
on
purpose
to
quarrel
with
you
*punct* ,
knowing
weston
to
be
out
*punct* ,
and
that
you
must
still
fight
your
own
battle
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
would
undoubtedly
support
me
*punct* ,
if
he
were
here
*punct* ,
for
he
thinks
exactly
as
i
do
on
the
subject
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
speaking
of
it
only
yesterday
*punct* ,
and
agreeing
how
fortunate
it
was
for
emma
*punct* ,
that
there
should
be
such
a
girl
in
highbury
for
her
to
associate
with
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
be
a
fair
judge
in
this
case
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
so
much
used
to
live
alone
*punct* ,
that
you
do
not
know
the
value
of
a
companion
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
perhaps
no
man
can
be
a
good
judge
of
the
comfort
a
woman
feels
in
the
society
of
one
of
her
own
sex
*punct* ,
after
being
used
to
it
all
her
life
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
imagine
your
objection
to
harriet
smith
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
not
the
superior
young
woman
which
emma's
friend
ought
to
be
*punct* .
*break*
but
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
as
emma
wants
to
see
her
better
informed
*punct* ,
it
will
be
an
inducement
to
her
to
read
more
herself
*punct* .
*break*
they
will
read
together
*punct* .
*break*
she
means
it
*punct* ,
i
know
*punct* .
*break*
emma
has
been
meaning
to
read
more
ever
since
she
was
twelve
years
old
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
seen
a
great
many
lists
of
her
drawing-up
at
various
times
of
books
that
she
meant
to
read
regularly
through
*punct* ,
and
very
good
lists
they
were
*punct* ,
very
well
chosen
*punct* ,
and
very
neatly
arranged
*punct* ,
sometimes
alphabetically
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
by
some
other
rule
*punct* .
*break*
the
list
she
drew
up
when
only
fourteen
*punct* ,
i
remember
thinking
it
did
her
judgment
so
much
credit
*punct* ,
that
i
preserved
it
some
time
*punct* ;
and
i
dare
say
she
may
have
made
out
a
very
good
list
now
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
have
done
with
expecting
any
course
of
steady
reading
from
emma
*punct* .
*break*
she
will
never
submit
to
any
thing
requiring
industry
and
patience
*punct* ,
and
a
subjection
of
the
fancy
to
the
understanding
*punct* .
*break*
where
miss
taylor
failed
to
stimulate
*punct* ,
i
may
safely
affirm
that
harriet
smith
will
do
nothing.
*punct* ,
you
never
could
persuade
her
to
read
half
so
much
as
you
wished.
*punct* ,
you
know
you
could
not
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
*punct* ,
replied
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
smiling
*punct* ,
that
i
thought
so
then;
*punct* ,
but
since
we
have
parted
*punct* ,
i
can
never
remember
emma's
omitting
to
do
any
thing
i
wished
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
hardly
any
desiring
to
refresh
such
a
memory
as
that,
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
feelingly
*punct* ;
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
had
done
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
*punct* ,
he
soon
added
*punct* ,
who
have
had
no
such
charm
thrown
over
my
senses
*punct* ,
must
still
see
*punct* ,
hear
*punct* ,
and
remember
*punct* .
*break*
emma
is
spoiled
by
being
the
cleverest
of
her
family
*punct* .
*break*
at
ten
years
old
*punct* ,
she
had
the
misfortune
of
being
able
to
answer
questions
which
puzzled
her
sister
at
seventeen
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
always
quick
and
assured
*punct* :
isabella
slow
and
diffident
*punct* .
*break*
and
ever
since
she
was
twelve
*punct* ,
emma
has
been
mistress
of
the
house
and
of
you
all
*punct* .
*break*
in
her
mother
she
lost
the
only
person
able
to
cope
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
inherits
her
mother's
talents
*punct* ,
and
must
have
been
under
subjection
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
have
been
sorry
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
to
be
dependent
on
your
recommendation
*punct* ,
had
i
quitted
mr.
woodhouse's
family
and
wanted
another
situation
*punct* ;
i
do
not
think
you
would
have
spoken
a
good
word
for
me
to
any
body
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
you
always
thought
me
unfit
for
the
office
i
held
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
smiling
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
better
placed
here
*punct* ;
very
fit
for
a
wife
*punct* ,
but
not
at
all
for
a
governess
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
were
preparing
yourself
to
be
an
excellent
wife
all
the
time
you
were
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
you
might
not
give
emma
such
a
complete
education
as
your
powers
would
seem
to
promise
*punct* ;
but
you
were
receiving
a
very
good
education
from
her
*punct* ,
on
the
very
material
matrimonial
point
of
submitting
your
own
will
*punct* ,
and
doing
as
you
were
bid
*punct* ;
and
if
weston
had
asked
me
to
recommend
him
a
wife
*punct* ,
i
should
certainly
have
named
miss
taylor
*punct* .
*break*
there
will
be
very
little
merit
in
making
a
good
wife
to
such
a
man
as
mr.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
to
own
the
truth
*punct* ,
i
am
afraid
you
are
rather
thrown
away
*punct* ,
and
that
with
every
disposition
to
bear
*punct* ,
there
will
be
nothing
to
be
borne
*punct* .
*break*
we
will
not
despair
*punct* ,
however
*punct* .
*break*
weston
may
grow
cross
from
the
wantonness
of
comfort
*punct* ,
or
his
son
may
plague
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
not
that.
*punct* ,
it
is
not
likely
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
do
not
foretell
vexation
from
that
quarter
*punct* .
*break*
not
i
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
i
only
name
possibilities
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
pretend
to
emma's
genius
for
foretelling
and
guessing
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
*punct* ,
with
all
my
heart
*punct* ,
the
young
man
may
be
a
weston
in
merit
*punct* ,
and
a
churchill
in
fortune.
*punct* ,
but
harriet
smith
*punct* ,
i
have
not
half
done
about
harriet
smith
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
her
the
very
worst
sort
of
companion
that
emma
could
possibly
have
*punct* .
*break*
she
knows
nothing
herself
*punct* ,
and
looks
upon
emma
as
knowing
every
thing
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
a
flatterer
in
all
her
ways
*punct* ;
and
so
much
the
worse
*punct* ,
because
undesigned
*punct* .
*break*
her
ignorance
is
hourly
flattery
*punct* .
*break*
how
can
emma
imagine
she
has
any
thing
to
learn
herself
*punct* ,
while
harriet
is
presenting
such
a
delightful
inferiority
*punct* ?
*break*
and
as
for
harriet
*punct* ,
i
will
venture
to
say
that
she
cannot
gain
by
the
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
hartfield
will
only
put
her
out
of
conceit
with
all
the
other
places
she
belongs
to
*punct* .
*break*
she
will
grow
just
refined
enough
to
be
uncomfortable
with
those
among
whom
birth
and
circumstances
have
placed
her
home
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
much
mistaken
if
emma's
doctrines
give
any
strength
of
mind
*punct* ,
or
tend
at
all
to
make
a
girl
adapt
herself
rationally
to
the
varieties
of
her
situation
in
life.
*punct* ,
they
only
give
a
little
polish
*punct* .
*break*
i
either
depend
more
upon
emma's
good
sense
than
you
do
*punct* ,
or
am
more
anxious
for
her
present
comfort
*punct* ;
for
i
cannot
lament
the
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
how
well
she
looked
last
night
*punct* !
*break*
you
would
rather
talk
of
her
person
than
her
mind
*punct* ,
would
you
*punct* ?
*break*
very
well
*punct* ;
i
shall
not
attempt
to
deny
emma's
being
pretty
*punct* .
*break*
say
beautiful
rather
*punct* .
*break*
can
you
imagine
any
thing
nearer
perfect
beauty
than
emma
altogether
*punct* ,
face
and
figure
*punct* ?
*break*
i
do
not
know
what
i
could
imagine
*punct* ,
but
i
confess
that
i
have
seldom
seen
a
face
or
figure
more
pleasing
to
me
than
hers
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
am
a
partial
old
friend
*punct* .
*break*
such
an
eye!
*punct* ,
the
true
hazle
eye
*punct* ,
and
so
brilliant
*punct* !
*break*
regular
features
*punct* ,
open
countenance
*punct* ,
with
a
complexion
*punct* !
*break*
what
a
bloom
of
full
health
*punct* ,
and
such
a
pretty
height
and
size
*punct* ;
such
a
firm
and
upright
figure
*punct* !
*break*
there
is
health
*punct* ,
not
merely
in
her
bloom
*punct* ,
but
in
her
air
*punct* ,
her
head
*punct* ,
her
glance
*punct* .
*break*
one
hears
sometimes
of
a
child
being
the
picture
of
health
*punct* ;
now
*punct* ,
emma
always
gives
me
the
idea
of
being
the
complete
picture
of
grown-up
health
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
loveliness
itself
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
is
not
she
*punct* ?
*break*
i
have
not
a
fault
to
find
with
her
person
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
her
all
you
describe
*punct* .
*break*
i
love
to
look
at
her
*punct* ;
and
i
will
add
this
praise
*punct* ,
that
i
do
not
think
her
personally
vain
*punct* .
*break*
considering
how
very
handsome
she
is
*punct* ,
she
appears
to
be
little
occupied
with
it
*punct* ;
her
vanity
lies
another
way
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
i
am
not
to
be
talked
out
of
my
dislike
of
harriet
smith
*punct* ,
or
my
dread
of
its
doing
them
both
harm
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
am
equally
stout
in
my
confidence
of
its
not
doing
them
any
harm
*punct* .
*break*
with
all
dear
emma's
little
faults
*punct* ,
she
is
an
excellent
creature
*punct* .
*break*
where
shall
we
see
a
better
daughter
*punct* ,
or
a
kinder
sister
*punct* ,
or
a
truer
friend
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ;
she
has
qualities
which
may
be
trusted
*punct* ;
she
will
never
lead
any
one
really
wrong
*punct* ;
she
will
make
no
lasting
blunder
*punct* ;
where
emma
errs
once
*punct* ,
she
is
in
the
right
a
hundred
times
*punct* .
*break*
very
well
*punct* ;
i
will
not
plague
you
any
more
*punct* .
*break*
emma
shall
be
an
angel
*punct* ,
and
i
will
keep
my
spleen
to
myself
till
christmas
brings
john
and
isabella
*punct* .
*break*
john
loves
emma
with
a
reasonable
and
therefore
not
a
blind
affection
*punct* ,
and
isabella
always
thinks
as
he
does
*punct* ;
except
when
he
is
not
quite
frightened
enough
about
the
children
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
of
having
their
opinions
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
that
you
all
love
her
really
too
well
to
be
unjust
or
unkind
*punct* ;
but
excuse
me
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
if
i
take
the
liberty
*punct* ,
i
consider
myself
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
as
having
somewhat
of
the
privilege
of
speech
that
emma's
mother
might
have
had
*punct* ,
the
liberty
of
hinting
that
i
do
not
think
any
possible
good
can
arise
from
harriet
smith's
intimacy
being
made
a
matter
of
much
discussion
among
you
*punct* .
*break*
pray
excuse
me
*punct* ;
but
supposing
any
little
inconvenience
may
be
apprehended
from
the
intimacy
*punct* ,
it
cannot
be
expected
that
emma
*punct* ,
accountable
to
nobody
but
her
father
*punct* ,
who
perfectly
approves
the
acquaintance
*punct* ,
should
put
an
end
to
it
*punct* ,
so
long
as
it
is
a
source
of
pleasure
to
herself
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
been
so
many
years
my
province
to
give
advice
*punct* ,
that
you
cannot
be
surprized
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
at
this
little
remains
of
office
*punct* .
*break*
not
at
all
*punct* ,
cried
he
*punct* ;
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
very
good
advice
*punct* ,
and
it
shall
have
a
better
fate
than
your
advice
has
often
found
*punct* ;
for
it
shall
be
attended
to
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
john
knightley
is
easily
alarmed
*punct* ,
and
might
be
made
unhappy
about
her
sister
*punct* .
*break*
be
satisfied
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
i
will
not
raise
any
outcry
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
keep
my
ill-humour
to
myself
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
a
very
sincere
interest
in
emma
*punct* .
*break*
isabella
does
not
seem
more
my
sister
*punct* ;
has
never
excited
a
greater
interest
*punct* ;
perhaps
hardly
so
great
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
an
anxiety
*punct* ,
a
curiosity
in
what
one
feels
for
emma
*punct* .
*break*
i
wonder
what
will
become
of
her
*punct* !
*break*
so
do
i
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
weston
gently
*punct* ,
very
much
*punct* .
*break*
she
always
declares
she
will
never
marry
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
means
just
nothing
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
have
no
idea
that
she
has
yet
ever
seen
a
man
she
cared
for
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
not
be
a
bad
thing
for
her
to
be
very
much
in
love
with
a
proper
object
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
like
to
see
emma
in
love
*punct* ,
and
in
some
doubt
of
a
return
*punct* ;
it
would
do
her
good
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
is
nobody
hereabouts
to
attach
her
*punct* ;
and
she
goes
so
seldom
from
home
*punct* .
*break*
there
does
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
seem
as
little
to
tempt
her
to
break
her
resolution
at
present
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
as
can
well
be
*punct* ;
and
while
she
is
so
happy
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
i
cannot
wish
her
to
be
forming
any
attachment
which
would
be
creating
such
difficulties
on
poor
mr.
woodhouse's
account
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
recommend
matrimony
at
present
to
emma
*punct* ,
though
i
mean
no
slight
to
the
state
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* .
*break*
part
of
her
meaning
was
to
conceal
some
favourite
thoughts
of
her
own
and
mr.
weston's
on
the
subject
*punct* ,
as
much
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
wishes
at
randalls
respecting
emma's
destiny
*punct* ,
but
it
was
not
desirable
to
have
them
suspected
*punct* ;
and
the
quiet
transition
which
mr.
knightley
soon
afterwards
made
to
what
does
weston
think
of
the
weather
*punct* ;
shall
we
have
rain
*punct* ?
*break*
convinced
her
that
he
had
nothing
more
to
say
or
surmise
about
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
feel
a
doubt
of
having
given
harriet's
fancy
a
proper
direction
and
raised
the
gratitude
of
her
young
vanity
to
a
very
good
purpose
*punct* ,
for
she
found
her
decidedly
more
sensible
than
before
of
mr.
elton's
being
a
remarkably
handsome
man
*punct* ,
with
most
agreeable
manners
*punct* ;
and
as
she
had
no
hesitation
in
following
up
the
assurance
of
his
admiration
by
agreeable
hints
*punct* ,
she
was
soon
pretty
confident
of
creating
as
much
liking
on
harriet's
side
*punct* ,
as
there
could
be
any
occasion
for
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
quite
convinced
of
mr.
elton's
being
in
the
fairest
way
of
falling
in
love
*punct* ,
if
not
in
love
already
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
no
scruple
with
regard
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
talked
of
harriet
*punct* ,
and
praised
her
so
warmly
*punct* ,
that
she
could
not
suppose
any
thing
wanting
which
a
little
time
would
not
add
*punct* .
*break*
his
perception
of
the
striking
improvement
of
harriet's
manner
*punct* ,
since
her
introduction
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
was
not
one
of
the
least
agreeable
proofs
of
his
growing
attachment
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
given
miss
smith
all
that
she
required
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ;
you
have
made
her
graceful
and
easy
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
a
beautiful
creature
when
she
came
to
you
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
in
my
opinion
*punct* ,
the
attractions
you
have
added
are
infinitely
superior
to
what
she
received
from
nature
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
glad
you
think
i
have
been
useful
to
her
*punct* ;
but
harriet
only
wanted
drawing
out
*punct* ,
and
receiving
a
few
*punct* ,
very
few
hints
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
all
the
natural
grace
of
sweetness
of
temper
and
artlessness
in
herself
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
done
very
little
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
were
admissible
to
contradict
a
lady
*punct* ,
said
the
gallant
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
i
have
perhaps
given
her
a
little
more
decision
of
character
*punct* ,
have
taught
her
to
think
on
points
which
had
not
fallen
in
her
way
before
*punct* .
*break*
exactly
so
*punct* ;
that
is
what
principally
strikes
me
*punct* .
*break*
so
much
superadded
decision
of
character
*punct* !
*break*
skilful
has
been
the
hand
*punct* !
*break*
great
has
been
the
pleasure
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
met
with
a
disposition
more
truly
amiable
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
was
spoken
with
a
sort
of
sighing
animation
*punct* ,
which
had
a
vast
deal
of
the
lover
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
not
less
pleased
another
day
with
the
manner
in
which
he
seconded
a
sudden
wish
of
hers
*punct* ,
to
have
harriet's
picture
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
ever
have
your
likeness
taken
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ?
*break*
said
she
*punct* :
did
you
ever
sit
for
your
picture
*punct* ?
*break*
harriet
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
*punct* ,
and
only
stopt
to
say
*punct* ,
with
a
very
interesting
naivete
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
dear
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
never
*punct* .
*break*
no
sooner
was
she
out
of
sight
*punct* ,
than
emma
exclaimed
*punct* ,
what
an
exquisite
possession
a
good
picture
of
her
would
be
*punct* !
*break*
i
would
give
any
money
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
almost
long
to
attempt
her
likeness
myself
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
not
know
it
i
dare
say
*punct* ,
but
two
or
three
years
ago
i
had
a
great
passion
for
taking
likenesses
*punct* ,
and
attempted
several
of
my
friends
*punct* ,
and
was
thought
to
have
a
tolerable
eye
in
general
*punct* .
*break*
but
from
one
cause
or
another
*punct* ,
i
gave
it
up
in
disgust
*punct* .
*break*
but
really
*punct* ,
i
could
almost
venture
*punct* ,
if
harriet
would
sit
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
such
a
delight
to
have
her
picture
*punct* !
*break*
let
me
entreat
you
*punct* ,
cried
mr.
elton
*punct* ;
it
would
indeed
be
a
delight
*punct* !
*break*
let
me
entreat
you
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
to
exercise
so
charming
a
talent
in
favour
of
your
friend
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
what
your
drawings
are
*punct* .
*break*
how
could
you
suppose
me
ignorant
*punct* ?
*break*
is
not
this
room
rich
in
specimens
of
your
landscapes
and
flowers
*punct* ;
and
has
not
mrs.
weston
some
inimitable
figure-pieces
in
her
drawing-room
*punct* ,
at
randalls
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
good
man!
*punct* ,
thought
emma
*punct* ,
but
what
has
all
that
to
do
with
taking
likenesses
*punct* ?
*break*
you
know
nothing
of
drawing
*punct* .
*break*
don't
pretend
to
be
in
raptures
about
mine
*punct* .
*break*
keep
your
raptures
for
harriet's
face
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
if
you
give
me
such
kind
encouragement
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
i
believe
i
shall
try
what
i
can
do
*punct* .
*break*
harriet's
features
are
very
delicate
*punct* ,
which
makes
a
likeness
difficult
*punct* ;
and
yet
there
is
a
peculiarity
in
the
shape
of
the
eye
and
the
lines
about
the
mouth
which
one
ought
to
catch
*punct* .
*break*
exactly
so
*punct* ,
the
shape
of
the
eye
and
the
lines
about
the
mouth
*punct* ,
i
have
not
a
doubt
of
your
success
*punct* .
*break*
pray
*punct* ,
pray
attempt
it
*punct* .
*break*
as
you
will
do
it
*punct* ,
it
will
indeed
*punct* ,
to
use
your
own
words
*punct* ,
be
an
exquisite
possession
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
am
afraid
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
harriet
will
not
like
to
sit
*punct* .
*break*
she
thinks
so
little
of
her
own
beauty
*punct* .
*break*
did
not
you
observe
her
manner
of
answering
me
*punct* ?
*break*
how
completely
it
meant
*punct* ,
why
should
my
picture
be
drawn
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
observed
it
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
lost
on
me
*punct* .
*break*
but
still
i
cannot
imagine
she
would
not
be
persuaded
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
was
soon
back
again
*punct* ,
and
the
proposal
almost
immediately
made
*punct* ;
and
she
had
no
scruples
which
could
stand
many
minutes
against
the
earnest
pressing
of
both
the
others
*punct* .
*break*
emma
wished
to
go
to
work
directly
*punct* ,
and
therefore
produced
the
portfolio
containing
her
various
attempts
at
portraits
*punct* ,
for
not
one
of
them
had
ever
been
finished
*punct* ,
that
they
might
decide
together
on
the
best
size
for
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
her
many
beginnings
were
displayed
*punct* .
*break*
miniatures
*punct* ,
half-lengths
*punct* ,
whole-lengths
*punct* ,
pencil
*punct* ,
crayon
*punct* ,
and
water-colours
had
been
all
tried
in
turn
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
always
wanted
to
do
every
thing
*punct* ,
and
had
made
more
progress
both
in
drawing
and
music
than
many
might
have
done
with
so
little
labour
as
she
would
ever
submit
to
*punct* .
*break*
she
played
and
sang;
*punct* ,
and
drew
in
almost
every
style
*punct* ;
but
steadiness
had
always
been
wanting
*punct* ;
and
in
nothing
had
she
approached
the
degree
of
excellence
which
she
would
have
been
glad
to
command
*punct* ,
and
ought
not
to
have
failed
of
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
not
much
deceived
as
to
her
own
skill
either
as
an
artist
or
a
musician
*punct* ,
but
she
was
not
unwilling
to
have
others
deceived
*punct* ,
or
sorry
to
know
her
reputation
for
accomplishment
often
higher
than
it
deserved
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
merit
in
every
drawing
*punct* ,
in
the
least
finished
*punct* ,
perhaps
the
most
*punct* ;
her
style
was
spirited
*punct* ;
but
had
there
been
much
less
*punct* ,
or
had
there
been
ten
times
more
*punct* ,
the
delight
and
admiration
of
her
two
companions
would
have
been
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
both
in
ecstasies
*punct* .
*break*
a
likeness
pleases
every
body
*punct* ;
and
miss
woodhouse's
performances
must
be
capital
*punct* .
*break*
no
great
variety
of
faces
for
you
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
only
my
own
family
to
study
from
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
my
father
*punct* ,
another
of
my
father
*punct* ,
but
the
idea
of
sitting
for
his
picture
made
him
so
nervous
*punct* ,
that
i
could
only
take
him
by
stealth
*punct* ;
neither
of
them
very
like
therefore
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
again
*punct* ,
and
again
*punct* ,
and
again
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* .
*break*
dear
mrs.
weston
*punct* !
*break*
always
my
kindest
friend
on
every
occasion
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
sit
whenever
i
asked
her
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
my
sister
*punct* ;
and
really
quite
her
own
little
elegant
figure!
*punct* ,
and
the
face
not
unlike
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
have
made
a
good
likeness
of
her
*punct* ,
if
she
would
have
sat
longer
*punct* ,
but
she
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
have
me
draw
her
four
children
that
she
would
not
be
quiet
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
here
come
all
my
attempts
at
three
of
those
four
children;
*punct* ,
there
they
are
*punct* ,
henry
and
john
and
bella
*punct* ,
from
one
end
of
the
sheet
to
the
other
*punct* ,
and
any
one
of
them
might
do
for
any
one
of
the
rest
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
so
eager
to
have
them
drawn
that
i
could
not
refuse
*punct* ;
but
there
is
no
making
children
of
three
or
four
years
old
stand
still
you
know
*punct* ;
nor
can
it
be
very
easy
to
take
any
likeness
of
them
*punct* ,
beyond
the
air
and
complexion
*punct* ,
unless
they
are
coarser
featured
than
any
of
mama's
children
ever
were
*punct* .
*break*
here
is
my
sketch
of
the
fourth
*punct* ,
who
was
a
baby
*punct* .
*break*
i
took
him
as
he
was
sleeping
on
the
sofa
*punct* ,
and
it
is
as
strong
a
likeness
of
his
cockade
as
you
would
wish
to
see
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
nestled
down
his
head
most
conveniently
*punct* .
*break*
that's
very
like
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
rather
proud
of
little
george
*punct* .
*break*
the
corner
of
the
sofa
is
very
good
*punct* .
*break*
then
here
is
my
last,
*punct* ,
unclosing
a
pretty
sketch
of
a
gentleman
in
small
size
*punct* ,
whole-length
*punct* ,
my
last
and
my
best
*punct* ,
my
brother
*punct* ,
mr.
john
knightley.
*punct* ,
this
did
not
want
much
of
being
finished
*punct* ,
when
i
put
it
away
in
a
pet
*punct* ,
and
vowed
i
would
never
take
another
likeness
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
help
being
provoked
*punct* ;
for
after
all
my
pains
*punct* ,
and
when
i
had
really
made
a
very
good
likeness
of
it
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
and
i
were
quite
agreed
in
thinking
it
very
like
*punct* ,
only
too
handsome
*punct* ,
too
flattering
*punct* ,
but
that
was
a
fault
on
the
right
side
*punct* ,
after
all
this
*punct* ,
came
poor
dear
isabella's
cold
approbation
of
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
it
was
a
little
like
*punct* ,
but
to
be
sure
it
did
not
do
him
justice
*punct* .
*break*
we
had
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
persuading
him
to
sit
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
made
a
great
favour
of
*punct* ;
and
altogether
it
was
more
than
i
could
bear
*punct* ;
and
so
i
never
would
finish
it
*punct* ,
to
have
it
apologised
over
as
an
unfavourable
likeness
*punct* ,
to
every
morning
visitor
in
brunswick
square;
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
i
said
*punct* ,
i
did
then
forswear
ever
drawing
any
body
again
*punct* .
*break*
but
for
harriet's
sake
*punct* ,
or
rather
for
my
own
*punct* ,
and
as
there
are
no
husbands
and
wives
in
the
case
at
present
*punct* ,
i
will
break
my
resolution
now
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
seemed
very
properly
struck
and
delighted
by
the
idea
*punct* ,
and
was
repeating
*punct* ,
no
husbands
and
wives
in
the
case
at
present
indeed
*punct* ,
as
you
observe
*punct* .
*break*
no
husbands
and
wives
*punct* ,
with
so
interesting
a
consciousness
*punct* ,
that
emma
began
to
consider
whether
she
had
not
better
leave
them
together
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
she
wanted
to
be
drawing
*punct* ,
the
declaration
must
wait
a
little
longer
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
soon
fixed
on
the
size
and
sort
of
portrait
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
to
be
a
whole-length
in
water-colours
*punct* ,
like
mr.
john
knightley's
*punct* ,
and
was
destined
*punct* ,
if
she
could
please
herself
*punct* ,
to
hold
a
very
honourable
station
over
the
mantelpiece
*punct* .
*break*
the
sitting
began
*punct* ;
and
harriet
*punct* ,
smiling
and
blushing
*punct* ,
and
afraid
of
not
keeping
her
attitude
and
countenance
*punct* ,
presented
a
very
sweet
mixture
of
youthful
expression
to
the
steady
eyes
of
the
artist
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
was
no
doing
any
thing
*punct* ,
with
mr.
elton
fidgeting
behind
her
and
watching
every
touch
*punct* .
*break*
she
gave
him
credit
for
stationing
himself
where
he
might
gaze
and
gaze
again
without
offence
*punct* ;
but
was
really
obliged
to
put
an
end
to
it
*punct* ,
and
request
him
to
place
himself
elsewhere
*punct* .
*break*
it
then
occurred
to
her
to
employ
him
in
reading
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
read
to
them
*punct* ,
it
would
be
a
kindness
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
it
would
amuse
away
the
difficulties
of
her
part
*punct* ,
and
lessen
the
irksomeness
of
miss
smith's
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
was
only
too
happy
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
listened
*punct* ,
and
emma
drew
in
peace
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
allow
him
to
be
still
frequently
coming
to
look
*punct* ;
any
thing
less
would
certainly
have
been
too
little
in
a
lover
*punct* ;
and
he
was
ready
at
the
smallest
intermission
of
the
pencil
*punct* ,
to
jump
up
and
see
the
progress
*punct* ,
and
be
charmed.
*punct* ,
there
was
no
being
displeased
with
such
an
encourager
*punct* ,
for
his
admiration
made
him
discern
a
likeness
almost
before
it
was
possible
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
not
respect
his
eye
*punct* ,
but
his
love
and
his
complaisance
were
unexceptionable
*punct* .
*break*
the
sitting
was
altogether
very
satisfactory
*punct* ;
she
was
quite
enough
pleased
with
the
first
day's
sketch
to
wish
to
go
on
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
want
of
likeness
*punct* ,
she
had
been
fortunate
in
the
attitude
*punct* ,
and
as
she
meant
to
throw
in
a
little
improvement
to
the
figure
*punct* ,
to
give
a
little
more
height
*punct* ,
and
considerably
more
elegance
*punct* ,
she
had
great
confidence
of
its
being
in
every
way
a
pretty
drawing
at
last
*punct* ,
and
of
its
filling
its
destined
place
with
credit
to
them
both
*punct* ,
a
standing
memorial
of
the
beauty
of
one
*punct* ,
the
skill
of
the
other
*punct* ,
and
the
friendship
of
both
*punct* ;
with
as
many
other
agreeable
associations
as
mr.
elton's
very
promising
attachment
was
likely
to
add
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
was
to
sit
again
the
next
day
*punct* ;
and
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
just
as
he
ought
*punct* ,
entreated
for
the
permission
of
attending
and
reading
to
them
again
*punct* .
*break*
by
all
means
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
be
most
happy
to
consider
you
as
one
of
the
party
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
civilities
and
courtesies
*punct* ,
the
same
success
and
satisfaction
*punct* ,
took
place
on
the
morrow
*punct* ,
and
accompanied
the
whole
progress
of
the
picture
*punct* ,
which
was
rapid
and
happy
*punct* .
*break*
every
body
who
saw
it
was
pleased
*punct* ,
but
mr.
elton
was
in
continual
raptures
*punct* ,
and
defended
it
through
every
criticism
*punct* .
*break*
miss
woodhouse
has
given
her
friend
the
only
beauty
she
wanted,
*punct* ,
observed
mrs.
weston
to
him
*punct* ,
not
in
the
least
suspecting
that
she
was
addressing
a
lover.
*punct* ,
the
expression
of
the
eye
is
most
correct
*punct* ,
but
miss
smith
has
not
those
eyebrows
and
eyelashes
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
the
fault
of
her
face
that
she
has
them
not
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
think
so
*punct* ?
*break*
i
cannot
agree
with
you
*punct* .
*break*
it
appears
to
me
a
most
perfect
resemblance
in
every
feature
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
saw
such
a
likeness
in
my
life
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
allow
for
the
effect
of
shade
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
made
her
too
tall
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
emma
knew
that
she
had
*punct* ,
but
would
not
own
it
*punct* ;
and
mr.
elton
warmly
added
*punct* ,
oh
no
*punct* !
*break*
certainly
not
too
tall
*punct* ;
not
in
the
least
too
tall
*punct* .
*break*
consider
*punct* ,
she
is
sitting
down
*punct* ,
which
naturally
presents
a
different
*punct* ,
which
in
short
gives
exactly
the
idea
*punct* ,
and
the
proportions
must
be
preserved
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
proportions
*punct* ,
fore-shortening.
*punct* ,
oh
no
*punct* !
*break*
it
gives
one
exactly
the
idea
of
such
a
height
as
miss
smith's
*punct* .
*break*
exactly
so
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
it
is
very
pretty
*punct* ,
said
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* .
*break*
so
prettily
done
*punct* !
*break*
just
as
your
drawings
always
are
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
any
body
who
draws
so
well
as
you
do
*punct* .
*break*
the
only
thing
i
do
not
thoroughly
like
is
*punct* ,
that
she
seems
to
be
sitting
out
of
doors
*punct* ,
with
only
a
little
shawl
over
her
shoulders
*punct* ,
and
it
makes
one
think
she
must
catch
cold
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
my
dear
papa
*punct* ,
it
is
supposed
to
be
summer
*punct* ;
a
warm
day
in
summer
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
the
tree
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
never
safe
to
sit
out
of
doors
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
you
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
may
say
any
thing
*punct* ,
cried
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
but
i
must
confess
that
i
regard
it
as
a
most
happy
thought
*punct* ,
the
placing
of
miss
smith
out
of
doors
*punct* ;
and
the
tree
is
touched
with
such
inimitable
spirit
*punct* !
*break*
any
other
situation
would
have
been
much
less
in
character
*punct* .
*break*
the
naivete
of
miss
smith's
manners
*punct* ,
and
altogether
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
it
is
most
admirable
*punct* !
*break*
i
cannot
keep
my
eyes
from
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
saw
such
a
likeness
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
thing
wanted
was
to
get
the
picture
framed
*punct* ;
and
here
were
a
few
difficulties
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
be
done
directly
*punct* ;
it
must
be
done
in
london
*punct* ;
the
order
must
go
through
the
hands
of
some
intelligent
person
whose
taste
could
be
depended
on
*punct* ;
and
isabella
*punct* ,
the
usual
doer
of
all
commissions
*punct* ,
must
not
be
applied
to
*punct* ,
because
it
was
december
*punct* ,
and
mr.
woodhouse
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
her
stirring
out
of
her
house
in
the
fogs
of
december
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
sooner
was
the
distress
known
to
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
than
it
was
removed
*punct* .
*break*
his
gallantry
was
always
on
the
alert
*punct* .
*break*
might
he
be
trusted
with
the
commission
*punct* ,
what
infinite
pleasure
should
he
have
in
executing
it
*punct* !
*break*
he
could
ride
to
london
at
any
time
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
impossible
to
say
how
much
he
should
be
gratified
by
being
employed
on
such
an
errand
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
too
good!
*punct* ,
she
could
not
endure
the
thought!
*punct* ,
she
would
not
give
him
such
a
troublesome
office
for
the
world,
*punct* ,
brought
on
the
desired
repetition
of
entreaties
and
assurances,
*punct* ,
and
a
very
few
minutes
settled
the
business
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
was
to
take
the
drawing
to
london
*punct* ,
chuse
the
frame
*punct* ,
and
give
the
directions
*punct* ;
and
emma
thought
she
could
so
pack
it
as
to
ensure
its
safety
without
much
incommoding
him
*punct* ,
while
he
seemed
mostly
fearful
of
not
being
incommoded
enough
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
precious
deposit
*punct* !
*break*
said
he
with
a
tender
sigh
*punct* ,
as
he
received
it
*punct* .
*break*
this
man
is
almost
too
gallant
to
be
in
love
*punct* ,
thought
emma
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
say
so
*punct* ,
but
that
i
suppose
there
may
be
a
hundred
different
ways
of
being
in
love
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
an
excellent
young
man
*punct* ,
and
will
suit
harriet
exactly
*punct* ;
it
will
be
an
exactly
so
*punct* ,
as
he
says
himself
*punct* ;
but
he
does
sigh
and
languish
*punct* ,
and
study
for
compliments
rather
more
than
i
could
endure
as
a
principal
*punct* .
*break*
i
come
in
for
a
pretty
good
share
as
a
second
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
his
gratitude
on
harriet's
account
*punct* .
*break*
the
very
day
of
mr.
elton's
going
to
london
produced
a
fresh
occasion
for
emma's
services
towards
her
friend
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
had
been
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
as
usual
*punct* ,
soon
after
breakfast
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
after
a
time
*punct* ,
had
gone
home
to
return
again
to
dinner
*punct* :
she
returned
*punct* ,
and
sooner
than
had
been
talked
of
*punct* ,
and
with
an
agitated
*punct* ,
hurried
look
*punct* ,
announcing
something
extraordinary
to
have
happened
which
she
was
longing
to
tell
*punct* .
*break*
half
a
minute
brought
it
all
out
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
heard
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
she
got
back
to
mrs.
goddard's
*punct* ,
that
mr.
martin
had
been
there
an
hour
before
*punct* ,
and
finding
she
was
not
at
home
*punct* ,
nor
particularly
expected
*punct* ,
had
left
a
little
parcel
for
her
from
one
of
his
sisters
*punct* ,
and
gone
away
*punct* ;
and
on
opening
this
parcel
*punct* ,
she
had
actually
found
*punct* ,
besides
the
two
songs
which
she
had
lent
elizabeth
to
copy
*punct* ,
a
letter
to
herself
*punct* ;
and
this
letter
was
from
him
*punct* ,
from
mr.
martin
*punct* ,
and
contained
a
direct
proposal
of
marriage
*punct* .
*break*
who
could
have
thought
it
*punct* ?
*break*
she
was
so
surprized
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
quite
a
proposal
of
marriage
*punct* ;
and
a
very
good
letter
*punct* ,
at
least
she
thought
so
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
wrote
as
if
he
really
loved
her
very
much
*punct* ,
but
she
did
not
know
*punct* ,
and
so
*punct* ,
she
was
come
as
fast
as
she
could
to
ask
miss
woodhouse
what
she
should
do.
*punct* ,
emma
was
half-ashamed
of
her
friend
for
seeming
so
pleased
and
so
doubtful
*punct* .
*break*
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
she
cried
*punct* ,
the
young
man
is
determined
not
to
lose
any
thing
for
want
of
asking
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
connect
himself
well
if
he
can
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
read
the
letter
*punct* ?
*break*
i'd
rather
you
would
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
not
sorry
to
be
pressed
*punct* .
*break*
she
read
*punct* ,
and
was
surprized
*punct* .
*break*
the
style
of
the
letter
was
much
above
her
expectation
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
not
merely
no
grammatical
errors
*punct* ,
but
as
a
composition
it
would
not
have
disgraced
a
gentleman
*punct* ;
the
language
*punct* ,
though
plain
*punct* ,
was
strong
and
unaffected
*punct* ,
and
the
sentiments
it
conveyed
very
much
to
the
credit
of
the
writer
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
short
*punct* ,
but
expressed
good
sense
*punct* ,
warm
attachment
*punct* ,
liberality
*punct* ,
propriety
*punct* ,
even
delicacy
of
feeling
*punct* .
*break*
she
paused
over
it
*punct* ,
while
harriet
stood
anxiously
watching
for
her
opinion
*punct* ,
with
a
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
and
was
at
last
forced
to
add
*punct* ,
is
it
a
good
letter
*punct* ?
*break*
or
is
it
too
short
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
a
very
good
letter
*punct* ,
replied
emma
rather
slowly
*punct* ,
so
good
a
letter
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
that
every
thing
considered
*punct* ,
i
think
one
of
his
sisters
must
have
helped
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
hardly
imagine
the
young
man
whom
i
saw
talking
with
you
the
other
day
could
express
himself
so
well
*punct* ,
if
left
quite
to
his
own
powers
*punct* ,
and
yet
it
is
not
the
style
of
a
woman
*punct* ;
no
*punct* ,
certainly
*punct* ,
it
is
too
strong
and
concise
*punct* ;
not
diffuse
enough
for
a
woman
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
he
is
a
sensible
man
*punct* ,
and
i
suppose
may
have
a
natural
talent
for
*punct* ,
thinks
strongly
and
clearly
*punct* ,
and
when
he
takes
a
pen
in
hand
*punct* ,
his
thoughts
naturally
find
proper
words
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
so
with
some
men
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
understand
the
sort
of
mind
*punct* .
*break*
vigorous
*punct* ,
decided
*punct* ,
with
sentiments
to
a
certain
point
*punct* ,
not
coarse
*punct* .
*break*
a
better
written
letter
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
returning
it,
*punct* ,
than
i
had
expected
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
the
still
waiting
harriet;
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
and
what
shall
i
do
*punct* ?
*break*
what
shall
you
do
*punct* !
*break*
in
what
respect
*punct* ?
*break*
do
you
mean
with
regard
to
this
letter
*punct* ?
*break*
but
what
are
you
in
doubt
of
*punct* ?
*break*
you
must
answer
it
of
course
*punct* ,
and
speedily
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
shall
i
say
*punct* ?
*break*
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
do
advise
me
*punct* .
*break*
oh
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* !
*break*
the
letter
had
much
better
be
all
your
own
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
express
yourself
very
properly
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
danger
of
your
not
being
intelligible
*punct* ,
which
is
the
first
thing
*punct* .
*break*
your
meaning
must
be
unequivocal
*punct* ;
no
doubts
or
demurs
*punct* :
and
such
expressions
of
gratitude
and
concern
for
the
pain
you
are
inflicting
as
propriety
requires
*punct* ,
will
present
themselves
unbidden
to
your
mind
*punct* ,
i
am
persuaded
*punct* .
*break*
you
need
not
be
prompted
to
write
with
the
appearance
of
sorrow
for
his
disappointment
*punct* .
*break*
you
think
i
ought
to
refuse
him
then
*punct* ,
said
harriet
*punct* ,
looking
down
*punct* .
*break*
ought
to
refuse
him
*punct* !
*break*
my
dear
harriet
*punct* ,
what
do
you
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
are
you
in
any
doubt
as
to
that
*punct* ?
*break*
i
thought
*punct* ,
but
i
beg
your
pardon
*punct* ,
perhaps
i
have
been
under
a
mistake
*punct* .
*break*
i
certainly
have
been
misunderstanding
you
*punct* ,
if
you
feel
in
doubt
as
to
the
purport
of
your
answer
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
imagined
you
were
consulting
me
only
as
to
the
wording
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
was
silent
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
little
reserve
of
manner
*punct* ,
emma
continued
*punct* :
you
mean
to
return
a
favourable
answer
*punct* ,
i
collect
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
do
not
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
i
do
not
mean
*punct* ,
what
shall
i
do
*punct* ?
*break*
what
would
you
advise
me
to
do
*punct* ?
*break*
pray
*punct* ,
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
not
give
you
any
advice
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
a
point
which
you
must
settle
with
your
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
no
notion
that
he
liked
me
so
very
much
*punct* ,
said
harriet
*punct* ,
contemplating
the
letter
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
little
while
emma
persevered
in
her
silence
*punct* ;
but
beginning
to
apprehend
the
bewitching
flattery
of
that
letter
might
be
too
powerful
*punct* ,
she
thought
it
best
to
say
*punct* ,
i
lay
it
down
as
a
general
rule
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
that
if
a
woman
doubts
as
to
whether
she
should
accept
a
man
or
not
*punct* ,
she
certainly
ought
to
refuse
him
*punct* .
*break*
if
she
can
hesitate
as
to
yes
*punct* ,
she
ought
to
say
no
directly
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
a
state
to
be
safely
entered
into
with
doubtful
feelings
*punct* ,
with
half
a
heart
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
it
my
duty
as
a
friend
*punct* ,
and
older
than
yourself
*punct* ,
to
say
thus
much
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
but
do
not
imagine
that
i
want
to
influence
you
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
you
are
a
great
deal
too
kind
to
*punct* ,
but
if
you
would
just
advise
me
what
i
had
best
do
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
i
do
not
mean
that
*punct* ,
as
you
say
*punct* ,
one's
mind
ought
to
be
quite
made
up
*punct* ,
one
should
not
be
hesitating
*punct* ,
it
is
a
very
serious
thing.
*punct* ,
it
will
be
safer
to
say
no
*punct* ,
perhaps.
*punct* ,
do
you
think
i
had
better
say
no
*punct* ?
*break*
not
for
the
world
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
smiling
graciously
*punct* ,
would
i
advise
you
either
way
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
be
the
best
judge
of
your
own
happiness
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
prefer
mr.
martin
to
every
other
person
*punct* ;
if
you
think
him
the
most
agreeable
man
you
have
ever
been
in
company
with
*punct* ,
why
should
you
hesitate
*punct* ?
*break*
you
blush
*punct* ,
harriet.
*punct* ,
does
any
body
else
occur
to
you
at
this
moment
under
such
a
definition
*punct* ?
*break*
harriet
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
do
not
deceive
yourself
*punct* ;
do
not
be
run
away
with
by
gratitude
and
compassion
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
moment
whom
are
you
thinking
of
*punct* ?
*break*
the
symptoms
were
favourable.
*punct* ,
instead
of
answering
*punct* ,
harriet
turned
away
confused
*punct* ,
and
stood
thoughtfully
by
the
fire
*punct* ;
and
though
the
letter
was
still
in
her
hand
*punct* ,
it
was
now
mechanically
twisted
about
without
regard
*punct* .
*break*
emma
waited
the
result
with
impatience
*punct* ,
but
not
without
strong
hopes
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
with
some
hesitation
*punct* ,
harriet
said
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
as
you
will
not
give
me
your
opinion
*punct* ,
i
must
do
as
well
as
i
can
by
myself
*punct* ;
and
i
have
now
quite
determined
*punct* ,
and
really
almost
made
up
my
mind
*punct* ,
to
refuse
mr.
martin
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
think
i
am
right
*punct* ?
*break*
perfectly
*punct* ,
perfectly
right
*punct* ,
my
dearest
harriet
*punct* ;
you
are
doing
just
what
you
ought
*punct* .
*break*
while
you
were
at
all
in
suspense
i
kept
my
feelings
to
myself
*punct* ,
but
now
that
you
are
so
completely
decided
i
have
no
hesitation
in
approving
*punct* .
*break*
dear
harriet
*punct* ,
i
give
myself
joy
of
this
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
have
grieved
me
to
lose
your
acquaintance
*punct* ,
which
must
have
been
the
consequence
of
your
marrying
mr.
martin
*punct* .
*break*
while
you
were
in
the
smallest
degree
wavering
*punct* ,
i
said
nothing
about
it
*punct* ,
because
i
would
not
influence
*punct* ;
but
it
would
have
been
the
loss
of
a
friend
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
have
visited
mrs.
robert
martin
*punct* ,
of
abbey-mill
farm
*punct* .
*break*
now
i
am
secure
of
you
for
ever
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
had
not
surmised
her
own
danger
*punct* ,
but
the
idea
of
it
struck
her
forcibly
*punct* .
*break*
you
could
not
have
visited
me
*punct* !
*break*
she
cried
*punct* ,
looking
aghast
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
to
be
sure
you
could
not
*punct* ;
but
i
never
thought
of
that
before
*punct* .
*break*
that
would
have
been
too
dreadful!
*punct* ,
what
an
escape!
*punct* ,
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
i
would
not
give
up
the
pleasure
and
honour
of
being
intimate
with
you
for
any
thing
in
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
it
would
have
been
a
severe
pang
to
lose
you
*punct* ;
but
it
must
have
been
*punct* .
*break*
you
would
have
thrown
yourself
out
of
all
good
society
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
have
given
you
up
*punct* .
*break*
dear
me!
*punct* ,
how
should
i
ever
have
borne
it
*punct* !
*break*
it
would
have
killed
me
never
to
come
to
hartfield
any
more
*punct* !
*break*
dear
affectionate
creature!
*punct* ,
you
banished
to
abbey-mill
farm!
*punct* ,
you
confined
to
the
society
of
the
illiterate
and
vulgar
all
your
life
*punct* !
*break*
i
wonder
how
the
young
man
could
have
the
assurance
to
ask
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
have
a
pretty
good
opinion
of
himself
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
think
he
is
conceited
either
*punct* ,
in
general
*punct* ,
said
harriet
*punct* ,
her
conscience
opposing
such
censure
*punct* ;
at
least
*punct* ,
he
is
very
good
natured
*punct* ,
and
i
shall
always
feel
much
obliged
to
him
*punct* ,
and
have
a
great
regard
for
*punct* ,
but
that
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
*punct* ,
and
you
know
*punct* ,
though
he
may
like
me
*punct* ,
it
does
not
follow
that
i
should
*punct* ,
and
certainly
i
must
confess
that
since
my
visiting
here
i
have
seen
people
*punct* ,
and
if
one
comes
to
compare
them
*punct* ,
person
and
manners
*punct* ,
there
is
no
comparison
at
all
*punct* ,
one
is
so
very
handsome
and
agreeable
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
i
do
really
think
mr.
martin
a
very
amiable
young
man
*punct* ,
and
have
a
great
opinion
of
him
*punct* ;
and
his
being
so
much
attached
to
me
*punct* ,
and
his
writing
such
a
letter
*punct* ,
but
as
to
leaving
you
*punct* ,
it
is
what
i
would
not
do
upon
any
consideration
*punct* .
*break*
thank
you
*punct* ,
thank
you
*punct* ,
my
own
sweet
little
friend
*punct* .
*break*
we
will
not
be
parted
*punct* .
*break*
a
woman
is
not
to
marry
a
man
merely
because
she
is
asked
*punct* ,
or
because
he
is
attached
to
her
*punct* ,
and
can
write
a
tolerable
letter
*punct* .
*break*
oh
no;
*punct* ,
and
it
is
but
a
short
letter
too
*punct* .
*break*
emma
felt
the
bad
taste
of
her
friend
*punct* ,
but
let
it
pass
with
a
very
true
*punct* ;
and
it
would
be
a
small
consolation
to
her
*punct* ,
for
the
clownish
manner
which
might
be
offending
her
every
hour
of
the
day
*punct* ,
to
know
that
her
husband
could
write
a
good
letter
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
very
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
cares
for
a
letter
*punct* ;
the
thing
is
*punct* ,
to
be
always
happy
with
pleasant
companions
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
quite
determined
to
refuse
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
shall
i
do
*punct* ?
*break*
that
shall
i
say
*punct* ?
*break*
emma
assured
her
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
the
answer
*punct* ,
and
advised
its
being
written
directly
*punct* ,
which
was
agreed
to
*punct* ,
in
the
hope
of
her
assistance
*punct* ;
and
though
emma
continued
to
protest
against
any
assistance
being
wanted
*punct* ,
it
was
in
fact
given
in
the
formation
of
every
sentence
*punct* .
*break*
the
looking
over
his
letter
again
*punct* ,
in
replying
to
it
*punct* ,
had
such
a
softening
tendency
*punct* ,
that
it
was
particularly
necessary
to
brace
her
up
with
a
few
decisive
expressions
*punct* ;
and
she
was
so
very
much
concerned
at
the
idea
of
making
him
unhappy
*punct* ,
and
thought
so
much
of
what
his
mother
and
sisters
would
think
and
say
*punct* ,
and
was
so
anxious
that
they
should
not
fancy
her
ungrateful
*punct* ,
that
emma
believed
if
the
young
man
had
come
in
her
way
at
that
moment
*punct* ,
he
would
have
been
accepted
after
all
*punct* .
*break*
this
letter
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
was
written
*punct* ,
and
sealed
*punct* ,
and
sent
*punct* .
*break*
the
business
was
finished
*punct* ,
and
harriet
safe
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
rather
low
all
the
evening
*punct* ,
but
emma
could
allow
for
her
amiable
regrets
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
relieved
them
by
speaking
of
her
own
affection
*punct* ,
sometimes
by
bringing
forward
the
idea
of
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
never
be
invited
to
abbey-mill
again
*punct* ,
was
said
in
rather
a
sorrowful
tone
*punct* .
*break*
nor
*punct* ,
if
you
were
*punct* ,
could
i
ever
bear
to
part
with
you
*punct* ,
my
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
a
great
deal
too
necessary
at
hartfield
to
be
spared
to
abbey-mill
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
am
sure
i
should
never
want
to
go
there
*punct* ;
for
i
am
never
happy
but
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
some
time
afterwards
it
was
*punct* ,
i
think
mrs.
goddard
would
be
very
much
surprized
if
she
knew
what
had
happened
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
miss
nash
would
*punct* ,
for
miss
nash
thinks
her
own
sister
very
well
married
*punct* ,
and
it
is
only
a
linen-draper
*punct* .
*break*
one
should
be
sorry
to
see
greater
pride
or
refinement
in
the
teacher
of
a
school
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
miss
nash
would
envy
you
such
an
opportunity
as
this
of
being
married
*punct* .
*break*
even
this
conquest
would
appear
valuable
in
her
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
as
to
any
thing
superior
for
you
*punct* ,
i
suppose
she
is
quite
in
the
dark
*punct* .
*break*
the
attentions
of
a
certain
person
can
hardly
be
among
the
tittle-tattle
of
highbury
yet
*punct* .
*break*
hitherto
i
fancy
you
and
i
are
the
only
people
to
whom
his
looks
and
manners
have
explained
themselves
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
blushed
and
smiled
*punct* ,
and
said
something
about
wondering
that
people
should
like
her
so
much
*punct* .
*break*
the
idea
of
mr.
elton
was
certainly
cheering
*punct* ;
but
still
*punct* ,
after
a
time
*punct* ,
she
was
tender-hearted
again
towards
the
rejected
mr.
martin
*punct* .
*break*
now
he
has
got
my
letter
*punct* ,
said
she
softly
*punct* .
*break*
i
wonder
what
they
are
all
doing
*punct* ,
whether
his
sisters
know
*punct* ,
if
he
is
unhappy
*punct* ,
they
will
be
unhappy
too
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
he
will
not
mind
it
so
very
much
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
think
of
those
among
our
absent
friends
who
are
more
cheerfully
employed
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
moment
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
is
shewing
your
picture
to
his
mother
and
sisters
*punct* ,
telling
how
much
more
beautiful
is
the
original
*punct* ,
and
after
being
asked
for
it
five
or
six
times
*punct* ,
allowing
them
to
hear
your
name
*punct* ,
your
own
dear
name
*punct* .
*break*
my
picture!
*punct* ,
but
he
has
left
my
picture
in
bond-street
*punct* .
*break*
has
he
so!
*punct* ,
then
i
know
nothing
of
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
my
dear
little
modest
harriet
*punct* ,
depend
upon
it
the
picture
will
not
be
in
bond-street
till
just
before
he
mounts
his
horse
to-morrow
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
his
companion
all
this
evening
*punct* ,
his
solace
*punct* ,
his
delight
*punct* .
*break*
it
opens
his
designs
to
his
family
*punct* ,
it
introduces
you
among
them
*punct* ,
it
diffuses
through
the
party
those
pleasantest
feelings
of
our
nature
*punct* ,
eager
curiosity
and
warm
prepossession
*punct* .
*break*
how
cheerful
*punct* ,
how
animated
*punct* ,
how
suspicious
*punct* ,
how
busy
their
imaginations
all
are
*punct* !
*break*
harriet
smiled
again
*punct* ,
and
her
smiles
grew
stronger
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
slept
at
hartfield
that
night
*punct* .
*break*
for
some
weeks
past
she
had
been
spending
more
than
half
her
time
there
*punct* ,
and
gradually
getting
to
have
a
bed-room
appropriated
to
herself
*punct* ;
and
emma
judged
it
best
in
every
respect
*punct* ,
safest
and
kindest
*punct* ,
to
keep
her
with
them
as
much
as
possible
just
at
present
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
obliged
to
go
the
next
morning
for
an
hour
or
two
to
mrs.
goddard's
*punct* ,
but
it
was
then
to
be
settled
that
she
should
return
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
to
make
a
regular
visit
of
some
days
*punct* .
*break*
while
she
was
gone
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
called
*punct* ,
and
sat
some
time
with
mr.
woodhouse
and
emma
*punct* ,
till
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
who
had
previously
made
up
his
mind
to
walk
out
*punct* ,
was
persuaded
by
his
daughter
not
to
defer
it
*punct* ,
and
was
induced
by
the
entreaties
of
both
*punct* ,
though
against
the
scruples
of
his
own
civility
*punct* ,
to
leave
mr.
knightley
for
that
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
who
had
nothing
of
ceremony
about
him
*punct* ,
was
offering
by
his
short
*punct* ,
decided
answers
*punct* ,
an
amusing
contrast
to
the
protracted
apologies
and
civil
hesitations
of
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
if
you
will
excuse
me
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
if
you
will
not
consider
me
as
doing
a
very
rude
thing
*punct* ,
i
shall
take
emma's
advice
and
go
out
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
sun
is
out
*punct* ,
i
believe
i
had
better
take
my
three
turns
while
i
can
*punct* .
*break*
i
treat
you
without
ceremony
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
we
invalids
think
we
are
privileged
people
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
do
not
make
a
stranger
of
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
leave
an
excellent
substitute
in
my
daughter
*punct* .
*break*
emma
will
be
happy
to
entertain
you
*punct* .
*break*
and
therefore
i
think
i
will
beg
your
excuse
and
take
my
three
turns
*punct* ,
my
winter
walk
*punct* .
*break*
you
cannot
do
better
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
ask
for
the
pleasure
of
your
company
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
but
i
am
a
very
slow
walker
*punct* ,
and
my
pace
would
be
tedious
to
you
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
besides
*punct* ,
you
have
another
long
walk
before
you
*punct* ,
to
donwell
abbey
*punct* .
*break*
thank
you
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
thank
you
*punct* ;
i
am
going
this
moment
myself
*punct* ;
and
i
think
the
sooner
you
go
the
better
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
fetch
your
greatcoat
and
open
the
garden
door
for
you
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
at
last
was
off
*punct* ;
but
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
instead
of
being
immediately
off
likewise
*punct* ,
sat
down
again
*punct* ,
seemingly
inclined
for
more
chat
*punct* .
*break*
he
began
speaking
of
harriet
*punct* ,
and
speaking
of
her
with
more
voluntary
praise
than
emma
had
ever
heard
before
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
rate
her
beauty
as
you
do
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ;
but
she
is
a
pretty
little
creature
*punct* ,
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
very
well
of
her
disposition
*punct* .
*break*
her
character
depends
upon
those
she
is
with
*punct* ;
but
in
good
hands
she
will
turn
out
a
valuable
woman
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
glad
you
think
so
*punct* ;
and
the
good
hands
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ,
may
not
be
wanting
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
you
are
anxious
for
a
compliment
*punct* ,
so
i
will
tell
you
that
you
have
improved
her
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
cured
her
of
her
school-girl's
giggle
*punct* ;
she
really
does
you
credit
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
be
mortified
indeed
if
i
did
not
believe
i
had
been
of
some
use
*punct* ;
but
it
is
not
every
body
who
will
bestow
praise
where
they
may
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
not
often
overpower
me
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
expecting
her
again
*punct* ,
you
say
*punct* ,
this
morning
*punct* ?
*break*
almost
every
moment
*punct* .
*break*
she
has
been
gone
longer
already
than
she
intended
*punct* .
*break*
something
has
happened
to
delay
her
*punct* ;
some
visitors
perhaps
*punct* .
*break*
highbury
gossips!
*punct* ,
tiresome
wretches
*punct* !
*break*
harriet
may
not
consider
every
body
tiresome
that
you
would
*punct* .
*break*
emma
knew
this
was
too
true
for
contradiction
*punct* ,
and
therefore
said
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
he
presently
added
*punct* ,
with
a
smile
*punct* ,
i
do
not
pretend
to
fix
on
times
or
places
*punct* ,
but
i
must
tell
you
that
i
have
good
reason
to
believe
your
little
friend
will
soon
hear
of
something
to
her
advantage
*punct* .
*break*
of
what
sort
*punct* ?
*break*
a
very
serious
sort
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* ;
still
smiling
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
think
of
but
one
thing
*punct* ,
who
is
in
love
with
her
*punct* ?
*break*
who
makes
you
their
confidant
*punct* ?
*break*
emma
was
more
than
half
in
hopes
of
mr.
elton's
having
dropt
a
hint
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
was
a
sort
of
general
friend
and
adviser
*punct* ,
and
she
knew
mr.
elton
looked
up
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
reason
to
think
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
that
harriet
smith
will
soon
have
an
offer
of
marriage
*punct* ,
and
from
a
most
unexceptionable
quarter:
*punct* ,
robert
martin
is
the
man
*punct* .
*break*
her
visit
to
abbey-mill
*punct* ,
this
summer
*punct* ,
seems
to
have
done
his
business
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
desperately
in
love
and
means
to
marry
her
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
very
obliging
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ;
but
is
he
sure
that
harriet
means
to
marry
him
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
means
to
make
her
an
offer
then
*punct* .
*break*
will
that
do
*punct* ?
*break*
he
came
to
the
abbey
two
evenings
ago
*punct* ,
on
purpose
to
consult
me
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
knows
i
have
a
thorough
regard
for
him
and
all
his
family
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
considers
me
as
one
of
his
best
friends
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
to
ask
me
whether
i
thought
it
would
be
imprudent
in
him
to
settle
so
early
*punct* ;
whether
i
thought
her
too
young
*punct* :
in
short
*punct* ,
whether
i
approved
his
choice
altogether
*punct* ;
having
some
apprehension
perhaps
of
her
being
considered
*punct* ,
especially
since
your
making
so
much
of
her
*punct* ,
as
in
a
line
of
society
above
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
very
much
pleased
with
all
that
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
hear
better
sense
from
any
one
than
robert
martin
*punct* .
*break*
he
always
speaks
to
the
purpose
*punct* ;
open
*punct* ,
straightforward
*punct* ,
and
very
well
judging
*punct* .
*break*
he
told
me
every
thing
*punct* ;
his
circumstances
and
plans
*punct* ,
and
what
they
all
proposed
doing
in
the
event
of
his
marriage
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
an
excellent
young
man
*punct* ,
both
as
son
and
brother
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
no
hesitation
in
advising
him
to
marry
*punct* .
*break*
he
proved
to
me
that
he
could
afford
it
*punct* ;
and
that
being
the
case
*punct* ,
i
was
convinced
he
could
not
do
better
*punct* .
*break*
i
praised
the
fair
lady
too
*punct* ,
and
altogether
sent
him
away
very
happy
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
had
never
esteemed
my
opinion
before
*punct* ,
he
would
have
thought
highly
of
me
then
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* ,
left
the
house
thinking
me
the
best
friend
and
counsellor
man
ever
had
*punct* .
*break*
this
happened
the
night
before
last
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
as
we
may
fairly
suppose
*punct* ,
he
would
not
allow
much
time
to
pass
before
he
spoke
to
the
lady
*punct* ,
and
as
he
does
not
appear
to
have
spoken
yesterday
*punct* ,
it
is
not
unlikely
that
he
should
be
at
mrs.
goddard's
to-day
*punct* ;
and
she
may
be
detained
by
a
visitor
*punct* ,
without
thinking
him
at
all
a
tiresome
wretch
*punct* .
*break*
pray
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
who
had
been
smiling
to
herself
through
a
great
part
of
this
speech
*punct* ,
how
do
you
know
that
mr.
martin
did
not
speak
yesterday
*punct* ?
*break*
certainly
*punct* ,
replied
he
*punct* ,
surprized
*punct* ,
i
do
not
absolutely
know
it
*punct* ;
but
it
may
be
inferred
*punct* .
*break*
was
not
she
the
whole
day
with
you
*punct* ?
*break*
come
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
i
will
tell
you
something
*punct* ,
in
return
for
what
you
have
told
me
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
speak
yesterday
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
he
wrote
*punct* ,
and
was
refused
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
obliged
to
be
repeated
before
it
could
be
believed
*punct* ;
and
mr.
knightley
actually
looked
red
with
surprize
and
displeasure
*punct* ,
as
he
stood
up
*punct* ,
in
tall
indignation
*punct* ,
and
said
*punct* ,
then
she
is
a
greater
simpleton
than
i
ever
believed
her
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
the
foolish
girl
about
*punct* ?
*break*
to
be
sure
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* ,
it
is
always
incomprehensible
to
a
man
that
a
woman
should
ever
refuse
an
offer
of
marriage
*punct* .
*break*
a
man
always
imagines
a
woman
to
be
ready
for
any
body
who
asks
her
*punct* .
*break*
a
man
does
not
imagine
any
such
thing
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
*punct* ?
*break*
harriet
smith
refuse
robert
martin
*punct* ?
*break*
madness
*punct* ,
if
it
is
so
*punct* ;
but
i
hope
you
are
mistaken
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
her
answer!
*punct* ,
nothing
could
be
clearer
*punct* .
*break*
you
saw
her
answer!
*punct* ,
you
wrote
her
answer
too
*punct* .
*break*
emma
*punct* ,
this
is
your
doing
*punct* .
*break*
you
persuaded
her
to
refuse
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
i
did
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
i
am
far
from
allowing
*punct* ,
i
should
not
feel
that
i
had
done
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
martin
is
a
very
respectable
young
man
*punct* ,
but
i
cannot
admit
him
to
be
harriet's
equal
*punct* ;
and
am
rather
surprized
indeed
that
he
should
have
ventured
to
address
her
*punct* .
*break*
by
your
account
*punct* ,
he
does
seem
to
have
had
some
scruples
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
pity
that
they
were
ever
got
over
*punct* .
*break*
not
harriet's
equal
*punct* !
*break*
exclaimed
mr.
knightley
loudly
and
warmly
*punct* ;
and
with
calmer
asperity
*punct* ,
added
*punct* ,
a
few
moments
afterwards
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
he
is
not
her
equal
indeed
*punct* ,
for
he
is
as
much
her
superior
in
sense
as
in
situation
*punct* .
*break*
emma
*punct* ,
your
infatuation
about
that
girl
blinds
you
*punct* .
*break*
what
are
harriet
smith's
claims
*punct* ,
either
of
birth
*punct* ,
nature
or
education
*punct* ,
to
any
connexion
higher
than
robert
martin
*punct* ?
*break*
she
is
the
natural
daughter
of
nobody
knows
whom
*punct* ,
with
probably
no
settled
provision
at
all
*punct* ,
and
certainly
no
respectable
relations
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
known
only
as
parlour-boarder
at
a
common
school
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
not
a
sensible
girl
*punct* ,
nor
a
girl
of
any
information
*punct* .
*break*
she
has
been
taught
nothing
useful
*punct* ,
and
is
too
young
and
too
simple
to
have
acquired
any
thing
herself
*punct* .
*break*
at
her
age
she
can
have
no
experience
*punct* ,
and
with
her
little
wit
*punct* ,
is
not
very
likely
ever
to
have
any
that
can
avail
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
pretty
*punct* ,
and
she
is
good
tempered
*punct* ,
and
that
is
all
*punct* .
*break*
my
only
scruple
in
advising
the
match
was
on
his
account
*punct* ,
as
being
beneath
his
deserts
*punct* ,
and
a
bad
connexion
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
that
*punct* ,
as
to
fortune
*punct* ,
in
all
probability
he
might
do
much
better
*punct* ;
and
that
as
to
a
rational
companion
or
useful
helpmate
*punct* ,
he
could
not
do
worse
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
could
not
reason
so
to
a
man
in
love
*punct* ,
and
was
willing
to
trust
to
there
being
no
harm
in
her
*punct* ,
to
her
having
that
sort
of
disposition
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
in
good
hands
*punct* ,
like
his
*punct* ,
might
be
easily
led
aright
and
turn
out
very
well
*punct* .
*break*
the
advantage
of
the
match
i
felt
to
be
all
on
her
side
*punct* ;
and
had
not
the
smallest
doubt
*punct* ,
nor
have
i
now
*punct* ,
that
there
would
be
a
general
cry-out
upon
her
extreme
good
luck
*punct* .
*break*
even
your
satisfaction
i
made
sure
of
*punct* .
*break*
it
crossed
my
mind
immediately
that
you
would
not
regret
your
friend's
leaving
highbury
*punct* ,
for
the
sake
of
her
being
settled
so
well
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
saying
to
myself
*punct* ,
even
emma
*punct* ,
with
all
her
partiality
for
harriet
*punct* ,
will
think
this
a
good
match
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
help
wondering
at
your
knowing
so
little
of
emma
as
to
say
any
such
thing
*punct* .
*break*
think
a
farmer
*punct* ,
and
with
all
his
sense
and
all
his
merit
mr.
martin
is
nothing
more,
*punct* ,
a
good
match
for
my
intimate
friend
*punct* !
*break*
not
regret
her
leaving
highbury
for
the
sake
of
marrying
a
man
whom
i
could
never
admit
as
an
acquaintance
of
my
own
*punct* !
*break*
i
wonder
you
should
think
it
possible
for
me
to
have
such
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
i
assure
you
mine
are
very
different
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
think
your
statement
by
no
means
fair
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
not
just
to
harriet's
claims
*punct* .
*break*
they
would
be
estimated
very
differently
by
others
as
well
as
myself
*punct* ;
mr.
martin
may
be
the
richest
of
the
two
*punct* ,
but
he
is
undoubtedly
her
inferior
as
to
rank
in
society.
*punct* ,
the
sphere
in
which
she
moves
is
much
above
his.
*punct* ,
it
would
be
a
degradation
*punct* .
*break*
a
degradation
to
illegitimacy
and
ignorance
*punct* ,
to
be
married
to
a
respectable
*punct* ,
intelligent
gentleman-farmer
*punct* !
*break*
as
to
the
circumstances
of
her
birth
*punct* ,
though
in
a
legal
sense
she
may
be
called
nobody
*punct* ,
it
will
not
hold
in
common
sense
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
not
to
pay
for
the
offence
of
others
*punct* ,
by
being
held
below
the
level
of
those
with
whom
she
is
brought
up.
*punct* ,
there
can
scarcely
be
a
doubt
that
her
father
is
a
gentleman
*punct* ,
and
a
gentleman
of
fortune.
*punct* ,
her
allowance
is
very
liberal
*punct* ;
nothing
has
ever
been
grudged
for
her
improvement
or
comfort.
*punct* ,
that
she
is
a
gentleman's
daughter
*punct* ,
is
indubitable
to
me
*punct* ;
that
she
associates
with
gentlemen's
daughters
*punct* ,
no
one
*punct* ,
i
apprehend
*punct* ,
will
deny.
*punct* ,
she
is
superior
to
mr.
robert
martin
*punct* .
*break*
whoever
might
be
her
parents
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
whoever
may
have
had
the
charge
of
her
*punct* ,
it
does
not
appear
to
have
been
any
part
of
their
plan
to
introduce
her
into
what
you
would
call
good
society
*punct* .
*break*
after
receiving
a
very
indifferent
education
she
is
left
in
mrs.
goddard's
hands
to
shift
as
she
can;
*punct* ,
to
move
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
in
mrs.
goddard's
line
*punct* ,
to
have
mrs.
goddard's
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
her
friends
evidently
thought
this
good
enough
for
her
*punct* ;
and
it
was
good
enough
*punct* .
*break*
she
desired
nothing
better
herself
*punct* .
*break*
till
you
chose
to
turn
her
into
a
friend
*punct* ,
her
mind
had
no
distaste
for
her
own
set
*punct* ,
nor
any
ambition
beyond
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
as
happy
as
possible
with
the
martins
in
the
summer
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
no
sense
of
superiority
then
*punct* .
*break*
if
she
has
it
now
*punct* ,
you
have
given
it
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
been
no
friend
to
harriet
smith
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* .
*break*
robert
martin
would
never
have
proceeded
so
far
*punct* ,
if
he
had
not
felt
persuaded
of
her
not
being
disinclined
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
him
well
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
too
much
real
feeling
to
address
any
woman
on
the
haphazard
of
selfish
passion
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
to
conceit
*punct* ,
he
is
the
farthest
from
it
of
any
man
i
know
*punct* .
*break*
depend
upon
it
he
had
encouragement
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
most
convenient
to
emma
not
to
make
a
direct
reply
to
this
assertion
*punct* ;
she
chose
rather
to
take
up
her
own
line
of
the
subject
again
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
a
very
warm
friend
to
mr.
martin
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
i
said
before
*punct* ,
are
unjust
to
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
harriet's
claims
to
marry
well
are
not
so
contemptible
as
you
represent
them
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
not
a
clever
girl
*punct* ,
but
she
has
better
sense
than
you
are
aware
of
*punct* ,
and
does
not
deserve
to
have
her
understanding
spoken
of
so
slightingly
*punct* .
*break*
waiving
that
point
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
and
supposing
her
to
be
*punct* ,
as
you
describe
her
*punct* ,
only
pretty
and
good-natured
*punct* ,
let
me
tell
you
*punct* ,
that
in
the
degree
she
possesses
them
*punct* ,
they
are
not
trivial
recommendations
to
the
world
in
general
*punct* ,
for
she
is
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
a
beautiful
girl
*punct* ,
and
must
be
thought
so
by
ninety-nine
people
out
of
an
hundred
*punct* ;
and
till
it
appears
that
men
are
much
more
philosophic
on
the
subject
of
beauty
than
they
are
generally
supposed
*punct* ;
till
they
do
fall
in
love
with
well-informed
minds
instead
of
handsome
faces
*punct* ,
a
girl
*punct* ,
with
such
loveliness
as
harriet
*punct* ,
has
a
certainty
of
being
admired
and
sought
after
*punct* ,
of
having
the
power
of
chusing
from
among
many
*punct* ,
consequently
a
claim
to
be
nice
*punct* .
*break*
her
good-nature
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
is
not
so
very
slight
a
claim
*punct* ,
comprehending
*punct* ,
as
it
does
*punct* ,
real
*punct* ,
thorough
sweetness
of
temper
and
manner
*punct* ,
a
very
humble
opinion
of
herself
*punct* ,
and
a
great
readiness
to
be
pleased
with
other
people
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
very
much
mistaken
if
your
sex
in
general
would
not
think
such
beauty
*punct* ,
and
such
temper
*punct* ,
the
highest
claims
a
woman
could
possess
*punct* .
*break*
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
to
hear
you
abusing
the
reason
you
have
*punct* ,
is
almost
enough
to
make
me
think
so
too
*punct* .
*break*
better
be
without
sense
*punct* ,
than
misapply
it
as
you
do
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
sure
*punct* !
*break*
cried
she
playfully
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
that
is
the
feeling
of
you
all
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
that
such
a
girl
as
harriet
is
exactly
what
every
man
delights
in
*punct* ,
what
at
once
bewitches
his
senses
and
satisfies
his
judgment
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
may
pick
and
chuse
*punct* .
*break*
were
you
*punct* ,
yourself
*punct* ,
ever
to
marry
*punct* ,
she
is
the
very
woman
for
you
*punct* .
*break*
and
is
she
*punct* ,
at
seventeen
*punct* ,
just
entering
into
life
*punct* ,
just
beginning
to
be
known
*punct* ,
to
be
wondered
at
because
she
does
not
accept
the
first
offer
she
receives
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
pray
let
her
have
time
to
look
about
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
always
thought
it
a
very
foolish
intimacy
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
presently
*punct* ,
though
i
have
kept
my
thoughts
to
myself
*punct* ;
but
i
now
perceive
that
it
will
be
a
very
unfortunate
one
for
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
puff
her
up
with
such
ideas
of
her
own
beauty
*punct* ,
and
of
what
she
has
a
claim
to
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
in
a
little
while
*punct* ,
nobody
within
her
reach
will
be
good
enough
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
vanity
working
on
a
weak
head
*punct* ,
produces
every
sort
of
mischief
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
so
easy
as
for
a
young
lady
to
raise
her
expectations
too
high
*punct* .
*break*
miss
harriet
smith
may
not
find
offers
of
marriage
flow
in
so
fast
*punct* ,
though
she
is
a
very
pretty
girl
*punct* .
*break*
men
of
sense
*punct* ,
whatever
you
may
chuse
to
say
*punct* ,
do
not
want
silly
wives
*punct* .
*break*
men
of
family
would
not
be
very
fond
of
connecting
themselves
with
a
girl
of
such
obscurity
*punct* ,
and
most
prudent
men
would
be
afraid
of
the
inconvenience
and
disgrace
they
might
be
involved
in
*punct* ,
when
the
mystery
of
her
parentage
came
to
be
revealed
*punct* .
*break*
let
her
marry
robert
martin
*punct* ,
and
she
is
safe
*punct* ,
respectable
*punct* ,
and
happy
for
ever
*punct* ;
but
if
you
encourage
her
to
expect
to
marry
greatly
*punct* ,
and
teach
her
to
be
satisfied
with
nothing
less
than
a
man
of
consequence
and
large
fortune
*punct* ,
she
may
be
a
parlour-boarder
at
mrs.
goddard's
all
the
rest
of
her
life
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
for
harriet
smith
is
a
girl
who
will
marry
somebody
or
other,
*punct* ,
till
she
grow
desperate
*punct* ,
and
is
glad
to
catch
at
the
old
writing-master's
son
*punct* .
*break*
we
think
so
very
differently
on
this
point
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
that
there
can
be
no
use
in
canvassing
it
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
only
be
making
each
other
more
angry
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
to
my
letting
her
marry
robert
martin
*punct* ,
it
is
impossible
*punct* ;
she
has
refused
him
*punct* ,
and
so
decidedly
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
as
must
prevent
any
second
application
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
abide
by
the
evil
of
having
refused
him
*punct* ,
whatever
it
may
be
*punct* ;
and
as
to
the
refusal
itself
*punct* ,
i
will
not
pretend
to
say
that
i
might
not
influence
her
a
little
*punct* ;
but
i
assure
you
there
was
very
little
for
me
or
for
any
body
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
his
appearance
is
so
much
against
him
*punct* ,
and
his
manner
so
bad
*punct* ,
that
if
she
ever
were
disposed
to
favour
him
*punct* ,
she
is
not
now
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
imagine
*punct* ,
that
before
she
had
seen
any
body
superior
*punct* ,
she
might
tolerate
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
the
brother
of
her
friends
*punct* ,
and
he
took
pains
to
please
her
*punct* ;
and
altogether
*punct* ,
having
seen
nobody
better
*punct* ,
that
must
have
been
his
great
assistant
*punct* ,
she
might
not
*punct* ,
while
she
was
at
abbey-mill
*punct* ,
find
him
disagreeable
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
case
is
altered
now
*punct* .
*break*
she
knows
now
what
gentlemen
are
*punct* ;
and
nothing
but
a
gentleman
in
education
and
manner
has
any
chance
with
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
nonsense
*punct* ,
errant
nonsense
*punct* ,
as
ever
was
talked
*punct* !
*break*
cried
mr.
knightley.
*punct* ,
robert
martin's
manners
have
sense
*punct* ,
sincerity
*punct* ,
and
good-humour
to
recommend
them
*punct* ;
and
his
mind
has
more
true
gentility
than
harriet
smith
could
understand
*punct* .
*break*
emma
made
no
answer
*punct* ,
and
tried
to
look
cheerfully
unconcerned
*punct* ,
but
was
really
feeling
uncomfortable
and
wanting
him
very
much
to
be
gone
*punct* .
*break*
she
did
not
repent
what
she
had
done
*punct* ;
she
still
thought
herself
a
better
judge
of
such
a
point
of
female
right
and
refinement
than
he
could
be
*punct* ;
but
yet
she
had
a
sort
of
habitual
respect
for
his
judgment
in
general
*punct* ,
which
made
her
dislike
having
it
so
loudly
against
her
*punct* ;
and
to
have
him
sitting
just
opposite
to
her
in
angry
state
*punct* ,
was
very
disagreeable
*punct* .
*break*
some
minutes
passed
in
this
unpleasant
silence
*punct* ,
with
only
one
attempt
on
emma's
side
to
talk
of
the
weather
*punct* ,
but
he
made
no
answer
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
thinking
*punct* .
*break*
the
result
of
his
thoughts
appeared
at
last
in
these
words
*punct* .
*break*
robert
martin
has
no
great
loss
*punct* ,
if
he
can
but
think
so
*punct* ;
and
i
hope
it
will
not
be
long
before
he
does
*punct* .
*break*
your
views
for
harriet
are
best
known
to
yourself
*punct* ;
but
as
you
make
no
secret
of
your
love
of
match-making
*punct* ,
it
is
fair
to
suppose
that
views
*punct* ,
and
plans
*punct* ,
and
projects
you
have;
*punct* ,
and
as
a
friend
i
shall
just
hint
to
you
that
if
elton
is
the
man
*punct* ,
i
think
it
will
be
all
labour
in
vain
*punct* .
*break*
emma
laughed
and
disclaimed
*punct* .
*break*
he
continued
*punct* ,
depend
upon
it
*punct* ,
elton
will
not
do
*punct* .
*break*
elton
is
a
very
good
sort
of
man
*punct* ,
and
a
very
respectable
vicar
of
highbury
*punct* ,
but
not
at
all
likely
to
make
an
imprudent
match
*punct* .
*break*
he
knows
the
value
of
a
good
income
as
well
as
any
body
*punct* .
*break*
elton
may
talk
sentimentally
*punct* ,
but
he
will
act
rationally
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
as
well
acquainted
with
his
own
claims
*punct* ,
as
you
can
be
with
harriet's
*punct* .
*break*
he
knows
that
he
is
a
very
handsome
young
man
*punct* ,
and
a
great
favourite
wherever
he
goes
*punct* ;
and
from
his
general
way
of
talking
in
unreserved
moments
*punct* ,
when
there
are
only
men
present
*punct* ,
i
am
convinced
that
he
does
not
mean
to
throw
himself
away
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
heard
him
speak
with
great
animation
of
a
large
family
of
young
ladies
that
his
sisters
are
intimate
with
*punct* ,
who
have
all
twenty
thousand
pounds
apiece
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
laughing
again
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
had
set
my
heart
on
mr.
elton's
marrying
harriet
*punct* ,
it
would
have
been
very
kind
to
open
my
eyes
*punct* ;
but
at
present
i
only
want
to
keep
harriet
to
myself
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
done
with
match-making
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
never
hope
to
equal
my
own
doings
at
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
leave
off
while
i
am
well
*punct* .
*break*
good
morning
to
you,
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
rising
and
walking
off
abruptly
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
very
much
vexed
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
the
disappointment
of
the
young
man
*punct* ,
and
was
mortified
to
have
been
the
means
of
promoting
it
*punct* ,
by
the
sanction
he
had
given
*punct* ;
and
the
part
which
he
was
persuaded
emma
had
taken
in
the
affair
*punct* ,
was
provoking
him
exceedingly
*punct* .
*break*
emma
remained
in
a
state
of
vexation
too
*punct* ;
but
there
was
more
indistinctness
in
the
causes
of
her's
*punct* ,
than
in
his
*punct* .
*break*
she
did
not
always
feel
so
absolutely
satisfied
with
herself
*punct* ,
so
entirely
convinced
that
her
opinions
were
right
and
her
adversary's
wrong
*punct* ,
as
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
he
walked
off
in
more
complete
self-approbation
than
he
left
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
not
so
materially
cast
down
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
but
that
a
little
time
and
the
return
of
harriet
were
very
adequate
restoratives
*punct* .
*break*
harriet's
staying
away
so
long
was
beginning
to
make
her
uneasy
*punct* .
*break*
the
possibility
of
the
young
man's
coming
to
mrs.
goddard's
that
morning
*punct* ,
and
meeting
with
harriet
and
pleading
his
own
cause
*punct* ,
gave
alarming
ideas
*punct* .
*break*
the
dread
of
such
a
failure
after
all
became
the
prominent
uneasiness
*punct* ;
and
when
harriet
appeared
*punct* ,
and
in
very
good
spirits
*punct* ,
and
without
having
any
such
reason
to
give
for
her
long
absence
*punct* ,
she
felt
a
satisfaction
which
settled
her
with
her
own
mind
*punct* ,
and
convinced
her
*punct* ,
that
let
mr.
knightley
think
or
say
what
he
would
*punct* ,
she
had
done
nothing
which
woman's
friendship
and
woman's
feelings
would
not
justify
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
frightened
her
a
little
about
mr.
elton
*punct* ;
but
when
she
considered
that
mr.
knightley
could
not
have
observed
him
as
she
had
done
*punct* ,
neither
with
the
interest
*punct* ,
nor
*punct* ,
she
must
be
allowed
to
tell
herself
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
mr.
knightley's
pretensions
*punct* ,
with
the
skill
of
such
an
observer
on
such
a
question
as
herself
*punct* ,
that
he
had
spoken
it
hastily
and
in
anger
*punct* ,
she
was
able
to
believe
*punct* ,
that
he
had
rather
said
what
he
wished
resentfully
to
be
true
*punct* ,
than
what
he
knew
any
thing
about
*punct* .
*break*
he
certainly
might
have
heard
mr.
elton
speak
with
more
unreserve
than
she
had
ever
done
*punct* ,
and
mr.
elton
might
not
be
of
an
imprudent
*punct* ,
inconsiderate
disposition
as
to
money
matters
*punct* ;
he
might
naturally
be
rather
attentive
than
otherwise
to
them
*punct* ;
but
then
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
did
not
make
due
allowance
for
the
influence
of
a
strong
passion
at
war
with
all
interested
motives
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
saw
no
such
passion
*punct* ,
and
of
course
thought
nothing
of
its
effects
*punct* ;
but
she
saw
too
much
of
it
to
feel
a
doubt
of
its
overcoming
any
hesitations
that
a
reasonable
prudence
might
originally
suggest
*punct* ;
and
more
than
a
reasonable
*punct* ,
becoming
degree
of
prudence
*punct* ,
she
was
very
sure
did
not
belong
to
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
harriet's
cheerful
look
and
manner
established
hers
*punct* :
she
came
back
*punct* ,
not
to
think
of
mr.
martin
*punct* ,
but
to
talk
of
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
miss
nash
had
been
telling
her
something
*punct* ,
which
she
repeated
immediately
with
great
delight
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
perry
had
been
to
mrs.
goddard's
to
attend
a
sick
child
*punct* ,
and
miss
nash
had
seen
him
*punct* ,
and
he
had
told
miss
nash
*punct* ,
that
as
he
was
coming
back
yesterday
from
clayton
park
*punct* ,
he
had
met
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
and
found
to
his
great
surprize
*punct* ,
that
mr.
elton
was
actually
on
his
road
to
london
*punct* ,
and
not
meaning
to
return
till
the
morrow
*punct* ,
though
it
was
the
whist-club
night
*punct* ,
which
he
had
been
never
known
to
miss
before
*punct* ;
and
mr.
perry
had
remonstrated
with
him
about
it
*punct* ,
and
told
him
how
shabby
it
was
in
him
*punct* ,
their
best
player
*punct* ,
to
absent
himself
*punct* ,
and
tried
very
much
to
persuade
him
to
put
off
his
journey
only
one
day
*punct* ;
but
it
would
not
do
*punct* ;
mr.
elton
had
been
determined
to
go
on
*punct* ,
and
had
said
in
a
very
particular
way
indeed
*punct* ,
that
he
was
going
on
business
which
he
would
not
put
off
for
any
inducement
in
the
world
*punct* ;
and
something
about
a
very
enviable
commission
*punct* ,
and
being
the
bearer
of
something
exceedingly
precious
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
perry
could
not
quite
understand
him
*punct* ,
but
he
was
very
sure
there
must
be
a
lady
in
the
case
*punct* ,
and
he
told
him
so
*punct* ;
and
mr.
elton
only
looked
very
conscious
and
smiling
*punct* ,
and
rode
off
in
great
spirits
*punct* .
*break*
miss
nash
had
told
her
all
this
*punct* ,
and
had
talked
a
great
deal
more
about
mr.
elton
*punct* ;
and
said
*punct* ,
looking
so
very
significantly
at
her
*punct* ,
that
she
did
not
pretend
to
understand
what
his
business
might
be
*punct* ,
but
she
only
knew
that
any
woman
whom
mr.
elton
could
prefer
*punct* ,
she
should
think
the
luckiest
woman
in
the
world
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
beyond
a
doubt
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
had
not
his
equal
for
beauty
or
agreeableness
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
might
quarrel
with
her
*punct* ,
but
emma
could
not
quarrel
with
herself
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
so
much
displeased
*punct* ,
that
it
was
longer
than
usual
before
he
came
to
hartfield
again
*punct* ;
and
when
they
did
meet
*punct* ,
his
grave
looks
shewed
that
she
was
not
forgiven
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
sorry
*punct* ,
but
could
not
repent
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
contrary
*punct* ,
her
plans
and
proceedings
were
more
and
more
justified
and
endeared
to
her
by
the
general
appearances
of
the
next
few
days
*punct* .
*break*
the
picture
*punct* ,
elegantly
framed
*punct* ,
came
safely
to
hand
soon
after
mr.
elton's
return
*punct* ,
and
being
hung
over
the
mantelpiece
of
the
common
sitting-room
*punct* ,
he
got
up
to
look
at
it
*punct* ,
and
sighed
out
his
half
sentences
of
admiration
just
as
he
ought
*punct* ;
and
as
for
harriet's
feelings
*punct* ,
they
were
visibly
forming
themselves
into
as
strong
and
steady
an
attachment
as
her
youth
and
sort
of
mind
admitted
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
soon
perfectly
satisfied
of
mr.
martin's
being
no
otherwise
remembered
*punct* ,
than
as
he
furnished
a
contrast
with
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
of
the
utmost
advantage
to
the
latter
*punct* .
*break*
her
views
of
improving
her
little
friend's
mind
*punct* ,
by
a
great
deal
of
useful
reading
and
conversation
*punct* ,
had
never
yet
led
to
more
than
a
few
first
chapters
*punct* ,
and
the
intention
of
going
on
to-morrow
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
much
easier
to
chat
than
to
study
*punct* ;
much
pleasanter
to
let
her
imagination
range
and
work
at
harriet's
fortune
*punct* ,
than
to
be
labouring
to
enlarge
her
comprehension
or
exercise
it
on
sober
facts
*punct* ;
and
the
only
literary
pursuit
which
engaged
harriet
at
present
*punct* ,
the
only
mental
provision
she
was
making
for
the
evening
of
life
*punct* ,
was
the
collecting
and
transcribing
all
the
riddles
of
every
sort
that
she
could
meet
with
*punct* ,
into
a
thin
quarto
of
hot-pressed
paper
*punct* ,
made
up
by
her
friend
*punct* ,
and
ornamented
with
ciphers
and
trophies
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
age
of
literature
*punct* ,
such
collections
on
a
very
grand
scale
are
not
uncommon
*punct* .
*break*
miss
nash
*punct* ,
head-teacher
at
mrs.
goddard's
*punct* ,
had
written
out
at
least
three
hundred
*punct* ;
and
harriet
*punct* ,
who
had
taken
the
first
hint
of
it
from
her
*punct* ,
hoped
*punct* ,
with
miss
woodhouse's
help
*punct* ,
to
get
a
great
many
more
*punct* .
*break*
emma
assisted
with
her
invention
*punct* ,
memory
and
taste
*punct* ;
and
as
harriet
wrote
a
very
pretty
hand
*punct* ,
it
was
likely
to
be
an
arrangement
of
the
first
order
*punct* ,
in
form
as
well
as
quantity
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
was
almost
as
much
interested
in
the
business
as
the
girls
*punct* ,
and
tried
very
often
to
recollect
something
worth
their
putting
in
*punct* .
*break*
so
many
clever
riddles
as
there
used
to
be
when
he
was
young
*punct* ,
he
wondered
he
could
not
remember
them
*punct* !
*break*
but
he
hoped
he
should
in
time
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
always
ended
in
kitty
*punct* ,
a
fair
but
frozen
maid
*punct* .
*break*
his
good
friend
perry
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
whom
he
had
spoken
to
on
the
subject
*punct* ,
did
not
at
present
recollect
any
thing
of
the
riddle
kind
*punct* ;
but
he
had
desired
perry
to
be
upon
the
watch
*punct* ,
and
as
he
went
about
so
much
*punct* ,
something
*punct* ,
he
thought
*punct* ,
might
come
from
that
quarter
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
by
no
means
his
daughter's
wish
that
the
intellects
of
highbury
in
general
should
be
put
under
requisition
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
was
the
only
one
whose
assistance
she
asked
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
invited
to
contribute
any
really
good
enigmas
*punct* ,
charades
*punct* ,
or
conundrums
that
he
might
recollect
*punct* ;
and
she
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
most
intently
at
work
with
his
recollections
*punct* ;
and
at
the
same
time
*punct* ,
as
she
could
perceive
*punct* ,
most
earnestly
careful
that
nothing
ungallant
*punct* ,
nothing
that
did
not
breathe
a
compliment
to
the
sex
should
pass
his
lips
*punct* .
*break*
they
owed
to
him
their
two
or
three
politest
puzzles
*punct* ;
and
the
joy
and
exultation
with
which
at
last
he
recalled
*punct* ,
and
rather
sentimentally
recited
*punct* ,
that
well-known
charade
*punct* ,
my
first
doth
affliction
denote
*punct* ,
which
my
second
is
destin'd
to
feel
and
my
whole
is
the
best
antidote
that
affliction
to
soften
and
heal.
*punct* ,
made
her
quite
sorry
to
acknowledge
that
they
had
transcribed
it
some
pages
ago
already
*punct* .
*break*
why
will
not
you
write
one
yourself
for
us
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
*punct* ?
*break*
said
she
*punct* ;
that
is
the
only
security
for
its
freshness
*punct* ;
and
nothing
could
be
easier
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
never
written
*punct* ,
hardly
ever
*punct* ,
any
thing
of
the
kind
in
his
life
*punct* .
*break*
the
stupidest
fellow
*punct* !
*break*
he
was
afraid
not
even
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
he
stopt
a
moment
*punct* ,
or
miss
smith
could
inspire
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
very
next
day
however
produced
some
proof
of
inspiration
*punct* .
*break*
he
called
for
a
few
moments
*punct* ,
just
to
leave
a
piece
of
paper
on
the
table
containing
*punct* ,
as
he
said
*punct* ,
a
charade
*punct* ,
which
a
friend
of
his
had
addressed
to
a
young
lady
*punct* ,
the
object
of
his
admiration
*punct* ,
but
which
*punct* ,
from
his
manner
*punct* ,
emma
was
immediately
convinced
must
be
his
own
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
offer
it
for
miss
smith's
collection
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* .
*break*
being
my
friend's
*punct* ,
i
have
no
right
to
expose
it
in
any
degree
to
the
public
eye
*punct* ,
but
perhaps
you
may
not
dislike
looking
at
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
speech
was
more
to
emma
than
to
harriet
*punct* ,
which
emma
could
understand
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
deep
consciousness
about
him
*punct* ,
and
he
found
it
easier
to
meet
her
eye
than
her
friend's
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
gone
the
next
moment:
*punct* ,
after
another
moment's
pause
*punct* ,
take
it
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
smiling
*punct* ,
and
pushing
the
paper
towards
harriet
*punct* ,
it
is
for
you
*punct* .
*break*
take
your
own
*punct* .
*break*
but
harriet
was
in
a
tremor
*punct* ,
and
could
not
touch
it
*punct* ;
and
emma
*punct* ,
never
loth
to
be
first
*punct* ,
was
obliged
to
examine
it
herself
*punct* .
*break*
to
miss
*punct* ,
charade
*punct* .
*break*
my
first
displays
the
wealth
and
pomp
of
kings
*punct* ,
lords
of

earth
*punct* !
*break*
their
luxury
and
ease
*punct* .
*break*

view

*break*

ready
wit
the

will
soon
supply
*punct* ,
may

approval
beam
in
that
soft
eye
*punct* !
*break*
she
cast
her
eye
over
it
*punct* ,
pondered
*punct* ,
caught
the
meaning
*punct* ,
read
it
through
again
to
be
quite
certain
*punct* ,
and
quite
mistress
of
the
lines
*punct* ,
and
then
passing
it
to
harriet
*punct* ,
sat
happily
smiling
*punct* ,
and
saying
to
herself
*punct* ,
while
harriet
was
puzzling
over
the
paper
in
all
the
confusion
of
hope
and
dulness
*punct* ,
very
well
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
very
well
indeed

worse
charades

i
give
you
credit
for
it

*break*
this
is
feeling
your
way
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
saying
very
plainly
*punct* ,
pray
*punct* ,
miss
smith
*punct* ,
give
me
leave
to
pay
my
addresses
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
approve
my
charade
and
my
intentions
in
the
same
glance
*punct* .
*break*
may
its
approval
beam
in
that
soft
eye
*punct* !
*break*
soft
is
the
very
word
for
her
eye
*punct* ,
of
all
epithets
*punct* ,
the
justest
that
could
be
given
*punct* .
*break*
thy
ready
wit

*break*
humph

harriet's
ready
wit

*break*
all

*break*
a
man
must
be
very
much
in
love
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
to
describe
her
so

*break*
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
i
wish
you

the
benefit
of
this
*punct* ;
i

this
would
convince

she

break
off
from

very
pleasant
observations

were
otherwise

sort

run
into
great
length

in
this
compliment
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
that
i
cannot
have
a
doubt
as
to
mr.
elton's
intentions
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
his
object
*punct* ,
and
you
will
soon
receive
the
completest
proof
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
it
must
be
so
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
i
could
not
be
so
deceived
*punct* ;
but
now
*punct* ,
it
is
clear
*punct* ;
the
state
of
his
mind
is
as
clear
and
decided
*punct* ,
as
my
wishes
on
the
subject
have
been
ever
since
i
knew
you
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
just
so
long
have
i
been
wanting
the
very
circumstance
to
happen
what
has
happened
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
never
tell
whether
an
attachment
between
you
and
mr.
elton
were
most
desirable
or
most
natural
*punct* .
*break*
its
probability
and
its
eligibility
have
really
so
equalled
each
other
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
very
happy
*punct* .
*break*
i
congratulate
you
*punct* ,
my
dear
harriet
*punct* ,
with
all
my
heart
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
an
attachment
which
a
woman
may
well
feel
pride
in
creating
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
a
connexion
which
offers
nothing
but
good
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
give
you
every
thing
that
you
want
*punct* ,
consideration
*punct* ,
independence
*punct* ,
a
proper
home
*punct* ,
it
will
fix
you
in
the
centre
of
all
your
real
friends
*punct* ,
close
to
hartfield
and
to
me
*punct* ,
and
confirm
our
intimacy
for
ever
*punct* .
*break*
this
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
is
an
alliance
which
can
never
raise
a
blush
in
either
of
us
*punct* .
*break*
dear
miss
woodhouse!
*punct* ,
and
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
was
all
that
harriet
*punct* ,
with
many
tender
embraces
could
articulate
at
first
*punct* ;
but
when
they
did
arrive
at
something
more
like
conversation
*punct* ,
it
was
sufficiently
clear
to
her
friend
that
she
saw
*punct* ,
felt
*punct* ,
anticipated
*punct* ,
and
remembered
just
as
she
ought
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton's
superiority
had
very
ample
acknowledgment
*punct* .
*break*
whatever
you
say
is
always
right
*punct* ,
cried
harriet
*punct* ,
and
therefore
i
suppose
*punct* ,
and
believe
*punct* ,
and
hope
it
must
be
so
*punct* ;
but
otherwise
i
could
not
have
imagined
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
so
much
beyond
any
thing
i
deserve
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
who
might
marry
any
body
*punct* !
*break*
there
cannot
be
two
opinions
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
so
very
superior
*punct* .
*break*
dear
me
*punct* ,
how
clever!
*punct* ,
could
it
really
be
meant
for
me
*punct* ?
*break*
i
cannot
make
a
question
*punct* ,
or
listen
to
a
question
about
that
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
certainty
*punct* .
*break*
receive
it
on
my
judgment
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
sort
of
prologue
to
the
play
*punct* ,
a
motto
to
the
chapter
*punct* ;
and
will
be
soon
followed
by
matter-of-fact
prose
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
sort
of
thing
which
nobody
could
have
expected
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
*punct* ,
a
month
ago
*punct* ,
i
had
no
more
idea
myself!
*punct* ,
the
strangest
things
do
take
place
*punct* !
*break*
when
miss
smiths
and
mr.
eltons
get
acquainted
*punct* ,
they
do
indeed
*punct* ,
and
really
it
is
strange
*punct* ;
it
is
out
of
the
common
course
that
what
is
so
evidently
*punct* ,
so
palpably
desirable
*punct* ,
what
courts
the
pre-arrangement
of
other
people
*punct* ,
should
so
immediately
shape
itself
into
the
proper
form
*punct* .
*break*
you
and
mr.
elton
are
by
situation
called
together
*punct* ;
you
belong
to
one
another
by
every
circumstance
of
your
respective
homes
*punct* .
*break*
your
marrying
will
be
equal
to
the
match
at
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
there
does
seem
to
be
a
something
in
the
air
of
hartfield
which
gives
love
exactly
the
right
direction
*punct* ,
and
sends
it
into
the
very
channel
where
it
ought
to
flow
*punct* .
*break*
the
course
of
true
love
never
did
run
smooth
*punct* ,
a
hartfield
edition
of
shakespeare
would
have
a
long
note
on
that
passage
*punct* .
*break*
that
mr.
elton
should
really
be
in
love
with
me,
*punct* ,
me
*punct* ,
of
all
people
*punct* ,
who
did
not
know
him
*punct* ,
to
speak
to
him
*punct* ,
at
michaelmas
*punct* !
*break*
and
he
*punct* ,
the
very
handsomest
man
that
ever
was
*punct* ,
and
a
man
that
every
body
looks
up
to
*punct* ,
quite
like
mr.
knightley
*punct* !
*break*
his
company
so
sought
after
*punct* ,
that
every
body
says
he
need
not
eat
a
single
meal
by
himself
if
he
does
not
chuse
it
*punct* ;
that
he
has
more
invitations
than
there
are
days
in
the
week
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
excellent
in
the
church
*punct* !
*break*
miss
nash
has
put
down
all
the
texts
he
has
ever
preached
from
since
he
came
to
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
look
back
to
the
first
time
i
saw
him
*punct* !
*break*
how
little
did
i
think!
*punct* ,
the
two
abbots
and
i
ran
into
the
front
room
and
peeped
through
the
blind
when
we
heard
he
was
going
by
*punct* ,
and
miss
nash
came
and
scolded
us
away
*punct* ,
and
staid
to
look
through
herself
*punct* ;
however
*punct* ,
she
called
me
back
presently
*punct* ,
and
let
me
look
too
*punct* ,
which
was
very
good-natured
*punct* .
*break*
and
how
beautiful
we
thought
he
looked
*punct* !
*break*
he
was
arm-in-arm
with
mr.
cole
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
an
alliance
which
*punct* ,
whoever
*punct* ,
whatever
your
friends
may
be
*punct* ,
must
be
agreeable
to
them
*punct* ,
provided
at
least
they
have
common
sense
*punct* ;
and
we
are
not
to
be
addressing
our
conduct
to
fools
*punct* .
*break*
if
they
are
anxious
to
see
you
happily
married
*punct* ,
here
is
a
man
whose
amiable
character
gives
every
assurance
of
it;
*punct* ,
if
they
wish
to
have
you
settled
in
the
same
country
and
circle
which
they
have
chosen
to
place
you
in
*punct* ,
here
it
will
be
accomplished
*punct* ;
and
if
their
only
object
is
that
you
should
*punct* ,
in
the
common
phrase
*punct* ,
be
well
married
*punct* ,
here
is
the
comfortable
fortune
*punct* ,
the
respectable
establishment
*punct* ,
the
rise
in
the
world
which
must
satisfy
them
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
very
true
*punct* .
*break*
how
nicely
you
talk
*punct* ;
i
love
to
hear
you
*punct* .
*break*
you
understand
every
thing
*punct* .
*break*
you
and
mr.
elton
are
one
as
clever
as
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
this
charade!
*punct* ,
if
i
had
studied
a
twelvemonth
*punct* ,
i
could
never
have
made
any
thing
like
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
he
meant
to
try
his
skill
*punct* ,
by
his
manner
of
declining
it
yesterday
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
think
it
is
*punct* ,
without
exception
*punct* ,
the
best
charade
i
ever
read
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
read
one
more
to
the
purpose
*punct* ,
certainly
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
as
long
again
as
almost
all
we
have
had
before
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
consider
its
length
as
particularly
in
its
favour
*punct* .
*break*
such
things
in
general
cannot
be
too
short
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
was
too
intent
on
the
lines
to
hear
*punct* .
*break*
the
most
satisfactory
comparisons
were
rising
in
her
mind
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
one
thing
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
presently
*punct* ,
her
cheeks
in
a
glow
*punct* ,
to
have
very
good
sense
in
a
common
way
*punct* ,
like
every
body
else
*punct* ,
and
if
there
is
any
thing
to
say
*punct* ,
to
sit
down
and
write
a
letter
*punct* ,
and
say
just
what
you
must
*punct* ,
in
a
short
way
*punct* ;
and
another
*punct* ,
to
write
verses
and
charades
like
this
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
have
desired
a
more
spirited
rejection
of
mr.
martin's
prose
*punct* .
*break*
such
sweet
lines
*punct* !
*break*
continued
harriet
*punct* ,
these
two
last!
*punct* ,
but
how
shall
i
ever
be
able
to
return
the
paper
*punct* ,
or
say
i
have
found
it
out?
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
what
can
we
do
about
that
*punct* ?
*break*
leave
it
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
be
here
this
evening
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* ,
and
then
i
will
give
it
him
back
*punct* ,
and
some
nonsense
or
other
will
pass
between
us
*punct* ,
and
you
shall
not
be
committed.
*punct* ,
your
soft
eyes
shall
chuse
their
own
time
for
beaming
*punct* .
*break*
trust
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
what
a
pity
that
i
must
not
write
this
beautiful
charade
into
my
book
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
sure
i
have
not
got
one
half
so
good
*punct* .
*break*
leave
out
the
two
last
lines
*punct* ,
and
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
write
it
into
your
book
*punct* .
*break*
but
those
two
lines
are
*punct* ,
the
best
of
all
*punct* .
*break*
granted;
*punct* ,
for
private
enjoyment
*punct* ;
and
for
private
enjoyment
keep
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
not
at
all
the
less
written
you
know
*punct* ,
because
you
divide
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
couplet
does
not
cease
to
be
*punct* ,
nor
does
its
meaning
change
*punct* .
*break*
but
take
it
away
*punct* ,
and
all
appropriation
ceases
*punct* ,
and
a
very
pretty
gallant
charade
remains
*punct* ,
fit
for
any
collection
*punct* .
*break*
depend
upon
it
*punct* ,
he
would
not
like
to
have
his
charade
slighted
*punct* ,
much
better
than
his
passion
*punct* .
*break*
a
poet
in
love
must
be
encouraged
in
both
capacities
*punct* ,
or
neither
*punct* .
*break*
give
me
the
book
*punct* ,
i
will
write
it
down
*punct* ,
and
then
there
can
be
no
possible
reflection
on
you
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
submitted
*punct* ,
though
her
mind
could
hardly
separate
the
parts
*punct* ,
so
as
to
feel
quite
sure
that
her
friend
were
not
writing
down
a
declaration
of
love
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
too
precious
an
offering
for
any
degree
of
publicity
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
never
let
that
book
go
out
of
my
own
hands
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* .
*break*
very
well
*punct* ,
replied
emma
*punct* ;
a
most
natural
feeling
*punct* ;
and
the
longer
it
lasts
*punct* ,
the
better
i
shall
be
pleased
*punct* .
*break*
but
here
is
my
father
coming
*punct* :
you
will
not
object
to
my
reading
the
charade
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
be
giving
him
so
much
pleasure
*punct* !
*break*
he
loves
any
thing
of
the
sort
*punct* ,
and
especially
any
thing
that
pays
woman
a
compliment
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
the
tenderest
spirit
of
gallantry
towards
us
all!
*punct* ,
you
must
let
me
read
it
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
looked
grave
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
harriet
*punct* ,
you
must
not
refine
too
much
upon
this
charade.
*punct* ,
you
will
betray
your
feelings
improperly
*punct* ,
if
you
are
too
conscious
and
too
quick
*punct* ,
and
appear
to
affix
more
meaning
*punct* ,
or
even
quite
all
the
meaning
which
may
be
affixed
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
be
overpowered
by
such
a
little
tribute
of
admiration
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
had
been
anxious
for
secrecy
*punct* ,
he
would
not
have
left
the
paper
while
i
was
by
*punct* ;
but
he
rather
pushed
it
towards
me
than
towards
you
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
let
us
be
too
solemn
on
the
business
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
encouragement
enough
to
proceed
*punct* ,
without
our
sighing
out
our
souls
over
this
charade
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
hope
i
shall
not
be
ridiculous
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
do
as
you
please
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
came
in
*punct* ,
and
very
soon
led
to
the
subject
again
*punct* ,
by
the
recurrence
of
his
very
frequent
inquiry
of
well
*punct* ,
my
dears
*punct* ,
how
does
your
book
go
on?
*punct* ,
have
you
got
any
thing
fresh
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* ;
we
have
something
to
read
you
*punct* ,
something
quite
fresh
*punct* .
*break*
a
piece
of
paper
was
found
on
the
table
this
morning
*punct* ,
dropt
*punct* ,
we
suppose
*punct* ,
by
a
fairy
*punct* ,
containing
a
very
pretty
charade
*punct* ,
and
we
have
just
copied
it
in
*punct* .
*break*
she
read
it
to
him
*punct* ,
just
as
he
liked
to
have
any
thing
read
*punct* ,
slowly
and
distinctly
*punct* ,
and
two
or
three
times
over
*punct* ,
with
explanations
of
every
part
as
she
proceeded
*punct* ,
and
he
was
very
much
pleased
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
she
had
foreseen
*punct* ,
especially
struck
with
the
complimentary
conclusion
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
that's
very
just
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
that's
very
properly
said
*punct* .
*break*
woman
*punct* ,
lovely
woman
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
such
a
pretty
charade
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
that
i
can
easily
guess
what
fairy
brought
it.
*punct* ,
nobody
could
have
written
so
prettily
*punct* ,
but
you
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* .
*break*
emma
only
nodded
*punct* ,
and
smiled.
*punct* ,
after
a
little
thinking
*punct* ,
and
a
very
tender
sigh
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* !
*break*
it
is
no
difficulty
to
see
who
you
take
after
*punct* !
*break*
your
dear
mother
was
so
clever
at
all
those
things
*punct* !
*break*
if
i
had
but
her
memory
*punct* !
*break*
but
i
can
remember
nothing;
*punct* ,
not
even
that
particular
riddle
which
you
have
heard
me
mention
*punct* ;
i
can
only
recollect
the
first
stanza
*punct* ;
and
there
are
several
*punct* .
*break*
kitty
*punct* ,
a
fair
but
frozen
maid
*punct* ,
kindled
a
flame
i
yet
deplore
*punct* ,
the
hood-wink'd
boy
i
called
to
aid
*punct* ,
though
of
his
near
approach
afraid
*punct* ,
so
fatal
to
my
suit
before
*punct* .
*break*
and
that
is
all
that
i
can
recollect
of
it
*punct* ,
but
it
is
very
clever
all
the
way
through
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
think
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
you
said
you
had
got
it
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* ,
it
is
written
out
in
our
second
page
*punct* .
*break*
we
copied
it
from
the
elegant
extracts
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
garrick's
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
very
true.
*punct* ,
i
wish
i
could
recollect
more
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
kitty
*punct* ,
a
fair
but
frozen
maid
*punct* .
*break*
the
name
makes
me
think
of
poor
isabella
*punct* ;
for
she
was
very
near
being
christened
catherine
after
her
grandmama
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
we
shall
have
her
here
next
week
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
thought
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
where
you
shall
put
her
*punct* ,
and
what
room
there
will
be
for
the
children
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
she
will
have
her
own
room
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ;
the
room
she
always
has;
*punct* ,
and
there
is
the
nursery
for
the
children,
*punct* ,
just
as
usual
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
why
should
there
be
any
change
*punct* ?
*break*
i
do
not
know
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
but
it
is
so
long
since
she
was
here!
*punct* ,
not
since
last
easter
*punct* ,
and
then
only
for
a
few
days.
*punct* ,
mr.
john
knightley's
being
a
lawyer
is
very
inconvenient.
*punct* ,
poor
isabella!
*punct* ,
she
is
sadly
taken
away
from
us
all!
*punct* ,
and
how
sorry
she
will
be
when
she
comes
*punct* ,
not
to
see
miss
taylor
here
*punct* !
*break*
she
will
not
be
surprized
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
i
was
very
much
surprized
when
i
first
heard
she
was
going
to
be
married
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
ask
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
to
dine
with
us
*punct* ,
while
isabella
is
here
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
if
there
is
time.
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
in
a
very
depressed
tone
*punct* ,
she
is
coming
for
only
one
week
*punct* .
*break*
there
will
not
be
time
for
any
thing
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
unfortunate
that
they
cannot
stay
longer
*punct* ,
but
it
seems
a
case
of
necessity
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
john
knightley
must
be
in
town
again
on
the
28th
*punct* ,
and
we
ought
to
be
thankful
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* ,
that
we
are
to
have
the
whole
of
the
time
they
can
give
to
the
country
*punct* ,
that
two
or
three
days
are
not
to
be
taken
out
for
the
abbey
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
promises
to
give
up
his
claim
this
christmas
*punct* ,
though
you
know
it
is
longer
since
they
were
with
him
*punct* ,
than
with
us
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
very
hard
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
if
poor
isabella
were
to
be
anywhere
but
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
could
never
allow
for
mr.
knightley's
claims
on
his
brother
*punct* ,
or
any
body's
claims
on
isabella
*punct* ,
except
his
own
*punct* .
*break*
he
sat
musing
a
little
while
*punct* ,
and
then
said
*punct* ,
but
i
do
not
see
why
poor
isabella
should
be
obliged
to
go
back
so
soon
*punct* ,
though
he
does
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
i
shall
try
and
persuade
her
to
stay
longer
with
us
*punct* .
*break*
she
and
the
children
might
stay
very
well
*punct* .
*break*
papa
*punct* ,
that
is
what
you
never
have
been
able
to
accomplish
*punct* ,
and
i
do
not
think
you
ever
will
*punct* .
*break*
isabella
cannot
bear
to
stay
behind
her
husband
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
too
true
for
contradiction
*punct* .
*break*
unwelcome
as
it
was
*punct* ,
mr.
woodhouse
could
only
give
a
submissive
sigh
*punct* ;
and
as
emma
saw
his
spirits
affected
by
the
idea
of
his
daughter's
attachment
to
her
husband
*punct* ,
she
immediately
led
to
such
a
branch
of
the
subject
as
must
raise
them
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
must
give
us
as
much
of
her
company
as
she
can
while
my
brother
and
sister
are
here
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
she
will
be
pleased
with
the
children
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
very
proud
of
the
children
*punct* ,
are
not
we
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* ?
*break*
i
wonder
which
she
will
think
the
handsomest
*punct* ,
henry
or
john
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
i
wonder
which
she
will
*punct* .
*break*
poor
little
dears
*punct* ,
how
glad
they
will
be
to
come
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
very
fond
of
being
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
they
are
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
who
is
not
*punct* .
*break*
henry
is
a
fine
boy
*punct* ,
but
john
is
very
like
his
mama
*punct* .
*break*
henry
is
the
eldest
*punct* ,
he
was
named
after
me
*punct* ,
not
after
his
father
*punct* .
*break*
john
*punct* ,
the
second
*punct* ,
is
named
after
his
father
*punct* .
*break*
some
people
are
surprized
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
that
the
eldest
was
not
*punct* ,
but
isabella
would
have
him
called
henry
*punct* ,
which
i
thought
very
pretty
of
her
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
is
a
very
clever
boy
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
all
remarkably
clever
*punct* ;
and
they
have
so
many
pretty
ways
*punct* .
*break*
they
will
come
and
stand
by
my
chair
*punct* ,
and
say
*punct* ,
grandpapa
*punct* ,
can
you
give
me
a
bit
of
string
*punct* ?
*break*
and
once
henry
asked
me
for
a
knife
*punct* ,
but
i
told
him
knives
were
only
made
for
grandpapas
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
their
father
is
too
rough
with
them
very
often
*punct* .
*break*
he
appears
rough
to
you
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
because
you
are
so
very
gentle
yourself
*punct* ;
but
if
you
could
compare
him
with
other
papas
*punct* ,
you
would
not
think
him
rough
*punct* .
*break*
he
wishes
his
boys
to
be
active
and
hardy
*punct* ;
and
if
they
misbehave
*punct* ,
can
give
them
a
sharp
word
now
and
then
*punct* ;
but
he
is
an
affectionate
father
*punct* ,
certainly
mr.
john
knightley
is
an
affectionate
father
*punct* .
*break*
the
children
are
all
fond
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
their
uncle
comes
in
*punct* ,
and
tosses
them
up
to
the
ceiling
in
a
very
frightful
way
*punct* !
*break*
but
they
like
it
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* ;
there
is
nothing
they
like
so
much
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
such
enjoyment
to
them
*punct* ,
that
if
their
uncle
did
not
lay
down
the
rule
of
their
taking
turns
*punct* ,
whichever
began
would
never
give
way
to
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
i
cannot
understand
it
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
the
case
with
us
all
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* .
*break*
one
half
of
the
world
cannot
understand
the
pleasures
of
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
later
in
the
morning
*punct* ,
and
just
as
the
girls
were
going
to
separate
in
preparation
for
the
regular
four
o'clock
dinner
*punct* ,
the
hero
of
this
inimitable
charade
walked
in
again
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
turned
away
*punct* ;
but
emma
could
receive
him
with
the
usual
smile
*punct* ,
and
her
quick
eye
soon
discerned
in
his
the
consciousness
of
having
made
a
push
*punct* ,
of
having
thrown
a
die
*punct* ;
and
she
imagined
he
was
come
to
see
how
it
might
turn
up
*punct* .
*break*
his
ostensible
reason
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
was
to
ask
whether
mr.
woodhouse's
party
could
be
made
up
in
the
evening
without
him
*punct* ,
or
whether
he
should
be
in
the
smallest
degree
necessary
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
were
*punct* ,
every
thing
else
must
give
way
*punct* ;
but
otherwise
his
friend
cole
had
been
saying
so
much
about
his
dining
with
him
*punct* ,
had
made
such
a
point
of
it
*punct* ,
that
he
had
promised
him
conditionally
to
come
*punct* .
*break*
emma
thanked
him
*punct* ,
but
could
not
allow
of
his
disappointing
his
friend
on
their
account
*punct* ;
her
father
was
sure
of
his
rubber
*punct* .
*break*
he
re-urged
*punct* ,
she
re-declined
*punct* ;
and
he
seemed
then
about
to
make
his
bow
*punct* ,
when
taking
the
paper
from
the
table
*punct* ,
she
returned
it
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
here
is
the
charade
you
were
so
obliging
as
to
leave
with
us
*punct* ;
thank
you
for
the
sight
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
we
admired
it
so
much
*punct* ,
that
i
have
ventured
to
write
it
into
miss
smith's
collection
*punct* .
*break*
your
friend
will
not
take
it
amiss
i
hope
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
i
have
not
transcribed
beyond
the
first
eight
lines
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
certainly
did
not
very
well
know
what
to
say
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
rather
doubtingly
*punct* ,
rather
confused
*punct* ;
said
something
about
honour,
*punct* ,
glanced
at
emma
and
at
harriet
*punct* ,
and
then
seeing
the
book
open
on
the
table
*punct* ,
took
it
up
*punct* ,
and
examined
it
very
attentively
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
view
of
passing
off
an
awkward
moment
*punct* ,
emma
smilingly
said
*punct* ,
you
must
make
my
apologies
to
your
friend
*punct* ;
but
so
good
a
charade
must
not
be
confined
to
one
or
two
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
be
sure
of
every
woman's
approbation
while
he
writes
with
such
gallantry
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
though
hesitating
a
good
deal
while
he
spoke
*punct* ;
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
*punct* ,
at
least
if
my
friend
feels
at
all
as
i
do
*punct* ,
i
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
that
*punct* ,
could
he
see
his
little
effusion
honoured
as
i
see
it
*punct* ,
looking
at
the
book
again
*punct* ,
and
replacing
it
on
the
table
*punct* ,
he
would
consider
it
as
the
proudest
moment
of
his
life
*punct* .
*break*
after
this
speech
he
was
gone
as
soon
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
think
it
too
soon
*punct* ;
for
with
all
his
good
and
agreeable
qualities
*punct* ,
there
was
a
sort
of
parade
in
his
speeches
which
was
very
apt
to
incline
her
to
laugh
*punct* .
*break*
she
ran
away
to
indulge
the
inclination
*punct* ,
leaving
the
tender
and
the
sublime
of
pleasure
to
harriet's
share
*punct* .
*break*
though
now
the
middle
of
december
*punct* ,
there
had
yet
been
no
weather
to
prevent
the
young
ladies
from
tolerably
regular
exercise
*punct* ;
and
on
the
morrow
*punct* ,
emma
had
a
charitable
visit
to
pay
to
a
poor
sick
family
*punct* ,
who
lived
a
little
way
out
of
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
their
road
to
this
detached
cottage
was
down
vicarage
lane
*punct* ,
a
lane
leading
at
right
angles
from
the
broad
*punct* ,
though
irregular
*punct* ,
main
street
of
the
place
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
as
may
be
inferred
*punct* ,
containing
the
blessed
abode
of
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
inferior
dwellings
were
first
to
be
passed
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
lane
rose
the
vicarage
*punct* ,
an
old
and
not
very
good
house
*punct* ,
almost
as
close
to
the
road
as
it
could
be
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
no
advantage
of
situation
*punct* ;
but
had
been
very
much
smartened
up
by
the
present
proprietor
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
such
as
it
was
*punct* ,
there
could
be
no
possibility
of
the
two
friends
passing
it
without
a
slackened
pace
and
observing
eyes.
*punct* ,
emma's
remark
was
*punct* ,
there
it
is
*punct* .
*break*
there
go
you
and
your
riddle-book
one
of
these
days.
*punct* ,
harriet's
was
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
what
a
sweet
house!
*punct* ,
how
very
beautiful!
*punct* ,
there
are
the
yellow
curtains
that
miss
nash
admires
so
much
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
often
walk
this
way
now
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
as
they
proceeded
*punct* ,
but
then
there
will
be
an
inducement
*punct* ,
and
i
shall
gradually
get
intimately
acquainted
with
all
the
hedges
*punct* ,
gates
*punct* ,
pools
and
pollards
of
this
part
of
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
*punct* ,
she
found
*punct* ,
had
never
in
her
life
been
within
side
the
vicarage
*punct* ,
and
her
curiosity
to
see
it
was
so
extreme
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
considering
exteriors
and
probabilities
*punct* ,
emma
could
only
class
it
*punct* ,
as
a
proof
of
love
*punct* ,
with
mr.
elton's
seeing
ready
wit
in
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
we
could
contrive
it
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ;
but
i
cannot
think
of
any
tolerable
pretence
for
going
in;
*punct* ,
no
servant
that
i
want
to
inquire
about
of
his
housekeeper
*punct* ,
no
message
from
my
father
*punct* .
*break*
she
pondered
*punct* ,
but
could
think
of
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
mutual
silence
of
some
minutes
*punct* ,
harriet
thus
began
again
*punct* ,
i
do
so
wonder
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
that
you
should
not
be
married
*punct* ,
or
going
to
be
married
*punct* !
*break*
so
charming
as
you
are!
*punct* ,
emma
laughed
*punct* ,
and
replied
*punct* ,
my
being
charming
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
is
not
quite
enough
to
induce
me
to
marry
*punct* ;
i
must
find
other
people
charming
*punct* ,
one
other
person
at
least
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
am
not
only
*punct* ,
not
going
to
be
married
*punct* ,
at
present
*punct* ,
but
have
very
little
intention
of
ever
marrying
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
ah!
*punct* ,
so
you
say
*punct* ;
but
i
cannot
believe
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
see
somebody
very
superior
to
any
one
i
have
seen
yet
*punct* ,
to
be
tempted
*punct* ;
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
recollecting
herself,
*punct* ,
is
out
of
the
question
*punct* :
and
i
do
not
wish
to
see
any
such
person
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
rather
not
be
tempted
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
really
change
for
the
better
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
were
to
marry
*punct* ,
i
must
expect
to
repent
it
*punct* .
*break*
dear
me!
*punct* ,
it
is
so
odd
to
hear
a
woman
talk
so!
*punct* ,
i
have
none
of
the
usual
inducements
of
women
to
marry
*punct* .
*break*
were
i
to
fall
in
love
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
it
would
be
a
different
thing
*punct* !
*break*
but
i
never
have
been
in
love
*punct* ;
it
is
not
my
way
*punct* ,
or
my
nature
*punct* ;
and
i
do
not
think
i
ever
shall
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
without
love
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
i
should
be
a
fool
to
change
such
a
situation
as
mine
*punct* .
*break*
fortune
i
do
not
want
*punct* ;
employment
i
do
not
want
*punct* ;
consequence
i
do
not
want
*punct* :
i
believe
few
married
women
are
half
as
much
mistress
of
their
husband's
house
as
i
am
of
hartfield
*punct* ;
and
never
*punct* ,
never
could
i
expect
to
be
so
truly
beloved
and
important
*punct* ;
so
always
first
and
always
right
in
any
man's
eyes
as
i
am
in
my
father's
*punct* .
*break*
but
then
*punct* ,
to
be
an
old
maid
at
last
*punct* ,
like
miss
bates
*punct* !
*break*
that
is
as
formidable
an
image
as
you
could
present
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ;
and
if
i
thought
i
should
ever
be
like
miss
bates
*punct* !
*break*
so
silly
*punct* ,
so
satisfied
*punct* ,
so
smiling
*punct* ,
so
prosing
*punct* ,
so
undistinguishing
and
unfastidious
*punct* ,
and
so
apt
to
tell
every
thing
relative
to
every
body
about
me
*punct* ,
i
would
marry
to-morrow
*punct* .
*break*
but
between
us
*punct* ,
i
am
convinced
there
never
can
be
any
likeness
*punct* ,
except
in
being
unmarried
*punct* .
*break*
but
still
*punct* ,
you
will
be
an
old
maid
*punct* !
*break*
and
that's
so
dreadful
*punct* !
*break*
never
mind
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
i
shall
not
be
a
poor
old
maid
*punct* ;
and
it
is
poverty
only
which
makes
celibacy
contemptible
to
a
generous
public
*punct* !
*break*
a
single
woman
*punct* ,
with
a
very
narrow
income
*punct* ,
must
be
a
ridiculous
*punct* ,
disagreeable
old
maid
*punct* !
*break*
the
proper
sport
of
boys
and
girls
*punct* ,
but
a
single
woman
*punct* ,
of
good
fortune
*punct* ,
is
always
respectable
*punct* ,
and
may
be
as
sensible
and
pleasant
as
any
body
else
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
distinction
is
not
quite
so
much
against
the
candour
and
common
sense
of
the
world
as
appears
at
first
*punct* ;
for
a
very
narrow
income
has
a
tendency
to
contract
the
mind
*punct* ,
and
sour
the
temper
*punct* .
*break*
those
who
can
barely
live
*punct* ,
and
who
live
perforce
in
a
very
small
*punct* ,
and
generally
very
inferior
*punct* ,
society
*punct* ,
may
well
be
illiberal
and
cross
*punct* .
*break*
this
does
not
apply
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
to
miss
bates
*punct* ;
she
is
only
too
good
natured
and
too
silly
to
suit
me
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
in
general
*punct* ,
she
is
very
much
to
the
taste
of
every
body
*punct* ,
though
single
and
though
poor
*punct* .
*break*
poverty
certainly
has
not
contracted
her
mind
*punct* :
i
really
believe
*punct* ,
if
she
had
only
a
shilling
in
the
world
*punct* ,
she
would
be
very
likely
to
give
away
sixpence
of
it
*punct* ;
and
nobody
is
afraid
of
her
*punct* :
that
is
a
great
charm
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
shall
you
do
*punct* ?
*break*
how
shall
you
employ
yourself
when
you
grow
old
*punct* ?
*break*
if
i
know
myself
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
mine
is
an
active
*punct* ,
busy
mind
*punct* ,
with
a
great
many
independent
resources
*punct* ;
and
i
do
not
perceive
why
i
should
be
more
in
want
of
employment
at
forty
or
fifty
than
one-and-twenty
*punct* .
*break*
woman's
usual
occupations
of
hand
and
mind
will
be
as
open
to
me
then
as
they
are
now
*punct* ;
or
with
no
important
variation
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
draw
less
*punct* ,
i
shall
read
more
*punct* ;
if
i
give
up
music
*punct* ,
i
shall
take
to
carpet-work
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
for
objects
of
interest
*punct* ,
objects
for
the
affections
*punct* ,
which
is
in
truth
the
great
point
of
inferiority
*punct* ,
the
want
of
which
is
really
the
great
evil
to
be
avoided
in
not
marrying
*punct* ,
i
shall
be
very
well
off
*punct* ,
with
all
the
children
of
a
sister
i
love
so
much
*punct* ,
to
care
about
*punct* .
*break*
there
will
be
enough
of
them
*punct* ,
in
all
probability
*punct* ,
to
supply
every
sort
of
sensation
that
declining
life
can
need
*punct* .
*break*
there
will
be
enough
for
every
hope
and
every
fear
*punct* ;
and
though
my
attachment
to
none
can
equal
that
of
a
parent
*punct* ,
it
suits
my
ideas
of
comfort
better
than
what
is
warmer
and
blinder
*punct* .
*break*
my
nephews
and
nieces!
*punct* ,
i
shall
often
have
a
niece
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
know
miss
bates's
niece
*punct* ?
*break*
that
is
*punct* ,
i
know
you
must
have
seen
her
a
hundred
times
*punct* ,
but
are
you
acquainted
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ;
we
are
always
forced
to
be
acquainted
whenever
she
comes
to
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
bye
*punct* ,
that
is
almost
enough
to
put
one
out
of
conceit
with
a
niece
*punct* .
*break*
at
least
*punct* ,
that
i
should
ever
bore
people
half
so
much
about
all
the
knightleys
together
*punct* ,
as
she
does
about
jane
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
one
is
sick
of
the
very
name
of
jane
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
every
letter
from
her
is
read
forty
times
over
*punct* ;
her
compliments
to
all
friends
go
round
and
round
again
*punct* ;
and
if
she
does
but
send
her
aunt
the
pattern
of
a
stomacher
*punct* ,
or
knit
a
pair
of
garters
for
her
grandmother
*punct* ,
one
hears
of
nothing
else
for
a
month
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
jane
fairfax
very
well
*punct* ;
but
she
tires
me
to
death
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
now
approaching
the
cottage
*punct* ,
and
all
idle
topics
were
superseded
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
very
compassionate
*punct* ;
and
the
distresses
of
the
poor
were
as
sure
of
relief
from
her
personal
attention
and
kindness
*punct* ,
her
counsel
and
her
patience
*punct* ,
as
from
her
purse
*punct* .
*break*
she
understood
their
ways
*punct* ,
could
allow
for
their
ignorance
and
their
temptations
*punct* ,
had
no
romantic
expectations
of
extraordinary
virtue
from
those
for
whom
education
had
done
so
little
*punct* ;
entered
into
their
troubles
with
ready
sympathy
*punct* ,
and
always
gave
her
assistance
with
as
much
intelligence
as
good-will
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
present
instance
*punct* ,
it
was
sickness
and
poverty
together
which
she
came
to
visit
*punct* ;
and
after
remaining
there
as
long
as
she
could
give
comfort
or
advice
*punct* ,
she
quitted
the
cottage
with
such
an
impression
of
the
scene
as
made
her
say
to
harriet
*punct* ,
as
they
walked
away
*punct* ,
these
are
the
sights
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
to
do
one
good
*punct* .
*break*
how
trifling
they
make
every
thing
else
appear!
*punct* ,
i
feel
now
as
if
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
these
poor
creatures
all
the
rest
of
the
day
*punct* ;
and
yet
*punct* ,
who
can
say
how
soon
it
may
all
vanish
from
my
mind
*punct* ?
*break*
very
true
*punct* ,
said
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
one
can
think
of
nothing
else
*punct* .
*break*
and
really
*punct* ,
i
do
not
think
the
impression
will
soon
be
over
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
as
she
crossed
the
low
hedge
*punct* ,
and
tottering
footstep
which
ended
the
narrow
*punct* ,
slippery
path
through
the
cottage
garden
*punct* ,
and
brought
them
into
the
lane
again
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
think
it
will
*punct* ,
stopping
to
look
once
more
at
all
the
outward
wretchedness
of
the
place
*punct* ,
and
recall
the
still
greater
within
*punct* .
*break*
dear
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
said
her
companion
*punct* .
*break*
they
walked
on
*punct* .
*break*
the
lane
made
a
slight
bend
*punct* ;
and
when
that
bend
was
passed
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
was
immediately
in
sight
*punct* ;
and
so
near
as
to
give
emma
time
only
to
say
farther
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* !
*break*
harriet
*punct* ,
here
comes
a
very
sudden
trial
of
our
stability
in
good
thoughts
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
smiling,
*punct* ,
i
hope
it
may
be
allowed
that
if
compassion
has
produced
exertion
and
relief
to
the
sufferers
*punct* ,
it
has
done
all
that
is
truly
important
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
feel
for
the
wretched
*punct* ,
enough
to
do
all
we
can
for
them
*punct* ,
the
rest
is
empty
sympathy
*punct* ,
only
distressing
to
ourselves
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
could
just
answer
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
dear
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
before
the
gentleman
joined
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
wants
and
sufferings
of
the
poor
family
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
were
the
first
subject
on
meeting
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
going
to
call
on
them
*punct* .
*break*
his
visit
he
would
now
defer
*punct* ;
but
they
had
a
very
interesting
parley
about
what
could
be
done
and
should
be
done
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
then
turned
back
to
accompany
them
*punct* .
*break*
to
fall
in
with
each
other
on
such
an
errand
as
this
*punct* ,
thought
emma
*punct* ;
to
meet
in
a
charitable
scheme
*punct* ;
this
will
bring
a
great
increase
of
love
on
each
side
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
not
wonder
if
it
were
to
bring
on
the
declaration
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
*punct* ,
if
i
were
not
here
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
i
were
anywhere
else
*punct* .
*break*
anxious
to
separate
herself
from
them
as
far
as
she
could
*punct* ,
she
soon
afterwards
took
possession
of
a
narrow
footpath
*punct* ,
a
little
raised
on
one
side
of
the
lane
*punct* ,
leaving
them
together
in
the
main
road
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
had
not
been
there
two
minutes
when
she
found
that
harriet's
habits
of
dependence
and
imitation
were
bringing
her
up
too
*punct* ,
and
that
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
they
would
both
be
soon
after
her
*punct* .
*break*
this
would
not
do
*punct* ;
she
immediately
stopped
*punct* ,
under
pretence
of
having
some
alteration
to
make
in
the
lacing
of
her
half-boot
*punct* ,
and
stooping
down
in
complete
occupation
of
the
footpath
*punct* ,
begged
them
to
have
the
goodness
to
walk
on
*punct* ,
and
she
would
follow
in
half
a
minute
*punct* .
*break*
they
did
as
they
were
desired
*punct* ;
and
by
the
time
she
judged
it
reasonable
to
have
done
with
her
boot
*punct* ,
she
had
the
comfort
of
farther
delay
in
her
power
*punct* ,
being
overtaken
by
a
child
from
the
cottage
*punct* ,
setting
out
*punct* ,
according
to
orders
*punct* ,
with
her
pitcher
*punct* ,
to
fetch
broth
from
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
to
walk
by
the
side
of
this
child
*punct* ,
and
talk
to
and
question
her
*punct* ,
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
*punct* ,
or
would
have
been
the
most
natural
*punct* ,
had
she
been
acting
just
then
without
design
*punct* ;
and
by
this
means
the
others
were
still
able
to
keep
ahead
*punct* ,
without
any
obligation
of
waiting
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
gained
on
them
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
involuntarily
*punct* :
the
child's
pace
was
quick
*punct* ,
and
theirs
rather
slow
*punct* ;
and
she
was
the
more
concerned
at
it
*punct* ,
from
their
being
evidently
in
a
conversation
which
interested
them
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
was
speaking
with
animation
*punct* ,
harriet
listening
with
a
very
pleased
attention
*punct* ;
and
emma
*punct* ,
having
sent
the
child
on
*punct* ,
was
beginning
to
think
how
she
might
draw
back
a
little
more
*punct* ,
when
they
both
looked
around
*punct* ,
and
she
was
obliged
to
join
them
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
was
still
talking
*punct* ,
still
engaged
in
some
interesting
detail
*punct* ;
and
emma
experienced
some
disappointment
when
she
found
that
he
was
only
giving
his
fair
companion
an
account
of
the
yesterday's
party
at
his
friend
cole's
*punct* ,
and
that
she
was
come
in
herself
for
the
stilton
cheese
*punct* ,
the
north
wiltshire
*punct* ,
the
butter
*punct* ,
the
cellery
*punct* ,
the
beet-root
*punct* ,
and
all
the
dessert
*punct* .
*break*
this
would
soon
have
led
to
something
better
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
was
her
consoling
reflection
*punct* ;
any
thing
interests
between
those
who
love
*punct* ;
and
any
thing
will
serve
as
introduction
to
what
is
near
the
heart
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
could
but
have
kept
longer
away
*punct* !
*break*
they
now
walked
on
together
quietly
*punct* ,
till
within
view
of
the
vicarage
pales
*punct* ,
when
a
sudden
resolution
*punct* ,
of
at
least
getting
harriet
into
the
house
*punct* ,
made
her
again
find
something
very
much
amiss
about
her
boot
*punct* ,
and
fall
behind
to
arrange
it
once
more
*punct* .
*break*
she
then
broke
the
lace
off
short
*punct* ,
and
dexterously
throwing
it
into
a
ditch
*punct* ,
was
presently
obliged
to
entreat
them
to
stop
*punct* ,
and
acknowledged
her
inability
to
put
herself
to
rights
so
as
to
be
able
to
walk
home
in
tolerable
comfort
*punct* .
*break*
part
of
my
lace
is
gone
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
and
i
do
not
know
how
i
am
to
contrive
*punct* .
*break*
i
really
am
a
most
troublesome
companion
to
you
both
*punct* ,
but
i
hope
i
am
not
often
so
ill-equipped
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
i
must
beg
leave
to
stop
at
your
house
*punct* ,
and
ask
your
housekeeper
for
a
bit
of
ribband
or
string
*punct* ,
or
any
thing
just
to
keep
my
boot
on
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
looked
all
happiness
at
this
proposition
*punct* ;
and
nothing
could
exceed
his
alertness
and
attention
in
conducting
them
into
his
house
and
endeavouring
to
make
every
thing
appear
to
advantage
*punct* .
*break*
the
room
they
were
taken
into
was
the
one
he
chiefly
occupied
*punct* ,
and
looking
forwards
*punct* ;
behind
it
was
another
with
which
it
immediately
communicated
*punct* ;
the
door
between
them
was
open
*punct* ,
and
emma
passed
into
it
with
the
housekeeper
to
receive
her
assistance
in
the
most
comfortable
manner
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
obliged
to
leave
the
door
ajar
as
she
found
it
*punct* ;
but
she
fully
intended
that
mr.
elton
should
close
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
closed
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
it
still
remained
ajar
*punct* ;
but
by
engaging
the
housekeeper
in
incessant
conversation
*punct* ,
she
hoped
to
make
it
practicable
for
him
to
chuse
his
own
subject
in
the
adjoining
room
*punct* .
*break*
for
ten
minutes
she
could
hear
nothing
but
herself
*punct* .
*break*
it
could
be
protracted
no
longer
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
then
obliged
to
be
finished
*punct* ,
and
make
her
appearance
*punct* .
*break*
the
lovers
were
standing
together
at
one
of
the
windows
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
a
most
favourable
aspect
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
for
half
a
minute
*punct* ,
emma
felt
the
glory
of
having
schemed
successfully
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
would
not
do
*punct* ;
he
had
not
come
to
the
point
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
most
agreeable
*punct* ,
most
delightful
*punct* ;
he
had
told
harriet
that
he
had
seen
them
go
by
*punct* ,
and
had
purposely
followed
them
*punct* ;
other
little
gallantries
and
allusions
had
been
dropt
*punct* ,
but
nothing
serious
*punct* .
*break*
cautious
*punct* ,
very
cautious
*punct* ,
thought
emma
*punct* ;
he
advances
inch
by
inch
*punct* ,
and
will
hazard
nothing
till
he
believes
himself
secure
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
though
every
thing
had
not
been
accomplished
by
her
ingenious
device
*punct* ,
she
could
not
but
flatter
herself
that
it
had
been
the
occasion
of
much
present
enjoyment
to
both
*punct* ,
and
must
be
leading
them
forward
to
the
great
event
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
must
now
be
left
to
himself
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
no
longer
in
emma's
power
to
superintend
his
happiness
or
quicken
his
measures
*punct* .
*break*
the
coming
of
her
sister's
family
was
so
very
near
at
hand
*punct* ,
that
first
in
anticipation
*punct* ,
and
then
in
reality
*punct* ,
it
became
henceforth
her
prime
object
of
interest
*punct* ;
and
during
the
ten
days
of
their
stay
at
hartfield
it
was
not
to
be
expected
*punct* ,
she
did
not
herself
expect
*punct* ,
that
any
thing
beyond
occasional
*punct* ,
fortuitous
assistance
could
be
afforded
by
her
to
the
lovers
*punct* .
*break*
they
might
advance
rapidly
if
they
would
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ;
they
must
advance
somehow
or
other
whether
they
would
or
no
*punct* .
*break*
she
hardly
wished
to
have
more
leisure
for
them
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
people
*punct* ,
who
the
more
you
do
for
them
*punct* ,
the
less
they
will
do
for
themselves
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
and
mrs.
john
knightley
*punct* ,
from
having
been
longer
than
usual
absent
from
surry
*punct* ,
were
exciting
of
course
rather
more
than
the
usual
interest
*punct* .
*break*
till
this
year
*punct* ,
every
long
vacation
since
their
marriage
had
been
divided
between
hartfield
and
donwell
abbey
*punct* ;
but
all
the
holidays
of
this
autumn
had
been
given
to
sea-bathing
for
the
children
*punct* ,
and
it
was
therefore
many
months
since
they
had
been
seen
in
a
regular
way
by
their
surry
connexions
*punct* ,
or
seen
at
all
by
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
who
could
not
be
induced
to
get
so
far
as
london
*punct* ,
even
for
poor
isabella's
sake
*punct* ;
and
who
consequently
was
now
most
nervously
and
apprehensively
happy
in
forestalling
this
too
short
visit
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
much
of
the
evils
of
the
journey
for
her
*punct* ,
and
not
a
little
of
the
fatigues
of
his
own
horses
and
coachman
who
were
to
bring
some
of
the
party
the
last
half
of
the
way
*punct* ;
but
his
alarms
were
needless
*punct* ;
the
sixteen
miles
being
happily
accomplished
*punct* ,
and
mr.
and
mrs.
john
knightley
*punct* ,
their
five
children
*punct* ,
and
a
competent
number
of
nursery-maids
*punct* ,
all
reaching
hartfield
in
safety
*punct* .
*break*
the
bustle
and
joy
of
such
an
arrival
*punct* ,
the
many
to
be
talked
to
*punct* ,
welcomed
*punct* ,
encouraged
*punct* ,
and
variously
dispersed
and
disposed
of
*punct* ,
produced
a
noise
and
confusion
which
his
nerves
could
not
have
borne
under
any
other
cause
*punct* ,
nor
have
endured
much
longer
even
for
this
*punct* ;
but
the
ways
of
hartfield
and
the
feelings
of
her
father
were
so
respected
by
mrs.
john
knightley
*punct* ,
that
in
spite
of
maternal
solicitude
for
the
immediate
enjoyment
of
her
little
ones
*punct* ,
and
for
their
having
instantly
all
the
liberty
and
attendance
*punct* ,
all
the
eating
and
drinking
*punct* ,
and
sleeping
and
playing
*punct* ,
which
they
could
possibly
wish
for
*punct* ,
without
the
smallest
delay
*punct* ,
the
children
were
never
allowed
to
be
long
a
disturbance
to
him
*punct* ,
either
in
themselves
or
in
any
restless
attendance
on
them
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
john
knightley
was
a
pretty
*punct* ,
elegant
little
woman
*punct* ,
of
gentle
*punct* ,
quiet
manners
*punct* ,
and
a
disposition
remarkably
amiable
and
affectionate
*punct* ;
wrapt
up
in
her
family
*punct* ;
a
devoted
wife
*punct* ,
a
doating
mother
*punct* ,
and
so
tenderly
attached
to
her
father
and
sister
that
*punct* ,
but
for
these
higher
ties
*punct* ,
a
warmer
love
might
have
seemed
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
never
see
a
fault
in
any
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
not
a
woman
of
strong
understanding
or
any
quickness
*punct* ;
and
with
this
resemblance
of
her
father
*punct* ,
she
inherited
also
much
of
his
constitution
*punct* ;
was
delicate
in
her
own
health
*punct* ,
over-careful
of
that
of
her
children
*punct* ,
had
many
fears
and
many
nerves
*punct* ,
and
was
as
fond
of
her
own
mr.
wingfield
in
town
as
her
father
could
be
of
mr.
perry
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
alike
too
*punct* ,
in
a
general
benevolence
of
temper
*punct* ,
and
a
strong
habit
of
regard
for
every
old
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
john
knightley
was
a
tall
*punct* ,
gentleman-like
*punct* ,
and
very
clever
man
*punct* ;
rising
in
his
profession
*punct* ,
domestic
*punct* ,
and
respectable
in
his
private
character
*punct* ;
but
with
reserved
manners
which
prevented
his
being
generally
pleasing
*punct* ;
and
capable
of
being
sometimes
out
of
humour
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
not
an
ill-tempered
man
*punct* ,
not
so
often
unreasonably
cross
as
to
deserve
such
a
reproach
*punct* ;
but
his
temper
was
not
his
great
perfection
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
with
such
a
worshipping
wife
*punct* ,
it
was
hardly
possible
that
any
natural
defects
in
it
should
not
be
increased
*punct* .
*break*
the
extreme
sweetness
of
her
temper
must
hurt
his
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
all
the
clearness
and
quickness
of
mind
which
she
wanted
*punct* ,
and
he
could
sometimes
act
an
ungracious
*punct* ,
or
say
a
severe
thing
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
not
a
great
favourite
with
his
fair
sister-in-law
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
wrong
in
him
escaped
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
quick
in
feeling
the
little
injuries
to
isabella
*punct* ,
which
isabella
never
felt
herself
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
she
might
have
passed
over
more
had
his
manners
been
flattering
to
isabella's
sister
*punct* ,
but
they
were
only
those
of
a
calmly
kind
brother
and
friend
*punct* ,
without
praise
and
without
blindness
*punct* ;
but
hardly
any
degree
of
personal
compliment
could
have
made
her
regardless
of
that
greatest
fault
of
all
in
her
eyes
which
he
sometimes
fell
into
*punct* ,
the
want
of
respectful
forbearance
towards
her
father
*punct* .
*break*
there
he
had
not
always
the
patience
that
could
have
been
wished
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse's
peculiarities
and
fidgetiness
were
sometimes
provoking
him
to
a
rational
remonstrance
or
sharp
retort
equally
ill-bestowed
*punct* .
*break*
it
did
not
often
happen
*punct* ;
for
mr.
john
knightley
had
really
a
great
regard
for
his
father-in-law
*punct* ,
and
generally
a
strong
sense
of
what
was
due
to
him
*punct* ;
but
it
was
too
often
for
emma's
charity
*punct* ,
especially
as
there
was
all
the
pain
of
apprehension
frequently
to
be
endured
*punct* ,
though
the
offence
came
not
*punct* .
*break*
the
beginning
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
of
every
visit
displayed
none
but
the
properest
feelings
*punct* ,
and
this
being
of
necessity
so
short
might
be
hoped
to
pass
away
in
unsullied
cordiality
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
not
been
long
seated
and
composed
when
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
with
a
melancholy
shake
of
the
head
and
a
sigh
*punct* ,
called
his
daughter's
attention
to
the
sad
change
at
hartfield
since
she
had
been
there
last
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
poor
miss
taylor
*punct* ,
it
is
a
grievous
business
*punct* .
*break*
oh
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
cried
she
with
ready
sympathy
*punct* ,
how
you
must
miss
her
*punct* !
*break*
and
dear
emma
*punct* ,
too!
*punct* ,
what
a
dreadful
loss
to
you
both!
*punct* ,
i
have
been
so
grieved
for
you.
*punct* ,
i
could
not
imagine
how
you
could
possibly
do
without
her.
*punct* ,
it
is
a
sad
change
indeed.
*punct* ,
but
i
hope
she
is
pretty
well
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
pretty
well
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ,
pretty
well.
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
but
that
the
place
agrees
with
her
tolerably
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
john
knightley
here
asked
emma
quietly
whether
there
were
any
doubts
of
the
air
of
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
none
in
the
least
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
saw
mrs.
weston
better
in
my
life
*punct* ,
never
looking
so
well
*punct* .
*break*
papa
is
only
speaking
his
own
regret
*punct* .
*break*
very
much
to
the
honour
of
both
*punct* ,
was
the
handsome
reply
*punct* .
*break*
and
do
you
see
her
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
tolerably
often
*punct* ?
*break*
asked
isabella
in
the
plaintive
tone
which
just
suited
her
father
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
hesitated.
*punct* ,
not
near
so
often
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
as
i
could
wish
*punct* .
*break*
papa
*punct* ,
we
have
missed
seeing
them
but
one
entire
day
since
they
married
*punct* .
*break*
either
in
the
morning
or
evening
of
every
day
*punct* ,
excepting
one
*punct* ,
have
we
seen
either
mr.
weston
or
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
and
generally
both
*punct* ,
either
at
randalls
or
here
*punct* ,
and
as
you
may
suppose
*punct* ,
isabella
*punct* ,
most
frequently
here
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
very
*punct* ,
very
kind
in
their
visits
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
is
really
as
kind
as
herself
*punct* .
*break*
papa
*punct* ,
if
you
speak
in
that
melancholy
way
*punct* ,
you
will
be
giving
isabella
a
false
idea
of
us
all
*punct* .
*break*
every
body
must
be
aware
that
miss
taylor
must
be
missed
*punct* ,
but
every
body
ought
also
to
be
assured
that
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
do
really
prevent
our
missing
her
by
any
means
to
the
extent
we
ourselves
anticipated
*punct* ,
which
is
the
exact
truth
*punct* .
*break*
just
as
it
should
be
*punct* ,
said
mr.
john
knightley
*punct* ,
and
just
as
i
hoped
it
was
from
your
letters
*punct* .
*break*
her
wish
of
shewing
you
attention
could
not
be
doubted
*punct* ,
and
his
being
a
disengaged
and
social
man
makes
it
all
easy
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
been
always
telling
you
*punct* ,
my
love
*punct* ,
that
i
had
no
idea
of
the
change
being
so
very
material
to
hartfield
as
you
apprehended
*punct* ;
and
now
you
have
emma's
account
*punct* ,
i
hope
you
will
be
satisfied
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
to
be
sure
*punct* ,
said
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
certainly
*punct* ,
i
cannot
deny
that
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
poor
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
does
come
and
see
us
pretty
often
*punct* ,
but
then
*punct* ,
she
is
always
obliged
to
go
away
again
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
very
hard
upon
mr.
weston
if
she
did
not
*punct* ,
papa.
*punct* ,
you
quite
forget
poor
mr.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
said
john
knightley
pleasantly
*punct* ,
that
mr.
weston
has
some
little
claim
*punct* .
*break*
you
and
i
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
will
venture
to
take
the
part
of
the
poor
husband
*punct* .
*break*
i
*punct* ,
being
a
husband
*punct* ,
and
you
not
being
a
wife
*punct* ,
the
claims
of
the
man
may
very
likely
strike
us
with
equal
force
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
isabella
*punct* ,
she
has
been
married
long
enough
to
see
the
convenience
of
putting
all
the
mr.
westons
aside
as
much
as
she
can
*punct* .
*break*
me
*punct* ,
my
love
*punct* ,
cried
his
wife
*punct* ,
hearing
and
understanding
only
in
part.
*punct* ,
are
you
talking
about
me?
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
nobody
ought
to
be
*punct* ,
or
can
be
*punct* ,
a
greater
advocate
for
matrimony
than
i
am
*punct* ;
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
misery
of
her
leaving
hartfield
*punct* ,
i
should
never
have
thought
of
miss
taylor
but
as
the
most
fortunate
woman
in
the
world
*punct* ;
and
as
to
slighting
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
that
excellent
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
i
think
there
is
nothing
he
does
not
deserve
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
he
is
one
of
the
very
best-tempered
men
that
ever
existed
*punct* .
*break*
excepting
yourself
and
your
brother
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
his
equal
for
temper
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
never
forget
his
flying
henry's
kite
for
him
that
very
windy
day
last
easter
*punct* ,
and
ever
since
his
particular
kindness
last
september
twelvemonth
in
writing
that
note
*punct* ,
at
twelve
o'clock
at
night
*punct* ,
on
purpose
to
assure
me
that
there
was
no
scarlet
fever
at
cobham
*punct* ,
i
have
been
convinced
there
could
not
be
a
more
feeling
heart
nor
a
better
man
in
existence.
*punct* ,
if
any
body
can
deserve
him
*punct* ,
it
must
be
miss
taylor
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
the
young
man
*punct* ?
*break*
said
john
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
has
he
been
here
on
this
occasion
*punct* ,
or
has
he
not
*punct* ?
*break*
he
has
not
been
here
yet
*punct* ,
replied
emma
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
strong
expectation
of
his
coming
soon
after
the
marriage
*punct* ,
but
it
ended
in
nothing
*punct* ;
and
i
have
not
heard
him
mentioned
lately
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
should
tell
them
of
the
letter
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
her
father
*punct* .
*break*
he
wrote
a
letter
to
poor
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
to
congratulate
her
*punct* ,
and
a
very
proper
*punct* ,
handsome
letter
it
was
*punct* .
*break*
she
shewed
it
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
it
very
well
done
of
him
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
whether
it
was
his
own
idea
you
know
*punct* ,
one
cannot
tell
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
but
young
*punct* ,
and
his
uncle
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
my
dear
papa
*punct* ,
he
is
three-and-twenty
*punct* .
*break*
you
forget
how
time
passes
*punct* .
*break*
three-and-twenty!
*punct* ,
is
he
indeed?
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
i
could
not
have
thought
it
*punct* ,
and
he
was
but
two
years
old
when
he
lost
his
poor
mother
*punct* !
*break*
well
*punct* ,
time
does
fly
indeed!
*punct* ,
and
my
memory
is
very
bad
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
it
was
an
exceeding
good
*punct* ,
pretty
letter
*punct* ,
and
gave
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
it
was
written
from
weymouth
*punct* ,
and
dated
sept
*punct* .
*break*
weston
churchill.'
*punct* ,
i
remember
that
perfectly
*punct* .
*break*
how
very
pleasing
and
proper
of
him
*punct* !
*break*
cried
the
good-hearted
mrs.
john
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
doubt
of
his
being
a
most
amiable
young
man
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
sad
it
is
that
he
should
not
live
at
home
with
his
father
*punct* !
*break*
there
is
something
so
shocking
in
a
child's
being
taken
away
from
his
parents
and
natural
home
*punct* !
*break*
i
never
could
comprehend
how
mr.
weston
could
part
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
to
give
up
one's
child
*punct* !
*break*
i
really
never
could
think
well
of
any
body
who
proposed
such
a
thing
to
any
body
else
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
ever
did
think
well
of
the
churchills
*punct* ,
i
fancy
*punct* ,
observed
mr.
john
knightley
coolly
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
need
not
imagine
mr.
weston
to
have
felt
what
you
would
feel
in
giving
up
henry
or
john
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
is
rather
an
easy
*punct* ,
cheerful-tempered
man
*punct* ,
than
a
man
of
strong
feelings
*punct* ;
he
takes
things
as
he
finds
them
*punct* ,
and
makes
enjoyment
of
them
somehow
or
other
*punct* ,
depending
*punct* ,
i
suspect
*punct* ,
much
more
upon
what
is
called
society
for
his
comforts
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
upon
the
power
of
eating
and
drinking
*punct* ,
and
playing
whist
with
his
neighbours
five
times
a
week
*punct* ,
than
upon
family
affection
*punct* ,
or
any
thing
that
home
affords
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
like
what
bordered
on
a
reflecti
on
on
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
and
had
half
a
mind
to
take
it
up
*punct* ;
but
she
struggled
*punct* ,
and
let
it
pass
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
keep
the
peace
if
possible
*punct* ;
and
there
was
something
honourable
and
valuable
in
the
strong
domestic
habits
*punct* ,
the
all-sufficiency
of
home
to
himself
*punct* ,
whence
resulted
her
brother's
disposition
to
look
down
on
the
common
rate
of
social
intercourse
*punct* ,
and
those
to
whom
it
was
important.
*punct* ,
it
had
a
high
claim
to
forbearance
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
was
to
dine
with
them
*punct* ,
rather
against
the
inclination
of
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
who
did
not
like
that
any
one
should
share
with
him
in
isabella's
first
day
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
sense
of
right
however
had
decided
it
*punct* ;
and
besides
the
consideration
of
what
was
due
to
each
brother
*punct* ,
she
had
particular
pleasure
*punct* ,
from
the
circumstance
of
the
late
disagreement
between
mr.
knightley
and
herself
*punct* ,
in
procuring
him
the
proper
invitation
*punct* .
*break*
she
hoped
they
might
now
become
friends
again
*punct* .
*break*
she
thought
it
was
time
to
make
up
*punct* .
*break*
making-up
indeed
would
not
do
*punct* .
*break*
she
certainly
had
not
been
in
the
wrong
*punct* ,
and
he
would
never
own
that
he
had
*punct* .
*break*
concession
must
be
out
of
the
question
*punct* ;
but
it
was
time
to
appear
to
forget
that
they
had
ever
quarrelled
*punct* ;
and
she
hoped
it
might
rather
assist
the
restoration
of
friendship
*punct* ,
that
when
he
came
into
the
room
she
had
one
of
the
children
with
her
*punct* ,
the
youngest
*punct* ,
a
nice
little
girl
about
eight
months
old
*punct* ,
who
was
now
making
her
first
visit
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
and
very
happy
to
be
danced
about
in
her
aunt's
arms
*punct* .
*break*
it
did
assist
*punct* ;
for
though
he
began
with
grave
looks
and
short
questions
*punct* ,
he
was
soon
led
on
to
talk
of
them
all
in
the
usual
way
*punct* ,
and
to
take
the
child
out
of
her
arms
with
all
the
unceremoniousness
of
perfect
amity
*punct* .
*break*
emma
felt
they
were
friends
again
*punct* ;
and
the
conviction
giving
her
at
first
great
satisfaction
*punct* ,
and
then
a
little
sauciness
*punct* ,
she
could
not
help
saying
*punct* ,
as
he
was
admiring
the
baby
*punct* ,
what
a
comfort
it
is
*punct* ,
that
we
think
alike
about
our
nephews
and
nieces
*punct* .
*break*
as
to
men
and
women
*punct* ,
our
opinions
are
sometimes
very
different
*punct* ;
but
with
regard
to
these
children
*punct* ,
i
observe
we
never
disagree
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
were
as
much
guided
by
nature
in
your
estimate
of
men
and
women
*punct* ,
and
as
little
under
the
power
of
fancy
and
whim
in
your
dealings
with
them
*punct* ,
as
you
are
where
these
children
are
concerned
*punct* ,
we
might
always
think
alike
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
sure
*punct* ,
our
discordancies
must
always
arise
from
my
being
in
the
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
smiling
*punct* ,
and
reason
good
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
sixteen
years
old
when
you
were
born
*punct* .
*break*
a
material
difference
then
*punct* ,
she
replied
*punct* ,
and
no
doubt
you
were
much
my
superior
in
judgment
at
that
period
of
our
lives
*punct* ;
but
does
not
the
lapse
of
one-and-twenty
years
bring
our
understandings
a
good
deal
nearer
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
a
good
deal
nearer
*punct* .
*break*
but
still
*punct* ,
not
near
enough
to
give
me
a
chance
of
being
right
*punct* ,
if
we
think
differently
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
still
the
advantage
of
you
by
sixteen
years
experience
*punct* ,
and
by
not
being
a
pretty
young
woman
and
a
spoiled
child
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
let
us
be
friends
*punct* ,
and
say
no
more
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
tell
your
aunt
*punct* ,
little
emma
*punct* ,
that
she
ought
to
set
you
a
better
example
than
to
be
renewing
old
grievances
*punct* ,
and
that
if
she
were
not
wrong
before
*punct* ,
she
is
now
*punct* .
*break*
that's
true
*punct* ,
she
cried
*punct* ,
very
true
*punct* .
*break*
little
emma
*punct* ,
grow
up
a
better
woman
than
your
aunt
*punct* .
*break*
be
infinitely
cleverer
and
not
half
so
conceited
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
a
word
or
two
more
*punct* ,
and
i
have
done
*punct* .
*break*
as
far
as
good
intentions
went
*punct* ,
we
were
both
right
*punct* ,
and
i
must
say
that
no
effects
on
my
side
of
the
argument
have
yet
proved
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
i
only
want
to
know
that
mr.
martin
is
not
very
*punct* ,
very
bitterly
disappointed
*punct* .
*break*
a
man
cannot
be
more
so
*punct* ,
was
his
short
*punct* ,
full
answer
*punct* .
*break*
ah!
*punct* ,
indeed
i
am
very
sorry.
*punct* ,
come
*punct* ,
shake
hands
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
this
had
just
taken
place
and
with
great
cordiality
*punct* ,
when
john
knightley
made
his
appearance
*punct* ,
and
how
d'ye
do
*punct* ,
george
*punct* ?
*break*
and
john
*punct* ,
how
are
you
*punct* ?
*break*
succeeded
in
the
true
english
style
*punct* ,
burying
under
a
calmness
that
seemed
all
but
indifference
*punct* ,
the
real
attachment
which
would
have
led
either
of
them
*punct* ,
if
requisite
*punct* ,
to
do
every
thing
for
the
good
of
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
the
evening
was
quiet
and
conversable
*punct* ,
as
mr.
woodhouse
declined
cards
entirely
for
the
sake
of
comfortable
talk
with
his
dear
isabella
*punct* ,
and
the
little
party
made
two
natural
divisions
*punct* ;
on
one
side
he
and
his
daughter
*punct* ;
on
the
other
the
two
mr.
knightleys
*punct* ;
their
subjects
totally
distinct
*punct* ,
or
very
rarely
mixing
*punct* ,
and
emma
only
occasionally
joining
in
one
or
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
the
brothers
talked
of
their
own
concerns
and
pursuits
*punct* ,
but
principally
of
those
of
the
elder
*punct* ,
whose
temper
was
by
much
the
most
communicative
*punct* ,
and
who
was
always
the
greater
talker
*punct* .
*break*
as
a
magistrate
*punct* ,
he
had
generally
some
point
of
law
to
consult
john
about
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
some
curious
anecdote
to
give
*punct* ;
and
as
a
farmer
*punct* ,
as
keeping
in
hand
the
home-farm
at
donwell
*punct* ,
he
had
to
tell
what
every
field
was
to
bear
next
year
*punct* ,
and
to
give
all
such
local
information
as
could
not
fail
of
being
interesting
to
a
brother
whose
home
it
had
equally
been
the
longest
part
of
his
life
*punct* ,
and
whose
attachments
were
strong
*punct* .
*break*
the
plan
of
a
drain
*punct* ,
the
change
of
a
fence
*punct* ,
the
felling
of
a
tree
*punct* ,
and
the
destination
of
every
acre
for
wheat
*punct* ,
turnips
*punct* ,
or
spring
corn
*punct* ,
was
entered
into
with
as
much
equality
of
interest
by
john
*punct* ,
as
his
cooler
manners
rendered
possible
*punct* ;
and
if
his
willing
brother
ever
left
him
any
thing
to
inquire
about
*punct* ,
his
inquiries
even
approached
a
tone
of
eagerness
*punct* .
*break*
while
they
were
thus
comfortably
occupied
*punct* ,
mr.
woodhouse
was
enjoying
a
full
flow
of
happy
regrets
and
fearful
affection
with
his
daughter
*punct* .
*break*
my
poor
dear
isabella
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
fondly
taking
her
hand
*punct* ,
and
interrupting
*punct* ,
for
a
few
moments
*punct* ,
her
busy
labours
for
some
one
of
her
five
children
*punct* ,
how
long
it
is
*punct* ,
how
terribly
long
since
you
were
here
*punct* !
*break*
and
how
tired
you
must
be
after
your
journey
*punct* !
*break*
you
must
go
to
bed
early
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
and
i
recommend
a
little
gruel
to
you
before
you
go.
*punct* ,
you
and
i
will
have
a
nice
basin
of
gruel
together
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
suppose
we
all
have
a
little
gruel
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
suppose
any
such
thing
*punct* ,
knowing
as
she
did
*punct* ,
that
both
the
mr.
knightleys
were
as
unpersuadable
on
that
article
as
herself;
*punct* ,
and
two
basins
only
were
ordered
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
little
more
discourse
in
praise
of
gruel
*punct* ,
with
some
wondering
at
its
not
being
taken
every
evening
by
every
body
*punct* ,
he
proceeded
to
say
*punct* ,
with
an
air
of
grave
reflection
*punct* ,
it
was
an
awkward
business
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
your
spending
the
autumn
at
south
end
instead
of
coming
here
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
had
much
opinion
of
the
sea
air
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
wingfield
most
strenuously
recommended
it
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
or
we
should
not
have
gone
*punct* .
*break*
he
recommended
it
for
all
the
children
*punct* ,
but
particularly
for
the
weakness
in
little
bella's
throat,
*punct* ,
both
sea
air
and
bathing
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
but
perry
had
many
doubts
about
the
sea
doing
her
any
good
*punct* ;
and
as
to
myself
*punct* ,
i
have
been
long
perfectly
convinced
*punct* ,
though
perhaps
i
never
told
you
so
before
*punct* ,
that
the
sea
is
very
rarely
of
use
to
any
body
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
it
almost
killed
me
once
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
come
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* ,
feeling
this
to
be
an
unsafe
subject
*punct* ,
i
must
beg
you
not
to
talk
of
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
it
makes
me
envious
and
miserable;
*punct* ,
i
who
have
never
seen
it
*punct* !
*break*
south
end
is
prohibited
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
isabella
*punct* ,
i
have
not
heard
you
make
one
inquiry
about
mr.
perry
yet
*punct* ;
and
he
never
forgets
you
*punct* .
*break*
good
mr.
perry
*punct* ,
how
is
he
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
pretty
well
*punct* ;
but
not
quite
well
*punct* .
*break*
poor
perry
is
bilious
*punct* ,
and
he
has
not
time
to
take
care
of
himself
*punct* ,
he
tells
me
he
has
not
time
to
take
care
of
himself
*punct* ,
which
is
very
sad
*punct* ,
but
he
is
always
wanted
all
round
the
country
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
there
is
not
a
man
in
such
practice
anywhere
*punct* .
*break*
but
then
there
is
not
so
clever
a
man
any
where
*punct* .
*break*
and
mrs.
perry
and
the
children
*punct* ,
how
are
they
*punct* ?
*break*
do
the
children
grow
*punct* ?
*break*
i
have
a
great
regard
for
mr.
perry
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
he
will
be
calling
soon
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
be
so
pleased
to
see
my
little
ones
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
he
will
be
here
to-morrow
*punct* ,
for
i
have
a
question
or
two
to
ask
him
about
myself
of
some
consequence
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
whenever
he
comes
*punct* ,
you
had
better
let
him
look
at
little
bella's
throat
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
her
throat
is
so
much
better
that
i
have
hardly
any
uneasiness
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
either
bathing
has
been
of
the
greatest
service
to
her
*punct* ,
or
else
it
is
to
be
attributed
to
an
excellent
embrocation
of
mr.
wingfield's
*punct* ,
which
we
have
been
applying
at
times
ever
since
august
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
very
likely
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
that
bathing
should
have
been
of
use
to
her
*punct* ,
and
if
i
had
known
you
were
wanting
an
embrocation
*punct* ,
i
would
have
spoken
to
*punct* ,
you
seem
to
me
to
have
forgotten
mrs.
and
miss
bates
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
i
have
not
heard
one
inquiry
after
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
good
bateses
*punct* ,
i
am
quite
ashamed
of
myself
*punct* ,
but
you
mention
them
in
most
of
your
letters
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
they
are
quite
well
*punct* .
*break*
good
old
mrs.
bates
*punct* ,
i
will
call
upon
her
to-morrow
*punct* ,
and
take
my
children.
*punct* ,
they
are
always
so
pleased
to
see
my
children.
*punct* ,
and
that
excellent
miss
bates!
*punct* ,
such
thorough
worthy
people!
*punct* ,
how
are
they
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
pretty
well
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
upon
the
whole
*punct* .
*break*
but
poor
mrs.
bates
had
a
bad
cold
about
a
month
ago
*punct* .
*break*
how
sorry
i
am
*punct* !
*break*
but
colds
were
never
so
prevalent
as
they
have
been
this
autumn
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
wingfield
told
me
that
he
has
never
known
them
more
general
or
heavy
*punct* ,
except
when
it
has
been
quite
an
influenza
*punct* .
*break*
that
has
been
a
good
deal
the
case
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ;
but
not
to
the
degree
you
mention
*punct* .
*break*
perry
says
that
colds
have
been
very
general
*punct* ,
but
not
so
heavy
as
he
has
very
often
known
them
in
november
*punct* .
*break*
perry
does
not
call
it
altogether
a
sickly
season
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
that
mr.
wingfield
considers
it
very
sickly
except
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* !
*break*
my
poor
dear
child
*punct* ,
the
truth
is
*punct* ,
that
in
london
it
is
always
a
sickly
season
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
is
healthy
in
london
*punct* ,
nobody
can
be
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
have
you
forced
to
live
there
*punct* !
*break*
so
far
off!
*punct* ,
and
the
air
so
bad
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
we
are
not
at
all
in
a
bad
air
*punct* .
*break*
our
part
of
london
is
very
superior
to
most
others!
*punct* ,
you
must
not
confound
us
with
london
in
general
*punct* ,
my
dear
sir
*punct* .
*break*
the
neighbourhood
of
brunswick
square
is
very
different
from
almost
all
the
rest
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
so
very
airy
*punct* !
*break*
i
should
be
unwilling
*punct* ,
i
own
*punct* ,
to
live
in
any
other
part
of
the
town;
*punct* ,
there
is
hardly
any
other
that
i
could
be
satisfied
to
have
my
children
in
*punct* :
but
we
are
so
remarkably
airy!
*punct* ,
mr.
wingfield
thinks
the
vicinity
of
brunswick
square
decidedly
the
most
favourable
as
to
air
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
it
is
not
like
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
you
make
the
best
of
it
*punct* ,
but
after
you
have
been
a
week
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
you
are
all
of
you
different
creatures
*punct* ;
you
do
not
look
like
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
now
i
cannot
say
*punct* ,
that
i
think
you
are
any
of
you
looking
well
at
present
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
so
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
but
i
assure
you
*punct* ,
excepting
those
little
nervous
head-aches
and
palpitations
which
i
am
never
entirely
free
from
anywhere
*punct* ,
i
am
quite
well
myself
*punct* ;
and
if
the
children
were
rather
pale
before
they
went
to
bed
*punct* ,
it
was
only
because
they
were
a
little
more
tired
than
usual
*punct* ,
from
their
journey
and
the
happiness
of
coming
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
you
will
think
better
of
their
looks
to-morrow
*punct* ;
for
i
assure
you
mr.
wingfield
told
me
*punct* ,
that
he
did
not
believe
he
had
ever
sent
us
off
altogether
*punct* ,
in
such
good
case
*punct* .
*break*
i
trust
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
that
you
do
not
think
mr.
knightley
looking
ill
*punct* ,
turning
her
eyes
with
affectionate
anxiety
towards
her
husband
*punct* .
*break*
middling
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ;
i
cannot
compliment
you
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
mr.
john
knightley
very
far
from
looking
well
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
the
matter
*punct* ,
sir?
*punct* ,
did
you
speak
to
me
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
mr.
john
knightley
*punct* ,
hearing
his
own
name
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sorry
to
find
*punct* ,
my
love
*punct* ,
that
my
father
does
not
think
you
looking
well
*punct* ,
but
i
hope
it
is
only
from
being
a
little
fatigued
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
have
wished
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
as
you
know
*punct* ,
that
you
had
seen
mr.
wingfield
before
you
left
home
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
isabella,
*punct* ,
exclaimed
he
hastily
*punct* ,
pray
do
not
concern
yourself
about
my
looks
*punct* .
*break*
be
satisfied
with
doctoring
and
coddling
yourself
and
the
children
*punct* ,
and
let
me
look
as
i
chuse
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
not
thoroughly
understand
what
you
were
telling
your
brother
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* ,
about
your
friend
mr.
graham's
intending
to
have
a
bailiff
from
scotland
*punct* ,
to
look
after
his
new
estate
*punct* .
*break*
what
will
it
answer
*punct* ?
*break*
will
not
the
old
prejudice
be
too
strong
*punct* ?
*break*
and
she
talked
in
this
way
so
long
and
successfully
that
*punct* ,
when
forced
to
give
her
attention
again
to
her
father
and
sister
*punct* ,
she
had
nothing
worse
to
hear
than
isabella's
kind
inquiry
after
jane
fairfax
*punct* ;
and
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
though
no
great
favourite
with
her
in
general
*punct* ,
she
was
at
that
moment
very
happy
to
assist
in
praising
*punct* .
*break*
that
sweet
*punct* ,
amiable
jane
fairfax
*punct* !
*break*
said
mrs.
john
knightley.
*punct* ,
it
is
so
long
since
i
have
seen
her
*punct* ,
except
now
and
then
for
a
moment
accidentally
in
town
*punct* !
*break*
what
happiness
it
must
be
to
her
good
old
grandmother
and
excellent
aunt
*punct* ,
when
she
comes
to
visit
them
*punct* !
*break*
i
always
regret
excessively
on
dear
emma's
account
that
she
cannot
be
more
at
highbury
*punct* ;
but
now
their
daughter
is
married
*punct* ,
i
suppose
colonel
and
mrs.
campbell
will
not
be
able
to
part
with
her
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
be
such
a
delightful
companion
for
emma
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
agreed
to
it
all
*punct* ,
but
added
*punct* ,
our
little
friend
harriet
smith
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
is
just
such
another
pretty
kind
of
young
person
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
like
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
have
a
better
companion
than
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
most
happy
to
hear
it
*punct* ,
but
only
jane
fairfax
one
knows
to
be
so
very
accomplished
and
superior!
*punct* ,
and
exactly
emma's
age
*punct* .
*break*
this
topic
was
discussed
very
happily
*punct* ,
and
others
succeeded
of
similar
moment
*punct* ,
and
passed
away
with
similar
harmony
*punct* ;
but
the
evening
did
not
close
without
a
little
return
of
agitation
*punct* .
*break*
the
gruel
came
and
supplied
a
great
deal
to
be
said
*punct* ,
much
praise
and
many
comments
*punct* ,
undoubting
decision
of
its
wholesomeness
for
every
constitution
*punct* ,
and
pretty
severe
philippics
upon
the
many
houses
where
it
was
never
met
with
tolerable;
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
unfortunately
*punct* ,
among
the
failures
which
the
daughter
had
to
instance
*punct* ,
the
most
recent
*punct* ,
and
therefore
most
prominent
*punct* ,
was
in
her
own
cook
at
south
end
*punct* ,
a
young
woman
hired
for
the
time
*punct* ,
who
never
had
been
able
to
understand
what
she
meant
by
a
basin
of
nice
smooth
gruel
*punct* ,
thin
*punct* ,
but
not
too
thin
*punct* .
*break*
often
as
she
had
wished
for
and
ordered
it
*punct* ,
she
had
never
been
able
to
get
any
thing
tolerable
*punct* .
*break*
here
was
a
dangerous
opening
*punct* .
*break*
said
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
shaking
his
head
and
fixing
his
eyes
on
her
with
tender
concern.
*punct* ,
the
ejaculation
in
emma's
ear
expressed
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* !
*break*
there
is
no
end
of
the
sad
consequences
of
your
going
to
south
end
*punct* .
*break*
it
does
not
bear
talking
of
*punct* .
*break*
and
for
a
little
while
she
hoped
he
would
not
talk
of
it
*punct* ,
and
that
a
silent
rumination
might
suffice
to
restore
him
to
the
relish
of
his
own
smooth
gruel
*punct* .
*break*
after
an
interval
of
some
minutes
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
began
with
*punct* ,
i
shall
always
be
very
sorry
that
you
went
to
the
sea
this
autumn
*punct* ,
instead
of
coming
here
*punct* .
*break*
but
why
should
you
be
sorry
*punct* ,
sir?
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* ,
it
did
the
children
a
great
deal
of
good
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
if
you
must
go
to
the
sea
*punct* ,
it
had
better
not
have
been
to
south
end
*punct* .
*break*
south
end
is
an
unhealthy
place
*punct* .
*break*
perry
was
surprized
to
hear
you
had
fixed
upon
south
end
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
there
is
such
an
idea
with
many
people
*punct* ,
but
indeed
it
is
quite
a
mistake
*punct* ,
sir.
*punct* ,
we
all
had
our
health
perfectly
well
there
*punct* ,
never
found
the
least
inconvenience
from
the
mud
*punct* ;
and
mr.
wingfield
says
it
is
entirely
a
mistake
to
suppose
the
place
unhealthy
*punct* ;
and
i
am
sure
he
may
be
depended
on
*punct* ,
for
he
thoroughly
understands
the
nature
of
the
air
*punct* ,
and
his
own
brother
and
family
have
been
there
repeatedly
*punct* .
*break*
you
should
have
gone
to
cromer
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
if
you
went
anywhere.
*punct* ,
perry
was
a
week
at
cromer
once
*punct* ,
and
he
holds
it
to
be
the
best
of
all
the
sea-bathing
places
*punct* .
*break*
a
fine
open
sea
*punct* ,
he
says
*punct* ,
and
very
pure
air
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
by
what
i
understand
*punct* ,
you
might
have
had
lodgings
there
quite
away
from
the
sea
*punct* ,
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
*punct* ,
very
comfortable
*punct* .
*break*
you
should
have
consulted
perry
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
the
difference
of
the
journey;
*punct* ,
only
consider
how
great
it
would
have
been.
*punct* ,
an
hundred
miles
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
instead
of
forty
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
as
perry
says
*punct* ,
where
health
is
at
stake
*punct* ,
nothing
else
should
be
considered
*punct* ;
and
if
one
is
to
travel
*punct* ,
there
is
not
much
to
chuse
between
forty
miles
and
an
hundred.
*punct* ,
better
not
move
at
all
*punct* ,
better
stay
in
london
altogether
than
travel
forty
miles
to
get
into
a
worse
air
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
just
what
perry
said
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
to
him
a
very
ill-judged
measure
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
attempts
to
stop
her
father
had
been
vain
*punct* ;
and
when
he
had
reached
such
a
point
as
this
*punct* ,
she
could
not
wonder
at
her
brother-in-law's
breaking
out
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
perry
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
in
a
voice
of
very
strong
displeasure
*punct* ,
would
do
as
well
to
keep
his
opinion
till
it
is
asked
for
*punct* .
*break*
why
does
he
make
it
any
business
of
his
*punct* ,
to
wonder
at
what
i
do?
*punct* ,
at
my
taking
my
family
to
one
part
of
the
coast
or
another?
*punct* ,
i
may
be
allowed
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ,
the
use
of
my
judgment
as
well
as
mr.
perry.
*punct* ,
i
want
his
directions
no
more
than
his
drugs
*punct* .
*break*
he
paused
*punct* ,
and
growing
cooler
in
a
moment
*punct* ,
added
*punct* ,
with
only
sarcastic
dryness
*punct* ,
if
mr.
perry
can
tell
me
how
to
convey
a
wife
and
five
children
a
distance
of
an
hundred
and
thirty
miles
with
no
greater
expense
or
inconvenience
than
a
distance
of
forty
*punct* ,
i
should
be
as
willing
to
prefer
cromer
to
south
end
as
he
could
himself
*punct* .
*break*
true
*punct* ,
true
*punct* ,
cried
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
with
most
ready
interposition
*punct* ,
very
true
*punct* .
*break*
that's
a
consideration
indeed.
*punct* ,
but
john
*punct* ,
as
to
what
i
was
telling
you
of
my
idea
of
moving
the
path
to
langham
*punct* ,
of
turning
it
more
to
the
right
that
it
may
not
cut
through
the
home
meadows
*punct* ,
i
cannot
conceive
any
difficulty
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
not
attempt
it
*punct* ,
if
it
were
to
be
the
means
of
inconvenience
to
the
highbury
people
*punct* ,
but
if
you
call
to
mind
exactly
the
present
line
of
the
path
*punct* ...
the
only
way
of
proving
it
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
will
be
to
turn
to
our
maps
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
see
you
at
the
abbey
to-morrow
morning
i
hope
*punct* ,
and
then
we
will
look
them
over
*punct* ,
and
you
shall
give
me
your
opinion
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
was
rather
agitated
by
such
harsh
reflections
on
his
friend
perry
*punct* ,
to
whom
he
had
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
though
unconsciously
*punct* ,
been
attributing
many
of
his
own
feelings
and
expressions;
*punct* ,
but
the
soothing
attentions
of
his
daughters
gradually
removed
the
present
evil
*punct* ,
and
the
immediate
alertness
of
one
brother
*punct* ,
and
better
recollections
of
the
other
*punct* ,
prevented
any
renewal
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
there
could
hardly
be
a
happier
creature
in
the
world
than
mrs.
john
knightley
*punct* ,
in
this
short
visit
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
going
about
every
morning
among
her
old
acquaintance
with
her
five
children
*punct* ,
and
talking
over
what
she
had
done
every
evening
with
her
father
and
sister
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
nothing
to
wish
otherwise
*punct* ,
but
that
the
days
did
not
pass
so
swiftly
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
delightful
visit;
*punct* ,
perfect
*punct* ,
in
being
much
too
short
*punct* .
*break*
in
general
their
evenings
were
less
engaged
with
friends
than
their
mornings
*punct* ;
but
one
complete
dinner
engagement
*punct* ,
and
out
of
the
house
too
*punct* ,
there
was
no
avoiding
*punct* ,
though
at
christmas
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
would
take
no
denial
*punct* ;
they
must
all
dine
at
randalls
one
day;
*punct* ,
even
mr.
woodhouse
was
persuaded
to
think
it
a
possible
thing
in
preference
to
a
division
of
the
party
*punct* .
*break*
how
they
were
all
to
be
conveyed
*punct* ,
he
would
have
made
a
difficulty
if
he
could
*punct* ,
but
as
his
son
and
daughter's
carriage
and
horses
were
actually
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
he
was
not
able
to
make
more
than
a
simple
question
on
that
head
*punct* ;
it
hardly
amounted
to
a
doubt
*punct* ;
nor
did
it
occupy
emma
long
to
convince
him
that
they
might
in
one
of
the
carriages
find
room
for
harriet
also
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
and
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
their
own
especial
set
*punct* ,
were
the
only
persons
invited
to
meet
them;
*punct* ,
the
hours
were
to
be
early
*punct* ,
as
well
as
the
numbers
few
*punct* ;
mr.
woodhouse's
habits
and
inclination
being
consulted
in
every
thing
*punct* .
*break*
the
evening
before
this
great
event
*punct* ,
for
it
was
a
very
great
event
that
mr.
woodhouse
should
dine
out
*punct* ,
on
the
24th
of
december
*punct* ,
had
been
spent
by
harriet
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
and
she
had
gone
home
so
much
indisposed
with
a
cold
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
but
for
her
own
earnest
wish
of
being
nursed
by
mrs.
goddard
*punct* ,
emma
could
not
have
allowed
her
to
leave
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
emma
called
on
her
the
next
day
*punct* ,
and
found
her
doom
already
signed
with
regard
to
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
very
feverish
and
had
a
bad
sore
throat
*punct* :
mrs.
goddard
was
full
of
care
and
affection
*punct* ,
mr.
perry
was
talked
of
*punct* ,
and
harriet
herself
was
too
ill
and
low
to
resist
the
authority
which
excluded
her
from
this
delightful
engagement
*punct* ,
though
she
could
not
speak
of
her
loss
without
many
tears
*punct* .
*break*
emma
sat
with
her
as
long
as
she
could
*punct* ,
to
attend
her
in
mrs.
goddard's
unavoidable
absences
*punct* ,
and
raise
her
spirits
by
representing
how
much
mr.
elton's
would
be
depressed
when
he
knew
her
state
*punct* ;
and
left
her
at
last
tolerably
comfortable
*punct* ,
in
the
sweet
dependence
of
his
having
a
most
comfortless
visit
*punct* ,
and
of
their
all
missing
her
very
much
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
not
advanced
many
yards
from
mrs.
goddard's
door
*punct* ,
when
she
was
met
by
mr.
elton
himself
*punct* ,
evidently
coming
towards
it
*punct* ,
and
as
they
walked
on
slowly
together
in
conversation
about
the
invalid
*punct* ,
of
whom
he
*punct* ,
on
the
rumour
of
considerable
illness
*punct* ,
had
been
going
to
inquire
*punct* ,
that
he
might
carry
some
report
of
her
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
they
were
overtaken
by
mr.
john
knightley
returning
from
the
daily
visit
to
donwell
*punct* ,
with
his
two
eldest
boys
*punct* ,
whose
healthy
*punct* ,
glowing
faces
shewed
all
the
benefit
of
a
country
run
*punct* ,
and
seemed
to
ensure
a
quick
despatch
of
the
roast
mutton
and
rice
pudding
they
were
hastening
home
for
*punct* .
*break*
they
joined
company
and
proceeded
together
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
just
describing
the
nature
of
her
friend's
complaint;
*punct* ,
a
throat
very
much
inflamed
*punct* ,
with
a
great
deal
of
heat
about
her
*punct* ,
a
quick
*punct* ,
low
pulse
*punct* ,
&
amp;c
*punct* .
*break*
and
she
was
sorry
to
find
from
mrs.
goddard
that
harriet
was
liable
to
very
bad
sore-throats
*punct* ,
and
had
often
alarmed
her
with
them
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
looked
all
alarm
on
the
occasion
*punct* ,
as
he
exclaimed
*punct* ,
a
sore-throat!
*punct* ,
i
hope
not
infectious
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
not
of
a
putrid
infectious
sort
*punct* .
*break*
has
perry
seen
her
*punct* ?
*break*
indeed
you
should
take
care
of
yourself
as
well
as
of
your
friend
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
entreat
you
to
run
no
risks
*punct* .
*break*
why
does
not
perry
see
her
*punct* ?
*break*
emma
*punct* ,
who
was
not
really
at
all
frightened
herself
*punct* ,
tranquillised
this
excess
of
apprehension
by
assurances
of
mrs.
goddard's
experience
and
care
*punct* ;
but
as
there
must
still
remain
a
degree
of
uneasiness
which
she
could
not
wish
to
reason
away
*punct* ,
which
she
would
rather
feed
and
assist
than
not
*punct* ,
she
added
soon
afterwards
*punct* ,
as
if
quite
another
subject
*punct* ,
it
is
so
cold
*punct* ,
so
very
cold
*punct* ,
and
looks
and
feels
so
very
much
like
snow
*punct* ,
that
if
it
were
to
any
other
place
or
with
any
other
party
*punct* ,
i
should
really
try
not
to
go
out
to-day
*punct* ,
and
dissuade
my
father
from
venturing
*punct* ;
but
as
he
has
made
up
his
mind
*punct* ,
and
does
not
seem
to
feel
the
cold
himself
*punct* ,
i
do
not
like
to
interfere
*punct* ,
as
i
know
it
would
be
so
great
a
disappointment
to
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
in
your
case
*punct* ,
i
should
certainly
excuse
myself
*punct* .
*break*
you
appear
to
me
a
little
hoarse
already
*punct* ,
and
when
you
consider
what
demand
of
voice
and
what
fatigues
to-morrow
will
bring
*punct* ,
i
think
it
would
be
no
more
than
common
prudence
to
stay
at
home
and
take
care
of
yourself
to-night
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
looked
as
if
he
did
not
very
well
know
what
answer
to
make
*punct* ;
which
was
exactly
the
case
*punct* ;
for
though
very
much
gratified
by
the
kind
care
of
such
a
fair
lady
*punct* ,
and
not
liking
to
resist
any
advice
of
her's
*punct* ,
he
had
not
really
the
least
inclination
to
give
up
the
visit;
*punct* ,
but
emma
*punct* ,
too
eager
and
busy
in
her
own
previous
conceptions
and
views
to
hear
him
impartially
*punct* ,
or
see
him
with
clear
vision
*punct* ,
was
very
well
satisfied
with
his
muttering
acknowledgment
of
its
being
very
cold
*punct* ,
certainly
very
cold
*punct* ,
and
walked
on
*punct* ,
rejoicing
in
having
extricated
him
from
randalls
*punct* ,
and
secured
him
the
power
of
sending
to
inquire
after
harriet
every
hour
of
the
evening
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
quite
right
*punct* ,
said
she;
*punct* ,
we
will
make
your
apologies
to
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
but
hardly
had
she
so
spoken
*punct* ,
when
she
found
her
brother
was
civilly
offering
a
seat
in
his
carriage
*punct* ,
if
the
weather
were
mr.
elton's
only
objection
*punct* ,
and
mr.
elton
actually
accepting
the
offer
with
much
prompt
satisfaction
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
done
thing
*punct* ;
mr.
elton
was
to
go
*punct* ,
and
never
had
his
broad
handsome
face
expressed
more
pleasure
than
at
this
moment
*punct* ;
never
had
his
smile
been
stronger
*punct* ,
nor
his
eyes
more
exulting
than
when
he
next
looked
at
her
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
she
to
herself
*punct* ,
this
is
most
strange!
*punct* ,
after
i
had
got
him
off
so
well
*punct* ,
to
chuse
to
go
into
company
*punct* ,
and
leave
harriet
ill
behind!
*punct* ,
most
strange
indeed!
*punct* ,
but
there
is
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
in
many
men
*punct* ,
especially
single
men
*punct* ,
such
an
inclination
*punct* ,
such
a
passion
for
dining
out
*punct* ,
a
dinner
engagement
is
so
high
in
the
class
of
their
pleasures
*punct* ,
their
employments
*punct* ,
their
dignities
*punct* ,
almost
their
duties
*punct* ,
that
any
thing
gives
way
to
it
*punct* ,
and
this
must
be
the
case
with
mr.
elton
*punct* ;
a
most
valuable
*punct* ,
amiable
*punct* ,
pleasing
young
man
undoubtedly
*punct* ,
and
very
much
in
love
with
harriet
*punct* ;
but
still
*punct* ,
he
cannot
refuse
an
invitation
*punct* ,
he
must
dine
out
wherever
he
is
asked
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
strange
thing
love
is
*punct* !
*break*
he
can
see
ready
wit
in
harriet
*punct* ,
but
will
not
dine
alone
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
soon
afterwards
mr.
elton
quitted
them
*punct* ,
and
she
could
not
but
do
him
the
justice
of
feeling
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
sentiment
in
his
manner
of
naming
harriet
at
parting
*punct* ;
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
while
assuring
her
that
he
should
call
at
mrs.
goddard's
for
news
of
her
fair
friend
*punct* ,
the
last
thing
before
he
prepared
for
the
happiness
of
meeting
her
again
*punct* ,
when
he
hoped
to
be
able
to
give
a
better
report
*punct* ;
and
he
sighed
and
smiled
himself
off
in
a
way
that
left
the
balance
of
approbation
much
in
his
favour
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
few
minutes
of
entire
silence
between
them
*punct* ,
john
knightley
began
with
*punct* ,
i
never
in
my
life
saw
a
man
more
intent
on
being
agreeable
than
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
downright
labour
to
him
where
ladies
are
concerned
*punct* .
*break*
with
men
he
can
be
rational
and
unaffected
*punct* ,
but
when
he
has
ladies
to
please
*punct* ,
every
feature
works
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton's
manners
are
not
perfect
*punct* ,
replied
emma
*punct* ;
but
where
there
is
a
wish
to
please
*punct* ,
one
ought
to
overlook
*punct* ,
and
one
does
overlook
a
great
deal
*punct* .
*break*
where
a
man
does
his
best
with
only
moderate
powers
*punct* ,
he
will
have
the
advantage
over
negligent
superiority
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
such
perfect
good-temper
and
good-will
in
mr.
elton
as
one
cannot
but
value
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
mr.
john
knightley
presently
*punct* ,
with
some
slyness
*punct* ,
he
seems
to
have
a
great
deal
of
good-will
towards
you
*punct* .
*break*
she
replied
with
a
smile
of
astonishment
*punct* ,
are
you
imagining
me
to
be
mr.
elton's
object
*punct* ?
*break*
such
an
imagination
has
crossed
me
*punct* ,
i
own
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ;
and
if
it
never
occurred
to
you
before
*punct* ,
you
may
as
well
take
it
into
consideration
now
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
in
love
with
me!
*punct* ,
what
an
idea
*punct* !
*break*
i
do
not
say
it
is
so
*punct* ;
but
you
will
do
well
to
consider
whether
it
is
so
or
not
*punct* ,
and
to
regulate
your
behaviour
accordingly
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
your
manners
to
him
encouraging
*punct* .
*break*
i
speak
as
a
friend
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* .
*break*
you
had
better
look
about
you
*punct* ,
and
ascertain
what
you
do
*punct* ,
and
what
you
mean
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
i
thank
you
*punct* ;
but
i
assure
you
you
are
quite
mistaken
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
and
i
are
very
good
friends
*punct* ,
and
nothing
more
*punct* ;
and
she
walked
on
*punct* ,
amusing
herself
in
the
consideration
of
the
blunders
which
often
arise
from
a
partial
knowledge
of
circumstances
*punct* ,
of
the
mistakes
which
people
of
high
pretensions
to
judgment
are
for
ever
falling
into
*punct* ;
and
not
very
well
pleased
with
her
brother
for
imagining
her
blind
and
ignorant
*punct* ,
and
in
want
of
counsel
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
had
so
completely
made
up
his
mind
to
the
visit
*punct* ,
that
in
spite
of
the
increasing
coldness
*punct* ,
he
seemed
to
have
no
idea
of
shrinking
from
it
*punct* ,
and
set
forward
at
last
most
punctually
with
his
eldest
daughter
in
his
own
carriage
*punct* ,
with
less
apparent
consciousness
of
the
weather
than
either
of
the
others
*punct* ;
too
full
of
the
wonder
of
his
own
going
*punct* ,
and
the
pleasure
it
was
to
afford
at
randalls
to
see
that
it
was
cold
*punct* ,
and
too
well
wrapt
up
to
feel
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
cold
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
was
severe
*punct* ;
and
by
the
time
the
second
carriage
was
in
motion
*punct* ,
a
few
flakes
of
snow
were
finding
their
way
down
*punct* ,
and
the
sky
had
the
appearance
of
being
so
overcharged
as
to
want
only
a
milder
air
to
produce
a
very
white
world
in
a
very
short
time
*punct* .
*break*
emma
soon
saw
that
her
companion
was
not
in
the
happiest
humour
*punct* .
*break*
the
preparing
and
the
going
abroad
in
such
weather
*punct* ,
with
the
sacrifice
of
his
children
after
dinner
*punct* ,
were
evils
*punct* ,
were
disagreeables
at
least
*punct* ,
which
mr.
john
knightley
did
not
by
any
means
like
*punct* ;
he
anticipated
nothing
in
the
visit
that
could
be
at
all
worth
the
purchase
*punct* ;
and
the
whole
of
their
drive
to
the
vicarage
was
spent
by
him
in
expressing
his
discontent
*punct* .
*break*
a
man
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
must
have
a
very
good
opinion
of
himself
when
he
asks
people
to
leave
their
own
fireside
*punct* ,
and
encounter
such
a
day
as
this
*punct* ,
for
the
sake
of
coming
to
see
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
think
himself
a
most
agreeable
fellow
*punct* ;
i
could
not
do
such
a
thing
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
the
greatest
absurdity
*punct* ,
actually
snowing
at
this
moment!
*punct* ,
the
folly
of
not
allowing
people
to
be
comfortable
at
home
*punct* ,
and
the
folly
of
people's
not
staying
comfortably
at
home
when
they
can
*punct* !
*break*
if
we
were
obliged
to
go
out
such
an
evening
as
this
*punct* ,
by
any
call
of
duty
or
business
*punct* ,
what
a
hardship
we
should
deem
it;
*punct* ,
and
here
are
we
*punct* ,
probably
with
rather
thinner
clothing
than
usual
*punct* ,
setting
forward
voluntarily
*punct* ,
without
excuse
*punct* ,
in
defiance
of
the
voice
of
nature
*punct* ,
which
tells
man
*punct* ,
in
every
thing
given
to
his
view
or
his
feelings
*punct* ,
to
stay
at
home
himself
*punct* ,
and
keep
all
under
shelter
that
he
can;
*punct* ,
here
are
we
setting
forward
to
spend
five
dull
hours
in
another
man's
house
*punct* ,
with
nothing
to
say
or
to
hear
that
was
not
said
and
heard
yesterday
*punct* ,
and
may
not
be
said
and
heard
again
to-morrow
*punct* .
*break*
going
in
dismal
weather
*punct* ,
to
return
probably
in
worse;
*punct* ,
four
horses
and
four
servants
taken
out
for
nothing
but
to
convey
five
idle
*punct* ,
shivering
creatures
into
colder
rooms
and
worse
company
than
they
might
have
had
at
home
*punct* .
*break*
emma
did
not
find
herself
equal
to
give
the
pleased
assent
*punct* ,
which
no
doubt
he
was
in
the
habit
of
receiving
*punct* ,
to
emulate
the
very
true
*punct* ,
my
love
*punct* ,
which
must
have
been
usually
administered
by
his
travelling
companion
*punct* ;
but
she
had
resolution
enough
to
refrain
from
making
any
answer
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
not
be
complying
*punct* ,
she
dreaded
being
quarrelsome
*punct* ;
her
heroism
reached
only
to
silence
*punct* .
*break*
she
allowed
him
to
talk
*punct* ,
and
arranged
the
glasses
*punct* ,
and
wrapped
herself
up
*punct* ,
without
opening
her
lips
*punct* .
*break*
they
arrived
*punct* ,
the
carriage
turned
*punct* ,
the
step
was
let
down
*punct* ,
and
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
spruce
*punct* ,
black
*punct* ,
and
smiling
*punct* ,
was
with
them
instantly
*punct* .
*break*
emma
thought
with
pleasure
of
some
change
of
subject
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
was
all
obligation
and
cheerfulness
*punct* ;
he
was
so
very
cheerful
in
his
civilities
indeed
*punct* ,
that
she
began
to
think
he
must
have
received
a
different
account
of
harriet
from
what
had
reached
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
sent
while
dressing
*punct* ,
and
the
answer
had
been
*punct* ,
much
the
same
*punct* ,
not
better
*punct* .
*break*
my
report
from
mrs.
goddard's
*punct* ,
said
she
presently
*punct* ,
was
not
so
pleasant
as
i
had
hoped
*punct* ,
not
better
was
my
answer
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
lengthened
immediately
*punct* ;
and
his
voice
was
the
voice
of
sentiment
as
he
answered
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
am
grieved
to
find
*punct* ,
i
was
on
the
point
of
telling
you
that
when
i
called
at
mrs.
goddard's
door
*punct* ,
which
i
did
the
very
last
thing
before
i
returned
to
dress
*punct* ,
i
was
told
that
miss
smith
was
not
better
*punct* ,
by
no
means
better
*punct* ,
rather
worse
*punct* .
*break*
very
much
grieved
and
concerned
*punct* ,
i
had
flattered
myself
that
she
must
be
better
after
such
a
cordial
as
i
knew
had
been
given
her
in
the
morning
*punct* .
*break*
emma
smiled
and
answered
*punct* ,
my
visit
was
of
use
to
the
nervous
part
of
her
complaint
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ;
but
not
even
i
can
charm
away
a
sore
throat
*punct* ;
it
is
a
most
severe
cold
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
perry
has
been
with
her
*punct* ,
as
you
probably
heard
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
imagined
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
i
did
not
*punct* ,
he
has
been
used
to
her
in
these
complaints
*punct* ,
and
i
hope
to-morrow
morning
will
bring
us
both
a
more
comfortable
report
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
impossible
not
to
feel
uneasiness
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
sad
loss
to
our
party
to-day
*punct* !
*break*
dreadful!
*punct* ,
exactly
so
*punct* ,
indeed.
*punct* ,
she
will
be
missed
every
moment
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
very
proper
*punct* ;
the
sigh
which
accompanied
it
was
really
estimable
*punct* ;
but
it
should
have
lasted
longer
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
rather
in
dismay
when
only
half
a
minute
afterwards
he
began
to
speak
of
other
things
*punct* ,
and
in
a
voice
of
the
greatest
alacrity
and
enjoyment
*punct* .
*break*
what
an
excellent
device
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
the
use
of
a
sheepskin
for
carriages
*punct* .
*break*
how
very
comfortable
they
make
it;
*punct* ,
impossible
to
feel
cold
with
such
precautions
*punct* .
*break*
the
contrivances
of
modern
days
indeed
have
rendered
a
gentleman's
carriage
perfectly
complete
*punct* .
*break*
one
is
so
fenced
and
guarded
from
the
weather
*punct* ,
that
not
a
breath
of
air
can
find
its
way
unpermitted
*punct* .
*break*
weather
becomes
absolutely
of
no
consequence
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
very
cold
afternoon
*punct* ,
but
in
this
carriage
we
know
nothing
of
the
matter.
*punct* ,
ha
*punct* !
*break*
snows
a
little
i
see
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
john
knightley
*punct* ,
and
i
think
we
shall
have
a
good
deal
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
christmas
weather
*punct* ,
observed
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
quite
seasonable
*punct* ;
and
extremely
fortunate
we
may
think
ourselves
that
it
did
not
begin
yesterday
*punct* ,
and
prevent
this
day's
party
*punct* ,
which
it
might
very
possibly
have
done
*punct* ,
for
mr.
woodhouse
would
hardly
have
ventured
had
there
been
much
snow
on
the
ground
*punct* ;
but
now
it
is
of
no
consequence
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
quite
the
season
indeed
for
friendly
meetings
*punct* .
*break*
at
christmas
every
body
invites
their
friends
about
them
*punct* ,
and
people
think
little
of
even
the
worst
weather
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
snowed
up
at
a
friend's
house
once
for
a
week
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
could
be
pleasanter
*punct* .
*break*
i
went
for
only
one
night
*punct* ,
and
could
not
get
away
till
that
very
day
se'nnight
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
john
knightley
looked
as
if
he
did
not
comprehend
the
pleasure
*punct* ,
but
said
only
*punct* ,
coolly
*punct* ,
i
cannot
wish
to
be
snowed
up
a
week
at
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
at
another
time
emma
might
have
been
amused
*punct* ,
but
she
was
too
much
astonished
now
at
mr.
elton's
spirits
for
other
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
seemed
quite
forgotten
in
the
expectation
of
a
pleasant
party
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
sure
of
excellent
fires
*punct* ,
continued
he
*punct* ,
and
every
thing
in
the
greatest
comfort
*punct* .
*break*
charming
people
*punct* ,
mr.
and
mrs.
weston;
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
indeed
is
much
beyond
praise
*punct* ,
and
he
is
exactly
what
one
values
*punct* ,
so
hospitable
*punct* ,
and
so
fond
of
society;
*punct* ,
it
will
be
a
small
party
*punct* ,
but
where
small
parties
are
select
*punct* ,
they
are
perhaps
the
most
agreeable
of
any
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston's
dining-room
does
not
accommodate
more
than
ten
comfortably
*punct* ;
and
for
my
part
*punct* ,
i
would
rather
*punct* ,
under
such
circumstances
*punct* ,
fall
short
by
two
than
exceed
by
two
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
you
will
agree
with
me
*punct* ,
turning
with
a
soft
air
to
emma,
*punct* ,
i
think
i
shall
certainly
have
your
approbation
*punct* ,
though
mr.
knightley
perhaps
*punct* ,
from
being
used
to
the
large
parties
of
london
*punct* ,
may
not
quite
enter
into
our
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
nothing
of
the
large
parties
of
london
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
i
never
dine
with
any
body
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
in
a
tone
of
wonder
and
pity,
*punct* ,
i
had
no
idea
that
the
law
had
been
so
great
a
slavery
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
the
time
must
come
when
you
will
be
paid
for
all
this
*punct* ,
when
you
will
have
little
labour
and
great
enjoyment
*punct* .
*break*
my
first
enjoyment
*punct* ,
replied
john
knightley
*punct* ,
as
they
passed
through
the
sweep-gate
*punct* ,
will
be
to
find
myself
safe
at
hartfield
again
*punct* .
*break*
some
change
of
countenance
was
necessary
for
each
gentleman
as
they
walked
into
mrs.
weston's
drawing-room;
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
must
compose
his
joyous
looks
*punct* ,
and
mr.
john
knightley
disperse
his
ill-humour
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
must
smile
less
*punct* ,
and
mr.
john
knightley
more
*punct* ,
to
fit
them
for
the
place.
*punct* ,
emma
only
might
be
as
nature
prompted
*punct* ,
and
shew
herself
just
as
happy
as
she
was
*punct* .
*break*
to
her
it
was
real
enjoyment
to
be
with
the
westons
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
was
a
great
favourite
*punct* ,
and
there
was
not
a
creature
in
the
world
to
whom
she
spoke
with
such
unreserve
*punct* ,
as
to
his
wife
*punct* ;
not
any
one
*punct* ,
to
whom
she
related
with
such
conviction
of
being
listened
to
and
understood
*punct* ,
of
being
always
interesting
and
always
intelligible
*punct* ,
the
little
affairs
*punct* ,
arrangements
*punct* ,
perplexities
*punct* ,
and
pleasures
of
her
father
and
herself
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
tell
nothing
of
hartfield
*punct* ,
in
which
mrs.
weston
had
not
a
lively
concern
*punct* ;
and
half
an
hour's
uninterrupted
communication
of
all
those
little
matters
on
which
the
daily
happiness
of
private
life
depends
*punct* ,
was
one
of
the
first
gratifications
of
each
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
a
pleasure
which
perhaps
the
whole
day's
visit
might
not
afford
*punct* ,
which
certainly
did
not
belong
to
the
present
half-hour
*punct* ;
but
the
very
sight
of
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
her
smile
*punct* ,
her
touch
*punct* ,
her
voice
was
grateful
to
emma
*punct* ,
and
she
determined
to
think
as
little
as
possible
of
mr.
elton's
oddities
*punct* ,
or
of
any
thing
else
unpleasant
*punct* ,
and
enjoy
all
that
was
enjoyable
to
the
utmost
*punct* .
*break*
the
misfortune
of
harriet's
cold
had
been
pretty
well
gone
through
before
her
arrival
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
had
been
safely
seated
long
enough
to
give
the
history
of
it
*punct* ,
besides
all
the
history
of
his
own
and
isabella's
coming
*punct* ,
and
of
emma's
being
to
follow
*punct* ,
and
had
indeed
just
got
to
the
end
of
his
satisfaction
that
james
should
come
and
see
his
daughter
*punct* ,
when
the
others
appeared
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
who
had
been
almost
wholly
engrossed
by
her
attentions
to
him
*punct* ,
was
able
to
turn
away
and
welcome
her
dear
emma
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
project
of
forgetting
mr.
elton
for
a
while
made
her
rather
sorry
to
find
*punct* ,
when
they
had
all
taken
their
places
*punct* ,
that
he
was
close
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
the
difficulty
was
great
of
driving
his
strange
insensibility
towards
harriet
*punct* ,
from
her
mind
*punct* ,
while
he
not
only
sat
at
her
elbow
*punct* ,
but
was
continually
obtruding
his
happy
countenance
on
her
notice
*punct* ,
and
solicitously
addressing
her
upon
every
occasion
*punct* .
*break*
instead
of
forgetting
him
*punct* ,
his
behaviour
was
such
that
she
could
not
avoid
the
internal
suggestion
of
can
it
really
be
as
my
brother
imagined
*punct* ?
*break*
can
it
be
possible
for
this
man
to
be
beginning
to
transfer
his
affections
from
harriet
to
me?
*punct* ,
absurd
and
insufferable!
*punct* ,
yet
he
would
be
so
anxious
for
her
being
perfectly
warm
*punct* ,
would
be
so
interested
about
her
father
*punct* ,
and
so
delighted
with
mrs.
weston
*punct* ;
and
at
last
would
begin
admiring
her
drawings
with
so
much
zeal
and
so
little
knowledge
as
seemed
terribly
like
a
would-be
lover
*punct* ,
and
made
it
some
effort
with
her
to
preserve
her
good
manners
*punct* .
*break*
for
her
own
sake
she
could
not
be
rude
*punct* ;
and
for
harriet's
*punct* ,
in
the
hope
that
all
would
yet
turn
out
right
*punct* ,
she
was
even
positively
civil
*punct* ;
but
it
was
an
effort
*punct* ;
especially
as
something
was
going
on
amongst
the
others
*punct* ,
in
the
most
overpowering
period
of
mr.
elton's
nonsense
*punct* ,
which
she
particularly
wished
to
listen
to
*punct* .
*break*
she
heard
enough
to
know
that
mr.
weston
was
giving
some
information
about
his
son
*punct* ;
she
heard
the
words
my
son
*punct* ,
and
frank
*punct* ,
and
my
son
*punct* ,
repeated
several
times
over
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
from
a
few
other
half-syllables
very
much
suspected
that
he
was
announcing
an
early
visit
from
his
son
*punct* ;
but
before
she
could
quiet
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
the
subject
was
so
completely
past
that
any
reviving
question
from
her
would
have
been
awkward
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
it
so
happened
that
in
spite
of
emma's
resolution
of
never
marrying
*punct* ,
there
was
something
in
the
name
*punct* ,
in
the
idea
of
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
which
always
interested
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
frequently
thought
*punct* ,
especially
since
his
father's
marriage
with
miss
taylor
*punct* ,
that
if
she
were
to
marry
*punct* ,
he
was
the
very
person
to
suit
her
in
age
*punct* ,
character
and
condition
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
by
this
connexion
between
the
families
*punct* ,
quite
to
belong
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
not
but
suppose
it
to
be
a
match
that
every
body
who
knew
them
must
think
of
*punct* .
*break*
that
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
did
think
of
it
*punct* ,
she
was
very
strongly
persuaded
*punct* ;
and
though
not
meaning
to
be
induced
by
him
*punct* ,
or
by
any
body
else
*punct* ,
to
give
up
a
situation
which
she
believed
more
replete
with
good
than
any
she
could
change
it
for
*punct* ,
she
had
a
great
curiosity
to
see
him
*punct* ,
a
decided
intention
of
finding
him
pleasant
*punct* ,
of
being
liked
by
him
to
a
certain
degree
*punct* ,
and
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
the
idea
of
their
being
coupled
in
their
friends
imaginations
*punct* .
*break*
with
such
sensations
*punct* ,
mr.
elton's
civilities
were
dreadfully
ill-timed
*punct* ;
but
she
had
the
comfort
of
appearing
very
polite
*punct* ,
while
feeling
very
cross
*punct* ,
and
of
thinking
that
the
rest
of
the
visit
could
not
possibly
pass
without
bringing
forward
the
same
information
again
*punct* ,
or
the
substance
of
it
*punct* ,
from
the
open-hearted
mr.
weston.
*punct* ,
so
it
proved;
*punct* ,
for
when
happily
released
from
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
and
seated
by
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
at
dinner
*punct* ,
he
made
use
of
the
very
first
interval
in
the
cares
of
hospitality
*punct* ,
the
very
first
leisure
from
the
saddle
of
mutton
*punct* ,
to
say
to
her
*punct* ,
we
want
only
two
more
to
be
just
the
right
number
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
like
to
see
two
more
here,
*punct* ,
your
pretty
little
friend
*punct* ,
miss
smith
*punct* ,
and
my
son
*punct* ,
and
then
i
should
say
we
were
quite
complete
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
you
did
not
hear
me
telling
the
others
in
the
drawing-room
that
we
are
expecting
frank
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
*punct* ,
and
he
will
be
with
us
within
a
fortnight
*punct* .
*break*
emma
spoke
with
a
very
proper
degree
of
pleasure
*punct* ;
and
fully
assented
to
his
proposition
of
mr.
frank
churchill
and
miss
smith
making
their
party
quite
complete
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
been
wanting
to
come
to
us
*punct* ,
continued
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
ever
since
september
*punct* :
every
letter
has
been
full
of
it
*punct* ;
but
he
cannot
command
his
own
time
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
those
to
please
who
must
be
pleased
*punct* ,
and
who
*punct* ,
between
ourselves
*punct* ,
are
sometimes
to
be
pleased
only
by
a
good
many
sacrifices
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
i
have
no
doubt
of
seeing
him
here
about
the
second
week
in
january
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
very
great
pleasure
it
will
be
to
you
*punct* !
*break*
and
mrs.
weston
is
so
anxious
to
be
acquainted
with
him
*punct* ,
that
she
must
be
almost
as
happy
as
yourself
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
she
would
be
*punct* ,
but
that
she
thinks
there
will
be
another
put-off
*punct* .
*break*
she
does
not
depend
upon
his
coming
so
much
as
i
do
*punct* :
but
she
does
not
know
the
parties
so
well
as
i
do
*punct* .
*break*
the
case
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
but
this
is
quite
between
ourselves
*punct* :
i
did
not
mention
a
syllable
of
it
in
the
other
room
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
secrets
in
all
families
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
the
case
is
*punct* ,
that
a
party
of
friends
are
invited
to
pay
a
visit
at
enscombe
in
january
*punct* ;
and
that
frank's
coming
depends
upon
their
being
put
off
*punct* .
*break*
if
they
are
not
put
off
*punct* ,
he
cannot
stir
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
know
they
will
*punct* ,
because
it
is
a
family
that
a
certain
lady
*punct* ,
of
some
consequence
*punct* ,
at
enscombe
*punct* ,
has
a
particular
dislike
to
*punct* :
and
though
it
is
thought
necessary
to
invite
them
once
in
two
or
three
years
*punct* ,
they
always
are
put
off
when
it
comes
to
the
point
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
not
the
smallest
doubt
of
the
issue
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
as
confident
of
seeing
frank
here
before
the
middle
of
january
*punct* ,
as
i
am
of
being
here
myself
*punct* :
but
your
good
friend
there
*punct* ,
nodding
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
table
*punct* ,
has
so
few
vagaries
herself
*punct* ,
and
has
been
so
little
used
to
them
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
that
she
cannot
calculate
on
their
effects
*punct* ,
as
i
have
been
long
in
the
practice
of
doing
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sorry
there
should
be
any
thing
like
doubt
in
the
case
*punct* ,
replied
emma
*punct* ;
but
am
disposed
to
side
with
you
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
think
he
will
come
*punct* ,
i
shall
think
so
too
*punct* ;
for
you
know
enscombe
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
have
some
right
to
that
knowledge
*punct* ;
though
i
have
never
been
at
the
place
in
my
life.
*punct* ,
she
is
an
odd
woman!
*punct* ,
but
i
never
allow
myself
to
speak
ill
of
her
*punct* ,
on
frank's
account
*punct* ;
for
i
do
believe
her
to
be
very
fond
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
is
no
small
credit
*punct* ,
in
my
opinion
*punct* ,
to
him
*punct* ,
that
he
should
excite
such
an
affection
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
though
i
would
not
say
it
to
any
body
else
*punct* ,
she
has
no
more
heart
than
a
stone
to
people
in
general
*punct* ;
and
the
devil
of
a
temper
*punct* .
*break*
emma
liked
the
subject
so
well
*punct* ,
that
she
began
upon
it
*punct* ,
to
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
very
soon
after
their
moving
into
the
drawing-room
*punct* :
wishing
her
joy
*punct* ,
yet
observing
*punct* ,
that
she
knew
the
first
meeting
must
be
rather
alarming.
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
agreed
to
it
*punct* ;
but
added
*punct* ,
that
she
should
be
very
glad
to
be
secure
of
undergoing
the
anxiety
of
a
first
meeting
at
the
time
talked
of
*punct* :
for
i
cannot
depend
upon
his
coming
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
be
so
sanguine
as
mr.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
very
much
afraid
that
it
will
all
end
in
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* ,
has
been
telling
you
exactly
how
the
matter
stands
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
it
seems
to
depend
upon
nothing
but
the
ill-humour
of
mrs.
churchill
*punct* ,
which
i
imagine
to
be
the
most
certain
thing
in
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
replied
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
smiling
*punct* ,
what
is
the
certainty
of
caprice
*punct* ?
*break*
then
turning
to
isabella
*punct* ,
who
had
not
been
attending
before
*punct* ,
you
must
know
*punct* ,
my
dear
mrs.
knightley
*punct* ,
that
we
are
by
no
means
so
sure
of
seeing
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
in
my
opinion
*punct* ,
as
his
father
thinks
*punct* .
*break*
it
depends
entirely
upon
his
aunt's
spirits
and
pleasure
*punct* ;
in
short
*punct* ,
upon
her
temper
*punct* .
*break*
to
you
*punct* ,
to
my
two
daughters
*punct* ,
i
may
venture
on
the
truth
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
churchill
rules
at
enscombe
*punct* ,
and
is
a
very
odd-tempered
woman
*punct* ;
and
his
coming
now
*punct* ,
depends
upon
her
being
willing
to
spare
him
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
mrs.
churchill
*punct* ;
every
body
knows
mrs.
churchill
*punct* ,
replied
isabella
*punct* :
and
i
am
sure
i
never
think
of
that
poor
young
man
without
the
greatest
compassion
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
constantly
living
with
an
ill-tempered
person
*punct* ,
must
be
dreadful
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
what
we
happily
have
never
known
any
thing
of
*punct* ;
but
it
must
be
a
life
of
misery
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
blessing
*punct* ,
that
she
never
had
any
children
*punct* !
*break*
poor
little
creatures
*punct* ,
how
unhappy
she
would
have
made
them
*punct* !
*break*
emma
wished
she
had
been
alone
with
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
she
should
then
have
heard
more
*punct* :
mrs.
weston
would
speak
to
her
*punct* ,
with
a
degree
of
unreserve
which
she
would
not
hazard
with
isabella
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
she
really
believed
*punct* ,
would
scarcely
try
to
conceal
any
thing
relative
to
the
churchills
from
her
*punct* ,
excepting
those
views
on
the
young
man
*punct* ,
of
which
her
own
imagination
had
already
given
her
such
instinctive
knowledge
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
present
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
very
soon
followed
them
into
the
drawing-room
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
sitting
long
after
dinner
*punct* ,
was
a
confinement
that
he
could
not
endure
*punct* .
*break*
neither
wine
nor
conversation
was
any
thing
to
him
*punct* ;
and
gladly
did
he
move
to
those
with
whom
he
was
always
comfortable
*punct* .
*break*
while
he
talked
to
isabella
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
emma
found
an
opportunity
of
saying
*punct* ,
and
so
you
do
not
consider
this
visit
from
your
son
as
by
any
means
certain
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sorry
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
introduction
must
be
unpleasant
*punct* ,
whenever
it
takes
place
*punct* ;
and
the
sooner
it
could
be
over
*punct* ,
the
better
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ;
and
every
delay
makes
one
more
apprehensive
of
other
delays
*punct* .
*break*
even
if
this
family
*punct* ,
the
braithwaites
*punct* ,
are
put
off
*punct* ,
i
am
still
afraid
that
some
excuse
may
be
found
for
disappointing
us
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
bear
to
imagine
any
reluctance
on
his
side
*punct* ;
but
i
am
sure
there
is
a
great
wish
on
the
churchills
to
keep
him
to
themselves
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
jealousy
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
jealous
even
of
his
regard
for
his
father
*punct* .
*break*
in
short
*punct* ,
i
can
feel
no
dependence
on
his
coming
*punct* ,
and
i
wish
mr.
weston
were
less
sanguine
*punct* .
*break*
he
ought
to
come
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
could
stay
only
a
couple
of
days
*punct* ,
he
ought
to
come
*punct* ;
and
one
can
hardly
conceive
a
young
man's
not
having
it
in
his
power
to
do
as
much
as
that
*punct* .
*break*
a
young
woman
*punct* ,
if
she
fall
into
bad
hands
*punct* ,
may
be
teazed
*punct* ,
and
kept
at
a
distance
from
those
she
wants
to
be
with
*punct* ;
but
one
cannot
comprehend
a
young
man's
being
under
such
restraint
*punct* ,
as
not
to
be
able
to
spend
a
week
with
his
father
*punct* ,
if
he
likes
it
*punct* .
*break*
one
ought
to
be
at
enscombe
*punct* ,
and
know
the
ways
of
the
family
*punct* ,
before
one
decides
upon
what
he
can
do
*punct* ,
replied
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
one
ought
to
use
the
same
caution
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
in
judging
of
the
conduct
of
any
one
individual
of
any
one
family
*punct* ;
but
enscombe
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
certainly
must
not
be
judged
by
general
rules
*punct* :
she
is
so
very
unreasonable
*punct* ;
and
every
thing
gives
way
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
is
so
fond
of
the
nephew
*punct* :
he
is
so
very
great
a
favourite
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
according
to
my
idea
of
mrs.
churchill
*punct* ,
it
would
be
most
natural
*punct* ,
that
while
she
makes
no
sacrifice
for
the
comfort
of
the
husband
*punct* ,
to
whom
she
owes
every
thing
*punct* ,
while
she
exercises
incessant
caprice
towards
him
*punct* ,
she
should
frequently
be
governed
by
the
nephew
*punct* ,
to
whom
she
owes
nothing
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
my
dearest
emma
*punct* ,
do
not
pretend
*punct* ,
with
your
sweet
temper
*punct* ,
to
understand
a
bad
one
*punct* ,
or
to
lay
down
rules
for
it
*punct* :
you
must
let
it
go
its
own
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
doubt
of
his
having
*punct* ,
at
times
*punct* ,
considerable
influence
*punct* ;
but
it
may
be
perfectly
impossible
for
him
to
know
beforehand
when
it
will
be
*punct* .
*break*
emma
listened
*punct* ,
and
then
coolly
said
*punct* ,
i
shall
not
be
satisfied
*punct* ,
unless
he
comes
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
have
a
great
deal
of
influence
on
some
points
*punct* ,
continued
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
and
on
others
*punct* ,
very
little
*punct* :
and
among
those
*punct* ,
on
which
she
is
beyond
his
reach
*punct* ,
it
is
but
too
likely
*punct* ,
may
be
this
very
circumstance
of
his
coming
away
from
them
to
visit
us
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
was
soon
ready
for
his
tea
*punct* ;
and
when
he
had
drank
his
tea
he
was
quite
ready
to
go
home
*punct* ;
and
it
was
as
much
as
his
three
companions
could
do
*punct* ,
to
entertain
away
his
notice
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
*punct* ,
before
the
other
gentlemen
appeared
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
was
chatty
and
convivial
*punct* ,
and
no
friend
to
early
separations
of
any
sort
*punct* ;
but
at
last
the
drawing-room
party
did
receive
an
augmentation
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
in
very
good
spirits
*punct* ,
was
one
of
the
first
to
walk
in
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
and
emma
were
sitting
together
on
a
sofa
*punct* .
*break*
he
joined
them
immediately
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
with
scarcely
an
invitation
*punct* ,
seated
himself
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
emma
*punct* ,
in
good
spirits
too
*punct* ,
from
the
amusement
afforded
her
mind
by
the
expectation
of
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
was
willing
to
forget
his
late
improprieties
*punct* ,
and
be
as
well
satisfied
with
him
as
before
*punct* ,
and
on
his
making
harriet
his
very
first
subject
*punct* ,
was
ready
to
listen
with
most
friendly
smiles
*punct* .
*break*
he
professed
himself
extremely
anxious
about
her
fair
friend
*punct* ,
her
fair
*punct* ,
lovely
*punct* ,
amiable
friend
*punct* .
*break*
did
she
know?
*punct* ,
had
she
heard
any
thing
about
her
*punct* ,
since
their
being
at
randalls?
*punct* ,
he
felt
much
anxiety
*punct* ,
he
must
confess
that
the
nature
of
her
complaint
alarmed
him
considerably
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
this
style
he
talked
on
for
some
time
very
properly
*punct* ,
not
much
attending
to
any
answer
*punct* ,
but
altogether
sufficiently
awake
to
the
terror
of
a
bad
sore
throat
*punct* ;
and
emma
was
quite
in
charity
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
last
there
seemed
a
perverse
turn
*punct* ;
it
seemed
all
at
once
as
if
he
were
more
afraid
of
its
being
a
bad
sore
throat
on
her
account
*punct* ,
than
on
harriet's
*punct* ,
more
anxious
that
she
should
escape
the
infection
*punct* ,
than
that
there
should
be
no
infection
in
the
complaint
*punct* .
*break*
he
began
with
great
earnestness
to
entreat
her
to
refrain
from
visiting
the
sick-chamber
again
*punct* ,
for
the
present
*punct* ,
to
entreat
her
to
promise
him
not
to
venture
into
such
hazard
till
he
had
seen
mr.
perry
and
learnt
his
opinion
*punct* ;
and
though
she
tried
to
laugh
it
off
and
bring
the
subject
back
into
its
proper
course
*punct* ,
there
was
no
putting
an
end
to
his
extreme
solicitude
about
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
vexed
*punct* .
*break*
it
did
appear
*punct* ,
there
was
no
concealing
it
*punct* ,
exactly
like
the
pretence
of
being
in
love
with
her
*punct* ,
instead
of
harriet
*punct* ;
an
inconstancy
*punct* ,
if
real
*punct* ,
the
most
contemptible
and
abominable
*punct* !
*break*
and
she
had
difficulty
in
behaving
with
temper
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
to
mrs.
weston
to
implore
her
assistance
*punct* ,
would
not
she
give
him
her
support?
*punct* ,
would
not
she
add
her
persuasions
to
his
*punct* ,
to
induce
miss
woodhouse
not
to
go
to
mrs.
goddard's
till
it
were
certain
that
miss
smith's
disorder
had
no
infection
*punct* ?
*break*
he
could
not
be
satisfied
without
a
promise
*punct* ,
would
not
she
give
him
her
influence
in
procuring
it
*punct* ?
*break*
so
scrupulous
for
others
*punct* ,
he
continued
*punct* ,
and
yet
so
careless
for
herself
*punct* !
*break*
she
wanted
me
to
nurse
my
cold
by
staying
at
home
to-day
*punct* ,
and
yet
will
not
promise
to
avoid
the
danger
of
catching
an
ulcerated
sore
throat
herself
*punct* .
*break*
is
this
fair
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston?
*punct* ,
judge
between
us
*punct* .
*break*
have
not
i
some
right
to
complain
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
sure
of
your
kind
support
and
aid
*punct* .
*break*
emma
saw
mrs.
weston's
surprize
*punct* ,
and
felt
that
it
must
be
great
*punct* ,
at
an
address
which
*punct* ,
in
words
and
manner
*punct* ,
was
assuming
to
himself
the
right
of
first
interest
in
her
*punct* ;
and
as
for
herself
*punct* ,
she
was
too
much
provoked
and
offended
to
have
the
power
of
directly
saying
any
thing
to
the
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
only
give
him
a
look
*punct* ;
but
it
was
such
a
look
as
she
thought
must
restore
him
to
his
senses
*punct* ,
and
then
left
the
sofa
*punct* ,
removing
to
a
seat
by
her
sister
*punct* ,
and
giving
her
all
her
attention
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
not
time
to
know
how
mr.
elton
took
the
reproof
*punct* ,
so
rapidly
did
another
subject
succeed
*punct* ;
for
mr.
john
knightley
now
came
into
the
room
from
examining
the
weather
*punct* ,
and
opened
on
them
all
with
the
information
of
the
ground
being
covered
with
snow
*punct* ,
and
of
its
still
snowing
fast
*punct* ,
with
a
strong
drifting
wind
*punct* ;
concluding
with
these
words
to
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* :
this
will
prove
a
spirited
beginning
of
your
winter
engagements
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
something
new
for
your
coachman
and
horses
to
be
making
their
way
through
a
storm
of
snow
*punct* .
*break*
poor
mr.
woodhouse
was
silent
from
consternation
*punct* ;
but
every
body
else
had
something
to
say
*punct* ;
every
body
was
either
surprized
or
not
surprized
*punct* ,
and
had
some
question
to
ask
*punct* ,
or
some
comfort
to
offer
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
and
emma
tried
earnestly
to
cheer
him
and
turn
his
attention
from
his
son-in-law
*punct* ,
who
was
pursuing
his
triumph
rather
unfeelingly
*punct* .
*break*
i
admired
your
resolution
very
much
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
in
venturing
out
in
such
weather
*punct* ,
for
of
course
you
saw
there
would
be
snow
very
soon
*punct* .
*break*
every
body
must
have
seen
the
snow
coming
on
*punct* .
*break*
i
admired
your
spirit
*punct* ;
and
i
dare
say
we
shall
get
home
very
well
*punct* .
*break*
another
hour
or
two's
snow
can
hardly
make
the
road
impassable
*punct* ;
and
we
are
two
carriages
*punct* ;
if
one
is
blown
over
in
the
bleak
part
of
the
common
field
there
will
be
the
other
at
hand
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
we
shall
be
all
safe
at
hartfield
before
midnight
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
with
triumph
of
a
different
sort
*punct* ,
was
confessing
that
he
had
known
it
to
be
snowing
some
time
*punct* ,
but
had
not
said
a
word
*punct* ,
lest
it
should
make
mr.
woodhouse
uncomfortable
*punct* ,
and
be
an
excuse
for
his
hurrying
away
*punct* .
*break*
as
to
there
being
any
quantity
of
snow
fallen
or
likely
to
fall
to
impede
their
return
*punct* ,
that
was
a
mere
joke
*punct* ;
he
was
afraid
they
would
find
no
difficulty
*punct* .
*break*
he
wished
the
road
might
be
impassable
*punct* ,
that
he
might
be
able
to
keep
them
all
at
randalls
*punct* ;
and
with
the
utmost
good-will
was
sure
that
accommodation
might
be
found
for
every
body
*punct* ,
calling
on
his
wife
to
agree
with
him
*punct* ,
that
with
a
little
contrivance
*punct* ,
every
body
might
be
lodged
*punct* ,
which
she
hardly
knew
how
to
do
*punct* ,
from
the
consciousness
of
there
being
but
two
spare
rooms
in
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
to
be
done
*punct* ,
my
dear
emma?
*punct* ,
what
is
to
be
done
*punct* ?
*break*
was
mr.
woodhouse's
first
exclamation
*punct* ,
and
all
that
he
could
say
for
some
time
*punct* .
*break*
to
her
he
looked
for
comfort
*punct* ;
and
her
assurances
of
safety
*punct* ,
her
representation
of
the
excellence
of
the
horses
*punct* ,
and
of
james
*punct* ,
and
of
their
having
so
many
friends
about
them
*punct* ,
revived
him
a
little
*punct* .
*break*
his
eldest
daughter's
alarm
was
equal
to
his
own
*punct* .
*break*
the
horror
of
being
blocked
up
at
randalls
*punct* ,
while
her
children
were
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
was
full
in
her
imagination
*punct* ;
and
fancying
the
road
to
be
now
just
passable
for
adventurous
people
*punct* ,
but
in
a
state
that
admitted
no
delay
*punct* ,
she
was
eager
to
have
it
settled
*punct* ,
that
her
father
and
emma
should
remain
at
randalls
*punct* ,
while
she
and
her
husband
set
forward
instantly
through
all
the
possible
accumulations
of
drifted
snow
that
might
impede
them
*punct* .
*break*
you
had
better
order
the
carriage
directly
*punct* ,
my
love
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ;
i
dare
say
we
shall
be
able
to
get
along
*punct* ,
if
we
set
off
directly
*punct* ;
and
if
we
do
come
to
any
thing
very
bad
*punct* ,
i
can
get
out
and
walk
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
not
mind
walking
half
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
change
my
shoes
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
the
moment
i
got
home
*punct* ;
and
it
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
that
gives
me
cold
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
my
dear
isabella
*punct* ,
it
is
the
most
extraordinary
sort
of
thing
in
the
world
*punct* ,
for
in
general
every
thing
does
give
you
cold
*punct* .
*break*
walk
home!
*punct* ,
you
are
prettily
shod
for
walking
home
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
be
bad
enough
for
the
horses
*punct* .
*break*
isabella
turned
to
mrs.
weston
for
her
approbation
of
the
plan
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
could
only
approve
*punct* .
*break*
isabella
then
went
to
emma
*punct* ;
but
emma
could
not
so
entirely
give
up
the
hope
of
their
being
all
able
to
get
away
*punct* ;
and
they
were
still
discussing
the
point
*punct* ,
when
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
who
had
left
the
room
immediately
after
his
brother's
first
report
of
the
snow
*punct* ,
came
back
again
*punct* ,
and
told
them
that
he
had
been
out
of
doors
to
examine
*punct* ,
and
could
answer
for
there
not
being
the
smallest
difficulty
in
their
getting
home
*punct* ,
whenever
they
liked
it
*punct* ,
either
now
or
an
hour
hence
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
gone
beyond
the
sweep
*punct* ,
some
way
along
the
highbury
road
*punct* ,
the
snow
was
nowhere
above
half
an
inch
deep
*punct* ,
in
many
places
hardly
enough
to
whiten
the
ground
*punct* ;
a
very
few
flakes
were
falling
at
present
*punct* ,
but
the
clouds
were
parting
*punct* ,
and
there
was
every
appearance
of
its
being
soon
over
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
seen
the
coachmen
*punct* ,
and
they
both
agreed
with
him
in
there
being
nothing
to
apprehend
*punct* .
*break*
to
isabella
*punct* ,
the
relief
of
such
tidings
was
very
great
*punct* ,
and
they
were
scarcely
less
acceptable
to
emma
on
her
father's
account
*punct* ,
who
was
immediately
set
as
much
at
ease
on
the
subject
as
his
nervous
constitution
allowed
*punct* ;
but
the
alarm
that
had
been
raised
could
not
be
appeased
so
as
to
admit
of
any
comfort
for
him
while
he
continued
at
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
satisfied
of
there
being
no
present
danger
in
returning
home
*punct* ,
but
no
assurances
could
convince
him
that
it
was
safe
to
stay
*punct* ;
and
while
the
others
were
variously
urging
and
recommending
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
and
emma
settled
it
in
a
few
brief
sentences
*punct* :
thus
*punct* ,
your
father
will
not
be
easy
*punct* ;
why
do
not
you
go
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
ready
*punct* ,
if
the
others
are
*punct* .
*break*
shall
i
ring
the
bell
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
do
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
bell
was
rung
*punct* ,
and
the
carriages
spoken
for
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
minutes
more
*punct* ,
and
emma
hoped
to
see
one
troublesome
companion
deposited
in
his
own
house
*punct* ,
to
get
sober
and
cool
*punct* ,
and
the
other
recover
his
temper
and
happiness
when
this
visit
of
hardship
were
over
*punct* .
*break*
the
carriage
came
*punct* :
and
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
always
the
first
object
on
such
occasions
*punct* ,
was
carefully
attended
to
his
own
by
mr.
knightley
and
mr.
weston
*punct* ;
but
not
all
that
either
could
say
could
prevent
some
renewal
of
alarm
at
the
sight
of
the
snow
which
had
actually
fallen
*punct* ,
and
the
discovery
of
a
much
darker
night
than
he
had
been
prepared
for
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
afraid
they
should
have
a
very
bad
drive
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
afraid
poor
isabella
would
not
like
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
would
be
poor
emma
in
the
carriage
behind
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
know
what
they
had
best
do
*punct* .
*break*
they
must
keep
as
much
together
as
they
could
*punct* ;
and
james
was
talked
to
*punct* ,
and
given
a
charge
to
go
very
slow
and
wait
for
the
other
carriage
*punct* .
*break*
isabella
stept
in
after
her
father
*punct* ;
john
knightley
*punct* ,
forgetting
that
he
did
not
belong
to
their
party
*punct* ,
stept
in
after
his
wife
very
naturally
*punct* ;
so
that
emma
found
*punct* ,
on
being
escorted
and
followed
into
the
second
carriage
by
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
that
the
door
was
to
be
lawfully
shut
on
them
*punct* ,
and
that
they
were
to
have
a
tete-a-tete
drive
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
not
have
been
the
awkwardness
of
a
moment
*punct* ,
it
would
have
been
rather
a
pleasure
*punct* ,
previous
to
the
suspicions
of
this
very
day
*punct* ;
she
could
have
talked
to
him
of
harriet
*punct* ,
and
the
three-quarters
of
a
mile
would
have
seemed
but
one
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
*punct* ,
she
would
rather
it
had
not
happened
*punct* .
*break*
she
believed
he
had
been
drinking
too
much
of
mr.
weston's
good
wine
*punct* ,
and
felt
sure
that
he
would
want
to
be
talking
nonsense
*punct* .
*break*
to
restrain
him
as
much
as
might
be
*punct* ,
by
her
own
manners
*punct* ,
she
was
immediately
preparing
to
speak
with
exquisite
calmness
and
gravity
of
the
weather
and
the
night
*punct* ;
but
scarcely
had
she
begun
*punct* ,
scarcely
had
they
passed
the
sweep-gate
and
joined
the
other
carriage
*punct* ,
than
she
found
her
subject
cut
up
*punct* ,
her
hand
seized
*punct* ,
her
attention
demanded
*punct* ,
and
mr.
elton
actually
making
violent
love
to
her
*punct* :
availing
himself
of
the
precious
opportunity
*punct* ,
declaring
sentiments
which
must
be
already
well
known
*punct* ,
hoping
*punct* ,
fearing
*punct* ,
adoring
*punct* ,
ready
to
die
if
she
refused
him
*punct* ;
but
flattering
himself
that
his
ardent
attachment
and
unequalled
love
and
unexampled
passion
could
not
fail
of
having
some
effect
*punct* ,
and
in
short
*punct* ,
very
much
resolved
on
being
seriously
accepted
as
soon
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
it
really
was
so
*punct* .
*break*
without
scruple
*punct* ,
without
apology
*punct* ,
without
much
apparent
diffidence
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
the
lover
of
harriet
*punct* ,
was
professing
himself
her
lover
*punct* .
*break*
she
tried
to
stop
him
*punct* ;
but
vainly
*punct* ;
he
would
go
on
*punct* ,
and
say
it
all
*punct* .
*break*
angry
as
she
was
*punct* ,
the
thought
of
the
moment
made
her
resolve
to
restrain
herself
when
she
did
speak
*punct* .
*break*
she
felt
that
half
this
folly
must
be
drunkenness
*punct* ,
and
therefore
could
hope
that
it
might
belong
only
to
the
passing
hour
*punct* .
*break*
accordingly
*punct* ,
with
a
mixture
of
the
serious
and
the
playful
*punct* ,
which
she
hoped
would
best
suit
his
half
and
half
state
*punct* ,
she
replied
*punct* ,
i
am
very
much
astonished
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
this
to
me
*punct* !
*break*
you
forget
yourself
*punct* ,
you
take
me
for
my
friend
*punct* ,
any
message
to
miss
smith
i
shall
be
happy
to
deliver
*punct* ;
but
no
more
of
this
to
me
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* .
*break*
miss
smith!
*punct* ,
message
to
miss
smith!
*punct* ,
what
could
she
possibly
mean!
*punct* ,
and
he
repeated
her
words
with
such
assurance
of
accent
*punct* ,
such
boastful
pretence
of
amazement
*punct* ,
that
she
could
not
help
replying
with
quickness
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
conduct
*punct* !
*break*
and
i
can
account
for
it
only
in
one
way
*punct* ;
you
are
not
yourself
*punct* ,
or
you
could
not
speak
either
to
me
*punct* ,
or
of
harriet
*punct* ,
in
such
a
manner
*punct* .
*break*
command
yourself
enough
to
say
no
more
*punct* ,
and
i
will
endeavour
to
forget
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
mr.
elton
had
only
drunk
wine
enough
to
elevate
his
spirits
*punct* ,
not
at
all
to
confuse
his
intellects
*punct* .
*break*
he
perfectly
knew
his
own
meaning
*punct* ;
and
having
warmly
protested
against
her
suspicion
as
most
injurious
*punct* ,
and
slightly
touched
upon
his
respect
for
miss
smith
as
her
friend,
*punct* ,
but
acknowledging
his
wonder
that
miss
smith
should
be
mentioned
at
all,
*punct* ,
he
resumed
the
subject
of
his
own
passion
*punct* ,
and
was
very
urgent
for
a
favourable
answer
*punct* .
*break*
as
she
thought
less
of
his
inebriety
*punct* ,
she
thought
more
of
his
inconstancy
and
presumption
*punct* ;
and
with
fewer
struggles
for
politeness
*punct* ,
replied
*punct* ,
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
doubt
any
longer
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
made
yourself
too
clear
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
my
astonishment
is
much
beyond
any
thing
i
can
express
*punct* .
*break*
after
such
behaviour
*punct* ,
as
i
have
witnessed
during
the
last
month
*punct* ,
to
miss
smith
*punct* ,
such
attentions
as
i
have
been
in
the
daily
habit
of
observing
*punct* ,
to
be
addressing
me
in
this
manner
*punct* ,
this
is
an
unsteadiness
of
character
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
which
i
had
not
supposed
possible
*punct* !
*break*
believe
me
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
i
am
far
*punct* ,
very
far
*punct* ,
from
gratified
in
being
the
object
of
such
professions
*punct* .
*break*
cried
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
this?
*punct* ,
miss
smith!
*punct* ,
i
never
thought
of
miss
smith
in
the
whole
course
of
my
existence
*punct* ,
never
paid
her
any
attentions
*punct* ,
but
as
your
friend
*punct* :
never
cared
whether
she
were
dead
or
alive
*punct* ,
but
as
your
friend
*punct* .
*break*
if
she
has
fancied
otherwise
*punct* ,
her
own
wishes
have
misled
her
*punct* ,
and
i
am
very
sorry
*punct* ,
extremely
sorry
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
miss
smith
*punct* ,
indeed!
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
who
can
think
of
miss
smith
*punct* ,
when
miss
woodhouse
is
near
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
upon
my
honour
*punct* ,
there
is
no
unsteadiness
of
character
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
thought
only
of
you
*punct* .
*break*
i
protest
against
having
paid
the
smallest
attention
to
any
one
else
*punct* .
*break*
every
thing
that
i
have
said
or
done
*punct* ,
for
many
weeks
past
*punct* ,
has
been
with
the
sole
view
of
marking
my
adoration
of
yourself
*punct* .
*break*
you
cannot
really
*punct* ,
seriously
*punct* ,
doubt
it
*punct* .
*break*
no!
*punct* ,
in
an
accent
meant
to
be
insinuating
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
you
have
seen
and
understood
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
what
emma
felt
*punct* ,
on
hearing
this
*punct* ,
which
of
all
her
unpleasant
sensations
was
uppermost
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
too
completely
overpowered
to
be
immediately
able
to
reply
*punct* :
and
two
moments
of
silence
being
ample
encouragement
for
mr.
elton's
sanguine
state
of
mind
*punct* ,
he
tried
to
take
her
hand
again
*punct* ,
as
he
joyously
exclaimed
*punct* ,
charming
miss
woodhouse
*punct* !
*break*
allow
me
to
interpret
this
interesting
silence
*punct* .
*break*
it
confesses
that
you
have
long
understood
me
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* ,
it
confesses
no
such
thing
*punct* .
*break*
so
far
from
having
long
understood
you
*punct* ,
i
have
been
in
a
most
complete
error
with
respect
to
your
views
*punct* ,
till
this
moment
*punct* .
*break*
as
to
myself
*punct* ,
i
am
very
sorry
that
you
should
have
been
giving
way
to
any
feelings
*punct* ,
nothing
could
be
farther
from
my
wishes
*punct* ,
your
attachment
to
my
friend
harriet
*punct* ,
your
pursuit
of
her
*punct* ,
pursuit
*punct* ,
it
appeared,
*punct* ,
gave
me
great
pleasure
*punct* ,
and
i
have
been
very
earnestly
wishing
you
success
*punct* :
but
had
i
supposed
that
she
were
not
your
attraction
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
i
should
certainly
have
thought
you
judged
ill
in
making
your
visits
so
frequent
*punct* .
*break*
am
i
to
believe
that
you
have
never
sought
to
recommend
yourself
particularly
to
miss
smith?
*punct* ,
that
you
have
never
thought
seriously
of
her
*punct* ?
*break*
never
*punct* ,
madam
*punct* ,
cried
he
*punct* ,
affronted
in
his
turn
*punct* :
never
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
seriously
of
miss
smith!
*punct* ,
miss
smith
is
a
very
good
sort
of
girl
*punct* ;
and
i
should
be
happy
to
see
her
respectably
settled
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
her
extremely
well
*punct* :
and
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* ,
there
are
men
who
might
not
object
to
*punct* ,
every
body
has
their
level
*punct* :
but
as
for
myself
*punct* ,
i
am
not
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
quite
so
much
at
a
loss
*punct* .
*break*
i
need
not
so
totally
despair
of
an
equal
alliance
*punct* ,
as
to
be
addressing
myself
to
miss
smith!
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
madam
*punct* ,
my
visits
to
hartfield
have
been
for
yourself
only
*punct* ;
and
the
encouragement
i
received
*punct* ,
encouragement!
*punct* ,
i
give
you
encouragement!
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
you
have
been
entirely
mistaken
in
supposing
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
seen
you
only
as
the
admirer
of
my
friend
*punct* .
*break*
in
no
other
light
could
you
have
been
more
to
me
than
a
common
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
*punct* :
but
it
is
well
that
the
mistake
ends
where
it
does
*punct* .
*break*
had
the
same
behaviour
continued
*punct* ,
miss
smith
might
have
been
led
into
a
misconception
of
your
views
*punct* ;
not
being
aware
*punct* ,
probably
*punct* ,
any
more
than
myself
*punct* ,
of
the
very
great
inequality
which
you
are
so
sensible
of
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
it
is
*punct* ,
the
disappointment
is
single
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
i
trust
*punct* ,
will
not
be
lasting
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
thoughts
of
matrimony
at
present
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
too
angry
to
say
another
word
*punct* ;
her
manner
too
decided
to
invite
supplication
*punct* ;
and
in
this
state
of
swelling
resentment
*punct* ,
and
mutually
deep
mortification
*punct* ,
they
had
to
continue
together
a
few
minutes
longer
*punct* ,
for
the
fears
of
mr.
woodhouse
had
confined
them
to
a
foot-pace
*punct* .
*break*
if
there
had
not
been
so
much
anger
*punct* ,
there
would
have
been
desperate
awkwardness
*punct* ;
but
their
straightforward
emotions
left
no
room
for
the
little
zigzags
of
embarrassment
*punct* .
*break*
without
knowing
when
the
carriage
turned
into
vicarage
lane
*punct* ,
or
when
it
stopped
*punct* ,
they
found
themselves
*punct* ,
all
at
once
*punct* ,
at
the
door
of
his
house
*punct* ;
and
he
was
out
before
another
syllable
passed.
*punct* ,
emma
then
felt
it
indispensable
to
wish
him
a
good
night
*punct* .
*break*
the
compliment
was
just
returned
*punct* ,
coldly
and
proudly
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
under
indescribable
irritation
of
spirits
*punct* ,
she
was
then
conveyed
to
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
there
she
was
welcomed
*punct* ,
with
the
utmost
delight
*punct* ,
by
her
father
*punct* ,
who
had
been
trembling
for
the
dangers
of
a
solitary
drive
from
vicarage
lane
*punct* ,
turning
a
corner
which
he
could
never
bear
to
think
of
*punct* ,
and
in
strange
hands
*punct* ,
a
mere
common
coachman
*punct* ,
no
james
*punct* ;
and
there
it
seemed
as
if
her
return
only
were
wanted
to
make
every
thing
go
well
*punct* :
for
mr.
john
knightley
*punct* ,
ashamed
of
his
ill-humour
*punct* ,
was
now
all
kindness
and
attention
*punct* ;
and
so
particularly
solicitous
for
the
comfort
of
her
father
*punct* ,
as
to
seem
*punct* ,
if
not
quite
ready
to
join
him
in
a
basin
of
gruel
*punct* ,
perfectly
sensible
of
its
being
exceedingly
wholesome
*punct* ;
and
the
day
was
concluding
in
peace
and
comfort
to
all
their
little
party
*punct* ,
except
herself.
*punct* ,
but
her
mind
had
never
been
in
such
perturbation
*punct* ;
and
it
needed
a
very
strong
effort
to
appear
attentive
and
cheerful
till
the
usual
hour
of
separating
allowed
her
the
relief
of
quiet
reflection
*punct* .
*break*
the
hair
was
curled
*punct* ,
and
the
maid
sent
away
*punct* ,
and
emma
sat
down
to
think
and
be
miserable.
*punct* ,
it
was
a
wretched
business
indeed!
*punct* ,
such
an
overthrow
of
every
thing
she
had
been
wishing
for!
*punct* ,
such
a
development
of
every
thing
most
unwelcome!
*punct* ,
such
a
blow
for
harriet!
*punct* ,
that
was
the
worst
of
all
*punct* .
*break*
every
part
of
it
brought
pain
and
humiliation
*punct* ,
of
some
sort
or
other
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
compared
with
the
evil
to
harriet
*punct* ,
all
was
light
*punct* ;
and
she
would
gladly
have
submitted
to
feel
yet
more
mistaken
*punct* ,
more
in
error
*punct* ,
more
disgraced
by
mis-judgment
*punct* ,
than
she
actually
was
*punct* ,
could
the
effects
of
her
blunders
have
been
confined
to
herself
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
had
not
persuaded
harriet
into
liking
the
man
*punct* ,
i
could
have
borne
any
thing
*punct* .
*break*
he
might
have
doubled
his
presumption
to
me
*punct* ,
but
poor
harriet
*punct* !
*break*
how
she
could
have
been
so
deceived!
*punct* ,
he
protested
that
he
had
never
thought
seriously
of
harriet
*punct* ,
never
*punct* !
*break*
she
looked
back
as
well
as
she
could
*punct* ;
but
it
was
all
confusion
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
taken
up
the
idea
*punct* ,
she
supposed
*punct* ,
and
made
every
thing
bend
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
his
manners
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
must
have
been
unmarked
*punct* ,
wavering
*punct* ,
dubious
*punct* ,
or
she
could
not
have
been
so
misled
*punct* .
*break*
the
picture!
*punct* ,
how
eager
he
had
been
about
the
picture!
*punct* ,
and
the
charade!
*punct* ,
and
an
hundred
other
circumstances;
*punct* ,
how
clearly
they
had
seemed
to
point
at
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
sure
*punct* ,
the
charade
*punct* ,
with
its
ready
wit
*punct* ,
but
then
the
soft
eyes
*punct* ,
in
fact
it
suited
neither
*punct* ;
it
was
a
jumble
without
taste
or
truth
*punct* .
*break*
who
could
have
seen
through
such
thick-headed
nonsense
*punct* ?
*break*
certainly
she
had
often
*punct* ,
especially
of
late
*punct* ,
thought
his
manners
to
herself
unnecessarily
gallant
*punct* ;
but
it
had
passed
as
his
way
*punct* ,
as
a
mere
error
of
judgment
*punct* ,
of
knowledge
*punct* ,
of
taste
*punct* ,
as
one
proof
among
others
that
he
had
not
always
lived
in
the
best
society
*punct* ,
that
with
all
the
gentleness
of
his
address
*punct* ,
true
elegance
was
sometimes
wanting
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
till
this
very
day
*punct* ,
she
had
never
*punct* ,
for
an
instant
*punct* ,
suspected
it
to
mean
any
thing
but
grateful
respect
to
her
as
harriet's
friend
*punct* .
*break*
to
mr.
john
knightley
was
she
indebted
for
her
first
idea
on
the
subject
*punct* ,
for
the
first
start
of
its
possibility
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
denying
that
those
brothers
had
penetration
*punct* .
*break*
she
remembered
what
mr.
knightley
had
once
said
to
her
about
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
the
caution
he
had
given
*punct* ,
the
conviction
he
had
professed
that
mr.
elton
would
never
marry
indiscreetly
*punct* ;
and
blushed
to
think
how
much
truer
a
knowledge
of
his
character
had
been
there
shewn
than
any
she
had
reached
herself
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
dreadfully
mortifying
*punct* ;
but
mr.
elton
was
proving
himself
*punct* ,
in
many
respects
*punct* ,
the
very
reverse
of
what
she
had
meant
and
believed
him
*punct* ;
proud
*punct* ,
assuming
*punct* ,
conceited
*punct* ;
very
full
of
his
own
claims
*punct* ,
and
little
concerned
about
the
feelings
of
others
*punct* .
*break*
contrary
to
the
usual
course
of
things
*punct* ,
mr.
elton's
wanting
to
pay
his
addresses
to
her
had
sunk
him
in
her
opinion
*punct* .
*break*
his
professions
and
his
proposals
did
him
no
service
*punct* .
*break*
she
thought
nothing
of
his
attachment
*punct* ,
and
was
insulted
by
his
hopes
*punct* .
*break*
he
wanted
to
marry
well
*punct* ,
and
having
the
arrogance
to
raise
his
eyes
to
her
*punct* ,
pretended
to
be
in
love
*punct* ;
but
she
was
perfectly
easy
as
to
his
not
suffering
any
disappointment
that
need
be
cared
for
*punct* .
*break*
there
had
been
no
real
affection
either
in
his
language
or
manners
*punct* .
*break*
sighs
and
fine
words
had
been
given
in
abundance
*punct* ;
but
she
could
hardly
devise
any
set
of
expressions
*punct* ,
or
fancy
any
tone
of
voice
*punct* ,
less
allied
with
real
love
*punct* .
*break*
she
need
not
trouble
herself
to
pity
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
only
wanted
to
aggrandise
and
enrich
himself
*punct* ;
and
if
miss
woodhouse
of
hartfield
*punct* ,
the
heiress
of
thirty
thousand
pounds
*punct* ,
were
not
quite
so
easily
obtained
as
he
had
fancied
*punct* ,
he
would
soon
try
for
miss
somebody
else
with
twenty
*punct* ,
or
with
ten
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
that
he
should
talk
of
encouragement
*punct* ,
should
consider
her
as
aware
of
his
views
*punct* ,
accepting
his
attentions
*punct* ,
meaning
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
to
marry
him!
*punct* ,
should
suppose
himself
her
equal
in
connexion
or
mind!
*punct* ,
look
down
upon
her
friend
*punct* ,
so
well
understanding
the
gradations
of
rank
below
him
*punct* ,
and
be
so
blind
to
what
rose
above
*punct* ,
as
to
fancy
himself
shewing
no
presumption
in
addressing
her!
*punct* ,
it
was
most
provoking
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
it
was
not
fair
to
expect
him
to
feel
how
very
much
he
was
her
inferior
in
talent
*punct* ,
and
all
the
elegancies
of
mind
*punct* .
*break*
the
very
want
of
such
equality
might
prevent
his
perception
of
it
*punct* ;
but
he
must
know
that
in
fortune
and
consequence
she
was
greatly
his
superior
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
know
that
the
woodhouses
had
been
settled
for
several
generations
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
the
younger
branch
of
a
very
ancient
family
*punct* ,
and
that
the
eltons
were
nobody
*punct* .
*break*
the
landed
property
of
hartfield
certainly
was
inconsiderable
*punct* ,
being
but
a
sort
of
notch
in
the
donwell
abbey
estate
*punct* ,
to
which
all
the
rest
of
highbury
belonged
*punct* ;
but
their
fortune
*punct* ,
from
other
sources
*punct* ,
was
such
as
to
make
them
scarcely
secondary
to
donwell
abbey
itself
*punct* ,
in
every
other
kind
of
consequence
*punct* ;
and
the
woodhouses
had
long
held
a
high
place
in
the
consideration
of
the
neighbourhood
which
mr.
elton
had
first
entered
not
two
years
ago
*punct* ,
to
make
his
way
as
he
could
*punct* ,
without
any
alliances
but
in
trade
*punct* ,
or
any
thing
to
recommend
him
to
notice
but
his
situation
and
his
civility.
*punct* ,
but
he
had
fancied
her
in
love
with
him
*punct* ;
that
evidently
must
have
been
his
dependence
*punct* ;
and
after
raving
a
little
about
the
seeming
incongruity
of
gentle
manners
and
a
conceited
head
*punct* ,
emma
was
obliged
in
common
honesty
to
stop
and
admit
that
her
own
behaviour
to
him
had
been
so
complaisant
and
obliging
*punct* ,
so
full
of
courtesy
and
attention
*punct* ,
as
*punct* ,
supposing
her
real
motive
unperceived
*punct* ,
might
warrant
a
man
of
ordinary
observation
and
delicacy
*punct* ,
like
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
in
fancying
himself
a
very
decided
favourite
*punct* .
*break*
if
she
had
so
misinterpreted
his
feelings
*punct* ,
she
had
little
right
to
wonder
that
he
*punct* ,
with
self-interest
to
blind
him
*punct* ,
should
have
mistaken
hers
*punct* .
*break*
the
first
error
and
the
worst
lay
at
her
door
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
foolish
*punct* ,
it
was
wrong
*punct* ,
to
take
so
active
a
part
in
bringing
any
two
people
together
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
adventuring
too
far
*punct* ,
assuming
too
much
*punct* ,
making
light
of
what
ought
to
be
serious
*punct* ,
a
trick
of
what
ought
to
be
simple
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
quite
concerned
and
ashamed
*punct* ,
and
resolved
to
do
such
things
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
here
have
i
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
actually
talked
poor
harriet
into
being
very
much
attached
to
this
man
*punct* .
*break*
she
might
never
have
thought
of
him
but
for
me
*punct* ;
and
certainly
never
would
have
thought
of
him
with
hope
*punct* ,
if
i
had
not
assured
her
of
his
attachment
*punct* ,
for
she
is
as
modest
and
humble
as
i
used
to
think
him
*punct* .
*break*
that
i
had
been
satisfied
with
persuading
her
not
to
accept
young
martin
*punct* .
*break*
there
i
was
quite
right
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
well
done
of
me
*punct* ;
but
there
i
should
have
stopped
*punct* ,
and
left
the
rest
to
time
and
chance
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
introducing
her
into
good
company
*punct* ,
and
giving
her
the
opportunity
of
pleasing
some
one
worth
having
*punct* ;
i
ought
not
to
have
attempted
more
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
*punct* ,
poor
girl
*punct* ,
her
peace
is
cut
up
for
some
time
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
been
but
half
a
friend
to
her
*punct* ;
and
if
she
were
not
to
feel
this
disappointment
so
very
much
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
i
have
not
an
idea
of
any
body
else
who
would
be
at
all
desirable
for
her;
*punct* ,
william
coxe
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
could
not
endure
william
coxe
*punct* ,
a
pert
young
lawyer
*punct* .
*break*
she
stopt
to
blush
and
laugh
at
her
own
relapse
*punct* ,
and
then
resumed
a
more
serious
*punct* ,
more
dispiriting
cogitation
upon
what
had
been
*punct* ,
and
might
be
*punct* ,
and
must
be
*punct* .
*break*
the
distressing
explanation
she
had
to
make
to
harriet
*punct* ,
and
all
that
poor
harriet
would
be
suffering
*punct* ,
with
the
awkwardness
of
future
meetings
*punct* ,
the
difficulties
of
continuing
or
discontinuing
the
acquaintance
*punct* ,
of
subduing
feelings
*punct* ,
concealing
resentment
*punct* ,
and
avoiding
eclat
*punct* ,
were
enough
to
occupy
her
in
most
unmirthful
reflections
some
time
longer
*punct* ,
and
she
went
to
bed
at
last
with
nothing
settled
but
the
conviction
of
her
having
blundered
most
dreadfully
*punct* .
*break*
to
youth
and
natural
cheerfulness
like
emma's
*punct* ,
though
under
temporary
gloom
at
night
*punct* ,
the
return
of
day
will
hardly
fail
to
bring
return
of
spirits
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
and
cheerfulness
of
morning
are
in
happy
analogy
*punct* ,
and
of
powerful
operation
*punct* ;
and
if
the
distress
be
not
poignant
enough
to
keep
the
eyes
unclosed
*punct* ,
they
will
be
sure
to
open
to
sensations
of
softened
pain
and
brighter
hope
*punct* .
*break*
emma
got
up
on
the
morrow
more
disposed
for
comfort
than
she
had
gone
to
bed
*punct* ,
more
ready
to
see
alleviations
of
the
evil
before
her
*punct* ,
and
to
depend
on
getting
tolerably
out
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
great
consolation
that
mr.
elton
should
not
be
really
in
love
with
her
*punct* ,
or
so
particularly
amiable
as
to
make
it
shocking
to
disappoint
him
*punct* ,
that
harriet's
nature
should
not
be
of
that
superior
sort
in
which
the
feelings
are
most
acute
and
retentive
*punct* ,
and
that
there
could
be
no
necessity
for
any
body's
knowing
what
had
passed
except
the
three
principals
*punct* ,
and
especially
for
her
father's
being
given
a
moment's
uneasiness
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
these
were
very
cheering
thoughts
*punct* ;
and
the
sight
of
a
great
deal
of
snow
on
the
ground
did
her
further
service
*punct* ,
for
any
thing
was
welcome
that
might
justify
their
all
three
being
quite
asunder
at
present
*punct* .
*break*
the
weather
was
most
favourable
for
her
*punct* ;
though
christmas
day
*punct* ,
she
could
not
go
to
church
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
would
have
been
miserable
had
his
daughter
attempted
it
*punct* ,
and
she
was
therefore
safe
from
either
exciting
or
receiving
unpleasant
and
most
unsuitable
ideas
*punct* .
*break*
the
ground
covered
with
snow
*punct* ,
and
the
atmosphere
in
that
unsettled
state
between
frost
and
thaw
*punct* ,
which
is
of
all
others
the
most
unfriendly
for
exercise
*punct* ,
every
morning
beginning
in
rain
or
snow
*punct* ,
and
every
evening
setting
in
to
freeze
*punct* ,
she
was
for
many
days
a
most
honourable
prisoner
*punct* .
*break*
no
intercourse
with
harriet
possible
but
by
note
*punct* ;
no
church
for
her
on
sunday
any
more
than
on
christmas
day
*punct* ;
and
no
need
to
find
excuses
for
mr.
elton's
absenting
himself
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
weather
which
might
fairly
confine
every
body
at
home
*punct* ;
and
though
she
hoped
and
believed
him
to
be
really
taking
comfort
in
some
society
or
other
*punct* ,
it
was
very
pleasant
to
have
her
father
so
well
satisfied
with
his
being
all
alone
in
his
own
house
*punct* ,
too
wise
to
stir
out
*punct* ;
and
to
hear
him
say
to
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
whom
no
weather
could
keep
entirely
from
them,
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
why
do
not
you
stay
at
home
like
poor
mr.
elton
*punct* ?
*break*
these
days
of
confinement
would
have
been
*punct* ,
but
for
her
private
perplexities
*punct* ,
remarkably
comfortable
*punct* ,
as
such
seclusion
exactly
suited
her
brother
*punct* ,
whose
feelings
must
always
be
of
great
importance
to
his
companions
*punct* ;
and
he
had
*punct* ,
besides
*punct* ,
so
thoroughly
cleared
off
his
ill-humour
at
randalls
*punct* ,
that
his
amiableness
never
failed
him
during
the
rest
of
his
stay
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
always
agreeable
and
obliging
*punct* ,
and
speaking
pleasantly
of
every
body
*punct* .
*break*
but
with
all
the
hopes
of
cheerfulness
*punct* ,
and
all
the
present
comfort
of
delay
*punct* ,
there
was
still
such
an
evil
hanging
over
her
in
the
hour
of
explanation
with
harriet
*punct* ,
as
made
it
impossible
for
emma
to
be
ever
perfectly
at
ease
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
and
mrs.
john
knightley
were
not
detained
long
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
the
weather
soon
improved
enough
for
those
to
move
who
must
move
*punct* ;
and
mr.
woodhouse
having
*punct* ,
as
usual
*punct* ,
tried
to
persuade
his
daughter
to
stay
behind
with
all
her
children
*punct* ,
was
obliged
to
see
the
whole
party
set
off
*punct* ,
and
return
to
his
lamentations
over
the
destiny
of
poor
isabella;
*punct* ,
which
poor
isabella
*punct* ,
passing
her
life
with
those
she
doated
on
*punct* ,
full
of
their
merits
*punct* ,
blind
to
their
faults
*punct* ,
and
always
innocently
busy
*punct* ,
might
have
been
a
model
of
right
feminine
happiness
*punct* .
*break*
the
evening
of
the
very
day
on
which
they
went
brought
a
note
from
mr.
elton
to
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
a
long
*punct* ,
civil
*punct* ,
ceremonious
note
*punct* ,
to
say
*punct* ,
with
mr.
elton's
best
compliments
*punct* ,
that
he
was
proposing
to
leave
highbury
the
following
morning
in
his
way
to
bath
*punct* ;
where
*punct* ,
in
compliance
with
the
pressing
entreaties
of
some
friends
*punct* ,
he
had
engaged
to
spend
a
few
weeks
*punct* ,
and
very
much
regretted
the
impossibility
he
was
under
*punct* ,
from
various
circumstances
of
weather
and
business
*punct* ,
of
taking
a
personal
leave
of
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
of
whose
friendly
civilities
he
should
ever
retain
a
grateful
sense
*punct* ,
and
had
mr.
woodhouse
any
commands
*punct* ,
should
be
happy
to
attend
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
most
agreeably
surprized.
*punct* ,
mr.
elton's
absence
just
at
this
time
was
the
very
thing
to
be
desired
*punct* .
*break*
she
admired
him
for
contriving
it
*punct* ,
though
not
able
to
give
him
much
credit
for
the
manner
in
which
it
was
announced
*punct* .
*break*
resentment
could
not
have
been
more
plainly
spoken
than
in
a
civility
to
her
father
*punct* ,
from
which
she
was
so
pointedly
excluded
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
not
even
a
share
in
his
opening
compliments.
*punct* ,
her
name
was
not
mentioned;
*punct* ,
and
there
was
so
striking
a
change
in
all
this
*punct* ,
and
such
an
ill-judged
solemnity
of
leave-taking
in
his
graceful
acknowledgments
*punct* ,
as
she
thought
*punct* ,
at
first
*punct* ,
could
not
escape
her
father's
suspicion
*punct* .
*break*
it
did
*punct* ,
however.
*punct* ,
her
father
was
quite
taken
up
with
the
surprize
of
so
sudden
a
journey
*punct* ,
and
his
fears
that
mr.
elton
might
never
get
safely
to
the
end
of
it
*punct* ,
and
saw
nothing
extraordinary
in
his
language
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
very
useful
note
*punct* ,
for
it
supplied
them
with
fresh
matter
for
thought
and
conversation
during
the
rest
of
their
lonely
evening
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
talked
over
his
alarms
*punct* ,
and
emma
was
in
spirits
to
persuade
them
away
with
all
her
usual
promptitude
*punct* .
*break*
she
now
resolved
to
keep
harriet
no
longer
in
the
dark
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
reason
to
believe
her
nearly
recovered
from
her
cold
*punct* ,
and
it
was
desirable
that
she
should
have
as
much
time
as
possible
for
getting
the
better
of
her
other
complaint
before
the
gentleman's
return
*punct* .
*break*
she
went
to
mrs.
goddard's
accordingly
the
very
next
day
*punct* ,
to
undergo
the
necessary
penance
of
communication
*punct* ;
and
a
severe
one
it
was.
*punct* ,
she
had
to
destroy
all
the
hopes
which
she
had
been
so
industriously
feeding
*punct* ,
to
appear
in
the
ungracious
character
of
the
one
preferred
*punct* ,
and
acknowledge
herself
grossly
mistaken
and
mis-judging
in
all
her
ideas
on
one
subject
*punct* ,
all
her
observations
*punct* ,
all
her
convictions
*punct* ,
all
her
prophecies
for
the
last
six
weeks
*punct* .
*break*
the
confession
completely
renewed
her
first
shame
*punct* ,
and
the
sight
of
harriet's
tears
made
her
think
that
she
should
never
be
in
charity
with
herself
again
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
bore
the
intelligence
very
well
*punct* ,
blaming
nobody
*punct* ,
and
in
every
thing
testifying
such
an
ingenuousness
of
disposition
and
lowly
opinion
of
herself
*punct* ,
as
must
appear
with
particular
advantage
at
that
moment
to
her
friend
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
in
the
humour
to
value
simplicity
and
modesty
to
the
utmost
*punct* ;
and
all
that
was
amiable
*punct* ,
all
that
ought
to
be
attaching
*punct* ,
seemed
on
harriet's
side
*punct* ,
not
her
own
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
did
not
consider
herself
as
having
any
thing
to
complain
of
*punct* .
*break*
the
affection
of
such
a
man
as
mr.
elton
would
have
been
too
great
a
distinction.
*punct* ,
she
never
could
have
deserved
him
*punct* ,
and
nobody
but
so
partial
and
kind
a
friend
as
miss
woodhouse
would
have
thought
it
possible
*punct* .
*break*
her
tears
fell
abundantly
*punct* ,
but
her
grief
was
so
truly
artless
*punct* ,
that
no
dignity
could
have
made
it
more
respectable
in
emma's
eyes
*punct* ,
and
she
listened
to
her
and
tried
to
console
her
with
all
her
heart
and
understanding
*punct* ,
really
for
the
time
convinced
that
harriet
was
the
superior
creature
of
the
two
*punct* ,
and
that
to
resemble
her
would
be
more
for
her
own
welfare
and
happiness
than
all
that
genius
or
intelligence
could
do
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
rather
too
late
in
the
day
to
set
about
being
simple-minded
and
ignorant
*punct* ;
but
she
left
her
with
every
previous
resolution
confirmed
of
being
humble
and
discreet
*punct* ,
and
repressing
imagination
all
the
rest
of
her
life
*punct* .
*break*
her
second
duty
now
*punct* ,
inferior
only
to
her
father's
claims
*punct* ,
was
to
promote
harriet's
comfort
*punct* ,
and
endeavour
to
prove
her
own
affection
in
some
better
method
than
by
match-making
*punct* .
*break*
she
got
her
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
and
shewed
her
the
most
unvarying
kindness
*punct* ,
striving
to
occupy
and
amuse
her
*punct* ,
and
by
books
and
conversation
*punct* ,
to
drive
mr.
elton
from
her
thoughts
*punct* .
*break*
time
*punct* ,
she
knew
*punct* ,
must
be
allowed
for
this
being
thoroughly
done
*punct* ;
and
she
could
suppose
herself
but
an
indifferent
judge
of
such
matters
in
general
*punct* ,
and
very
inadequate
to
sympathise
in
an
attachment
to
mr.
elton
in
particular
*punct* ;
but
it
seemed
to
her
reasonable
that
at
harriet's
age
*punct* ,
and
with
the
entire
extinction
of
all
hope
*punct* ,
such
a
progress
might
be
made
towards
a
state
of
composure
by
the
time
of
mr.
elton's
return
*punct* ,
as
to
allow
them
all
to
meet
again
in
the
common
routine
of
acquaintance
*punct* ,
without
any
danger
of
betraying
sentiments
or
increasing
them
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
did
think
him
all
perfection
*punct* ,
and
maintained
the
non-existence
of
any
body
equal
to
him
in
person
or
goodness
*punct* ,
and
did
*punct* ,
in
truth
*punct* ,
prove
herself
more
resolutely
in
love
than
emma
had
foreseen
*punct* ;
but
yet
it
appeared
to
her
so
natural
*punct* ,
so
inevitable
to
strive
against
an
inclination
of
that
sort
unrequited
*punct* ,
that
she
could
not
comprehend
its
continuing
very
long
in
equal
force
*punct* .
*break*
if
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
on
his
return
*punct* ,
made
his
own
indifference
as
evident
and
indubitable
as
she
could
not
doubt
he
would
anxiously
do
*punct* ,
she
could
not
imagine
harriet's
persisting
to
place
her
happiness
in
the
sight
or
the
recollection
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
their
being
fixed
*punct* ,
so
absolutely
fixed
*punct* ,
in
the
same
place
*punct* ,
was
bad
for
each
*punct* ,
for
all
three
*punct* .
*break*
not
one
of
them
had
the
power
of
removal
*punct* ,
or
of
effecting
any
material
change
of
society
*punct* .
*break*
they
must
encounter
each
other
*punct* ,
and
make
the
best
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
was
farther
unfortunate
in
the
tone
of
her
companions
at
mrs.
goddard's
*punct* ;
mr.
elton
being
the
adoration
of
all
the
teachers
and
great
girls
in
the
school
*punct* ;
and
it
must
be
at
hartfield
only
that
she
could
have
any
chance
of
hearing
him
spoken
of
with
cooling
moderation
or
repellent
truth
*punct* .
*break*
where
the
wound
had
been
given
*punct* ,
there
must
the
cure
be
found
if
anywhere
*punct* ;
and
emma
felt
that
*punct* ,
till
she
saw
her
in
the
way
of
cure
*punct* ,
there
could
be
no
true
peace
for
herself
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
frank
churchill
did
not
come
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
time
proposed
drew
near
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston's
fears
were
justified
in
the
arrival
of
a
letter
of
excuse
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
present
*punct* ,
he
could
not
be
spared
*punct* ,
to
his
very
great
mortification
and
regret
*punct* ;
but
still
he
looked
forward
with
the
hope
of
coming
to
randalls
at
no
distant
period
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
was
exceedingly
disappointed
*punct* ,
much
more
disappointed
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
than
her
husband
*punct* ,
though
her
dependence
on
seeing
the
young
man
had
been
so
much
more
sober
*punct* :
but
a
sanguine
temper
*punct* ,
though
for
ever
expecting
more
good
than
occurs
*punct* ,
does
not
always
pay
for
its
hopes
by
any
proportionate
depression
*punct* .
*break*
it
soon
flies
over
the
present
failure
*punct* ,
and
begins
to
hope
again
*punct* .
*break*
for
half
an
hour
mr.
weston
was
surprized
and
sorry
*punct* ;
but
then
he
began
to
perceive
that
frank's
coming
two
or
three
months
later
would
be
a
much
better
plan
*punct* ;
better
time
of
year
*punct* ;
better
weather
*punct* ;
and
that
he
would
be
able
*punct* ,
without
any
doubt
*punct* ,
to
stay
considerably
longer
with
them
than
if
he
had
come
sooner
*punct* .
*break*
these
feelings
rapidly
restored
his
comfort
*punct* ,
while
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
of
a
more
apprehensive
disposition
*punct* ,
foresaw
nothing
but
a
repetition
of
excuses
and
delays
*punct* ;
and
after
all
her
concern
for
what
her
husband
was
to
suffer
*punct* ,
suffered
a
great
deal
more
herself
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
not
at
this
time
in
a
state
of
spirits
to
care
really
about
mr.
frank
churchill's
not
coming
*punct* ,
except
as
a
disappointment
at
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
the
acquaintance
at
present
had
no
charm
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
wanted
*punct* ,
rather
*punct* ,
to
be
quiet
*punct* ,
and
out
of
temptation
*punct* ;
but
still
*punct* ,
as
it
was
desirable
that
she
should
appear
*punct* ,
in
general
*punct* ,
like
her
usual
self
*punct* ,
she
took
care
to
express
as
much
interest
in
the
circumstance
*punct* ,
and
enter
as
warmly
into
mr.
and
mrs.
weston's
disappointment
*punct* ,
as
might
naturally
belong
to
their
friendship
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
the
first
to
announce
it
to
mr.
knightley
*punct* ;
and
exclaimed
quite
as
much
as
was
necessary
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
being
acting
a
part
*punct* ,
perhaps
rather
more,
*punct* ,
at
the
conduct
of
the
churchills
*punct* ,
in
keeping
him
away
*punct* .
*break*
she
then
proceeded
to
say
a
good
deal
more
than
she
felt
*punct* ,
of
the
advantage
of
such
an
addition
to
their
confined
society
in
surry
*punct* ;
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
somebody
new
*punct* ;
the
gala-day
to
highbury
entire
*punct* ,
which
the
sight
of
him
would
have
made
*punct* ;
and
ending
with
reflections
on
the
churchills
again
*punct* ,
found
herself
directly
involved
in
a
disagreement
with
mr.
knightley
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
to
her
great
amusement
*punct* ,
perceived
that
she
was
taking
the
other
side
of
the
question
from
her
real
opinion
*punct* ,
and
making
use
of
mrs.
weston's
arguments
against
herself
*punct* .
*break*
the
churchills
are
very
likely
in
fault
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
coolly
*punct* ;
but
i
dare
say
he
might
come
if
he
would
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
why
you
should
say
so
*punct* .
*break*
he
wishes
exceedingly
to
come
*punct* ;
but
his
uncle
and
aunt
will
not
spare
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
believe
that
he
has
not
the
power
of
coming
*punct* ,
if
he
made
a
point
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
too
unlikely
*punct* ,
for
me
to
believe
it
without
proof
*punct* .
*break*
how
odd
you
are
*punct* !
*break*
what
has
mr.
frank
churchill
done
*punct* ,
to
make
you
suppose
him
such
an
unnatural
creature
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
not
supposing
him
at
all
an
unnatural
creature
*punct* ,
in
suspecting
that
he
may
have
learnt
to
be
above
his
connexions
*punct* ,
and
to
care
very
little
for
any
thing
but
his
own
pleasure
*punct* ,
from
living
with
those
who
have
always
set
him
the
example
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
great
deal
more
natural
than
one
could
wish
*punct* ,
that
a
young
man
*punct* ,
brought
up
by
those
who
are
proud
*punct* ,
luxurious
*punct* ,
and
selfish
*punct* ,
should
be
proud
*punct* ,
luxurious
*punct* ,
and
selfish
too
*punct* .
*break*
if
frank
churchill
had
wanted
to
see
his
father
*punct* ,
he
would
have
contrived
it
between
september
and
january
*punct* .
*break*
a
man
at
his
age
*punct* ,
what
is
he?
*punct* ,
three
or
four-and-twenty
*punct* ,
cannot
be
without
the
means
of
doing
as
much
as
that
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
that's
easily
said
*punct* ,
and
easily
felt
by
you
*punct* ,
who
have
always
been
your
own
master
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
the
worst
judge
in
the
world
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
of
the
difficulties
of
dependence
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
to
have
tempers
to
manage
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
to
be
conceived
that
a
man
of
three
or
four-and-twenty
should
not
have
liberty
of
mind
or
limb
to
that
amount
*punct* .
*break*
he
cannot
want
money
*punct* ,
he
cannot
want
leisure
*punct* .
*break*
we
know
*punct* ,
on
the
contrary
*punct* ,
that
he
has
so
much
of
both
*punct* ,
that
he
is
glad
to
get
rid
of
them
at
the
idlest
haunts
in
the
kingdom
*punct* .
*break*
we
hear
of
him
for
ever
at
some
watering-place
or
other
*punct* .
*break*
a
little
while
ago
*punct* ,
he
was
at
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
this
proves
that
he
can
leave
the
churchills
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sometimes
he
can
*punct* .
*break*
and
those
times
are
whenever
he
thinks
it
worth
his
while
*punct* ;
whenever
there
is
any
temptation
of
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
very
unfair
to
judge
of
any
body's
conduct
*punct* ,
without
an
intimate
knowledge
of
their
situation
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
*punct* ,
who
has
not
been
in
the
interior
of
a
family
*punct* ,
can
say
what
the
difficulties
of
any
individual
of
that
family
may
be
*punct* .
*break*
we
ought
to
be
acquainted
with
enscombe
*punct* ,
and
with
mrs.
churchill's
temper
*punct* ,
before
we
pretend
to
decide
upon
what
her
nephew
can
do
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
*punct* ,
at
times
*punct* ,
be
able
to
do
a
great
deal
more
than
he
can
at
others
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
one
thing
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
which
a
man
can
always
do
*punct* ,
if
he
chuses
*punct* ,
and
that
is
*punct* ,
his
duty
*punct* ;
not
by
manoeuvring
and
finessing
*punct* ,
but
by
vigour
and
resolution
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
frank
churchill's
duty
to
pay
this
attention
to
his
father
*punct* .
*break*
he
knows
it
to
be
so
*punct* ,
by
his
promises
and
messages
*punct* ;
but
if
he
wished
to
do
it
*punct* ,
it
might
be
done
*punct* .
*break*
a
man
who
felt
rightly
would
say
at
once
*punct* ,
simply
and
resolutely
*punct* ,
to
mrs.
churchill
*punct* ,
every
sacrifice
of
mere
pleasure
you
will
always
find
me
ready
to
make
to
your
convenience
*punct* ;
but
i
must
go
and
see
my
father
immediately
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
he
would
be
hurt
by
my
failing
in
such
a
mark
of
respect
to
him
on
the
present
occasion
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
set
off
to-morrow.'
*punct* ,
if
he
would
say
so
to
her
at
once
*punct* ,
in
the
tone
of
decision
becoming
a
man
*punct* ,
there
would
be
no
opposition
made
to
his
going
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
laughing
*punct* ;
but
perhaps
there
might
be
some
made
to
his
coming
back
again
*punct* .
*break*
such
language
for
a
young
man
entirely
dependent
*punct* ,
to
use!
*punct* ,
nobody
but
you
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
would
imagine
it
possible
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
have
not
an
idea
of
what
is
requisite
in
situations
directly
opposite
to
your
own
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
frank
churchill
to
be
making
such
a
speech
as
that
to
the
uncle
and
aunt
*punct* ,
who
have
brought
him
up
*punct* ,
and
are
to
provide
for
him!
*punct* ,
standing
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
and
speaking
as
loud
as
he
could!
*punct* ,
how
can
you
imagine
such
conduct
practicable
*punct* ?
*break*
depend
upon
it
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
a
sensible
man
would
find
no
difficulty
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
feel
himself
in
the
right
*punct* ;
and
the
declaration
*punct* ,
made
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
as
a
man
of
sense
would
make
it
*punct* ,
in
a
proper
manner
*punct* ,
would
do
him
more
good
*punct* ,
raise
him
higher
*punct* ,
fix
his
interest
stronger
with
the
people
he
depended
on
*punct* ,
than
all
that
a
line
of
shifts
and
expedients
can
ever
do
*punct* .
*break*
respect
would
be
added
to
affection
*punct* .
*break*
they
would
feel
that
they
could
trust
him
*punct* ;
that
the
nephew
who
had
done
rightly
by
his
father
*punct* ,
would
do
rightly
by
them
*punct* ;
for
they
know
*punct* ,
as
well
as
he
does
*punct* ,
as
well
as
all
the
world
must
know
*punct* ,
that
he
ought
to
pay
this
visit
to
his
father
*punct* ;
and
while
meanly
exerting
their
power
to
delay
it
*punct* ,
are
in
their
hearts
not
thinking
the
better
of
him
for
submitting
to
their
whims
*punct* .
*break*
respect
for
right
conduct
is
felt
by
every
body
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
would
act
in
this
sort
of
manner
*punct* ,
on
principle
*punct* ,
consistently
*punct* ,
regularly
*punct* ,
their
little
minds
would
bend
to
his
*punct* .
*break*
i
rather
doubt
that
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
very
fond
of
bending
little
minds
*punct* ;
but
where
little
minds
belong
to
rich
people
in
authority
*punct* ,
i
think
they
have
a
knack
of
swelling
out
*punct* ,
till
they
are
quite
as
unmanageable
as
great
ones
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
imagine
*punct* ,
that
if
you
*punct* ,
as
you
are
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
were
to
be
transported
and
placed
all
at
once
in
mr.
frank
churchill's
situation
*punct* ,
you
would
be
able
to
say
and
do
just
what
you
have
been
recommending
for
him
*punct* ;
and
it
might
have
a
very
good
effect
*punct* .
*break*
the
churchills
might
not
have
a
word
to
say
in
return
*punct* ;
but
then
*punct* ,
you
would
have
no
habits
of
early
obedience
and
long
observance
to
break
through
*punct* .
*break*
to
him
who
has
*punct* ,
it
might
not
be
so
easy
to
burst
forth
at
once
into
perfect
independence
*punct* ,
and
set
all
their
claims
on
his
gratitude
and
regard
at
nought
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
have
as
strong
a
sense
of
what
would
be
right
*punct* ,
as
you
can
have
*punct* ,
without
being
so
equal
*punct* ,
under
particular
circumstances
*punct* ,
to
act
up
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
then
it
would
not
be
so
strong
a
sense
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
failed
to
produce
equal
exertion
*punct* ,
it
could
not
be
an
equal
conviction
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
the
difference
of
situation
and
habit
*punct* !
*break*
i
wish
you
would
try
to
understand
what
an
amiable
young
man
may
be
likely
to
feel
in
directly
opposing
those
*punct* ,
whom
as
child
and
boy
he
has
been
looking
up
to
all
his
life
*punct* .
*break*
our
amiable
young
man
is
a
very
weak
young
man
*punct* ,
if
this
be
the
first
occasion
of
his
carrying
through
a
resolution
to
do
right
against
the
will
of
others
*punct* .
*break*
it
ought
to
have
been
a
habit
with
him
by
this
time
*punct* ,
of
following
his
duty
*punct* ,
instead
of
consulting
expediency
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
allow
for
the
fears
of
the
child
*punct* ,
but
not
of
the
man
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
became
rational
*punct* ,
he
ought
to
have
roused
himself
and
shaken
off
all
that
was
unworthy
in
their
authority
*punct* .
*break*
he
ought
to
have
opposed
the
first
attempt
on
their
side
to
make
him
slight
his
father
*punct* .
*break*
had
he
begun
as
he
ought
*punct* ,
there
would
have
been
no
difficulty
now
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
never
agree
about
him
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* ;
but
that
is
nothing
extraordinary
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
not
the
least
idea
of
his
being
a
weak
young
man
*punct* :
i
feel
sure
that
he
is
not
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
would
not
be
blind
to
folly
*punct* ,
though
in
his
own
son
*punct* ;
but
he
is
very
likely
to
have
a
more
yielding
*punct* ,
complying
*punct* ,
mild
disposition
than
would
suit
your
notions
of
man's
perfection
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
he
has
*punct* ;
and
though
it
may
cut
him
off
from
some
advantages
*punct* ,
it
will
secure
him
many
others
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ;
all
the
advantages
of
sitting
still
when
he
ought
to
move
*punct* ,
and
of
leading
a
life
of
mere
idle
pleasure
*punct* ,
and
fancying
himself
extremely
expert
in
finding
excuses
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
can
sit
down
and
write
a
fine
flourishing
letter
*punct* ,
full
of
professions
and
falsehoods
*punct* ,
and
persuade
himself
that
he
has
hit
upon
the
very
best
method
in
the
world
of
preserving
peace
at
home
and
preventing
his
father's
having
any
right
to
complain
*punct* .
*break*
his
letters
disgust
me
*punct* .
*break*
your
feelings
are
singular
*punct* .
*break*
they
seem
to
satisfy
every
body
else
*punct* .
*break*
i
suspect
they
do
not
satisfy
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
they
hardly
can
satisfy
a
woman
of
her
good
sense
and
quick
feelings
*punct* :
standing
in
a
mother's
place
*punct* ,
but
without
a
mother's
affection
to
blind
her
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
on
her
account
that
attention
to
randalls
is
doubly
due
*punct* ,
and
she
must
doubly
feel
the
omission
*punct* .
*break*
had
she
been
a
person
of
consequence
herself
*punct* ,
he
would
have
come
i
dare
say
*punct* ;
and
it
would
not
have
signified
whether
he
did
or
no
*punct* .
*break*
can
you
think
your
friend
behindhand
in
these
sort
of
considerations
*punct* ?
*break*
do
you
suppose
she
does
not
often
say
all
this
to
herself
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
your
amiable
young
man
can
be
amiable
only
in
french
*punct* ,
not
in
english
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
be
very
aimable
*punct* ,
have
very
good
manners
*punct* ,
and
be
very
agreeable
*punct* ;
but
he
can
have
no
english
delicacy
towards
the
feelings
of
other
people
*punct* :
nothing
really
amiable
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
you
seem
determined
to
think
ill
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
me!
*punct* ,
not
at
all
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
rather
displeased
*punct* ;
i
do
not
want
to
think
ill
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
be
as
ready
to
acknowledge
his
merits
as
any
other
man
*punct* ;
but
i
hear
of
none
*punct* ,
except
what
are
merely
personal
*punct* ;
that
he
is
well-grown
and
good-looking
*punct* ,
with
smooth
*punct* ,
plausible
manners
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
if
he
have
nothing
else
to
recommend
him
*punct* ,
he
will
be
a
treasure
at
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
we
do
not
often
look
upon
fine
young
men
*punct* ,
well-bred
and
agreeable
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
not
be
nice
and
ask
for
all
the
virtues
into
the
bargain
*punct* .
*break*
cannot
you
imagine
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
what
a
sensation
his
coming
will
produce
*punct* ?
*break*
there
will
be
but
one
subject
throughout
the
parishes
of
donwell
and
highbury
*punct* ;
but
one
interest
*punct* ,
one
object
of
curiosity
*punct* ;
it
will
be
all
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* ;
we
shall
think
and
speak
of
nobody
else
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
excuse
my
being
so
much
over-powered
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
find
him
conversable
*punct* ,
i
shall
be
glad
of
his
acquaintance
*punct* ;
but
if
he
is
only
a
chattering
coxcomb
*punct* ,
he
will
not
occupy
much
of
my
time
or
thoughts
*punct* .
*break*
my
idea
of
him
is
*punct* ,
that
he
can
adapt
his
conversation
to
the
taste
of
every
body
*punct* ,
and
has
the
power
as
well
as
the
wish
of
being
universally
agreeable
*punct* .
*break*
to
you
*punct* ,
he
will
talk
of
farming
*punct* ;
to
me
*punct* ,
of
drawing
or
music
*punct* ;
and
so
on
to
every
body
*punct* ,
having
that
general
information
on
all
subjects
which
will
enable
him
to
follow
the
lead
*punct* ,
or
take
the
lead
*punct* ,
just
as
propriety
may
require
*punct* ,
and
to
speak
extremely
well
on
each
*punct* ;
that
is
my
idea
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
mine
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
warmly
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
that
if
he
turn
out
any
thing
like
it
*punct* ,
he
will
be
the
most
insufferable
fellow
breathing
*punct* !
*break*
at
three-and-twenty
to
be
the
king
of
his
company
*punct* ,
the
great
man
*punct* ,
the
practised
politician
*punct* ,
who
is
to
read
every
body's
character
*punct* ,
and
make
every
body's
talents
conduce
to
the
display
of
his
own
superiority
*punct* ;
to
be
dispensing
his
flatteries
around
*punct* ,
that
he
may
make
all
appear
like
fools
compared
with
himself
*punct* !
*break*
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
your
own
good
sense
could
not
endure
such
a
puppy
when
it
came
to
the
point
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
say
no
more
about
him
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* ,
you
turn
every
thing
to
evil
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
both
prejudiced
*punct* ;
you
against
*punct* ,
i
for
him
*punct* ;
and
we
have
no
chance
of
agreeing
till
he
is
really
here
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
prejudiced
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
am
very
much
*punct* ,
and
without
being
at
all
ashamed
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
my
love
for
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
gives
me
a
decided
prejudice
in
his
favour
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
a
person
i
never
think
of
from
one
month's
end
to
another
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
with
a
degree
of
vexation
*punct* ,
which
made
emma
immediately
talk
of
something
else
*punct* ,
though
she
could
not
comprehend
why
he
should
be
angry
*punct* .
*break*
to
take
a
dislike
to
a
young
man
*punct* ,
only
because
he
appeared
to
be
of
a
different
disposition
from
himself
*punct* ,
was
unworthy
the
real
liberality
of
mind
which
she
was
always
used
to
acknowledge
in
him
*punct* ;
for
with
all
the
high
opinion
of
himself
*punct* ,
which
she
had
often
laid
to
his
charge
*punct* ,
she
had
never
before
for
a
moment
supposed
it
could
make
him
unjust
to
the
merit
of
another
*punct* .
*break*
emma
and
harriet
had
been
walking
together
one
morning
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
emma's
opinion
*punct* ,
had
been
talking
enough
of
mr.
elton
for
that
day
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
not
think
that
harriet's
solace
or
her
own
sins
required
more
*punct* ;
and
she
was
therefore
industriously
getting
rid
of
the
subject
as
they
returned;
*punct* ,
but
it
burst
out
again
when
she
thought
she
had
succeeded
*punct* ,
and
after
speaking
some
time
of
what
the
poor
must
suffer
in
winter
*punct* ,
and
receiving
no
other
answer
than
a
very
plaintive
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
is
so
good
to
the
poor
*punct* !
*break*
she
found
something
else
must
be
done
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
just
approaching
the
house
where
lived
mrs.
and
miss
bates
*punct* .
*break*
she
determined
to
call
upon
them
and
seek
safety
in
numbers
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
always
sufficient
reason
for
such
an
attention
*punct* ;
mrs.
and
miss
bates
loved
to
be
called
on
*punct* ,
and
she
knew
she
was
considered
by
the
very
few
who
presumed
ever
to
see
imperfection
in
her
*punct* ,
as
rather
negligent
in
that
respect
*punct* ,
and
as
not
contributing
what
she
ought
to
the
stock
of
their
scanty
comforts
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
had
many
a
hint
from
mr.
knightley
and
some
from
her
own
heart
*punct* ,
as
to
her
deficiency
*punct* ,
but
none
were
equal
to
counteract
the
persuasion
of
its
being
very
disagreeable,
*punct* ,
a
waste
of
time
*punct* ,
tiresome
women
*punct* ,
and
all
the
horror
of
being
in
danger
of
falling
in
with
the
second-rate
and
third-rate
of
highbury
*punct* ,
who
were
calling
on
them
for
ever
*punct* ,
and
therefore
she
seldom
went
near
them
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
she
made
the
sudden
resolution
of
not
passing
their
door
without
going
in
*punct* ,
observing
*punct* ,
as
she
proposed
it
to
harriet
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
as
well
as
she
could
calculate
*punct* ,
they
were
just
now
quite
safe
from
any
letter
from
jane
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
the
house
belonged
to
people
in
business
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
and
miss
bates
occupied
the
drawing-room
floor
*punct* ;
and
there
*punct* ,
in
the
very
moderate-sized
apartment
*punct* ,
which
was
every
thing
to
them
*punct* ,
the
visitors
were
most
cordially
and
even
gratefully
welcomed
*punct* ;
the
quiet
neat
old
lady
*punct* ,
who
with
her
knitting
was
seated
in
the
warmest
corner
*punct* ,
wanting
even
to
give
up
her
place
to
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
and
her
more
active
*punct* ,
talking
daughter
*punct* ,
almost
ready
to
overpower
them
with
care
and
kindness
*punct* ,
thanks
for
their
visit
*punct* ,
solicitude
for
their
shoes
*punct* ,
anxious
inquiries
after
mr.
woodhouse's
health
*punct* ,
cheerful
communications
about
her
mother's
*punct* ,
and
sweet-cake
from
the
beaufet
*punct* ,
mrs.
cole
had
just
been
there
*punct* ,
just
called
in
for
ten
minutes
*punct* ,
and
had
been
so
good
as
to
sit
an
hour
with
them
*punct* ,
and
she
had
taken
a
piece
of
cake
and
been
so
kind
as
to
say
she
liked
it
very
much
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
she
hoped
miss
woodhouse
and
miss
smith
would
do
them
the
favour
to
eat
a
piece
too
*punct* .
*break*
the
mention
of
the
coles
was
sure
to
be
followed
by
that
of
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
intimacy
between
them
*punct* ,
and
mr.
cole
had
heard
from
mr.
elton
since
his
going
away
*punct* .
*break*
emma
knew
what
was
coming
*punct* ;
they
must
have
the
letter
over
again
*punct* ,
and
settle
how
long
he
had
been
gone
*punct* ,
and
how
much
he
was
engaged
in
company
*punct* ,
and
what
a
favourite
he
was
wherever
he
went
*punct* ,
and
how
full
the
master
of
the
ceremonies
ball
had
been
*punct* ;
and
she
went
through
it
very
well
*punct* ,
with
all
the
interest
and
all
the
commendation
that
could
be
requisite
*punct* ,
and
always
putting
forward
to
prevent
harriet's
being
obliged
to
say
a
word
*punct* .
*break*
this
she
had
been
prepared
for
when
she
entered
the
house
*punct* ;
but
meant
*punct* ,
having
once
talked
him
handsomely
over
*punct* ,
to
be
no
farther
incommoded
by
any
troublesome
topic
*punct* ,
and
to
wander
at
large
amongst
all
the
mistresses
and
misses
of
highbury
*punct* ,
and
their
card-parties
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
not
been
prepared
to
have
jane
fairfax
succeed
mr.
elton
*punct* ;
but
he
was
actually
hurried
off
by
miss
bates
*punct* ,
she
jumped
away
from
him
at
last
abruptly
to
the
coles
*punct* ,
to
usher
in
a
letter
from
her
niece
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
i
understand
*punct* ,
certainly
as
to
dancing
*punct* ,
mrs.
cole
was
telling
me
that
dancing
at
the
rooms
at
bath
was
*punct* ,
mrs.
cole
was
so
kind
as
to
sit
some
time
with
us
*punct* ,
talking
of
jane
*punct* ;
for
as
soon
as
she
came
in
*punct* ,
she
began
inquiring
after
her
*punct* ,
jane
is
so
very
great
a
favourite
there
*punct* .
*break*
whenever
she
is
with
us
*punct* ,
mrs.
cole
does
not
know
how
to
shew
her
kindness
enough
*punct* ;
and
i
must
say
that
jane
deserves
it
as
much
as
any
body
can
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
she
began
inquiring
after
her
directly
*punct* ,
saying
*punct* ,
i
know
you
cannot
have
heard
from
jane
lately
*punct* ,
because
it
is
not
her
time
for
writing
*punct* ;
and
when
i
immediately
said
*punct* ,
but
indeed
we
have
*punct* ,
we
had
a
letter
this
very
morning
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
saw
any
body
more
surprized
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
*punct* ,
upon
your
honour
*punct* ?
*break*
said
she
*punct* ;
well
*punct* ,
that
is
quite
unexpected
*punct* .
*break*
do
let
me
hear
what
she
says
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
politeness
was
at
hand
directly
*punct* ,
to
say
*punct* ,
with
smiling
interest
*punct* ,
have
you
heard
from
miss
fairfax
so
lately
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
extremely
happy
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
she
is
well
*punct* ?
*break*
you
are
so
kind
*punct* !
*break*
replied
the
happily
deceived
aunt
*punct* ,
while
eagerly
hunting
for
the
letter.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
here
it
is
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
sure
it
could
not
be
far
off
*punct* ;
but
i
had
put
my
huswife
upon
it
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* ,
without
being
aware
*punct* ,
and
so
it
was
quite
hid
*punct* ,
but
i
had
it
in
my
hand
so
very
lately
that
i
was
almost
sure
it
must
be
on
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
reading
it
to
mrs.
cole
*punct* ,
and
since
she
went
away
*punct* ,
i
was
reading
it
again
to
my
mother
*punct* ,
for
it
is
such
a
pleasure
to
her
*punct* ,
a
letter
from
jane
*punct* ,
that
she
can
never
hear
it
often
enough
*punct* ;
so
i
knew
it
could
not
be
far
off
*punct* ,
and
here
it
is
*punct* ,
only
just
under
my
huswife
*punct* ,
and
since
you
are
so
kind
as
to
wish
to
hear
what
she
says;
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
first
of
all
*punct* ,
i
really
must
*punct* ,
in
justice
to
jane
*punct* ,
apologise
for
her
writing
so
short
a
letter
*punct* ,
only
two
pages
you
see
*punct* ,
hardly
two
*punct* ,
and
in
general
she
fills
the
whole
paper
and
crosses
half
*punct* .
*break*
my
mother
often
wonders
that
i
can
make
it
out
so
well
*punct* .
*break*
she
often
says
*punct* ,
when
the
letter
is
first
opened
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
hetty
*punct* ,
now
i
think
you
will
be
put
to
it
to
make
out
all
that
checker-work'
*punct* ,
don't
you
*punct* ,
ma'am?
*punct* ,
and
then
i
tell
her
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
she
would
contrive
to
make
it
out
herself
*punct* ,
if
she
had
nobody
to
do
it
for
her
*punct* ,
every
word
of
it
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
she
would
pore
over
it
till
she
had
made
out
every
word
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
though
my
mother's
eyes
are
not
so
good
as
they
were
*punct* ,
she
can
see
amazingly
well
still
*punct* ,
thank
god
*punct* !
*break*
with
the
help
of
spectacles
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
such
a
blessing
*punct* !
*break*
my
mother's
are
really
very
good
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
jane
often
says
*punct* ,
when
she
is
here
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* ,
grandmama
*punct* ,
you
must
have
had
very
strong
eyes
to
see
as
you
do
*punct* ,
and
so
much
fine
work
as
you
have
done
too!
*punct* ,
i
only
wish
my
eyes
may
last
me
as
well
*punct* .
*break*
all
this
spoken
extremely
fast
obliged
miss
bates
to
stop
for
breath
*punct* ;
and
emma
said
something
very
civil
about
the
excellence
of
miss
fairfax's
handwriting
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
extremely
kind
*punct* ,
replied
miss
bates
*punct* ,
highly
gratified
*punct* ;
you
who
are
such
a
judge
*punct* ,
and
write
so
beautifully
yourself
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
there
is
nobody's
praise
that
could
give
us
so
much
pleasure
as
miss
woodhouse's
*punct* .
*break*
my
mother
does
not
hear
*punct* ;
she
is
a
little
deaf
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
ma'am
*punct* ,
addressing
her
*punct* ,
do
you
hear
what
miss
woodhouse
is
so
obliging
to
say
about
jane's
handwriting
*punct* ?
*break*
and
emma
had
the
advantage
of
hearing
her
own
silly
compliment
repeated
twice
over
before
the
good
old
lady
could
comprehend
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
pondering
*punct* ,
in
the
meanwhile
*punct* ,
upon
the
possibility
*punct* ,
without
seeming
very
rude
*punct* ,
of
making
her
escape
from
jane
fairfax's
letter
*punct* ,
and
had
almost
resolved
on
hurrying
away
directly
under
some
slight
excuse
*punct* ,
when
miss
bates
turned
to
her
again
and
seized
her
attention
*punct* .
*break*
my
mother's
deafness
is
very
trifling
you
see
*punct* ,
just
nothing
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
by
only
raising
my
voice
*punct* ,
and
saying
any
thing
two
or
three
times
over
*punct* ,
she
is
sure
to
hear
*punct* ;
but
then
she
is
used
to
my
voice
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
very
remarkable
that
she
should
always
hear
jane
better
than
she
does
me
*punct* .
*break*
jane
speaks
so
distinct
*punct* !
*break*
however
*punct* ,
she
will
not
find
her
grandmama
at
all
deafer
than
she
was
two
years
ago
*punct* ;
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
at
my
mother's
time
of
life
*punct* ,
and
it
really
is
full
two
years
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
since
she
was
here
*punct* .
*break*
we
never
were
so
long
without
seeing
her
before
*punct* ,
and
as
i
was
telling
mrs.
cole
*punct* ,
we
shall
hardly
know
how
to
make
enough
of
her
now
*punct* .
*break*
are
you
expecting
miss
fairfax
here
soon
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
yes
*punct* ;
next
week
*punct* .
*break*
indeed!
*punct* ,
that
must
be
a
very
great
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
very
kind
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
next
week
*punct* .
*break*
every
body
is
so
surprized
*punct* ;
and
every
body
says
the
same
obliging
things
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
she
will
be
as
happy
to
see
her
friends
at
highbury
*punct* ,
as
they
can
be
to
see
her
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
friday
or
saturday
*punct* ;
she
cannot
say
which
*punct* ,
because
colonel
campbell
will
be
wanting
the
carriage
himself
one
of
those
days
*punct* .
*break*
so
very
good
of
them
to
send
her
the
whole
way
*punct* !
*break*
but
they
always
do
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
oh
yes
*punct* ,
friday
or
saturday
next
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
what
she
writes
about
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
the
reason
of
her
writing
out
of
rule
*punct* ,
as
we
call
it
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
in
the
common
course
*punct* ,
we
should
not
have
heard
from
her
before
next
tuesday
or
wednesday
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
so
i
imagined
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
afraid
there
could
be
little
chance
of
my
hearing
any
thing
of
miss
fairfax
to-day
*punct* .
*break*
so
obliging
of
you
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
we
should
not
have
heard
*punct* ,
if
it
had
not
been
for
this
particular
circumstance
*punct* ,
of
her
being
to
come
here
so
soon
*punct* .
*break*
my
mother
is
so
delighted!
*punct* ,
for
she
is
to
be
three
months
with
us
at
least
*punct* .
*break*
three
months
*punct* ,
she
says
so
*punct* ,
positively
*punct* ,
as
i
am
going
to
have
the
pleasure
of
reading
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
the
case
is
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* ,
that
the
campbells
are
going
to
ireland
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
dixon
has
persuaded
her
father
and
mother
to
come
over
and
see
her
directly
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
not
intended
to
go
over
till
the
summer
*punct* ,
but
she
is
so
impatient
to
see
them
again
*punct* ,
for
till
she
married
*punct* ,
last
october
*punct* ,
she
was
never
away
from
them
so
much
as
a
week
*punct* ,
which
must
make
it
very
strange
to
be
in
different
kingdoms
*punct* ,
i
was
going
to
say
*punct* ,
but
however
different
countries
*punct* ,
and
so
she
wrote
a
very
urgent
letter
to
her
mother
*punct* ,
or
her
father
*punct* ,
i
declare
i
do
not
know
which
it
was
*punct* ,
but
we
shall
see
presently
in
jane's
letter
*punct* ,
wrote
in
mr.
dixon's
name
as
well
as
her
own
*punct* ,
to
press
their
coming
over
directly
*punct* ,
and
they
would
give
them
the
meeting
in
dublin
*punct* ,
and
take
them
back
to
their
country
seat
*punct* ,
baly-craig
*punct* ,
a
beautiful
place
*punct* ,
i
fancy
*punct* .
*break*
jane
has
heard
a
great
deal
of
its
beauty
*punct* ;
from
mr.
dixon
*punct* ,
i
mean
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
that
she
ever
heard
about
it
from
any
body
else
*punct* ;
but
it
was
very
natural
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
that
he
should
like
to
speak
of
his
own
place
while
he
was
paying
his
addresses
*punct* ,
and
as
jane
used
to
be
very
often
walking
out
with
them
*punct* ,
for
colonel
and
mrs.
campbell
were
very
particular
about
their
daughter's
not
walking
out
often
with
only
mr.
dixon
*punct* ,
for
which
i
do
not
at
all
blame
them
*punct* ;
of
course
she
heard
every
thing
he
might
be
telling
miss
campbell
about
his
own
home
in
ireland
*punct* ;
and
i
think
she
wrote
us
word
that
he
had
shewn
them
some
drawings
of
the
place
*punct* ,
views
that
he
had
taken
himself
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
a
most
amiable
*punct* ,
charming
young
man
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* .
*break*
jane
was
quite
longing
to
go
to
ireland
*punct* ,
from
his
account
of
things
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
moment
*punct* ,
an
ingenious
and
animating
suspicion
entering
emma's
brain
with
regard
to
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
this
charming
mr.
dixon
*punct* ,
and
the
not
going
to
ireland
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* ,
with
the
insidious
design
of
farther
discovery
*punct* ,
you
must
feel
it
very
fortunate
that
miss
fairfax
should
be
allowed
to
come
to
you
at
such
a
time
*punct* .
*break*
considering
the
very
particular
friendship
between
her
and
mrs.
dixon
*punct* ,
you
could
hardly
have
expected
her
to
be
excused
from
accompanying
colonel
and
mrs.
campbell
*punct* .
*break*
very
true
*punct* ,
very
true
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
the
very
thing
that
we
have
always
been
rather
afraid
of
*punct* ;
for
we
should
not
have
liked
to
have
her
at
such
a
distance
from
us
*punct* ,
for
months
together
*punct* ,
not
able
to
come
if
any
thing
was
to
happen
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
see
*punct* ,
every
thing
turns
out
for
the
best
*punct* .
*break*
they
want
her
*punct* ,
mr.
and
mrs.
dixon
*punct* ,
excessively
to
come
over
with
colonel
and
mrs.
campbell
*punct* ;
quite
depend
upon
it
*punct* ;
nothing
can
be
more
kind
or
pressing
than
their
joint
invitation
*punct* ,
jane
says
*punct* ,
as
you
will
hear
presently
*punct* ;
mr.
dixon
does
not
seem
in
the
least
backward
in
any
attention
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
a
most
charming
young
man
*punct* .
*break*
ever
since
the
service
he
rendered
jane
at
weymouth
*punct* ,
when
they
were
out
in
that
party
on
the
water
*punct* ,
and
she
*punct* ,
by
the
sudden
whirling
round
of
something
or
other
among
the
sails
*punct* ,
would
have
been
dashed
into
the
sea
at
once
*punct* ,
and
actually
was
all
but
gone
*punct* ,
if
he
had
not
*punct* ,
with
the
greatest
presence
of
mind
*punct* ,
caught
hold
of
her
habit
*punct* ,
i
can
never
think
of
it
without
trembling!
*punct* ,
but
ever
since
we
had
the
history
of
that
day
*punct* ,
i
have
been
so
fond
of
mr.
dixon
*punct* !
*break*
but
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
all
her
friends
urgency
*punct* ,
and
her
own
wish
of
seeing
ireland
*punct* ,
miss
fairfax
prefers
devoting
the
time
to
you
and
mrs.
bates
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
entirely
her
own
doing
*punct* ,
entirely
her
own
choice
*punct* ;
and
colonel
and
mrs.
campbell
think
she
does
quite
right
*punct* ,
just
what
they
should
recommend
*punct* ;
and
indeed
they
particularly
wish
her
to
try
her
native
air
*punct* ,
as
she
has
not
been
quite
so
well
as
usual
lately
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
concerned
to
hear
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
they
judge
wisely
*punct* .
*break*
but
mrs.
dixon
must
be
very
much
disappointed
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
dixon
*punct* ,
i
understand
*punct* ,
has
no
remarkable
degree
of
personal
beauty
*punct* ;
is
not
*punct* ,
by
any
means
*punct* ,
to
be
compared
with
miss
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
very
obliging
to
say
such
things
*punct* ,
but
certainly
not
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
comparison
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
miss
campbell
always
was
absolutely
plain
*punct* ,
but
extremely
elegant
and
amiable
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
that
of
course
*punct* .
*break*
jane
caught
a
bad
cold
*punct* ,
poor
thing
*punct* !
*break*
so
long
ago
as
the
7th
of
november
*punct* ,
as
i
am
going
to
read
to
you,
*punct* ,
and
has
never
been
well
since
*punct* .
*break*
a
long
time
*punct* ,
is
not
it
*punct* ,
for
a
cold
to
hang
upon
her
*punct* ?
*break*
she
never
mentioned
it
before
*punct* ,
because
she
would
not
alarm
us
*punct* .
*break*
just
like
her
*punct* !
*break*
so
considerate!
*punct* ,
but
however
*punct* ,
she
is
so
far
from
well
*punct* ,
that
her
kind
friends
the
campbells
think
she
had
better
come
home
*punct* ,
and
try
an
air
that
always
agrees
with
her
*punct* ;
and
they
have
no
doubt
that
three
or
four
months
at
highbury
will
entirely
cure
her
*punct* ,
and
it
is
certainly
a
great
deal
better
that
she
should
come
here
*punct* ,
than
go
to
ireland
*punct* ,
if
she
is
unwell
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
could
nurse
her
*punct* ,
as
we
should
do
*punct* .
*break*
it
appears
to
me
the
most
desirable
arrangement
in
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
she
is
to
come
to
us
next
friday
or
saturday
*punct* ,
and
the
campbells
leave
town
in
their
way
to
holyhead
the
monday
following
*punct* ,
as
you
will
find
from
jane's
letter
*punct* .
*break*
so
sudden!
*punct* ,
you
may
guess
*punct* ,
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
what
a
flurry
it
has
thrown
me
in
*punct* !
*break*
if
it
was
not
for
the
drawback
of
her
illness
*punct* ,
but
i
am
afraid
we
must
expect
to
see
her
grown
thin
*punct* ,
and
looking
very
poorly
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
tell
you
what
an
unlucky
thing
happened
to
me
*punct* ,
as
to
that
*punct* .
*break*
i
always
make
a
point
of
reading
jane's
letters
through
to
myself
first
*punct* ,
before
i
read
them
aloud
to
my
mother
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
for
fear
of
there
being
any
thing
in
them
to
distress
her
*punct* .
*break*
jane
desired
me
to
do
it
*punct* ,
so
i
always
do
*punct* :
and
so
i
began
to-day
with
my
usual
caution
*punct* ;
but
no
sooner
did
i
come
to
the
mention
of
her
being
unwell
*punct* ,
than
i
burst
out
*punct* ,
quite
frightened
*punct* ,
with
bless
me
*punct* !
*break*
poor
jane
is
ill!'
*punct* ,
which
my
mother
*punct* ,
being
on
the
watch
*punct* ,
heard
distinctly
*punct* ,
and
was
sadly
alarmed
at
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
when
i
read
on
*punct* ,
i
found
it
was
not
near
so
bad
as
i
had
fancied
at
first
*punct* ;
and
i
make
so
light
of
it
now
to
her
*punct* ,
that
she
does
not
think
much
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
cannot
imagine
how
i
could
be
so
off
my
guard
*punct* .
*break*
if
jane
does
not
get
well
soon
*punct* ,
we
will
call
in
mr.
perry
*punct* .
*break*
the
expense
shall
not
be
thought
of
*punct* ;
and
though
he
is
so
liberal
*punct* ,
and
so
fond
of
jane
that
i
dare
say
he
would
not
mean
to
charge
any
thing
for
attendance
*punct* ,
we
could
not
suffer
it
to
be
so
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
a
wife
and
family
to
maintain
*punct* ,
and
is
not
to
be
giving
away
his
time
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
now
i
have
just
given
you
a
hint
of
what
jane
writes
about
*punct* ,
we
will
turn
to
her
letter
*punct* ,
and
i
am
sure
she
tells
her
own
story
a
great
deal
better
than
i
can
tell
it
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
afraid
we
must
be
running
away
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
glancing
at
harriet
*punct* ,
and
beginning
to
rise
*punct* ,
my
father
will
be
expecting
us
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
no
intention
*punct* ,
i
thought
i
had
no
power
of
staying
more
than
five
minutes
*punct* ,
when
i
first
entered
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
i
merely
called
*punct* ,
because
i
would
not
pass
the
door
without
inquiring
after
mrs.
bates
*punct* ;
but
i
have
been
so
pleasantly
detained
*punct* !
*break*
now
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
we
must
wish
you
and
mrs.
bates
good
morning
*punct* .
*break*
and
not
all
that
could
be
urged
to
detain
her
succeeded
*punct* .
*break*
she
regained
the
street
*punct* ,
happy
in
this
*punct* ,
that
though
much
had
been
forced
on
her
against
her
will
*punct* ,
though
she
had
in
fact
heard
the
whole
substance
of
jane
fairfax's
letter
*punct* ,
she
had
been
able
to
escape
the
letter
itself
*punct* .
*break*
jane
fairfax
was
an
orphan
*punct* ,
the
only
child
of
mrs.
bates's
youngest
daughter
*punct* .
*break*
the
marriage
of
lieut
*punct* .
*break*
fairfax
of
the
_______
regiment
of
infantry
*punct* ,
and
miss
jane
bates
*punct* ,
had
had
its
day
of
fame
and
pleasure
*punct* ,
hope
and
interest
*punct* ;
but
nothing
now
remained
of
it
*punct* ,
save
the
melancholy
remembrance
of
him
dying
in
action
abroad
*punct* ,
of
his
widow
sinking
under
consumption
and
grief
soon
afterwards
*punct* ,
and
this
girl
*punct* .
*break*
by
birth
she
belonged
to
highbury
*punct* :
and
when
at
three
years
old
*punct* ,
on
losing
her
mother
*punct* ,
she
became
the
property
*punct* ,
the
charge
*punct* ,
the
consolation
*punct* ,
the
fondling
of
her
grandmother
and
aunt
*punct* ,
there
had
seemed
every
probability
of
her
being
permanently
fixed
there
*punct* ;
of
her
being
taught
only
what
very
limited
means
could
command
*punct* ,
and
growing
up
with
no
advantages
of
connexion
or
improvement
*punct* ,
to
be
engrafted
on
what
nature
had
given
her
in
a
pleasing
person
*punct* ,
good
understanding
*punct* ,
and
warm-hearted
*punct* ,
well-meaning
relations
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
compassionate
feelings
of
a
friend
of
her
father
gave
a
change
to
her
destiny
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
colonel
campbell
*punct* ,
who
had
very
highly
regarded
fairfax
*punct* ,
as
an
excellent
officer
and
most
deserving
young
man
*punct* ;
and
farther
*punct* ,
had
been
indebted
to
him
for
such
attentions
*punct* ,
during
a
severe
camp-fever
*punct* ,
as
he
believed
had
saved
his
life
*punct* .
*break*
these
were
claims
which
he
did
not
learn
to
overlook
*punct* ,
though
some
years
passed
away
from
the
death
of
poor
fairfax
*punct* ,
before
his
own
return
to
england
put
any
thing
in
his
power
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
did
return
*punct* ,
he
sought
out
the
child
and
took
notice
of
her
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
married
man
*punct* ,
with
only
one
living
child
*punct* ,
a
girl
*punct* ,
about
jane's
age
*punct* :
and
jane
became
their
guest
*punct* ,
paying
them
long
visits
and
growing
a
favourite
with
all
*punct* ;
and
before
she
was
nine
years
old
*punct* ,
his
daughter's
great
fondness
for
her
*punct* ,
and
his
own
wish
of
being
a
real
friend
*punct* ,
united
to
produce
an
offer
from
colonel
campbell
of
undertaking
the
whole
charge
of
her
education
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
accepted
*punct* ;
and
from
that
period
jane
had
belonged
to
colonel
campbell's
family
*punct* ,
and
had
lived
with
them
entirely
*punct* ,
only
visiting
her
grandmother
from
time
to
time
*punct* .
*break*
the
plan
was
that
she
should
be
brought
up
for
educating
others
*punct* ;
the
very
few
hundred
pounds
which
she
inherited
from
her
father
making
independence
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
to
provide
for
her
otherwise
was
out
of
colonel
campbell's
power
*punct* ;
for
though
his
income
*punct* ,
by
pay
and
appointments
*punct* ,
was
handsome
*punct* ,
his
fortune
was
moderate
and
must
be
all
his
daughter's
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
by
giving
her
an
education
*punct* ,
he
hoped
to
be
supplying
the
means
of
respectable
subsistence
hereafter
*punct* .
*break*
such
was
jane
fairfax's
history
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
fallen
into
good
hands
*punct* ,
known
nothing
but
kindness
from
the
campbells
*punct* ,
and
been
given
an
excellent
education
*punct* .
*break*
living
constantly
with
right-minded
and
well-informed
people
*punct* ,
her
heart
and
understanding
had
received
every
advantage
of
discipline
and
culture
*punct* ;
and
colonel
campbell's
residence
being
in
london
*punct* ,
every
lighter
talent
had
been
done
full
justice
to
*punct* ,
by
the
attendance
of
first-rate
masters
*punct* .
*break*
her
disposition
and
abilities
were
equally
worthy
of
all
that
friendship
could
do
*punct* ;
and
at
eighteen
or
nineteen
she
was
*punct* ,
as
far
as
such
an
early
age
can
be
qualified
for
the
care
of
children
*punct* ,
fully
competent
to
the
office
of
instruction
herself
*punct* ;
but
she
was
too
much
beloved
to
be
parted
with
*punct* .
*break*
neither
father
nor
mother
could
promote
*punct* ,
and
the
daughter
could
not
endure
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
evil
day
was
put
off
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
easy
to
decide
that
she
was
still
too
young
*punct* ;
and
jane
remained
with
them
*punct* ,
sharing
*punct* ,
as
another
daughter
*punct* ,
in
all
the
rational
pleasures
of
an
elegant
society
*punct* ,
and
a
judicious
mixture
of
home
and
amusement
*punct* ,
with
only
the
drawback
of
the
future
*punct* ,
the
sobering
suggestions
of
her
own
good
understanding
to
remind
her
that
all
this
might
soon
be
over
*punct* .
*break*
the
affection
of
the
whole
family
*punct* ,
the
warm
attachment
of
miss
campbell
in
particular
*punct* ,
was
the
more
honourable
to
each
party
from
the
circumstance
of
jane's
decided
superiority
both
in
beauty
and
acquirements
*punct* .
*break*
that
nature
had
given
it
in
feature
could
not
be
unseen
by
the
young
woman
*punct* ,
nor
could
her
higher
powers
of
mind
be
unfelt
by
the
parents
*punct* .
*break*
they
continued
together
with
unabated
regard
however
*punct* ,
till
the
marriage
of
miss
campbell
*punct* ,
who
by
that
chance
*punct* ,
that
luck
which
so
often
defies
anticipation
in
matrimonial
affairs
*punct* ,
giving
attraction
to
what
is
moderate
rather
than
to
what
is
superior
*punct* ,
engaged
the
affections
of
mr.
dixon
*punct* ,
a
young
man
*punct* ,
rich
and
agreeable
*punct* ,
almost
as
soon
as
they
were
acquainted
*punct* ;
and
was
eligibly
and
happily
settled
*punct* ,
while
jane
fairfax
had
yet
her
bread
to
earn
*punct* .
*break*
this
event
had
very
lately
taken
place
*punct* ;
too
lately
for
any
thing
to
be
yet
attempted
by
her
less
fortunate
friend
towards
entering
on
her
path
of
duty
*punct* ;
though
she
had
now
reached
the
age
which
her
own
judgment
had
fixed
on
for
beginning
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
long
resolved
that
one-and-twenty
should
be
the
period
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
fortitude
of
a
devoted
novitiate
*punct* ,
she
had
resolved
at
one-and-twenty
to
complete
the
sacrifice
*punct* ,
and
retire
from
all
the
pleasures
of
life
*punct* ,
of
rational
intercourse
*punct* ,
equal
society
*punct* ,
peace
and
hope
*punct* ,
to
penance
and
mortification
for
ever
*punct* .
*break*
the
good
sense
of
colonel
and
mrs.
campbell
could
not
oppose
such
a
resolution
*punct* ,
though
their
feelings
did
*punct* .
*break*
as
long
as
they
lived
*punct* ,
no
exertions
would
be
necessary
*punct* ,
their
home
might
be
hers
for
ever
*punct* ;
and
for
their
own
comfort
they
would
have
retained
her
wholly
*punct* ;
but
this
would
be
selfishness:
*punct* ,
what
must
be
at
last
*punct* ,
had
better
be
soon
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
they
began
to
feel
it
might
have
been
kinder
and
wiser
to
have
resisted
the
temptation
of
any
delay
*punct* ,
and
spared
her
from
a
taste
of
such
enjoyments
of
ease
and
leisure
as
must
now
be
relinquished
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
affection
was
glad
to
catch
at
any
reasonable
excuse
for
not
hurrying
on
the
wretched
moment
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
never
been
quite
well
since
the
time
of
their
daughter's
marriage
*punct* ;
and
till
she
should
have
completely
recovered
her
usual
strength
*punct* ,
they
must
forbid
her
engaging
in
duties
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
so
far
from
being
compatible
with
a
weakened
frame
and
varying
spirits
*punct* ,
seemed
*punct* ,
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
*punct* ,
to
require
something
more
than
human
perfection
of
body
and
mind
to
be
discharged
with
tolerable
comfort
*punct* .
*break*
with
regard
to
her
not
accompanying
them
to
ireland
*punct* ,
her
account
to
her
aunt
contained
nothing
but
truth
*punct* ,
though
there
might
be
some
truths
not
told
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
her
own
choice
to
give
the
time
of
their
absence
to
highbury
*punct* ;
to
spend
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
her
last
months
of
perfect
liberty
with
those
kind
relations
to
whom
she
was
so
very
dear
*punct* :
and
the
campbells
*punct* ,
whatever
might
be
their
motive
or
motives
*punct* ,
whether
single
*punct* ,
or
double
*punct* ,
or
treble
*punct* ,
gave
the
arrangement
their
ready
sanction
*punct* ,
and
said
*punct* ,
that
they
depended
more
on
a
few
months
spent
in
her
native
air
*punct* ,
for
the
recovery
of
her
health
*punct* ,
than
on
any
thing
else
*punct* .
*break*
certain
it
was
that
she
was
to
come
*punct* ;
and
that
highbury
*punct* ,
instead
of
welcoming
that
perfect
novelty
which
had
been
so
long
promised
it
*punct* ,
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
must
put
up
for
the
present
with
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
who
could
bring
only
the
freshness
of
a
two
years
absence
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
sorry;
*punct* ,
to
have
to
pay
civilities
to
a
person
she
did
not
like
through
three
long
months!
*punct* ,
to
be
always
doing
more
than
she
wished
*punct* ,
and
less
than
she
ought
*punct* !
*break*
why
she
did
not
like
jane
fairfax
might
be
a
difficult
question
to
answer
*punct* ;
mr.
knightley
had
once
told
her
it
was
because
she
saw
in
her
the
really
accomplished
young
woman
*punct* ,
which
she
wanted
to
be
thought
herself
*punct* ;
and
though
the
accusation
had
been
eagerly
refuted
at
the
time
*punct* ,
there
were
moments
of
self-examination
in
which
her
conscience
could
not
quite
acquit
her
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
could
never
get
acquainted
with
her
*punct* :
she
did
not
know
how
it
was
*punct* ,
but
there
was
such
coldness
and
reserve
*punct* ,
such
apparent
indifference
whether
she
pleased
or
not
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
her
aunt
was
such
an
eternal
talker!
*punct* ,
and
she
was
made
such
a
fuss
with
by
every
body!
*punct* ,
and
it
had
been
always
imagined
that
they
were
to
be
so
intimate
*punct* ,
because
their
ages
were
the
same
*punct* ,
every
body
had
supposed
they
must
be
so
fond
of
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
these
were
her
reasons
*punct* ,
she
had
no
better
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
dislike
so
little
just
*punct* ,
every
imputed
fault
was
so
magnified
by
fancy
*punct* ,
that
she
never
saw
jane
fairfax
the
first
time
after
any
considerable
absence
*punct* ,
without
feeling
that
she
had
injured
her
*punct* ;
and
now
*punct* ,
when
the
due
visit
was
paid
*punct* ,
on
her
arrival
*punct* ,
after
a
two
years
interval
*punct* ,
she
was
particularly
struck
with
the
very
appearance
and
manners
*punct* ,
which
for
those
two
whole
years
she
had
been
depreciating
*punct* .
*break*
jane
fairfax
was
very
elegant
*punct* ,
remarkably
elegant
*punct* ;
and
she
had
herself
the
highest
value
for
elegance
*punct* .
*break*
her
height
was
pretty
*punct* ,
just
such
as
almost
every
body
would
think
tall
*punct* ,
and
nobody
could
think
very
tall
*punct* ;
her
figure
particularly
graceful
*punct* ;
her
size
a
most
becoming
medium
*punct* ,
between
fat
and
thin
*punct* ,
though
a
slight
appearance
of
ill-health
seemed
to
point
out
the
likeliest
evil
of
the
two
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
but
feel
all
this
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
her
face
*punct* ,
her
features
*punct* ,
there
was
more
beauty
in
them
altogether
than
she
had
remembered
*punct* ;
it
was
not
regular
*punct* ,
but
it
was
very
pleasing
beauty
*punct* .
*break*
her
eyes
*punct* ,
a
deep
grey
*punct* ,
with
dark
eye-lashes
and
eyeb
rows
*punct* ,
had
never
been
denied
their
praise
*punct* ;
but
the
skin
*punct* ,
which
she
had
been
used
to
cavil
at
*punct* ,
as
wanting
colour
*punct* ,
had
a
clearness
and
delicacy
which
really
needed
no
fuller
bloom
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
style
of
beauty
*punct* ,
of
which
elegance
was
the
reigning
character
*punct* ,
and
as
such
*punct* ,
she
must
*punct* ,
in
honour
*punct* ,
by
all
her
principles
*punct* ,
admire
it:
*punct* ,
elegance
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
whether
of
person
or
of
mind
*punct* ,
she
saw
so
little
in
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
not
to
be
vulgar
*punct* ,
was
distinction
*punct* ,
and
merit
*punct* .
*break*
in
short
*punct* ,
she
sat
*punct* ,
during
the
first
visit
*punct* ,
looking
at
jane
fairfax
with
twofold
complacency
*punct* ;
the
sense
of
pleasure
and
the
sense
of
rendering
justice
*punct* ,
and
was
determining
that
she
would
dislike
her
no
longer
*punct* .
*break*
when
she
took
in
her
history
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
her
situation
*punct* ,
as
well
as
her
beauty
*punct* ;
when
she
considered
what
all
this
elegance
was
destined
to
*punct* ,
what
she
was
going
to
sink
from
*punct* ,
how
she
was
going
to
live
*punct* ,
it
seemed
impossible
to
feel
any
thing
but
compassion
and
respect
*punct* ;
especially
*punct* ,
if
to
every
well-known
particular
entitling
her
to
interest
*punct* ,
were
added
the
highly
probable
circumstance
of
an
attachment
to
mr.
dixon
*punct* ,
which
she
had
so
naturally
started
to
herself
*punct* .
*break*
in
that
case
*punct* ,
nothing
could
be
more
pitiable
or
more
honourable
than
the
sacrifices
she
had
resolved
on
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
very
willing
now
to
acquit
her
of
having
seduced
mr.
dixon's
actions
from
his
wife
*punct* ,
or
of
any
thing
mischievous
which
her
imagination
had
suggested
at
first
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
were
love
*punct* ,
it
might
be
simple
*punct* ,
single
*punct* ,
successless
love
on
her
side
alone
*punct* .
*break*
she
might
have
been
unconsciously
sucking
in
the
sad
poison
*punct* ,
while
a
sharer
of
his
conversation
with
her
friend
*punct* ;
and
from
the
best
*punct* ,
the
purest
of
motives
*punct* ,
might
now
be
denying
herself
this
visit
to
ireland
*punct* ,
and
resolving
to
divide
herself
effectually
from
him
and
his
connexions
by
soon
beginning
her
career
of
laborious
duty
*punct* .
*break*
upon
the
whole
*punct* ,
emma
left
her
with
such
softened
*punct* ,
charitable
feelings
*punct* ,
as
made
her
look
around
in
walking
home
*punct* ,
and
lament
that
highbury
afforded
no
young
man
worthy
of
giving
her
independence
*punct* ;
nobody
that
she
could
wish
to
scheme
about
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
these
were
charming
feelings
*punct* ,
but
not
lasting
*punct* .
*break*
before
she
had
committed
herself
by
any
public
profession
of
eternal
friendship
for
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
or
done
more
towards
a
recantation
of
past
prejudices
and
errors
*punct* ,
than
saying
to
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
she
certainly
is
handsome
*punct* ;
she
is
better
than
handsome
*punct* !
*break*
jane
had
spent
an
evening
at
hartfield
with
her
grandmother
and
aunt
*punct* ,
and
every
thing
was
relapsing
much
into
its
usual
state
*punct* .
*break*
former
provocations
reappeared
*punct* .
*break*
the
aunt
was
as
tiresome
as
ever
*punct* ;
more
tiresome
*punct* ,
because
anxiety
for
her
health
was
now
added
to
admiration
of
her
powers
*punct* ;
and
they
had
to
listen
to
the
description
of
exactly
how
little
bread
and
butter
she
ate
for
breakfast
*punct* ,
and
how
small
a
slice
of
mutton
for
dinner
*punct* ,
as
well
as
to
see
exhibitions
of
new
caps
and
new
workbags
for
her
mother
and
herself
*punct* ;
and
jane's
offences
rose
again
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
music
*punct* ;
emma
was
obliged
to
play
*punct* ;
and
the
thanks
and
praise
which
necessarily
followed
appeared
to
her
an
affectation
of
candour
*punct* ,
an
air
of
greatness
*punct* ,
meaning
only
to
shew
off
in
higher
style
her
own
very
superior
performance
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
*punct* ,
besides
*punct* ,
which
was
the
worst
of
all
*punct* ,
so
cold
*punct* ,
so
cautious
*punct* !
*break*
there
was
no
getting
at
her
real
opinion
*punct* .
*break*
wrapt
up
in
a
cloak
of
politeness
*punct* ,
she
seemed
determined
to
hazard
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
disgustingly
*punct* ,
was
suspiciously
reserved
*punct* .
*break*
if
any
thing
could
be
more
*punct* ,
where
all
was
most
*punct* ,
she
was
more
reserved
on
the
subject
of
weymouth
and
the
dixons
than
any
thing
*punct* .
*break*
she
seemed
bent
on
giving
no
real
insight
into
mr.
dixon's
character
*punct* ,
or
her
own
value
for
his
company
*punct* ,
or
opinion
of
the
suitableness
of
the
match
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
all
general
approbation
and
smoothness
*punct* ;
nothing
delineated
or
distinguished
*punct* .
*break*
it
did
her
no
service
however
*punct* .
*break*
her
caution
was
thrown
away
*punct* .
*break*
emma
saw
its
artifice
*punct* ,
and
returned
to
her
first
surmises
*punct* .
*break*
there
probably
was
something
more
to
conceal
than
her
own
preference
*punct* ;
mr.
dixon
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
had
been
very
near
changing
one
friend
for
the
other
*punct* ,
or
been
fixed
only
to
miss
campbell
*punct* ,
for
the
sake
of
the
future
twelve
thousand
pounds
*punct* .
*break*
the
like
reserve
prevailed
on
other
topics
*punct* .
*break*
she
and
mr.
frank
churchill
had
been
at
weymouth
at
the
same
time
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
known
that
they
were
a
little
acquainted
*punct* ;
but
not
a
syllable
of
real
information
could
emma
procure
as
to
what
he
truly
was
*punct* .
*break*
was
he
handsome?
*punct* ,
she
believed
he
was
reckoned
a
very
fine
young
man
*punct* .
*break*
was
he
agreeable?
*punct* ,
he
was
generally
thought
so
*punct* .
*break*
did
he
appear
a
sensible
young
man
*punct* ;
a
young
man
of
information?
*punct* ,
at
a
watering-place
*punct* ,
or
in
a
common
london
acquaintance
*punct* ,
it
was
difficult
to
decide
on
such
points
*punct* .
*break*
manners
were
all
that
could
be
safely
judged
of
*punct* ,
under
a
much
longer
knowledge
than
they
had
yet
had
of
mr.
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
she
believed
every
body
found
his
manners
pleasing
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
forgive
her
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
forgive
her;
*punct* ,
but
as
neither
provocation
nor
resentment
were
discerned
by
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
who
had
been
of
the
party
*punct* ,
and
had
seen
only
proper
attention
and
pleasing
behaviour
on
each
side
*punct* ,
he
was
expressing
the
next
morning
*punct* ,
being
at
hartfield
again
on
business
with
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
his
approbation
of
the
whole
*punct* ;
not
so
openly
as
he
might
have
done
had
her
father
been
out
of
the
room
*punct* ,
but
speaking
plain
enough
to
be
very
intelligible
to
emma
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
used
to
think
her
unjust
to
jane
*punct* ,
and
had
now
great
pleasure
in
marking
an
improvement
*punct* .
*break*
a
very
pleasant
evening
*punct* ,
he
began
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
mr.
woodhouse
had
been
talked
into
what
was
necessary
*punct* ,
told
that
he
understood
*punct* ,
and
the
papers
swept
away;
*punct* ,
particularly
pleasant
*punct* .
*break*
you
and
miss
fairfax
gave
us
some
very
good
music
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
a
more
luxurious
state
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
than
sitting
at
one's
ease
to
be
entertained
a
whole
evening
by
two
such
young
women
*punct* ;
sometimes
with
music
and
sometimes
with
conversation
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
miss
fairfax
must
have
found
the
evening
pleasant
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* .
*break*
you
left
nothing
undone
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
glad
you
made
her
play
so
much
*punct* ,
for
having
no
instrument
at
her
grandmother's
*punct* ,
it
must
have
been
a
real
indulgence
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
happy
you
approved
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
smiling
*punct* ;
but
i
hope
i
am
not
often
deficient
in
what
is
due
to
guests
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
her
father
instantly
*punct* ;
that
i
am
sure
you
are
not
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
nobody
half
so
attentive
and
civil
as
you
are
*punct* .
*break*
if
any
thing
*punct* ,
you
are
too
attentive
*punct* .
*break*
the
muffin
last
night
*punct* ,
if
it
had
been
handed
round
once
*punct* ,
i
think
it
would
have
been
enough
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
nearly
at
the
same
time
*punct* ;
you
are
not
often
deficient
*punct* ;
not
often
deficient
either
in
manner
or
comprehension
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
you
understand
me
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* .
*break*
an
arch
look
expressed
*punct* ,
i
understand
you
well
enough
*punct* ;
but
she
said
only
*punct* ,
miss
fairfax
is
reserved
*punct* .
*break*
i
always
told
you
she
was
*punct* ,
a
little
*punct* ;
but
you
will
soon
overcome
all
that
part
of
her
reserve
which
ought
to
be
overcome
*punct* ,
all
that
has
its
foundation
in
diffidence
*punct* .
*break*
what
arises
from
discretion
must
be
honoured
*punct* .
*break*
you
think
her
diffident
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
see
it
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
moving
from
his
chair
into
one
close
by
her
*punct* ,
you
are
not
going
to
tell
me
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ,
that
you
had
not
a
pleasant
evening
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ;
i
was
pleased
with
my
own
perseverance
in
asking
questions
*punct* ;
and
amused
to
think
how
little
information
i
obtained
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
disappointed
*punct* ,
was
his
only
answer
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
every
body
had
a
pleasant
evening
*punct* ,
said
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
in
his
quiet
way
*punct* .
*break*
once
*punct* ,
i
felt
the
fire
rather
too
much
*punct* ;
but
then
i
moved
back
my
chair
a
little
*punct* ,
a
very
little
*punct* ,
and
it
did
not
disturb
me
*punct* .
*break*
miss
bates
was
very
chatty
and
good-humoured
*punct* ,
as
she
always
is
*punct* ,
though
she
speaks
rather
too
quick
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
she
is
very
agreeable
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
bates
too
*punct* ,
in
a
different
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
like
old
friends
*punct* ;
and
miss
jane
fairfax
is
a
very
pretty
sort
of
young
lady
*punct* ,
a
very
pretty
and
a
very
well-behaved
young
lady
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
have
found
the
evening
agreeable
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
because
she
had
emma
*punct* .
*break*
true
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
and
emma
*punct* ,
because
she
had
miss
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
emma
saw
his
anxiety
*punct* ,
and
wishing
to
appease
it
*punct* ,
at
least
for
the
present
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
and
with
a
sincerity
which
no
one
could
question
*punct* ,
she
is
a
sort
of
elegant
creature
that
one
cannot
keep
one's
eyes
from
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
always
watching
her
to
admire
*punct* ;
and
i
do
pity
her
from
my
heart
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
looked
as
if
he
were
more
gratified
than
he
cared
to
express
*punct* ;
and
before
he
could
make
any
reply
*punct* ,
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
whose
thoughts
were
on
the
bates's
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
it
is
a
great
pity
that
their
circumstances
should
be
so
confined
*punct* !
*break*
a
great
pity
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
and
i
have
often
wished
*punct* ,
but
it
is
so
little
one
can
venture
to
do
*punct* ,
small
*punct* ,
trifling
presents
*punct* ,
of
any
thing
uncommon
*punct* ,
now
we
have
killed
a
porker
*punct* ,
and
emma
thinks
of
sending
them
a
loin
or
a
leg
*punct* ;
it
is
very
small
and
delicate
*punct* ,
hartfield
pork
is
not
like
any
other
pork
*punct* ,
but
still
it
is
pork
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
unless
one
could
be
sure
of
their
making
it
into
steaks
*punct* ,
nicely
fried
*punct* ,
as
ours
are
fried
*punct* ,
without
the
smallest
grease
*punct* ,
and
not
roast
it
*punct* ,
for
no
stomach
can
bear
roast
pork
*punct* ,
i
think
we
had
better
send
the
leg
*punct* ,
do
not
you
think
so
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ?
*break*
my
dear
papa
*punct* ,
i
sent
the
whole
hind-quarter
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
you
would
wish
it
*punct* .
*break*
there
will
be
the
leg
to
be
salted
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
which
is
so
very
nice
*punct* ,
and
the
loin
to
be
dressed
directly
in
any
manner
they
like
*punct* .
*break*
that's
right
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
very
right
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
not
thought
of
it
before
*punct* ,
but
that
is
the
best
way
*punct* .
*break*
they
must
not
over-salt
the
leg
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
if
it
is
not
over-salted
*punct* ,
and
if
it
is
very
thoroughly
boiled
*punct* ,
just
as
serle
boils
ours
*punct* ,
and
eaten
very
moderately
of
*punct* ,
with
a
boiled
turnip
*punct* ,
and
a
little
carrot
or
parsnip
*punct* ,
i
do
not
consider
it
unwholesome
*punct* .
*break*
emma
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
presently
*punct* ,
i
have
a
piece
of
news
for
you
*punct* .
*break*
you
like
news
*punct* ,
and
i
heard
an
article
in
my
way
hither
that
i
think
will
interest
you
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
always
like
news
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
it?
*punct* ,
why
do
you
smile
so?
*punct* ,
where
did
you
hear
it?
*punct* ,
at
randalls
*punct* ?
*break*
he
had
time
only
to
say
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
not
at
randalls
*punct* ;
i
have
not
been
near
randalls
*punct* ,
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
*punct* ,
and
miss
bates
and
miss
fairfax
walked
into
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
full
of
thanks
*punct* ,
and
full
of
news
*punct* ,
miss
bates
knew
not
which
to
give
quickest
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
soon
saw
that
he
had
lost
his
moment
*punct* ,
and
that
not
another
syllable
of
communication
could
rest
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
how
are
you
this
morning
*punct* ?
*break*
my
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
i
come
quite
over-powered
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
beautiful
hind-quarter
of
pork
*punct* !
*break*
you
are
too
bountiful
*punct* !
*break*
have
you
heard
the
news
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
elton
is
going
to
be
married
*punct* .
*break*
emma
had
not
had
time
even
to
think
of
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
and
she
was
so
completely
surprized
that
she
could
not
avoid
a
little
start
*punct* ,
and
a
little
blush
*punct* ,
at
the
sound
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
my
news:
*punct* ,
i
thought
it
would
interest
you
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
with
a
smile
which
implied
a
conviction
of
some
part
of
what
had
passed
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
but
where
could
you
hear
it
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
miss
bates
*punct* .
*break*
where
could
you
possibly
hear
it
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ?
*break*
for
it
is
not
five
minutes
since
i
received
mrs.
cole's
note
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
it
cannot
be
more
than
five
*punct* ,
or
at
least
ten
*punct* ,
for
i
had
got
my
bonnet
and
spencer
on
*punct* ,
just
ready
to
come
out
*punct* ,
i
was
only
gone
down
to
speak
to
patty
again
about
the
pork
*punct* ,
jane
was
standing
in
the
passage
*punct* ,
were
not
you
*punct* ,
jane?
*punct* ,
for
my
mother
was
so
afraid
that
we
had
not
any
salting-pan
large
enough
*punct* .
*break*
so
i
said
i
would
go
down
and
see
*punct* ,
and
jane
said
*punct* ,
shall
i
go
down
instead
*punct* ?
*break*
for
i
think
you
have
a
little
cold
*punct* ,
and
patty
has
been
washing
the
kitchen.'
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
and
just
then
came
the
note
*punct* .
*break*
a
miss
hawkins
*punct* ,
that's
all
i
know
*punct* .
*break*
a
miss
hawkins
of
bath
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
how
could
you
possibly
have
heard
it
*punct* ?
*break*
for
the
very
moment
mr.
cole
told
mrs.
cole
of
it
*punct* ,
she
sat
down
and
wrote
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
a
miss
hawkins
*punct* ,
i
was
with
mr.
cole
on
business
an
hour
and
a
half
ago
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
just
read
elton's
letter
as
i
was
shewn
in
*punct* ,
and
handed
it
to
me
directly
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
quite
*punct* ,
i
suppose
there
never
was
a
piece
of
news
more
generally
interesting
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
you
really
are
too
bountiful
*punct* .
*break*
my
mother
desires
her
very
best
compliments
and
regards
*punct* ,
and
a
thousand
thanks
*punct* ,
and
says
you
really
quite
oppress
her
*punct* .
*break*
we
consider
our
hartfield
pork
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
indeed
it
certainly
is
*punct* ,
so
very
superior
to
all
other
pork
*punct* ,
that
emma
and
i
cannot
have
a
greater
pleasure
than
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
as
my
mother
says
*punct* ,
our
friends
are
only
too
good
to
us
*punct* .
*break*
if
ever
there
were
people
who
*punct* ,
without
having
great
wealth
themselves
*punct* ,
had
every
thing
they
could
wish
for
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
it
is
us
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
well
say
that
our
lot
is
cast
in
a
goodly
heritage
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
and
so
you
actually
saw
the
letter
*punct* ;
well
*punct* ,
it
was
short
*punct* ,
merely
to
announce
*punct* ,
but
cheerful
*punct* ,
exulting
*punct* ,
of
course.
*punct* ,
here
was
a
sly
glance
at
emma
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
*punct* ,
i
forget
the
precise
words
*punct* ,
one
has
no
business
to
remember
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
information
was
*punct* ,
as
you
state
*punct* ,
that
he
was
going
to
be
married
to
a
miss
hawkins
*punct* .
*break*
by
his
style
*punct* ,
i
should
imagine
it
just
settled
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
going
to
be
married
*punct* !
*break*
said
emma
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
have
every
body's
wishes
for
his
happiness
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
very
young
to
settle
*punct* ,
was
mr.
woodhouse's
observation
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
better
not
be
in
a
hurry
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
to
me
very
well
off
as
he
was
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
always
glad
to
see
him
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
a
new
neighbour
for
us
all
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* !
*break*
said
miss
bates
*punct* ,
joyfully
*punct* ;
my
mother
is
so
pleased!
*punct* ,
she
says
she
cannot
bear
to
have
the
poor
old
vicarage
without
a
mistress
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
great
news
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
jane
*punct* ,
you
have
never
seen
mr.
elton!
*punct* ,
no
wonder
that
you
have
such
a
curiosity
to
see
him
*punct* .
*break*
jane's
curiosity
did
not
appear
of
that
absorbing
nature
as
wholly
to
occupy
her
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
have
never
seen
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
she
replied
*punct* ,
starting
on
this
appeal
*punct* ;
is
he
*punct* ,
is
he
a
tall
man
*punct* ?
*break*
who
shall
answer
that
question
*punct* ?
*break*
my
father
would
say
yes
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
no
*punct* ;
and
miss
bates
and
i
that
he
is
just
the
happy
medium
*punct* .
*break*
when
you
have
been
here
a
little
longer
*punct* ,
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
you
will
understand
that
mr.
elton
is
the
standard
of
perfection
in
highbury
*punct* ,
both
in
person
and
mind
*punct* .
*break*
very
true
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
so
she
will
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
the
very
best
young
man
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
my
dear
jane
*punct* ,
if
you
remember
*punct* ,
i
told
you
yesterday
he
was
precisely
the
height
of
mr.
perry
*punct* .
*break*
miss
hawkins,
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* ,
an
excellent
young
woman
*punct* .
*break*
his
extreme
attention
to
my
mother
*punct* ,
wanting
her
to
sit
in
the
vicarage
pew
*punct* ,
that
she
might
hear
the
better
*punct* ,
for
my
mother
is
a
little
deaf
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
it
is
not
much
*punct* ,
but
she
does
not
hear
quite
quick
*punct* .
*break*
jane
says
that
colonel
campbell
is
a
little
deaf
*punct* .
*break*
he
fancied
bathing
might
be
good
for
it
*punct* ,
the
warm
bath
*punct* ,
but
she
says
it
did
him
no
lasting
benefit
*punct* .
*break*
colonel
campbell
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
is
quite
our
angel
*punct* .
*break*
and
mr.
dixon
seems
a
very
charming
young
man
*punct* ,
quite
worthy
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
such
a
happiness
when
good
people
get
together
*punct* ,
and
they
always
do
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
here
will
be
mr.
elton
and
miss
hawkins
*punct* ;
and
there
are
the
coles
*punct* ,
such
very
good
people
*punct* ;
and
the
perrys
*punct* ,
i
suppose
there
never
was
a
happier
or
a
better
couple
than
mr.
and
mrs.
perry
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
turning
to
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
i
think
there
are
few
places
with
such
society
as
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
i
always
say
*punct* ,
we
are
quite
blessed
in
our
neighbours.
*punct* ,
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
if
there
is
one
thing
my
mother
loves
better
than
another
*punct* ,
it
is
pork
*punct* ,
a
roast
loin
of
pork
*punct* ,
as
to
who
*punct* ,
or
what
miss
hawkins
is
*punct* ,
or
how
long
he
has
been
acquainted
with
her
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
nothing
i
suppose
can
be
known
*punct* .
*break*
one
feels
that
it
cannot
be
a
very
long
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
been
gone
only
four
weeks
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
had
any
information
to
give
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
after
a
few
more
wonderings
*punct* ,
emma
said
*punct* ,
you
are
silent
*punct* ,
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
but
i
hope
you
mean
to
take
an
interest
in
this
news
*punct* .
*break*
you
*punct* ,
who
have
been
hearing
and
seeing
so
much
of
late
on
these
subjects
*punct* ,
who
must
have
been
so
deep
in
the
business
on
miss
campbell's
account
*punct* ,
we
shall
not
excuse
your
being
indifferent
about
mr.
elton
and
miss
hawkins
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
have
seen
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
replied
jane
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
interested
*punct* ,
but
i
believe
it
requires
that
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
it
is
some
months
since
miss
campbell
married
*punct* ,
the
impression
may
be
a
little
worn
off
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
he
has
been
gone
just
four
weeks
*punct* ,
as
you
observe
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
said
miss
bates
*punct* ,
four
weeks
yesterday.
*punct* ,
a
miss
hawkins!
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
i
had
always
rather
fancied
it
would
be
some
young
lady
hereabouts
*punct* ;
not
that
i
ever
*punct* ,
mrs.
cole
once
whispered
to
me
*punct* ,
but
i
immediately
said
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
is
a
most
worthy
young
man
*punct* ,
but'
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
i
do
not
think
i
am
particularly
quick
at
those
sort
of
discoveries
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
pretend
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
before
me
*punct* ,
i
see
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
same
time
*punct* ,
nobody
could
wonder
if
mr.
elton
should
have
aspired
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
lets
me
chatter
on
*punct* ,
so
good-humouredly
*punct* .
*break*
she
knows
i
would
not
offend
for
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
how
does
miss
smith
do
*punct* ?
*break*
she
seems
quite
recovered
now
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
heard
from
mrs.
john
knightley
lately
*punct* ?
*break*
those
dear
little
children
*punct* .
*break*
jane
*punct* ,
do
you
know
i
always
fancy
mr.
dixon
like
mr.
john
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
i
mean
in
person
*punct* ,
tall
*punct* ,
and
with
that
sort
of
look
*punct* ,
and
not
very
talkative
*punct* .
*break*
quite
wrong
*punct* ,
my
dear
aunt
*punct* ;
there
is
no
likeness
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
but
one
never
does
form
a
just
idea
of
any
body
beforehand
*punct* .
*break*
one
takes
up
a
notion
*punct* ,
and
runs
away
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
dixon
*punct* ,
you
say
*punct* ,
is
not
*punct* ,
strictly
speaking
*punct* ,
handsome
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
far
from
it
*punct* ,
certainly
plain
*punct* .
*break*
i
told
you
he
was
plain
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
you
said
that
miss
campbell
would
not
allow
him
to
be
plain
*punct* ,
and
that
you
yourself
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
as
for
me
*punct* ,
my
judgment
is
worth
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
where
i
have
a
regard
*punct* ,
i
always
think
a
person
well-looking
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
gave
what
i
believed
the
general
opinion
*punct* ,
when
i
called
him
plain
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
my
dear
jane
*punct* ,
i
believe
we
must
be
running
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
weather
does
not
look
well
*punct* ,
and
grandmama
will
be
uneasy
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
too
obliging
*punct* ,
my
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ;
but
we
really
must
take
leave
*punct* .
*break*
this
has
been
a
most
agreeable
piece
of
news
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
just
go
round
by
mrs.
cole's
*punct* ;
but
i
shall
not
stop
three
minutes
*punct* :
and
*punct* ,
jane
*punct* ,
you
had
better
go
home
directly
*punct* ,
i
would
not
have
you
out
in
a
shower!
*punct* ,
we
think
she
is
the
better
for
highbury
already
*punct* .
*break*
thank
you
*punct* ,
we
do
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
not
attempt
calling
on
mrs.
goddard
*punct* ,
for
i
really
do
not
think
she
cares
for
any
thing
but
boiled
pork
*punct* :
when
we
dress
the
leg
it
will
be
another
thing
*punct* .
*break*
good
morning
to
you
*punct* ,
my
dear
sir
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
is
coming
too
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
that
is
so
very!
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
if
jane
is
tired
*punct* ,
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
give
her
your
arm.
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
and
miss
hawkins!
*punct* ,
good
morning
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
emma
*punct* ,
alone
with
her
father
*punct* ,
had
half
her
attention
wanted
by
him
while
he
lamented
that
young
people
would
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
marry
*punct* ,
and
to
marry
strangers
too
*punct* ,
and
the
other
half
she
could
give
to
her
own
view
of
the
subject
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
to
herself
an
amusing
and
a
very
welcome
piece
of
news
*punct* ,
as
proving
that
mr.
elton
could
not
have
suffered
long
*punct* ;
but
she
was
sorry
for
harriet
*punct* :
harriet
must
feel
it
*punct* ,
and
all
that
she
could
hope
was
*punct* ,
by
giving
the
first
information
herself
*punct* ,
to
save
her
from
hearing
it
abruptly
from
others
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
now
about
the
time
that
she
was
likely
to
call
*punct* .
*break*
if
she
were
to
meet
miss
bates
in
her
way!
*punct* ,
and
upon
its
beginning
to
rain
*punct* ,
emma
was
obliged
to
expect
that
the
weather
would
be
detaining
her
at
mrs.
goddard's
*punct* ,
and
that
the
intelligence
would
undoubtedly
rush
upon
her
without
preparation
*punct* .
*break*
the
shower
was
heavy
*punct* ,
but
short
*punct* ;
and
it
had
not
been
over
five
minutes
*punct* ,
when
in
came
harriet
*punct* ,
with
just
the
heated
*punct* ,
agitated
look
which
hurrying
thither
with
a
full
heart
was
likely
to
give
*punct* ;
and
the
oh
*punct* !
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
what
do
you
think
has
happened
*punct* !
*break*
which
instantly
burst
forth
*punct* ,
had
all
the
evidence
of
corresponding
perturbation
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
blow
was
given
*punct* ,
emma
felt
that
she
could
not
now
shew
greater
kindness
than
in
listening
*punct* ;
and
harriet
*punct* ,
unchecked
*punct* ,
ran
eagerly
through
what
she
had
to
tell
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
set
out
from
mrs.
goddard's
half
an
hour
ago
*punct* ,
she
had
been
afraid
it
would
rain
*punct* ,
she
had
been
afraid
it
would
pour
down
every
moment
*punct* ,
but
she
thought
she
might
get
to
hartfield
first
*punct* ,
she
had
hurried
on
as
fast
as
possible
*punct* ;
but
then
*punct* ,
as
she
was
passing
by
the
house
where
a
young
woman
was
making
up
a
gown
for
her
*punct* ,
she
thought
she
would
just
step
in
and
see
how
it
went
on
*punct* ;
and
though
she
did
not
seem
to
stay
half
a
moment
there
*punct* ,
soon
after
she
came
out
it
began
to
rain
*punct* ,
and
she
did
not
know
what
to
do
*punct* ;
so
she
ran
on
directly
*punct* ,
as
fast
as
she
could
*punct* ,
and
took
shelter
at
ford's.
*punct* ,
ford's
was
the
principal
woollen-draper
*punct* ,
linen-draper
*punct* ,
and
haberdasher's
shop
united
*punct* ;
the
shop
first
in
size
and
fashion
in
the
place.
*punct* ,
and
so
*punct* ,
there
she
had
set
*punct* ,
without
an
idea
of
any
thing
in
the
world
*punct* ,
full
ten
minutes
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
all
of
a
sudden
*punct* ,
who
should
come
in
*punct* ,
to
be
sure
it
was
so
very
odd!
*punct* ,
but
they
always
dealt
at
ford's
*punct* ,
who
should
come
in
*punct* ,
but
elizabeth
martin
and
her
brother!
*punct* ,
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* !
*break*
i
thought
i
should
have
fainted
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
sitting
near
the
door
*punct* ,
elizabeth
saw
me
directly
*punct* ;
but
he
did
not
*punct* ;
he
was
busy
with
the
umbrella
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
she
saw
me
*punct* ,
but
she
looked
away
directly
*punct* ,
and
took
no
notice
*punct* ;
and
they
both
went
to
quite
the
farther
end
of
the
shop
*punct* ;
and
i
kept
sitting
near
the
door!
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
dear
*punct* ;
i
was
so
miserable
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
sure
i
must
have
been
as
white
as
my
gown
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
go
away
you
know
*punct* ,
because
of
the
rain
*punct* ;
but
i
did
so
wish
myself
anywhere
in
the
world
but
there.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
dear
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
at
last
*punct* ,
i
fancy
*punct* ,
he
looked
round
and
saw
me
*punct* ;
for
instead
of
going
on
with
her
buyings
*punct* ,
they
began
whispering
to
one
another
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
they
were
talking
of
me
*punct* ;
and
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
he
was
persuading
her
to
speak
to
me
*punct* ,
do
you
think
he
was
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse?
*punct* ,
for
presently
she
came
forward
*punct* ,
came
quite
up
to
me
*punct* ,
and
asked
me
how
i
did
*punct* ,
and
seemed
ready
to
shake
hands
*punct* ,
if
i
would
*punct* .
*break*
she
did
not
do
any
of
it
in
the
same
way
that
she
used
*punct* ;
i
could
see
she
was
altered
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
she
seemed
to
try
to
be
very
friendly
*punct* ,
and
we
shook
hands
*punct* ,
and
stood
talking
some
time
*punct* ;
but
i
know
no
more
what
i
said
*punct* ,
i
was
in
such
a
tremble!
*punct* ,
i
remember
she
said
she
was
sorry
we
never
met
now
*punct* ;
which
i
thought
almost
too
kind
*punct* !
*break*
dear
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
i
was
absolutely
miserable
*punct* !
*break*
by
that
time
*punct* ,
it
was
beginning
to
hold
up
*punct* ,
and
i
was
determined
that
nothing
should
stop
me
from
getting
away
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
only
think!
*punct* ,
i
found
he
was
coming
up
towards
me
too
*punct* ,
slowly
you
know
*punct* ,
and
as
if
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
*punct* ;
and
so
he
came
and
spoke
*punct* ,
and
i
answered
*punct* ,
and
i
stood
for
a
minute
*punct* ,
feeling
dreadfully
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
one
can't
tell
how
*punct* ;
and
then
i
took
courage
*punct* ,
and
said
it
did
not
rain
*punct* ,
and
i
must
go
*punct* ;
and
so
off
i
set
*punct* ;
and
i
had
not
got
three
yards
from
the
door
*punct* ,
when
he
came
after
me
*punct* ,
only
to
say
*punct* ,
if
i
was
going
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
he
thought
i
had
much
better
go
round
by
mr.
cole's
stables
*punct* ,
for
i
should
find
the
near
way
quite
floated
by
this
rain
*punct* .
*break*
dear
*punct* ,
i
thought
it
would
have
been
the
death
of
me
*punct* !
*break*
so
i
said
*punct* ,
i
was
very
much
obliged
to
him
*punct* :
you
know
i
could
not
do
less
*punct* ;
and
then
he
went
back
to
elizabeth
*punct* ,
and
i
came
round
by
the
stables
*punct* ,
i
believe
i
did
*punct* ,
but
i
hardly
knew
where
i
was
*punct* ,
or
any
thing
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
i
would
rather
done
any
thing
than
have
it
happen
*punct* :
and
yet
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
there
was
a
sort
of
satisfaction
in
seeing
him
behave
so
pleasantly
and
so
kindly
*punct* .
*break*
and
elizabeth
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
do
talk
to
me
and
make
me
comfortable
again
*punct* .
*break*
very
sincerely
did
emma
wish
to
do
so
*punct* ;
but
it
was
not
immediately
in
her
power
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
obliged
to
stop
and
think
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
not
thoroughly
comfortable
herself
*punct* .
*break*
the
young
man's
conduct
*punct* ,
and
his
sister's
*punct* ,
seemed
the
result
of
real
feeling
*punct* ,
and
she
could
not
but
pity
them
*punct* .
*break*
as
harriet
described
it
*punct* ,
there
had
been
an
interesting
mixture
of
wounded
affection
and
genuine
delicacy
in
their
behaviour
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
had
believed
them
to
be
well-meaning
*punct* ,
worthy
people
before
*punct* ;
and
what
difference
did
this
make
in
the
evils
of
the
connexion
*punct* ?
*break*
it
was
folly
to
be
disturbed
by
it
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
*punct* ,
he
must
be
sorry
to
lose
her
*punct* ,
they
must
be
all
sorry
*punct* .
*break*
ambition
*punct* ,
as
well
as
love
*punct* ,
had
probably
been
mortified
*punct* .
*break*
they
might
all
have
hoped
to
rise
by
harriet's
acquaintance
*punct* :
and
besides
*punct* ,
what
was
the
value
of
harriet's
description?
*punct* ,
so
easily
pleased
*punct* ,
so
little
discerning;
*punct* ,
what
signified
her
praise
*punct* ?
*break*
she
exerted
herself
*punct* ,
and
did
try
to
make
her
comfortable
*punct* ,
by
considering
all
that
had
passed
as
a
mere
trifle
*punct* ,
and
quite
unworthy
of
being
dwelt
on
*punct* ,
it
might
be
distressing
*punct* ,
for
the
moment
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ;
but
you
seem
to
have
behaved
extremely
well
*punct* ;
and
it
is
over
*punct* ,
and
may
never
*punct* ,
can
never
*punct* ,
as
a
first
meeting
*punct* ,
occur
again
*punct* ,
and
therefore
you
need
not
think
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
said
*punct* ,
very
true
*punct* ,
and
she
would
not
think
about
it
*punct* ;
but
still
she
talked
of
it
*punct* ,
still
she
could
talk
of
nothing
else
*punct* ;
and
emma
*punct* ,
at
last
*punct* ,
in
order
to
put
the
martins
out
of
her
head
*punct* ,
was
obliged
to
hurry
on
the
news
*punct* ,
which
she
had
meant
to
give
with
so
much
tender
caution
*punct* ;
hardly
knowing
herself
whether
to
rejoice
or
be
angry
*punct* ,
ashamed
or
only
amused
*punct* ,
at
such
a
state
of
mind
in
poor
harriet
*punct* ,
such
a
conclusion
of
mr.
elton's
importance
with
her
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
elton's
rights
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
gradually
revived
*punct* .
*break*
though
she
did
not
feel
the
first
intelligence
as
she
might
have
done
the
day
before
*punct* ,
or
an
hour
before
*punct* ,
its
interest
soon
increased
*punct* ;
and
before
their
first
conversation
was
over
*punct* ,
she
had
talked
herself
into
all
the
sensations
of
curiosity
*punct* ,
wonder
and
regret
*punct* ,
pain
and
pleasure
*punct* ,
as
to
this
fortunate
miss
hawkins
*punct* ,
which
could
conduce
to
place
the
martins
under
proper
subordination
in
her
fancy
*punct* .
*break*
emma
learned
to
be
rather
glad
that
there
had
been
such
a
meeting
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
been
serviceable
in
deadening
the
first
shock
*punct* ,
without
retaining
any
influence
to
alarm
*punct* .
*break*
as
harriet
now
lived
*punct* ,
the
martins
could
not
get
at
her
*punct* ,
without
seeking
her
*punct* ,
where
hitherto
they
had
wanted
either
the
courage
or
the
condescension
to
seek
her
*punct* ;
for
since
her
refusal
of
the
brother
*punct* ,
the
sisters
never
had
been
at
mrs.
goddard's
*punct* ;
and
a
twelvemonth
might
pass
without
their
being
thrown
together
again
*punct* ,
with
any
necessity
*punct* ,
or
even
any
power
of
speech
*punct* .
*break*
human
nature
is
so
well
disposed
towards
those
who
are
in
interesting
situations
*punct* ,
that
a
young
person
*punct* ,
who
either
marries
or
dies
*punct* ,
is
sure
of
being
kindly
spoken
of
*punct* .
*break*
a
week
had
not
passed
since
miss
hawkins's
name
was
first
mentioned
in
highbury
*punct* ,
before
she
was
*punct* ,
by
some
means
or
other
*punct* ,
discovered
to
have
every
recommendation
of
person
and
mind
*punct* ;
to
be
handsome
*punct* ,
elegant
*punct* ,
highly
accomplished
*punct* ,
and
perfectly
amiable
*punct* :
and
when
mr.
elton
himself
arrived
to
triumph
in
his
happy
prospects
*punct* ,
and
circulate
the
fame
of
her
merits
*punct* ,
there
was
very
little
more
for
him
to
do
*punct* ,
than
to
tell
her
christian
name
*punct* ,
and
say
whose
music
she
principally
played
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
returned
*punct* ,
a
very
happy
man
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
gone
away
rejected
and
mortified
*punct* ,
disappointed
in
a
very
sanguine
hope
*punct* ,
after
a
series
of
what
appeared
to
him
strong
encouragement
*punct* ;
and
not
only
losing
the
right
lady
*punct* ,
but
finding
himself
debased
to
the
level
of
a
very
wrong
one
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
gone
away
deeply
offended
*punct* ,
he
came
back
engaged
to
another
*punct* ,
and
to
another
as
superior
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
to
the
first
*punct* ,
as
under
such
circumstances
what
is
gained
always
is
to
what
is
lost
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
back
gay
and
self-satisfied
*punct* ,
eager
and
busy
*punct* ,
caring
nothing
for
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
and
defying
miss
smith
*punct* .
*break*
or
thereabouts
*punct* ;
and
he
had
gained
her
with
such
delightful
rapidity
*punct* ,
the
first
hour
of
introduction
had
been
so
very
soon
followed
by
distinguishing
notice
*punct* ;
the
history
which
he
had
to
give
mrs.
cole
of
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
affair
was
so
glorious
*punct* ,
the
steps
so
quick
*punct* ,
from
the
accidental
rencontre
*punct* ,
to
the
dinner
at
mr.
green's
*punct* ,
and
the
party
at
mrs.
brown's
*punct* ,
smiles
and
blushes
rising
in
importance
*punct* ,
with
consciousness
and
agitation
richly
scattered
*punct* ,
the
lady
had
been
so
easily
impressed
*punct* ,
so
sweetly
disposed
*punct* ,
had
in
short
*punct* ,
to
use
a
most
intelligible
phrase
*punct* ,
been
so
very
ready
to
have
him
*punct* ,
that
vanity
and
prudence
were
equally
contented
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
caught
both
substance
and
shadow
*punct* ,
both
fortune
and
affection
*punct* ,
and
was
just
the
happy
man
he
ought
to
be
*punct* ;
talking
only
of
himself
and
his
own
concerns
*punct* ,
expecting
to
be
congratulated
*punct* ,
ready
to
be
laughed
at
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
with
cordial
*punct* ,
fearless
smiles
*punct* ,
now
addressing
all
the
young
ladies
of
the
place
*punct* ,
to
whom
*punct* ,
a
few
weeks
ago
*punct* ,
he
would
have
been
more
cautiously
gallant
*punct* .
*break*
the
wedding
was
no
distant
event
*punct* ,
as
the
parties
had
only
themselves
to
please
*punct* ,
and
nothing
but
the
necessary
preparations
to
wait
for
*punct* ;
and
when
he
set
out
for
bath
again
*punct* ,
there
was
a
general
expectation
*punct* ,
which
a
certain
glance
of
mrs.
cole's
did
not
seem
to
contradict
*punct* ,
that
when
he
next
entered
highbury
he
would
bring
his
bride
*punct* .
*break*
during
his
present
short
stay
*punct* ,
emma
had
barely
seen
him
*punct* ;
but
just
enough
to
feel
that
the
first
meeting
was
over
*punct* ,
and
to
give
her
the
impression
of
his
not
being
improved
by
the
mixture
of
pique
and
pretension
*punct* ,
now
spread
over
his
air
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
beginning
very
much
to
wonder
that
she
had
ever
thought
him
pleasing
at
all
*punct* ;
and
his
sight
was
so
inseparably
connected
with
some
very
disagreeable
feelings
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
except
in
a
moral
light
*punct* ,
as
a
penance
*punct* ,
a
lesson
*punct* ,
a
source
of
profitable
humiliation
to
her
own
mind
*punct* ,
she
would
have
been
thankful
to
be
assured
of
never
seeing
him
again
*punct* .
*break*
she
wished
him
very
well
*punct* ;
but
he
gave
her
pain
*punct* ,
and
his
welfare
twenty
miles
off
would
administer
most
satisfaction
*punct* .
*break*
the
pain
of
his
continued
residence
in
highbury
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
must
certainly
be
lessened
by
his
marriage
*punct* .
*break*
many
vain
solicitudes
would
be
prevented
*punct* ,
many
awkwardnesses
smoothed
by
it
*punct* .
*break*
a
mrs.
elton
would
be
an
excuse
for
any
change
of
intercourse
*punct* ;
former
intimacy
might
sink
without
remark
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
almost
beginning
their
life
of
civility
again
*punct* .
*break*
of
the
lady
*punct* ,
individually
*punct* ,
emma
thought
very
little
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
good
enough
for
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* ;
accomplished
enough
for
highbury
*punct* ,
handsome
enough
*punct* ,
to
look
plain
*punct* ,
probably
*punct* ,
by
harriet's
side
*punct* .
*break*
as
to
connexion
*punct* ,
there
emma
was
perfectly
easy
*punct* ;
persuaded
*punct* ,
that
after
all
his
own
vaunted
claims
and
disdain
of
harriet
*punct* ,
he
had
done
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
on
that
article
*punct* ,
truth
seemed
attainable
*punct* .
*break*
what
she
was
*punct* ,
must
be
uncertain
*punct* ;
but
who
she
was
*punct* ,
might
be
found
out
*punct* ;
and
setting
aside
the
10,000
l.
*punct* ,
it
did
not
appear
that
she
was
at
all
harriet's
superior
*punct* .
*break*
she
brought
no
name
*punct* ,
no
blood
*punct* ,
no
alliance
*punct* .
*break*
miss
hawkins
was
the
youngest
of
the
two
daughters
of
a
bristol
*punct* ,
merchant
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
he
must
be
called
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
the
whole
of
the
profits
of
his
mercantile
life
appeared
so
very
moderate
*punct* ,
it
was
not
unfair
to
guess
the
dignity
of
his
line
of
trade
had
been
very
moderate
also
*punct* .
*break*
part
of
every
winter
she
had
been
used
to
spend
in
bath
*punct* ;
but
bristol
was
her
home
*punct* ,
the
very
heart
of
bristol
*punct* ;
for
though
the
father
and
mother
had
died
some
years
ago
*punct* ,
an
uncle
remained
*punct* ,
in
the
law
line
*punct* ,
nothing
more
distinctly
honourable
was
hazarded
of
him
*punct* ,
than
that
he
was
in
the
law
line
*punct* ;
and
with
him
the
daughter
had
lived
*punct* .
*break*
emma
guessed
him
to
be
the
drudge
of
some
attorney
*punct* ,
and
too
stupid
to
rise
*punct* .
*break*
and
all
the
grandeur
of
the
connexion
seemed
dependent
on
the
elder
sister
*punct* ,
who
was
very
well
married
*punct* ,
to
a
gentleman
in
a
great
way
*punct* ,
near
bristol
*punct* ,
who
kept
two
carriages
*punct* !
*break*
that
was
the
wind-up
of
the
history
*punct* ;
that
was
the
glory
of
miss
hawkins
*punct* .
*break*
could
she
but
have
given
harriet
her
feelings
about
it
all
*punct* !
*break*
she
had
talked
her
into
love
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
alas
*punct* !
*break*
she
was
not
so
easily
to
be
talked
out
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
charm
of
an
object
to
occupy
the
many
vacancies
of
harriet's
mind
was
not
to
be
talked
away
*punct* .
*break*
he
might
be
superseded
by
another
*punct* ;
he
certainly
would
indeed
*punct* ;
nothing
could
be
clearer
*punct* ;
even
a
robert
martin
would
have
been
sufficient
*punct* ;
but
nothing
else
*punct* ,
she
feared
*punct* ,
would
cure
her
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
was
one
of
those
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
having
once
begun
*punct* ,
would
be
always
in
love
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
*punct* ,
poor
girl
*punct* !
*break*
she
was
considerably
worse
from
this
reappearance
of
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
always
having
a
glimpse
of
him
somewhere
or
other
*punct* .
*break*
emma
saw
him
only
once
*punct* ;
but
two
or
three
times
every
day
harriet
was
sure
just
to
meet
with
him
*punct* ,
or
just
to
miss
him
*punct* ,
just
to
hear
his
voice
*punct* ,
or
see
his
shoulder
*punct* ,
just
to
have
something
occur
to
preserve
him
in
her
fancy
*punct* ,
in
all
the
favouring
warmth
of
surprize
and
conjecture
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
perpetually
hearing
about
him
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
excepting
when
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
she
was
always
among
those
who
saw
no
fault
in
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
and
found
nothing
so
interesting
as
the
discussion
of
his
concerns
*punct* ;
and
every
report
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
every
guess
*punct* ,
all
that
had
already
occurred
*punct* ,
all
that
might
occur
in
the
arrangement
of
his
affairs
*punct* ,
comprehending
income
*punct* ,
servants
*punct* ,
and
furniture
*punct* ,
was
continually
in
agitation
around
her
*punct* .
*break*
her
regard
was
receiving
strength
by
invariable
praise
of
him
*punct* ,
and
her
regrets
kept
alive
*punct* ,
and
feelings
irritated
by
ceaseless
repetitions
of
miss
hawkins's
happiness
*punct* ,
and
continual
observation
of
*punct* ,
how
much
he
seemed
attached!
*punct* ,
his
air
as
he
walked
by
the
house
*punct* ,
the
very
sitting
of
his
hat
*punct* ,
being
all
in
proof
of
how
much
he
was
in
love
*punct* !
*break*
had
it
been
allowable
entertainment
*punct* ,
had
there
been
no
pain
to
her
friend
*punct* ,
or
reproach
to
herself
*punct* ,
in
the
waverings
of
harriet's
mind
*punct* ,
emma
would
have
been
amused
by
its
variations
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
mr.
elton
predominated
*punct* ,
sometimes
the
martins
*punct* ;
and
each
was
occasionally
useful
as
a
check
to
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton's
engagement
had
been
the
cure
of
the
agitation
of
meeting
mr.
martin
*punct* .
*break*
the
unhappiness
produced
by
the
knowledge
of
that
engagement
had
been
a
little
put
aside
by
elizabeth
martin's
calling
at
mrs.
goddard's
a
few
days
afterwards
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
had
not
been
at
home
*punct* ;
but
a
note
had
been
prepared
and
left
for
her
*punct* ,
written
in
the
very
style
to
touch
*punct* ;
a
small
mixture
of
reproach
*punct* ,
with
a
great
deal
of
kindness
*punct* ;
and
till
mr.
elton
himself
appeared
*punct* ,
she
had
been
much
occupied
by
it
*punct* ,
continually
pondering
over
what
could
be
done
in
return
*punct* ,
and
wishing
to
do
more
than
she
dared
to
confess
*punct* .
*break*
but
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
in
person
*punct* ,
had
driven
away
all
such
cares
*punct* .
*break*
while
he
staid
*punct* ,
the
martins
were
forgotten
*punct* ;
and
on
the
very
morning
of
his
setting
off
for
bath
again
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
to
dissipate
some
of
the
distress
it
occasioned
*punct* ,
judged
it
best
for
her
to
return
elizabeth
martin's
visit
*punct* .
*break*
how
that
visit
was
to
be
acknowledged
*punct* ,
what
would
be
necessary
*punct* ,
and
what
might
be
safest
*punct* ,
had
been
a
point
of
some
doubtful
consideration
*punct* .
*break*
absolute
neglect
of
the
mother
and
sisters
*punct* ,
when
invited
to
come
*punct* ,
would
be
ingratitude
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
not
be
*punct* :
and
yet
the
danger
of
a
renewal
of
the
acquaintance!
*punct* ,
after
much
thinking
*punct* ,
she
could
determine
on
nothing
better
*punct* ,
than
harriet's
returning
the
visit
*punct* ;
but
in
a
way
that
*punct* ,
if
they
had
understanding
*punct* ,
should
convince
them
that
it
was
to
be
only
a
formal
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
she
meant
to
take
her
in
the
carriage
*punct* ,
leave
her
at
the
abbey
mill
*punct* ,
while
she
drove
a
little
farther
*punct* ,
and
call
for
her
again
so
soon
*punct* ,
as
to
allow
no
time
for
insidious
applications
or
dangerous
recurrences
to
the
past
*punct* ,
and
give
the
most
decided
proof
of
what
degree
of
intimacy
was
chosen
for
the
future
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
think
of
nothing
better
*punct* :
and
though
there
was
something
in
it
which
her
own
heart
could
not
approve
*punct* ,
something
of
ingratitude
*punct* ,
merely
glossed
over
*punct* ,
it
must
be
done
*punct* ,
or
what
would
become
of
harriet
*punct* ?
*break*
small
heart
had
harriet
for
visiting
*punct* .
*break*
only
half
an
hour
before
her
friend
called
for
her
at
mrs.
goddard's
*punct* ,
her
evil
stars
had
led
her
to
the
very
spot
where
*punct* ,
at
that
moment
*punct* ,
a
trunk
*punct* ,
directed
to
the
rev
*punct* .
*break*
philip
elton
*punct* ,
white-hart
*punct* ,
bath
*punct* ,
was
to
be
seen
under
the
operation
of
being
lifted
into
the
butcher's
cart
*punct* ,
which
was
to
convey
it
to
where
the
coaches
past
*punct* ;
and
every
thing
in
this
world
*punct* ,
excepting
that
trunk
and
the
direction
*punct* ,
was
consequently
a
blank
*punct* .
*break*
she
went
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ;
and
when
they
reached
the
farm
*punct* ,
and
she
was
to
be
put
down
*punct* ,
at
the
end
of
the
broad
*punct* ,
neat
gravel
walk
*punct* ,
which
led
between
espalier
apple-trees
to
the
front
door
*punct* ,
the
sight
of
every
thing
which
had
given
her
so
much
pleasure
the
autumn
before
*punct* ,
was
beginning
to
revive
a
little
local
agitation
*punct* ;
and
when
they
parted
*punct* ,
emma
observed
her
to
be
looking
around
with
a
sort
of
fearful
curiosity
*punct* ,
which
determined
her
not
to
allow
the
visit
to
exceed
the
proposed
quarter
of
an
hour
*punct* .
*break*
she
went
on
herself
*punct* ,
to
give
that
portion
of
time
to
an
old
servant
who
was
married
*punct* ,
and
settled
in
donwell
*punct* .
*break*
the
quarter
of
an
hour
brought
her
punctually
to
the
white
gate
again
*punct* ;
and
miss
smith
receiving
her
summons
*punct* ,
was
with
her
without
delay
*punct* ,
and
unattended
by
any
alarming
young
man
*punct* .
*break*
she
came
solitarily
down
the
gravel
walk
*punct* ,
a
miss
martin
just
appearing
at
the
door
*punct* ,
and
parting
with
her
seemingly
with
ceremonious
civility
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
could
not
very
soon
give
an
intelligible
account
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
feeling
too
much
*punct* ;
but
at
last
emma
collected
from
her
enough
to
understand
the
sort
of
meeting
*punct* ,
and
the
sort
of
pain
it
was
creating
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
seen
only
mrs.
martin
and
the
two
girls
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
received
her
doubtingly
*punct* ,
if
not
coolly
*punct* ;
and
nothing
beyond
the
merest
commonplace
had
been
talked
almost
all
the
time
*punct* ,
till
just
at
last
*punct* ,
when
mrs.
martin's
saying
*punct* ,
all
of
a
sudden
*punct* ,
that
she
thought
miss
smith
was
grown
*punct* ,
had
brought
on
a
more
interesting
subject
*punct* ,
and
a
warmer
manner
*punct* .
*break*
in
that
very
room
she
had
been
measured
last
september
*punct* ,
with
her
two
friends
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
the
pencilled
marks
and
memorandums
on
the
wainscot
by
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
done
it
*punct* .
*break*
they
all
seemed
to
remember
the
day
*punct* ,
the
hour
*punct* ,
the
party
*punct* ,
the
occasion
*punct* ,
to
feel
the
same
consciousness
*punct* ,
the
same
regrets
*punct* ,
to
be
ready
to
return
to
the
same
good
understanding
*punct* ;
and
they
were
just
growing
again
like
themselves
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
as
emma
must
suspect
*punct* ,
as
ready
as
the
best
of
them
to
be
cordial
and
happy,
*punct* ,
when
the
carriage
reappeared
*punct* ,
and
all
was
over
*punct* .
*break*
the
style
of
the
visit
*punct* ,
and
the
shortness
of
it
*punct* ,
were
then
felt
to
be
decisive
*punct* .
*break*
fourteen
minutes
to
be
given
to
those
with
whom
she
had
thankfully
passed
six
weeks
not
six
months
ago!
*punct* ,
emma
could
not
but
picture
it
all
*punct* ,
and
feel
how
justly
they
might
resent
*punct* ,
how
naturally
harriet
must
suffer
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
bad
business
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
have
given
a
great
deal
*punct* ,
or
endured
a
great
deal
*punct* ,
to
have
had
the
martins
in
a
higher
rank
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
so
deserving
*punct* ,
that
a
little
higher
should
have
been
enough
*punct* :
but
as
it
was
*punct* ,
how
could
she
have
done
otherwise?
*punct* ,
impossible!
*punct* ,
she
could
not
repent
*punct* .
*break*
they
must
be
separated
*punct* ;
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
pain
in
the
process
*punct* ,
so
much
to
herself
at
this
time
*punct* ,
that
she
soon
felt
the
necessity
of
a
little
consolation
*punct* ,
and
resolved
on
going
home
by
way
of
randalls
to
procure
it
*punct* .
*break*
her
mind
was
quite
sick
of
mr.
elton
and
the
martins
*punct* .
*break*
the
refreshment
of
randalls
was
absolutely
necessary
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
good
scheme
*punct* ;
but
on
driving
to
the
door
they
heard
that
neither
master
nor
mistress
was
at
home
*punct* ;
they
had
both
been
out
some
time
*punct* ;
the
man
believed
they
were
gone
to
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
too
bad
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* ,
as
they
turned
away
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
we
shall
just
miss
them
*punct* ;
too
provoking!
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
when
i
have
been
so
disappointed
*punct* .
*break*
and
she
leaned
back
in
the
corner
*punct* ,
to
indulge
her
murmurs
*punct* ,
or
to
reason
them
away
*punct* ;
probably
a
little
of
both
*punct* ,
such
being
the
commonest
process
of
a
not
ill-disposed
mind
*punct* .
*break*
presently
the
carriage
stopt
*punct* ;
she
looked
up
*punct* ;
it
was
stopt
by
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
who
were
standing
to
speak
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
instant
pleasure
in
the
sight
of
them
*punct* ,
and
still
greater
pleasure
was
conveyed
in
sound
*punct* ,
for
mr.
weston
immediately
accosted
her
with
*punct* ,
how
d'ye
do?
*punct* ,
how
d'ye
do?
*punct* ,
we
have
been
sitting
with
your
father
*punct* ,
glad
to
see
him
so
well
*punct* .
*break*
frank
comes
to-morrow
*punct* ,
i
had
a
letter
this
morning
*punct* ,
we
see
him
to-morrow
by
dinner-time
to
a
certainty
*punct* ,
he
is
at
oxford
to-day
*punct* ,
and
he
comes
for
a
whole
fortnight
*punct* ;
i
knew
it
would
be
so
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
had
come
at
christmas
he
could
not
have
staid
three
days
*punct* ;
i
was
always
glad
he
did
not
come
at
christmas
*punct* ;
now
we
are
going
to
have
just
the
right
weather
for
him
*punct* ,
fine
*punct* ,
dry
*punct* ,
settled
weather
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
enjoy
him
completely
*punct* ;
every
thing
has
turned
out
exactly
as
we
could
wish
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
resisting
such
news
*punct* ,
no
possibility
of
avoiding
the
influence
of
such
a
happy
face
as
mr.
weston's
*punct* ,
confirmed
as
it
all
was
by
the
words
and
the
countenance
of
his
wife
*punct* ,
fewer
and
quieter
*punct* ,
but
not
less
to
the
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
to
know
that
she
thought
his
coming
certain
was
enough
to
make
emma
consider
it
so
*punct* ,
and
sincerely
did
she
rejoice
in
their
joy
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
most
delightful
reanimation
of
exhausted
spirits
*punct* .
*break*
the
worn-out
past
was
sunk
in
the
freshness
of
what
was
coming
*punct* ;
and
in
the
rapidity
of
half
a
moment's
thought
*punct* ,
she
hoped
mr.
elton
would
now
be
talked
of
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
gave
her
the
history
of
the
engagements
at
enscombe
*punct* ,
which
allowed
his
son
to
answer
for
having
an
entire
fortnight
at
his
command
*punct* ,
as
well
as
the
route
and
the
method
of
his
journey
*punct* ;
and
she
listened
*punct* ,
and
smiled
*punct* ,
and
congratulated
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
soon
bring
him
over
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
at
the
conclusion
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
imagine
she
saw
a
touch
of
the
arm
at
this
speech
*punct* ,
from
his
wife
*punct* .
*break*
we
had
better
move
on
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
we
are
detaining
the
girls
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
i
am
ready;
*punct* ,
and
turning
again
to
emma
*punct* ,
but
you
must
not
be
expecting
such
a
very
fine
young
man
*punct* ;
you
have
only
had
my
account
you
know
*punct* ;
i
dare
say
he
is
really
nothing
extraordinary:
*punct* ,
though
his
own
sparkling
eyes
at
the
moment
were
speaking
a
very
different
conviction
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
look
perfectly
unconscious
and
innocent
*punct* ,
and
answer
in
a
manner
that
appropriated
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
think
of
me
to-morrow
*punct* ,
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
about
four
o'clock
*punct* ,
was
mrs.
weston's
parting
injunction
*punct* ;
spoken
with
some
anxiety
*punct* ,
and
meant
only
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
four
o'clock!
*punct* ,
depend
upon
it
he
will
be
here
by
three
*punct* ,
was
mr.
weston's
quick
amendment
*punct* ;
and
so
ended
a
most
satisfactory
meeting
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
spirits
were
mounted
quite
up
to
happiness
*punct* ;
every
thing
wore
a
different
air
*punct* ;
james
and
his
horses
seemed
not
half
so
sluggish
as
before
*punct* .
*break*
when
she
looked
at
the
hedges
*punct* ,
she
thought
the
elder
at
least
must
soon
be
coming
out
*punct* ;
and
when
she
turned
round
to
harriet
*punct* ,
she
saw
something
like
a
look
of
spring
*punct* ,
a
tender
smile
even
there
*punct* .
*break*
will
mr.
frank
churchill
pass
through
bath
as
well
as
oxford?
*punct* ,
was
a
question
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
which
did
not
augur
much
*punct* .
*break*
but
neither
geography
nor
tranquillity
could
come
all
at
once
*punct* ,
and
emma
was
now
in
a
humour
to
resolve
that
they
should
both
come
in
time
*punct* .
*break*
the
morning
of
the
interesting
day
arrived
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
weston's
faithful
pupil
did
not
forget
either
at
ten
*punct* ,
or
eleven
*punct* ,
or
twelve
o'clock
*punct* ,
that
she
was
to
think
of
her
at
four
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
dear
anxious
friend,
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
in
mental
soliloquy
*punct* ,
while
walking
downstairs
from
her
own
room
*punct* ,
always
overcareful
for
every
body's
comfort
but
your
own
*punct* ;
i
see
you
now
in
all
your
little
fidgets
*punct* ,
going
again
and
again
into
his
room
*punct* ,
to
be
sure
that
all
is
right
*punct* .
*break*
the
clock
struck
twelve
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
*punct* .
*break*
tis
twelve
*punct* ;
i
shall
not
forget
to
think
of
you
four
hours
hence
*punct* ;
and
by
this
time
to-morrow
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
or
a
little
later
*punct* ,
i
may
be
thinking
of
the
possibility
of
their
all
calling
here
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
they
will
bring
him
soon
*punct* .
*break*
she
opened
the
parlour
door
*punct* ,
and
saw
two
gentlemen
sitting
with
her
father
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
and
his
son
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
been
arrived
only
a
few
minutes
*punct* ,
and
mr.
weston
had
scarcely
finished
his
explanation
of
frank's
being
a
day
before
his
time
*punct* ,
and
her
father
was
yet
in
the
midst
of
his
very
civil
welcome
and
congratulations
*punct* ,
when
she
appeared
*punct* ,
to
have
her
share
of
surprize
*punct* ,
introduction
*punct* ,
and
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
the
frank
churchill
so
long
talked
of
*punct* ,
so
high
in
interest
*punct* ,
was
actually
before
her
*punct* ,
he
was
presented
to
her
*punct* ,
and
she
did
not
think
too
much
had
been
said
in
his
praise
*punct* ;
he
was
a
very
good
looking
young
man
*punct* ;
height
*punct* ,
air
*punct* ,
address
*punct* ,
all
were
unexceptionable
*punct* ,
and
his
countenance
had
a
great
deal
of
the
spirit
and
liveliness
of
his
father's
*punct* ;
he
looked
quick
and
sensible
*punct* .
*break*
she
felt
immediately
that
she
should
like
him
*punct* ;
and
there
was
a
well-bred
ease
of
manner
*punct* ,
and
a
readiness
to
talk
*punct* ,
which
convinced
her
that
he
came
intending
to
be
acquainted
with
her
*punct* ,
and
that
acquainted
they
soon
must
be
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
reached
randalls
the
evening
before
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
pleased
with
the
eagerness
to
arrive
which
had
made
him
alter
his
plan
*punct* ,
and
travel
earlier
*punct* ,
later
*punct* ,
and
quicker
*punct* ,
that
he
might
gain
half
a
day
*punct* .
*break*
i
told
you
yesterday
*punct* ,
cried
mr.
weston
with
exultation
*punct* ,
i
told
you
all
that
he
would
be
here
before
the
time
named
*punct* .
*break*
i
remembered
what
i
used
to
do
myself
*punct* .
*break*
one
cannot
creep
upon
a
journey
*punct* ;
one
cannot
help
getting
on
faster
than
one
has
planned
*punct* ;
and
the
pleasure
of
coming
in
upon
one's
friends
before
the
look-out
begins
*punct* ,
is
worth
a
great
deal
more
than
any
little
exertion
it
needs
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
great
pleasure
where
one
can
indulge
in
it
*punct* ,
said
the
young
man
*punct* ,
though
there
are
not
many
houses
that
i
should
presume
on
so
far
*punct* ;
but
in
coming
home
i
felt
i
might
do
any
thing
*punct* .
*break*
the
word
home
made
his
father
look
on
him
with
fresh
complacency
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
directly
sure
that
he
knew
how
to
make
himself
agreeable
*punct* ;
the
conviction
was
strengthened
by
what
followed
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
very
much
pleased
with
randalls
*punct* ,
thought
it
a
most
admirably
arranged
house
*punct* ,
would
hardly
allow
it
even
to
be
very
small
*punct* ,
admired
the
situation
*punct* ,
the
walk
to
highbury
*punct* ,
highbury
itself
*punct* ,
hartfield
still
more
*punct* ,
and
professed
himself
to
have
always
felt
the
sort
of
interest
in
the
country
which
none
but
one's
own
country
gives
*punct* ,
and
the
greatest
curiosity
to
visit
it
*punct* .
*break*
that
he
should
never
have
been
able
to
indulge
so
amiable
a
feeling
before
*punct* ,
passed
suspiciously
through
emma's
brain
*punct* ;
but
still
*punct* ,
if
it
were
a
falsehood
*punct* ,
it
was
a
pleasant
one
*punct* ,
and
pleasantly
handled
*punct* .
*break*
his
manner
had
no
air
of
study
or
exaggeration
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
really
look
and
speak
as
if
in
a
state
of
no
common
enjoyment
*punct* .
*break*
their
subjects
in
general
were
such
as
belong
to
an
opening
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
on
his
side
were
the
inquiries,
*punct* ,
was
she
a
horsewoman?
*punct* ,
pleasant
rides?
*punct* ,
pleasant
walks?
*punct* ,
had
they
a
large
neighbourhood?
*punct* ,
highbury
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
afforded
society
enough?
*punct* ,
there
were
several
very
pretty
houses
in
and
about
it.
*punct* ,
balls
*punct* ,
had
they
balls?
*punct* ,
was
it
a
musical
society
*punct* ?
*break*
but
when
satisfied
on
all
these
points
*punct* ,
and
their
acquaintance
proportionably
advanced
*punct* ,
he
contrived
to
find
an
opportunity
*punct* ,
while
their
two
fathers
were
engaged
with
each
other
*punct* ,
of
introducing
his
mother-in-law
*punct* ,
and
speaking
of
her
with
so
much
handsome
praise
*punct* ,
so
much
warm
admiration
*punct* ,
so
much
gratitude
for
the
happiness
she
secured
to
his
father
*punct* ,
and
her
very
kind
reception
of
himself
*punct* ,
as
was
an
additional
proof
of
his
knowing
how
to
please
*punct* ,
and
of
his
certainly
thinking
it
worth
while
to
try
to
please
her
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
advance
a
word
of
praise
beyond
what
she
knew
to
be
thoroughly
deserved
by
mrs.
weston
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
undoubtedly
he
could
know
very
little
of
the
matter
*punct* .
*break*
he
understood
what
would
be
welcome
*punct* ;
he
could
be
sure
of
little
else
*punct* .
*break*
his
father's
marriage
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
had
been
the
wisest
measure
*punct* ,
every
friend
must
rejoice
in
it
*punct* ;
and
the
family
from
whom
he
had
received
such
a
blessing
must
be
ever
considered
as
having
conferred
the
highest
obligation
on
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
got
as
near
as
he
could
to
thanking
her
for
miss
taylor's
merits
*punct* ,
without
seeming
quite
to
forget
that
in
the
common
course
of
things
it
was
to
be
rather
supposed
that
miss
taylor
had
formed
miss
woodhouse's
character
*punct* ,
than
miss
woodhouse
miss
taylor's
*punct* .
*break*
and
at
last
*punct* ,
as
if
resolved
to
qualify
his
opinion
completely
for
travelling
round
to
its
object
*punct* ,
he
wound
it
all
up
with
astonishment
at
the
youth
and
beauty
of
her
person
*punct* .
*break*
elegant
*punct* ,
agreeable
manners
*punct* ,
i
was
prepared
for
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ;
but
i
confess
that
*punct* ,
considering
every
thing
*punct* ,
i
had
not
expected
more
than
a
very
tolerably
well-looking
woman
of
a
certain
age
*punct* ;
i
did
not
know
that
i
was
to
find
a
pretty
young
woman
in
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
you
cannot
see
too
much
perfection
in
mrs.
weston
for
my
feelings
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ;
were
you
to
guess
her
to
be
eighteen
*punct* ,
i
should
listen
with
pleasure
*punct* ;
but
she
would
be
ready
to
quarrel
with
you
for
using
such
words
*punct* .
*break*
don't
let
her
imagine
that
you
have
spoken
of
her
as
a
pretty
young
woman
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
i
should
know
better
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ;
no
*punct* ,
depend
upon
it
*punct* ,
with
a
gallant
bow,
*punct* ,
that
in
addressing
mrs.
weston
i
should
understand
whom
i
might
praise
without
any
danger
of
being
thought
extravagant
in
my
terms
*punct* .
*break*
emma
wondered
whether
the
same
suspicion
of
what
might
be
expected
from
their
knowing
each
other
*punct* ,
which
had
taken
strong
possession
of
her
mind
*punct* ,
had
ever
crossed
his
*punct* ;
and
whether
his
compliments
were
to
be
considered
as
marks
of
acquiescence
*punct* ,
or
proofs
of
defiance
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
see
more
of
him
to
understand
his
ways
*punct* ;
at
present
she
only
felt
they
were
agreeable
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
no
doubt
of
what
mr.
weston
was
often
thinking
about
*punct* .
*break*
his
quick
eye
she
detected
again
and
again
glancing
towards
them
with
a
happy
expression
*punct* ;
and
even
*punct* ,
when
he
might
have
determined
not
to
look
*punct* ,
she
was
confident
that
he
was
often
listening
*punct* .
*break*
her
own
father's
perfect
exemption
from
any
thought
of
the
kind
*punct* ,
the
entire
deficiency
in
him
of
all
such
sort
of
penetration
or
suspicion
*punct* ,
was
a
most
comfortable
circumstance
*punct* .
*break*
happily
he
was
not
farther
from
approving
matrimony
than
from
foreseeing
it.
*punct* ,
though
always
objecting
to
every
marriage
that
was
arranged
*punct* ,
he
never
suffered
beforehand
from
the
apprehension
of
any
*punct* ;
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
think
so
ill
of
any
two
persons
understanding
as
to
suppose
they
meant
to
marry
till
it
were
proved
against
them
*punct* .
*break*
she
blessed
the
favouring
blindness
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
now
*punct* ,
without
the
drawback
of
a
single
unpleasant
surmise
*punct* ,
without
a
glance
forward
at
any
possible
treachery
in
his
guest
*punct* ,
give
way
to
all
his
natural
kind-hearted
civility
in
solicitous
inquiries
after
mr.
frank
churchill's
accommodation
on
his
journey
*punct* ,
through
the
sad
evils
of
sleeping
two
nights
on
the
road
*punct* ,
and
express
very
genuine
unmixed
anxiety
to
know
that
he
had
certainly
escaped
catching
cold
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
could
not
allow
him
to
feel
quite
assured
of
himself
till
after
another
night
*punct* .
*break*
a
reasonable
visit
paid
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
began
to
move.
*punct* ,
he
must
be
going
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
business
at
the
crown
about
his
hay
*punct* ,
and
a
great
many
errands
for
mrs.
weston
at
ford's
*punct* ,
but
he
need
not
hurry
any
body
else
*punct* .
*break*
his
son
*punct* ,
too
well
bred
to
hear
the
hint
*punct* ,
rose
immediately
also
*punct* ,
saying
*punct* ,
as
you
are
going
farther
on
business
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
i
will
take
the
opportunity
of
paying
a
visit
*punct* ,
which
must
be
paid
some
day
or
other
*punct* ,
and
therefore
may
as
well
be
paid
now
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
the
honour
of
being
acquainted
with
a
neighbour
of
yours
*punct* ,
turning
to
emma,
*punct* ,
a
lady
residing
in
or
near
highbury
*punct* ;
a
family
of
the
name
of
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
have
no
difficulty
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
in
finding
the
house
*punct* ;
though
fairfax
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
is
not
the
proper
name
*punct* ,
i
should
rather
say
barnes
*punct* ,
or
bates
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
know
any
family
of
that
name
*punct* ?
*break*
to
be
sure
we
do
*punct* ,
cried
his
father
*punct* ;
mrs.
bates
*punct* ,
we
passed
her
house
*punct* ,
i
saw
miss
bates
at
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
true
*punct* ,
true
*punct* ,
you
are
acquainted
with
miss
fairfax
*punct* ;
i
remember
you
knew
her
at
weymouth
*punct* ,
and
a
fine
girl
she
is
*punct* .
*break*
call
upon
her
*punct* ,
by
all
means
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
necessity
for
my
calling
this
morning
*punct* ,
said
the
young
man
*punct* ;
another
day
would
do
as
well
*punct* ;
but
there
was
that
degree
of
acquaintance
at
weymouth
which
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
go
to-day
*punct* ,
go
to-day
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
defer
it
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
right
to
be
done
cannot
be
done
too
soon
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
besides
*punct* ,
i
must
give
you
a
hint
*punct* ,
frank
*punct* ;
any
want
of
attention
to
her
here
should
be
carefully
avoided
*punct* .
*break*
you
saw
her
with
the
campbells
*punct* ,
when
she
was
the
equal
of
every
body
she
mixed
with
*punct* ,
but
here
she
is
with
a
poor
old
grandmother
*punct* ,
who
has
barely
enough
to
live
on
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
do
not
call
early
it
will
be
a
slight
*punct* .
*break*
the
son
looked
convinced
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
heard
her
speak
of
the
acquaintance
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ;
she
is
a
very
elegant
young
woman
*punct* .
*break*
he
agreed
to
it
*punct* ,
but
with
so
quiet
a
yes
*punct* ,
as
inclined
her
almost
to
doubt
his
real
concurrence
*punct* ;
and
yet
there
must
be
a
very
distinct
sort
of
elegance
for
the
fashionable
world
*punct* ,
if
jane
fairfax
could
be
thought
only
ordinarily
gifted
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
were
never
particularly
struck
by
her
manners
before
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
i
think
you
will
to-day
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
see
her
to
advantage
*punct* ;
see
her
and
hear
her
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
i
am
afraid
you
will
not
hear
her
at
all
*punct* ,
for
she
has
an
aunt
who
never
holds
her
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
acquainted
with
miss
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
are
you
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
always
the
last
to
make
his
way
in
conversation
*punct* ;
then
give
me
leave
to
assure
you
that
you
will
find
her
a
very
agreeable
young
lady
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
staying
here
on
a
visit
to
her
grandmama
and
aunt
*punct* ,
very
worthy
people
*punct* ;
i
have
known
them
all
my
life
*punct* .
*break*
they
will
be
extremely
glad
to
see
you
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* ;
and
one
of
my
servants
shall
go
with
you
to
shew
you
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
upon
no
account
in
the
world
*punct* ;
my
father
can
direct
me
*punct* .
*break*
but
your
father
is
not
going
so
far
*punct* ;
he
is
only
going
to
the
crown
*punct* ,
quite
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
*punct* ,
and
there
are
a
great
many
houses
*punct* ;
you
might
be
very
much
at
a
loss
*punct* ,
and
it
is
a
very
dirty
walk
*punct* ,
unless
you
keep
on
the
footpath
*punct* ;
but
my
coachman
can
tell
you
where
you
had
best
cross
the
street
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
frank
churchill
still
declined
it
*punct* ,
looking
as
serious
as
he
could
*punct* ,
and
his
father
gave
his
hearty
support
by
calling
out
*punct* ,
my
good
friend
*punct* ,
this
is
quite
unnecessary
*punct* ;
frank
knows
a
puddle
of
water
when
he
sees
it
*punct* ,
and
as
to
mrs.
bates's
*punct* ,
he
may
get
there
from
the
crown
in
a
hop
*punct* ,
step
*punct* ,
and
jump
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
permitted
to
go
alone
*punct* ;
and
with
a
cordial
nod
from
one
*punct* ,
and
a
graceful
bow
from
the
other
*punct* ,
the
two
gentlemen
took
leave
*punct* .
*break*
emma
remained
very
well
pleased
with
this
beginning
of
the
acquaintance
*punct* ,
and
could
now
engage
to
think
of
them
all
at
randalls
any
hour
of
the
day
*punct* ,
with
full
confidence
in
their
comfort
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
morning
brought
mr.
frank
churchill
again
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
with
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
to
whom
and
to
highbury
he
seemed
to
take
very
cordially
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
sitting
with
her
*punct* ,
it
appeared
*punct* ,
most
companionably
at
home
*punct* ,
till
her
usual
hour
of
exercise
*punct* ;
and
on
being
desired
to
chuse
their
walk
*punct* ,
immediately
fixed
on
highbury.
*punct* ,
he
did
not
doubt
there
being
very
pleasant
walks
in
every
direction
*punct* ,
but
if
left
to
him
*punct* ,
he
should
always
chuse
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
highbury
*punct* ,
that
airy
*punct* ,
cheerful
*punct* ,
happy-looking
highbury
*punct* ,
would
be
his
constant
attraction.
*punct* ,
highbury
*punct* ,
with
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
stood
for
hartfield
*punct* ;
and
she
trusted
to
its
bearing
the
same
construction
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
they
walked
thither
directly
*punct* .
*break*
emma
had
hardly
expected
them
*punct* :
for
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
who
had
called
in
for
half
a
minute
*punct* ,
in
order
to
hear
that
his
son
was
very
handsome
*punct* ,
knew
nothing
of
their
plans
*punct* ;
and
it
was
an
agreeable
surprize
to
her
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
to
perceive
them
walking
up
to
the
house
together
*punct* ,
arm
in
arm
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
wanting
to
see
him
again
*punct* ,
and
especially
to
see
him
in
company
with
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
upon
his
behaviour
to
whom
her
opinion
of
him
was
to
depend
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
were
deficient
there
*punct* ,
nothing
should
make
amends
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
on
seeing
them
together
*punct* ,
she
became
perfectly
satisfied
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
merely
in
fine
words
or
hyperbolical
compliment
that
he
paid
his
duty
*punct* ;
nothing
could
be
more
proper
or
pleasing
than
his
whole
manner
to
her
*punct* ,
nothing
could
more
agreeably
denote
his
wish
of
considering
her
as
a
friend
and
securing
her
affection
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
was
time
enough
for
emma
to
form
a
reasonable
judgment
*punct* ,
as
their
visit
included
all
the
rest
of
the
morning
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
all
three
walking
about
together
for
an
hour
or
two
*punct* ,
first
round
the
shrubberies
of
hartfield
*punct* ,
and
afterwards
in
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
delighted
with
every
thing
*punct* ;
admired
hartfield
sufficiently
for
mr.
woodhouse's
ear
*punct* ;
and
when
their
going
farther
was
resolved
on
*punct* ,
confessed
his
wish
to
be
made
acquainted
with
the
whole
village
*punct* ,
and
found
matter
of
commendation
and
interest
much
oftener
than
emma
could
have
supposed
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
the
objects
of
his
curiosity
spoke
very
amiable
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
he
begged
to
be
shewn
the
house
which
his
father
had
lived
in
so
long
*punct* ,
and
which
had
been
the
home
of
his
father's
father
*punct* ;
and
on
recollecting
that
an
old
woman
who
had
nursed
him
was
still
living
*punct* ,
walked
in
quest
of
her
cottage
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other
*punct* ;
and
though
in
some
points
of
pursuit
or
observation
there
was
no
positive
merit
*punct* ,
they
shewed
*punct* ,
altogether
*punct* ,
a
good-will
towards
highbury
in
general
*punct* ,
which
must
be
very
like
a
merit
to
those
he
was
with
*punct* .
*break*
emma
watched
and
decided
*punct* ,
that
with
such
feelings
as
were
now
shewn
*punct* ,
it
could
not
be
fairly
supposed
that
he
had
been
ever
voluntarily
absenting
himself
*punct* ;
that
he
had
not
been
acting
a
part
*punct* ,
or
making
a
parade
of
insincere
professions
*punct* ;
and
that
mr.
knightley
certainly
had
not
done
him
justice
*punct* .
*break*
their
first
pause
was
at
the
crown
inn
*punct* ,
an
inconsiderable
house
*punct* ,
though
the
principal
one
of
the
sort
*punct* ,
where
a
couple
of
pair
of
post-horses
were
kept
*punct* ,
more
for
the
convenience
of
the
neighbourhood
than
from
any
run
on
the
road
*punct* ;
and
his
companions
had
not
expected
to
be
detained
by
any
interest
excited
there
*punct* ;
but
in
passing
it
they
gave
the
history
of
the
large
room
visibly
added
*punct* ;
it
had
been
built
many
years
ago
for
a
ball-room
*punct* ,
and
while
the
neighbourhood
had
been
in
a
particularly
populous
*punct* ,
dancing
state
*punct* ,
had
been
occasionally
used
as
such;
*punct* ,
but
such
brilliant
days
had
long
passed
away
*punct* ,
and
now
the
highest
purpose
for
which
it
was
ever
wanted
was
to
accommodate
a
whist
club
established
among
the
gentlemen
and
half-gentlemen
of
the
place
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
immediately
interested
*punct* .
*break*
its
character
as
a
ball-room
caught
him
*punct* ;
and
instead
of
passing
on
*punct* ,
he
stopt
for
several
minutes
at
the
two
superior
sashed
windows
which
were
open
*punct* ,
to
look
in
and
contemplate
its
capabilities
*punct* ,
and
lament
that
its
original
purpose
should
have
ceased
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
no
fault
in
the
room
*punct* ,
he
would
acknowledge
none
which
they
suggested
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
it
was
long
enough
*punct* ,
broad
enough
*punct* ,
handsome
enough
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
hold
the
very
number
for
comfort
*punct* .
*break*
they
ought
to
have
balls
there
at
least
every
fortnight
through
the
winter
*punct* .
*break*
why
had
not
miss
woodhouse
revived
the
former
good
old
days
of
the
room?
*punct* ,
she
who
could
do
any
thing
in
highbury
*punct* !
*break*
the
want
of
proper
families
in
the
place
*punct* ,
and
the
conviction
that
none
beyond
the
place
and
its
immediate
environs
could
be
tempted
to
attend
*punct* ,
were
mentioned
*punct* ;
but
he
was
not
satisfied
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
be
persuaded
that
so
many
good-looking
houses
as
he
saw
around
him
*punct* ,
could
not
furnish
numbers
enough
for
such
a
meeting
*punct* ;
and
even
when
particulars
were
given
and
families
described
*punct* ,
he
was
still
unwilling
to
admit
that
the
inconvenience
of
such
a
mixture
would
be
any
thing
*punct* ,
or
that
there
would
be
the
smallest
difficulty
in
every
body's
returning
into
their
proper
place
the
next
morning
*punct* .
*break*
he
argued
like
a
young
man
very
much
bent
on
dancing
*punct* ;
and
emma
was
rather
surprized
to
see
the
constitution
of
the
weston
prevail
so
decidedly
against
the
habits
of
the
churchills
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
to
have
all
the
life
and
spirit
*punct* ,
cheerful
feelings
*punct* ,
and
social
inclinations
of
his
father
*punct* ,
and
nothing
of
the
pride
or
reserve
of
enscombe
*punct* .
*break*
of
pride
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
there
was
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
scarcely
enough
*punct* ;
his
indifference
to
a
confusion
of
rank
*punct* ,
bordered
too
much
on
inelegance
of
mind
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
be
no
judge
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
of
the
evil
he
was
holding
cheap
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
but
an
effusion
of
lively
spirits
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
he
was
persuaded
to
move
on
from
the
front
of
the
crown
*punct* ;
and
being
now
almost
facing
the
house
where
the
bateses
lodged
*punct* ,
emma
recollected
his
intended
visit
the
day
before
*punct* ,
and
asked
him
if
he
had
paid
it
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ;
i
was
just
going
to
mention
it
*punct* .
*break*
a
very
successful
visit:
*punct* ,
i
saw
all
the
three
ladies
*punct* ;
and
felt
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
preparatory
hint
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
talking
aunt
had
taken
me
quite
by
surprize
*punct* ,
it
must
have
been
the
death
of
me
*punct* .
*break*
as
it
was
*punct* ,
i
was
only
betrayed
into
paying
a
most
unreasonable
visit
*punct* .
*break*
ten
minutes
would
have
been
all
that
was
necessary
*punct* ,
perhaps
all
that
was
proper
*punct* ;
and
i
had
told
my
father
i
should
certainly
be
at
home
before
him
*punct* ,
but
there
was
no
getting
away
*punct* ,
no
pause
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
to
my
utter
astonishment
*punct* ,
i
found
*punct* ,
when
he
*punct* ,
finding
me
nowhere
else
*punct* ,
joined
me
there
at
last
*punct* ,
that
i
had
been
actually
sitting
with
them
very
nearly
three-quarters
of
an
hour
*punct* .
*break*
the
good
lady
had
not
given
me
the
possibility
of
escape
before
*punct* .
*break*
and
how
did
you
think
miss
fairfax
looking
*punct* ?
*break*
ill
*punct* ,
very
ill
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
if
a
young
lady
can
ever
be
allowed
to
look
ill
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
expression
is
hardly
admissible
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
ladies
can
never
look
ill
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
seriously
*punct* ,
miss
fairfax
is
naturally
so
pale
*punct* ,
as
almost
always
to
give
the
appearance
of
ill
health.
*punct* ,
a
most
deplorable
want
of
complexion
*punct* .
*break*
emma
would
not
agree
to
this
*punct* ,
and
began
a
warm
defence
of
miss
fairfax's
complexion
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
certainly
never
brilliant
*punct* ,
but
she
would
not
allow
it
to
have
a
sickly
hue
in
general
*punct* ;
and
there
was
a
softness
and
delicacy
in
her
skin
which
gave
peculiar
elegance
to
the
character
of
her
face
*punct* .
*break*
he
listened
with
all
due
deference
*punct* ;
acknowledged
that
he
had
heard
many
people
say
the
same
*punct* ,
but
yet
he
must
confess
*punct* ,
that
to
him
nothing
could
make
amends
for
the
want
of
the
fine
glow
of
health
*punct* .
*break*
where
features
were
indifferent
*punct* ,
a
fine
complexion
gave
beauty
to
them
all
*punct* ;
and
where
they
were
good
*punct* ,
the
effect
was
*punct* ,
fortunately
he
need
not
attempt
to
describe
what
the
effect
was
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
there
is
no
disputing
about
taste.
*punct* ,
at
least
you
admire
her
except
her
complexion
*punct* .
*break*
he
shook
his
head
and
laughed.
*punct* ,
i
cannot
separate
miss
fairfax
and
her
complexion
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
see
her
often
at
weymouth
*punct* ?
*break*
were
you
often
in
the
same
society
*punct* ?
*break*
at
this
moment
they
were
approaching
ford's
*punct* ,
and
he
hastily
exclaimed
*punct* ,
ha
*punct* !
*break*
he
comes
to
highbury
himself
*punct* ,
he
says
*punct* ,
six
days
out
of
the
seven
*punct* ,
and
has
always
business
at
ford's
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
be
not
inconvenient
to
you
*punct* ,
pray
let
us
go
in
*punct* ,
that
i
may
prove
myself
to
belong
to
the
place
*punct* ,
to
be
a
true
citizen
of
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
buy
something
at
ford's
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
be
taking
out
my
freedom.
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
they
sell
gloves
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
gloves
and
every
thing
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
admire
your
patriotism
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
be
adored
in
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
you
were
very
popular
before
you
came
*punct* ,
because
you
were
mr.
weston's
son
*punct* ,
but
lay
out
half
a
guinea
at
ford's
*punct* ,
and
your
popularity
will
stand
upon
your
own
virtues
*punct* .
*break*
they
went
in
*punct* ;
and
while
the
sleek
*punct* ,
well-tied
parcels
of
men's
beavers
and
york
tan
were
bringing
down
and
displaying
on
the
counter
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
but
i
beg
your
pardon
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
you
were
speaking
to
me
*punct* ,
you
were
saying
something
at
the
very
moment
of
this
burst
of
my
amor
patriae
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
let
me
lose
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
assure
you
the
utmost
stretch
of
public
fame
would
not
make
me
amends
for
the
loss
of
any
happiness
in
private
life
*punct* .
*break*
i
merely
asked
*punct* ,
whether
you
had
known
much
of
miss
fairfax
and
her
party
at
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
that
i
understand
your
question
*punct* ,
i
must
pronounce
it
to
be
a
very
unfair
one
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
always
the
lady's
right
to
decide
on
the
degree
of
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
miss
fairfax
must
already
have
given
her
account.
*punct* ,
i
shall
not
commit
myself
by
claiming
more
than
she
may
chuse
to
allow
*punct* .
*break*
upon
my
word
*punct* !
*break*
you
answer
as
discreetly
as
she
could
do
herself
*punct* .
*break*
but
her
account
of
every
thing
leaves
so
much
to
be
guessed
*punct* ,
she
is
so
very
reserved
*punct* ,
so
very
unwilling
to
give
the
least
information
about
any
body
*punct* ,
that
i
really
think
you
may
say
what
you
like
of
your
acquaintance
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
may
i
*punct* ,
indeed?
*punct* ,
then
i
will
speak
the
truth
*punct* ,
and
nothing
suits
me
so
well
*punct* .
*break*
i
met
her
frequently
at
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
known
the
campbells
a
little
in
town
*punct* ;
and
at
weymouth
we
were
very
much
in
the
same
set
*punct* .
*break*
colonel
campbell
is
a
very
agreeable
man
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
campbell
a
friendly
*punct* ,
warm-hearted
woman
*punct* .
*break*
i
like
them
all
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
miss
fairfax's
situation
in
life
*punct* ,
i
conclude
*punct* ;
what
she
is
destined
to
be
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
rather
hesitatingly
*punct* ,
i
believe
i
do
*punct* .
*break*
you
get
upon
delicate
subjects
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
weston
smiling
*punct* ;
remember
that
i
am
here.
*punct* ,
mr.
frank
churchill
hardly
knows
what
to
say
when
you
speak
of
miss
fairfax's
situation
in
life
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
move
a
little
farther
off
*punct* .
*break*
i
certainly
do
forget
to
think
of
her
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
as
having
ever
been
any
thing
but
my
friend
and
my
dearest
friend
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
as
if
he
fully
understood
and
honoured
such
a
sentiment
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
gloves
were
bought
*punct* ,
and
they
had
quitted
the
shop
again
*punct* ,
did
you
ever
hear
the
young
lady
we
were
speaking
of
*punct* ,
play
*punct* ?
*break*
said
frank
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
ever
hear
her
*punct* !
*break*
you
forget
how
much
she
belongs
to
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
heard
her
every
year
of
our
lives
since
we
both
began
*punct* .
*break*
she
plays
charmingly
*punct* .
*break*
you
think
so
*punct* ,
do
you?
*punct* ,
i
wanted
the
opinion
of
some
one
who
could
really
judge
*punct* .
*break*
she
appeared
to
me
to
play
well
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
with
considerable
taste
*punct* ,
but
i
know
nothing
of
the
matter
myself.
*punct* ,
i
am
excessively
fond
of
music
*punct* ,
but
without
the
smallest
skill
or
right
of
judging
of
any
body's
performance.
*punct* ,
i
have
been
used
to
hear
her's
admired
*punct* ;
and
i
remember
one
proof
of
her
being
thought
to
play
well:
*punct* ,
a
man
*punct* ,
a
very
musical
man
*punct* ,
and
in
love
with
another
woman
*punct* ,
engaged
to
her
*punct* ,
on
the
point
of
marriage
*punct* ,
would
yet
never
ask
that
other
woman
to
sit
down
to
the
instrument
*punct* ,
if
the
lady
in
question
could
sit
down
instead
*punct* ,
never
seemed
to
like
to
hear
one
if
he
could
hear
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
that
*punct* ,
i
thought
*punct* ,
in
a
man
of
known
musical
talent
*punct* ,
was
some
proof
*punct* .
*break*
said
emma
*punct* ,
highly
amused.
*punct* ,
mr.
dixon
is
very
musical
*punct* ,
is
he
*punct* ?
*break*
we
shall
know
more
about
them
all
*punct* ,
in
half
an
hour
*punct* ,
from
you
*punct* ,
than
miss
fairfax
would
have
vouchsafed
in
half
a
year
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
mr.
dixon
and
miss
campbell
were
the
persons
*punct* ;
and
i
thought
it
a
very
strong
proof
*punct* .
*break*
certainly
*punct* ,
very
strong
it
was
*punct* ;
to
own
the
truth
*punct* ,
a
great
deal
stronger
than
*punct* ,
if
i
had
been
miss
campbell
*punct* ,
would
have
been
at
all
agreeable
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
excuse
a
man's
having
more
music
than
love
*punct* ,
more
ear
than
eye
*punct* ,
a
more
acute
sensibility
to
fine
sounds
than
to
my
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
how
did
miss
campbell
appear
to
like
it
*punct* ?
*break*
it
was
her
very
particular
friend
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
said
emma
*punct* ,
laughing
*punct* .
*break*
one
would
rather
have
a
stranger
preferred
than
one's
very
particular
friend
*punct* ,
with
a
stranger
it
might
not
recur
again
*punct* ,
but
the
misery
of
having
a
very
particular
friend
always
at
hand
*punct* ,
to
do
every
thing
better
than
one
does
oneself!
*punct* ,
poor
mrs.
dixon
*punct* !
*break*
well
*punct* ,
i
am
glad
she
is
gone
to
settle
in
ireland
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
right
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
very
flattering
to
miss
campbell
*punct* ;
but
she
really
did
not
seem
to
feel
it
*punct* .
*break*
so
much
the
better
*punct* ,
or
so
much
the
worse:
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
which
*punct* .
*break*
but
be
it
sweetness
or
be
it
stupidity
in
her
*punct* ,
quickness
of
friendship
*punct* ,
or
dulness
of
feeling
*punct* ,
there
was
one
person
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
who
must
have
felt
it
*punct* :
miss
fairfax
herself
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
have
felt
the
improper
and
dangerous
distinction
*punct* .
*break*
as
to
that
*punct* ,
i
do
not
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
do
not
imagine
that
i
expect
an
account
of
miss
fairfax's
sensations
from
you
*punct* ,
or
from
any
body
else
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
known
to
no
human
being
*punct* ,
i
guess
*punct* ,
but
herself
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
she
continued
to
play
whenever
she
was
asked
by
mr.
dixon
*punct* ,
one
may
guess
what
one
chuses
*punct* .
*break*
there
appeared
such
a
perfectly
good
understanding
among
them
all
*punct* ,
he
began
rather
quickly
*punct* ,
but
checking
himself
*punct* ,
added
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
on
what
terms
they
really
were
*punct* ,
how
it
might
all
be
behind
the
scenes
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
only
say
that
there
was
smoothness
outwardly
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
*punct* ,
who
have
known
miss
fairfax
from
a
child
*punct* ,
must
be
a
better
judge
of
her
character
*punct* ,
and
of
how
she
is
likely
to
conduct
herself
in
critical
situations
*punct* ,
than
i
can
be
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
known
her
from
a
child
*punct* ,
undoubtedly
*punct* ;
we
have
been
children
and
women
together
*punct* ;
and
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
we
should
be
intimate,
*punct* ,
that
we
should
have
taken
to
each
other
whenever
she
visited
her
friends
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
never
did
*punct* .
*break*
i
hardly
know
how
it
has
happened
*punct* ;
a
little
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
from
that
wickedness
on
my
side
which
was
prone
to
take
disgust
towards
a
girl
so
idolized
and
so
cried
up
as
she
always
was
*punct* ,
by
her
aunt
and
grandmother
*punct* ,
and
all
their
set
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
*punct* ,
her
reserve
*punct* ,
i
never
could
attach
myself
to
any
one
so
completely
reserved
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
most
repulsive
quality
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* .
*break*
oftentimes
very
convenient
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* ,
but
never
pleasing
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
safety
in
reserve
*punct* ,
but
no
attraction
*punct* .
*break*
one
cannot
love
a
reserved
person
*punct* .
*break*
not
till
the
reserve
ceases
towards
oneself
*punct* ;
and
then
the
attraction
may
be
the
greater
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
must
be
more
in
want
of
a
friend
*punct* ,
or
an
agreeable
companion
*punct* ,
than
i
have
yet
been
*punct* ,
to
take
the
trouble
of
conquering
any
body's
reserve
to
procure
one
*punct* .
*break*
intimacy
between
miss
fairfax
and
me
is
quite
out
of
the
question
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
reason
to
think
ill
of
her
*punct* ,
not
the
least
*punct* ,
except
that
such
extreme
and
perpetual
cautiousness
of
word
and
manner
*punct* ,
such
a
dread
of
giving
a
distinct
idea
about
any
body
*punct* ,
is
apt
to
suggest
suspicions
of
there
being
something
to
conceal
*punct* .
*break*
he
perfectly
agreed
with
her
*punct* :
and
after
walking
together
so
long
*punct* ,
and
thinking
so
much
alike
*punct* ,
emma
felt
herself
so
well
acquainted
with
him
*punct* ,
that
she
could
hardly
believe
it
to
be
only
their
second
meeting
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
not
exactly
what
she
had
expected
*punct* ;
less
of
the
man
of
the
world
in
some
of
his
notions
*punct* ,
less
of
the
spoiled
child
of
fortune
*punct* ,
therefore
better
than
she
had
expected
*punct* .
*break*
his
ideas
seemed
more
moderate
*punct* ,
his
feelings
warmer
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
particularly
struck
by
his
manner
of
considering
mr.
elton's
house
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
as
well
as
the
church
*punct* ,
he
would
go
and
look
at
*punct* ,
and
would
not
join
them
in
finding
much
fault
with
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
he
could
not
believe
it
a
bad
house
*punct* ;
not
such
a
house
as
a
man
was
to
be
pitied
for
having
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
were
to
be
shared
with
the
woman
he
loved
*punct* ,
he
could
not
think
any
man
to
be
pitied
for
having
that
house
*punct* .
*break*
there
must
be
ample
room
in
it
for
every
real
comfort
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
must
be
a
blockhead
who
wanted
more
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
laughed
*punct* ,
and
said
he
did
not
know
what
he
was
talking
about
*punct* .
*break*
used
only
to
a
large
house
himself
*punct* ,
and
without
ever
thinking
how
many
advantages
and
accommodations
were
attached
to
its
size
*punct* ,
he
could
be
no
judge
of
the
privations
inevitably
belonging
to
a
small
one
*punct* .
*break*
but
emma
*punct* ,
in
her
own
mind
*punct* ,
determined
that
he
did
know
what
he
was
talking
about
*punct* ,
and
that
he
shewed
a
very
amiable
inclination
to
settle
early
in
life
*punct* ,
and
to
marry
*punct* ,
from
worthy
motives
*punct* .
*break*
he
might
not
be
aware
of
the
inroads
on
domestic
peace
to
be
occasioned
by
no
housekeeper's
room
*punct* ,
or
a
bad
butler's
pantry
*punct* ,
but
no
doubt
he
did
perfectly
feel
that
enscombe
could
not
make
him
happy
*punct* ,
and
that
whenever
he
were
attached
*punct* ,
he
would
willingly
give
up
much
of
wealth
to
be
allowed
an
early
establishment
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
very
good
opinion
of
frank
churchill
was
a
little
shaken
the
following
day
*punct* ,
by
hearing
that
he
was
gone
off
to
london
*punct* ,
merely
to
have
his
hair
cut
*punct* .
*break*
a
sudden
freak
seemed
to
have
seized
him
at
breakfast
*punct* ,
and
he
had
sent
for
a
chaise
and
set
off
*punct* ,
intending
to
return
to
dinner
*punct* ,
but
with
no
more
important
view
that
appeared
than
having
his
hair
cut
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
certainly
no
harm
in
his
travelling
sixteen
miles
twice
over
on
such
an
errand
*punct* ;
but
there
was
an
air
of
foppery
and
nonsense
in
it
which
she
could
not
approve
*punct* .
*break*
it
did
not
accord
with
the
rationality
of
plan
*punct* ,
the
moderation
in
expense
*punct* ,
or
even
the
unselfish
warmth
of
heart
*punct* ,
which
she
had
believed
herself
to
discern
in
him
yesterday
*punct* .
*break*
vanity
*punct* ,
extravagance
*punct* ,
love
of
change
*punct* ,
restlessness
of
temper
*punct* ,
which
must
be
doing
something
*punct* ,
good
or
bad
*punct* ;
heedlessness
as
to
the
pleasure
of
his
father
and
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
indifferent
as
to
how
his
conduct
might
appear
in
general
*punct* ;
he
became
liable
to
all
these
charges
*punct* .
*break*
his
father
only
called
him
a
coxcomb
*punct* ,
and
thought
it
a
very
good
story
*punct* ;
but
that
mrs.
weston
did
not
like
it
*punct* ,
was
clear
enough
*punct* ,
by
her
passing
it
over
as
quickly
as
possible
*punct* ,
and
making
no
other
comment
than
that
all
young
people
would
have
their
little
whims
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
exception
of
this
little
blot
*punct* ,
emma
found
that
his
visit
hitherto
had
given
her
friend
only
good
ideas
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
was
very
ready
to
say
how
attentive
and
pleasant
a
companion
he
made
himself
*punct* ,
how
much
she
saw
to
like
in
his
disposition
altogether
*punct* .
*break*
he
appeared
to
have
a
very
open
temper
*punct* ,
certainly
a
very
cheerful
and
lively
one
*punct* ;
she
could
observe
nothing
wrong
in
his
notions
*punct* ,
a
great
deal
decidedly
right
*punct* ;
he
spoke
of
his
uncle
with
warm
regard
*punct* ,
was
fond
of
talking
of
him
*punct* ,
said
he
would
be
the
best
man
in
the
world
if
he
were
left
to
himself
*punct* ;
and
though
there
was
no
being
attached
to
the
aunt
*punct* ,
he
acknowledged
her
kindness
with
gratitude
*punct* ,
and
seemed
to
mean
always
to
speak
of
her
with
respect
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
all
very
promising
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
but
for
such
an
unfortunate
fancy
for
having
his
hair
cut
*punct* ,
there
was
nothing
to
denote
him
unworthy
of
the
distinguished
honour
which
her
imagination
had
given
him
*punct* ;
the
honour
*punct* ,
if
not
of
being
really
in
love
with
her
*punct* ,
of
being
at
least
very
near
it
*punct* ,
and
saved
only
by
her
own
indifference
*punct* ,
for
still
her
resolution
held
of
never
marrying
*punct* ,
the
honour
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
of
being
marked
out
for
her
by
all
their
joint
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
on
his
side
*punct* ,
added
a
virtue
to
the
account
which
must
have
some
weight
*punct* .
*break*
he
gave
her
to
understand
that
frank
admired
her
extremely
*punct* ,
thought
her
very
beautiful
and
very
charming
*punct* ;
and
with
so
much
to
be
said
for
him
altogether
*punct* ,
she
found
she
must
not
judge
him
harshly
*punct* .
*break*
as
mrs.
weston
observed
*punct* ,
all
young
people
would
have
their
little
whims
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
one
person
among
his
new
acquaintance
in
surry
*punct* ,
not
so
leniently
disposed
*punct* .
*break*
in
general
he
was
judged
*punct* ,
throughout
the
parishes
of
donwell
and
highbury
*punct* ,
with
great
candour
*punct* ;
liberal
allowances
were
made
for
the
little
excesses
of
such
a
handsome
young
man
*punct* ,
one
who
smiled
so
often
and
bowed
so
well
*punct* ;
but
there
was
one
spirit
among
them
not
to
be
softened
*punct* ,
from
its
power
of
censure
*punct* ,
by
bows
or
smiles
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
the
circumstance
was
told
him
at
hartfield
*punct* ;
for
the
moment
*punct* ,
he
was
silent
*punct* ;
but
emma
heard
him
almost
immediately
afterwards
say
to
himself
*punct* ,
over
a
newspaper
he
held
in
his
hand
*punct* ,
hum
*punct* !
*break*
just
the
trifling
*punct* ,
silly
fellow
i
took
him
for
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
half
a
mind
to
resent
*punct* ;
but
an
instant's
observation
convinced
her
that
it
was
really
said
only
to
relieve
his
own
feelings
*punct* ,
and
not
meant
to
provoke
*punct* ;
and
therefore
she
let
it
pass
*punct* .
*break*
although
in
one
instance
the
bearers
of
not
good
tidings
*punct* ,
mr.
and
mrs.
weston's
visit
this
morning
was
in
another
respect
particularly
opportune
*punct* .
*break*
something
occurred
while
they
were
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
to
make
emma
want
their
advice
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
which
was
still
more
lucky
*punct* ,
she
wanted
exactly
the
advice
they
gave
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
the
occurrence:
*punct* ,
the
coles
had
been
settled
some
years
in
highbury
*punct* ,
and
were
very
good
sort
of
people
*punct* ,
friendly
*punct* ,
liberal
*punct* ,
and
unpretending
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
they
were
of
low
origin
*punct* ,
in
trade
*punct* ,
and
only
moderately
genteel
*punct* .
*break*
on
their
first
coming
into
the
country
*punct* ,
they
had
lived
in
proportion
to
their
income
*punct* ,
quietly
*punct* ,
keeping
little
company
*punct* ,
and
that
little
unexpensively
*punct* ;
but
the
last
year
or
two
had
brought
them
a
considerable
increase
of
means
*punct* ,
the
house
in
town
had
yielded
greater
profits
*punct* ,
and
fortune
in
general
had
smiled
on
them
*punct* .
*break*
with
their
wealth
*punct* ,
their
views
increased
*punct* ;
their
want
of
a
larger
house
*punct* ,
their
inclination
for
more
company
*punct* .
*break*
they
added
to
their
house
*punct* ,
to
their
number
of
servants
*punct* ,
to
their
expenses
of
every
sort
*punct* ;
and
by
this
time
were
*punct* ,
in
fortune
and
style
of
living
*punct* ,
second
only
to
the
family
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
their
love
of
society
*punct* ,
and
their
new
dining-room
*punct* ,
prepared
every
body
for
their
keeping
dinner-company
*punct* ;
and
a
few
parties
*punct* ,
chiefly
among
the
single
men
*punct* ,
had
already
taken
place
*punct* .
*break*
the
regular
and
best
families
emma
could
hardly
suppose
they
would
presume
to
invite
*punct* ,
neither
donwell
*punct* ,
nor
hartfield
*punct* ,
nor
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
should
tempt
her
to
go
*punct* ,
if
they
did
*punct* ;
and
she
regretted
that
her
father's
known
habits
would
be
giving
her
refusal
less
meaning
than
she
could
wish
*punct* .
*break*
the
coles
were
very
respectable
in
their
way
*punct* ,
but
they
ought
to
be
taught
that
it
was
not
for
them
to
arrange
the
terms
on
which
the
superior
families
would
visit
them
*punct* .
*break*
this
lesson
*punct* ,
she
very
much
feared
*punct* ,
they
would
receive
only
from
herself
*punct* ;
she
had
little
hope
of
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
none
of
mr.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
had
made
up
her
mind
how
to
meet
this
presumption
so
many
weeks
before
it
appeared
*punct* ,
that
when
the
insult
came
at
last
*punct* ,
it
found
her
very
differently
affected
*punct* .
*break*
donwell
and
randalls
had
received
their
invitation
*punct* ,
and
none
had
come
for
her
father
and
herself
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
weston's
accounting
for
it
with
i
suppose
they
will
not
take
the
liberty
with
you
*punct* ;
they
know
you
do
not
dine
out
*punct* ,
was
not
quite
sufficient
*punct* .
*break*
she
felt
that
she
should
like
to
have
had
the
power
of
refusal
*punct* ;
and
afterwards
*punct* ,
as
the
idea
of
the
party
to
be
assembled
there
*punct* ,
consisting
precisely
of
those
whose
society
was
dearest
to
her
*punct* ,
occurred
again
and
again
*punct* ,
she
did
not
know
that
she
might
not
have
been
tempted
to
accept
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
was
to
be
there
in
the
evening
*punct* ,
and
the
bateses
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
been
speaking
of
it
as
they
walked
about
highbury
the
day
before
*punct* ,
and
frank
churchill
had
most
earnestly
lamented
her
absence
*punct* .
*break*
might
not
the
evening
end
in
a
dance
*punct* ?
*break*
had
been
a
question
of
his
*punct* .
*break*
the
bare
possibility
of
it
acted
as
a
farther
irritation
on
her
spirits
*punct* ;
and
her
being
left
in
solitary
grandeur
*punct* ,
even
supposing
the
omission
to
be
intended
as
a
compliment
*punct* ,
was
but
poor
comfort
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
arrival
of
this
very
invitation
while
the
westons
were
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
which
made
their
presence
so
acceptable
*punct* ;
for
though
her
first
remark
*punct* ,
on
reading
it
*punct* ,
was
that
of
course
it
must
be
declined
*punct* ,
she
so
very
soon
proceeded
to
ask
them
what
they
advised
her
to
do
*punct* ,
that
their
advice
for
her
going
was
most
prompt
and
successful
*punct* .
*break*
she
owned
that
*punct* ,
considering
every
thing
*punct* ,
she
was
not
absolutely
without
inclination
for
the
party
*punct* .
*break*
the
coles
expressed
themselves
so
properly
*punct* ,
there
was
so
much
real
attention
in
the
manner
of
it
*punct* ,
so
much
consideration
for
her
father
*punct* .
*break*
they
would
have
solicited
the
honour
earlier
*punct* ,
but
had
been
waiting
the
arrival
of
a
folding-screen
from
london
*punct* ,
which
they
hoped
might
keep
mr.
woodhouse
from
any
draught
of
air
*punct* ,
and
therefore
induce
him
the
more
readily
to
give
them
the
honour
of
his
company
*punct* .
*break*
upon
the
whole
*punct* ,
she
was
very
persuadable
*punct* ;
and
it
being
briefly
settled
among
themselves
how
it
might
be
done
without
neglecting
his
comfort
*punct* ,
how
certainly
mrs.
goddard
*punct* ,
if
not
mrs.
bates
*punct* ,
might
be
depended
on
for
bearing
him
company
*punct* ,
mr.
woodhouse
was
to
be
talked
into
an
acquiescence
of
his
daughter's
going
out
to
dinner
on
a
day
now
near
at
hand
*punct* ,
and
spending
the
whole
evening
away
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
his
going
*punct* ,
emma
did
not
wish
him
to
think
it
possible
*punct* ,
the
hours
would
be
too
late
*punct* ,
and
the
party
too
numerous
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
soon
pretty
well
resigned
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
fond
of
dinner-visiting
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
i
never
was
*punct* .
*break*
no
more
is
emma
*punct* .
*break*
late
hours
do
not
agree
with
us
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sorry
mr.
and
mrs.
cole
should
have
done
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
it
would
be
much
better
if
they
would
come
in
one
afternoon
next
summer
*punct* ,
and
take
their
tea
with
us
*punct* ,
take
us
in
their
afternoon
walk
*punct* ;
which
they
might
do
*punct* ,
as
our
hours
are
so
reasonable
*punct* ,
and
yet
get
home
without
being
out
in
the
damp
of
the
evening
*punct* .
*break*
the
dews
of
a
summer
evening
are
what
i
would
not
expose
any
body
to
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
as
they
are
so
very
desirous
to
have
dear
emma
dine
with
them
*punct* ,
and
as
you
will
both
be
there
*punct* ,
and
mr.
knightley
too
*punct* ,
to
take
care
of
her
*punct* ,
i
cannot
wish
to
prevent
it
*punct* ,
provided
the
weather
be
what
it
ought
*punct* ,
neither
damp
*punct* ,
nor
cold
*punct* ,
nor
windy
*punct* .
*break*
then
turning
to
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
with
a
look
of
gentle
reproach
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* !
*break*
miss
taylor
*punct* ,
if
you
had
not
married
*punct* ,
you
would
have
staid
at
home
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
cried
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
as
i
took
miss
taylor
away
*punct* ,
it
is
incumbent
on
me
to
supply
her
place
*punct* ,
if
i
can
*punct* ;
and
i
will
step
to
mrs.
goddard
in
a
moment
*punct* ,
if
you
wish
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
idea
of
any
thing
to
be
done
in
a
moment
*punct* ,
was
increasing
*punct* ,
not
lessening
*punct* ,
mr.
woodhouse's
agitation
*punct* .
*break*
the
ladies
knew
better
how
to
allay
it
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
must
be
quiet
*punct* ,
and
every
thing
deliberately
arranged
*punct* .
*break*
with
this
treatment
*punct* ,
mr.
woodhouse
was
soon
composed
enough
for
talking
as
usual
*punct* .
*break*
he
should
be
happy
to
see
mrs.
goddard
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
great
regard
for
mrs.
goddard
*punct* ;
and
emma
should
write
a
line
*punct* ,
and
invite
her
*punct* .
*break*
james
could
take
the
note
*punct* .
*break*
but
first
of
all
*punct* ,
there
must
be
an
answer
written
to
mrs.
cole
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
make
my
excuses
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
as
civilly
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
say
that
i
am
quite
an
invalid
*punct* ,
and
go
no
where
*punct* ,
and
therefore
must
decline
their
obliging
invitation
*punct* ;
beginning
with
my
compliments
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
will
do
every
thing
right
*punct* .
*break*
i
need
not
tell
you
what
is
to
be
done
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
remember
to
let
james
know
that
the
carriage
will
be
wanted
on
tuesday
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
have
no
fears
for
you
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
never
been
there
above
once
since
the
new
approach
was
made
*punct* ;
but
still
i
have
no
doubt
that
james
will
take
you
very
safely
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
you
get
there
*punct* ,
you
must
tell
him
at
what
time
you
would
have
him
come
for
you
again
*punct* ;
and
you
had
better
name
an
early
hour
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
not
like
staying
late
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
get
very
tired
when
tea
is
over
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
would
not
wish
me
to
come
away
before
i
am
tired
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
my
love
*punct* ;
but
you
will
soon
be
tired
*punct* .
*break*
there
will
be
a
great
many
people
talking
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
not
like
the
noise
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
cried
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
if
emma
comes
away
early
*punct* ,
it
will
be
breaking
up
the
party
*punct* .
*break*
and
no
great
harm
if
it
does
*punct* ,
said
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* .
*break*
the
sooner
every
party
breaks
up
*punct* ,
the
better
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
do
not
consider
how
it
may
appear
to
the
coles
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
going
away
directly
after
tea
might
be
giving
offence
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
good-natured
people
*punct* ,
and
think
little
of
their
own
claims
*punct* ;
but
still
they
must
feel
that
any
body's
hurrying
away
is
no
great
compliment
*punct* ;
and
miss
woodhouse's
doing
it
would
be
more
thought
of
than
any
other
person's
in
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
you
would
not
wish
to
disappoint
and
mortify
the
coles
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
friendly
*punct* ,
good
sort
of
people
as
ever
lived
*punct* ,
and
who
have
been
your
neighbours
these
ten
years
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
upon
no
account
in
the
world
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
*punct* ;
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
reminding
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
be
extremely
sorry
to
be
giving
them
any
pain
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
what
worthy
people
they
are
*punct* .
*break*
perry
tells
me
that
mr.
cole
never
touches
malt
liquor
*punct* .
*break*
you
would
not
think
it
to
look
at
him
*punct* ,
but
he
is
bilious
*punct* ,
mr.
cole
is
very
bilious
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
would
not
be
the
means
of
giving
them
any
pain
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
we
must
consider
this
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
*punct* ,
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
hurting
mr.
and
mrs.
cole
*punct* ,
you
would
stay
a
little
longer
than
you
might
wish
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
not
regard
being
tired
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
be
perfectly
safe
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
among
your
friends
*punct* .
*break*
oh
yes
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
fears
at
all
for
myself
*punct* ;
and
i
should
have
no
scruples
of
staying
as
late
as
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
but
on
your
account
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
only
afraid
of
your
sitting
up
for
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
afraid
of
your
not
being
exceedingly
comfortable
with
mrs.
goddard
*punct* .
*break*
she
loves
piquet
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ;
but
when
she
is
gone
home
*punct* ,
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
sitting
up
by
yourself
*punct* ,
instead
of
going
to
bed
at
your
usual
time
*punct* ,
and
the
idea
of
that
would
entirely
destroy
my
comfort
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
promise
me
not
to
sit
up
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
*punct* ,
on
the
condition
of
some
promises
on
her
side
*punct* :
such
as
that
*punct* ,
if
she
came
home
cold
*punct* ,
she
would
be
sure
to
warm
herself
thoroughly
*punct* ;
if
hungry
*punct* ,
that
she
would
take
something
to
eat
*punct* ;
that
her
own
maid
should
sit
up
for
her
*punct* ;
and
that
serle
and
the
butler
should
see
that
every
thing
were
safe
in
the
house
*punct* ,
as
usual
*punct* .
*break*
frank
churchill
came
back
again
*punct* ;
and
if
he
kept
his
father's
dinner
waiting
*punct* ,
it
was
not
known
at
hartfield
*punct* ;
for
mrs.
weston
was
too
anxious
for
his
being
a
favourite
with
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
to
betray
any
imperfection
which
could
be
concealed
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
back
*punct* ,
had
had
his
hair
cut
*punct* ,
and
laughed
at
himself
with
a
very
good
grace
*punct* ,
but
without
seeming
really
at
all
ashamed
of
what
he
had
done
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
no
reason
to
wish
his
hair
longer
*punct* ,
to
conceal
any
confusion
of
face
*punct* ;
no
reason
to
wish
the
money
unspent
*punct* ,
to
improve
his
spirits
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
quite
as
undaunted
and
as
lively
as
ever
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
after
seeing
him
*punct* ,
emma
thus
moralised
to
herself:
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
whether
it
ought
to
be
so
*punct* ,
but
certainly
silly
things
do
cease
to
be
silly
if
they
are
done
by
sensible
people
in
an
impudent
way
*punct* .
*break*
wickedness
is
always
wickedness
*punct* ,
but
folly
is
not
always
folly.
*punct* ,
it
depends
upon
the
character
of
those
who
handle
it
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
he
is
not
a
trifling
*punct* ,
silly
young
man
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
were
*punct* ,
he
would
have
done
this
differently
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
either
have
gloried
in
the
achievement
*punct* ,
or
been
ashamed
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
there
would
have
been
either
the
ostentation
of
a
coxcomb
*punct* ,
or
the
evasions
of
a
mind
too
weak
to
defend
its
own
vanities.
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
i
am
perfectly
sure
that
he
is
not
trifling
or
silly
*punct* .
*break*
with
tuesday
came
the
agreeable
prospect
of
seeing
him
again
*punct* ,
and
for
a
longer
time
than
hitherto
*punct* ;
of
judging
of
his
general
manners
*punct* ,
and
by
inference
*punct* ,
of
the
meaning
of
his
manners
towards
herself
*punct* ;
of
guessing
how
soon
it
might
be
necessary
for
her
to
throw
coldness
into
her
air
*punct* ;
and
of
fancying
what
the
observations
of
all
those
might
be
*punct* ,
who
were
now
seeing
them
together
for
the
first
time
*punct* .
*break*
she
meant
to
be
very
happy
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
the
scene
being
laid
at
mr.
cole's
*punct* ;
and
without
being
able
to
forget
that
among
the
failings
of
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
even
in
the
days
of
his
favour
*punct* ,
none
had
disturbed
her
more
than
his
propensity
to
dine
with
mr.
cole
*punct* .
*break*
her
father's
comfort
was
amply
secured
*punct* ,
mrs.
bates
as
well
as
mrs.
goddard
being
able
to
come
*punct* ;
and
her
last
pleasing
duty
*punct* ,
before
she
left
the
house
*punct* ,
was
to
pay
her
respects
to
them
as
they
sat
together
after
dinner
*punct* ;
and
while
her
father
was
fondly
noticing
the
beauty
of
her
dress
*punct* ,
to
make
the
two
ladies
all
the
amends
in
her
power
*punct* ,
by
helping
them
to
large
slices
of
cake
and
full
glasses
of
wine
*punct* ,
for
whatever
unwilling
self-denial
his
care
of
their
constitution
might
have
obliged
them
to
practise
during
the
meal.
*punct* ,
she
had
provided
a
plentiful
dinner
for
them
*punct* ;
she
wished
she
could
know
that
they
had
been
allowed
to
eat
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
followed
another
carriage
to
mr.
cole's
door
*punct* ;
and
was
pleased
to
see
that
it
was
mr.
knightley's
*punct* ;
for
mr.
knightley
keeping
no
horses
*punct* ,
having
little
spare
money
and
a
great
deal
of
health
*punct* ,
activity
*punct* ,
and
independence
*punct* ,
was
too
apt
*punct* ,
in
emma's
opinion
*punct* ,
to
get
about
as
he
could
*punct* ,
and
not
use
his
carriage
so
often
as
became
the
owner
of
donwell
abbey
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
an
opportunity
now
of
speaking
her
approbation
while
warm
from
her
heart
*punct* ,
for
he
stopped
to
hand
her
out
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
coming
as
you
should
do
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ;
like
a
gentleman.
*punct* ,
i
am
quite
glad
to
see
you
*punct* .
*break*
he
thanked
her
*punct* ,
observing
*punct* ,
how
lucky
that
we
should
arrive
at
the
same
moment
*punct* !
*break*
for
*punct* ,
if
we
had
met
first
in
the
drawing-room
*punct* ,
i
doubt
whether
you
would
have
discerned
me
to
be
more
of
a
gentleman
than
usual.
*punct* ,
you
might
not
have
distinguished
how
i
came
*punct* ,
by
my
look
or
manner
*punct* .
*break*
yes
i
should
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
i
should
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
always
a
look
of
consciousness
or
bustle
when
people
come
in
a
way
which
they
know
to
be
beneath
them
*punct* .
*break*
you
think
you
carry
it
off
very
well
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* ,
but
with
you
it
is
a
sort
of
bravado
*punct* ,
an
air
of
affected
unconcern
*punct* ;
i
always
observe
it
whenever
i
meet
you
under
those
circumstances
*punct* .
*break*
now
you
have
nothing
to
try
for
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
not
afraid
of
being
supposed
ashamed
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
not
striving
to
look
taller
than
any
body
else
*punct* .
*break*
now
i
shall
really
be
very
happy
to
walk
into
the
same
room
with
you
*punct* .
*break*
was
his
reply
*punct* ,
but
not
at
all
in
anger
*punct* .
*break*
emma
had
as
much
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
the
rest
of
the
party
as
with
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
received
with
a
cordial
respect
which
could
not
but
please
*punct* ,
and
given
all
the
consequence
she
could
wish
for
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
westons
arrived
*punct* ,
the
kindest
looks
of
love
*punct* ,
the
strongest
of
admiration
were
for
her
*punct* ,
from
both
husband
and
wife
*punct* ;
the
son
approached
her
with
a
cheerful
eagerness
which
marked
her
as
his
peculiar
object
*punct* ,
and
at
dinner
she
found
him
seated
by
her
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
she
firmly
believed
*punct* ,
not
without
some
dexterity
on
his
side
*punct* .
*break*
the
party
was
rather
large
*punct* ,
as
it
included
one
other
family
*punct* ,
a
proper
unobjectionable
country
family
*punct* ,
whom
the
coles
had
the
advantage
of
naming
among
their
acquaintance
*punct* ,
and
the
male
part
of
mr.
cox's
family
*punct* ,
the
lawyer
of
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
the
less
worthy
females
were
to
come
in
the
evening
*punct* ,
with
miss
bates
*punct* ,
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
and
miss
smith
*punct* ;
but
already
*punct* ,
at
dinner
*punct* ,
they
were
too
numerous
for
any
subject
of
conversation
to
be
general
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
while
politics
and
mr.
elton
were
talked
over
*punct* ,
emma
could
fairly
surrender
all
her
attention
to
the
pleasantness
of
her
neighbour
*punct* .
*break*
the
first
remote
sound
to
which
she
felt
herself
obliged
to
attend
*punct* ,
was
the
name
of
jane
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
cole
seemed
to
be
relating
something
of
her
that
was
expected
to
be
very
interesting
*punct* .
*break*
she
listened
*punct* ,
and
found
it
well
worth
listening
to
*punct* .
*break*
that
very
dear
part
of
emma
*punct* ,
her
fancy
*punct* ,
received
an
amusing
supply
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
cole
was
telling
that
she
had
been
calling
on
miss
bates
*punct* ,
and
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
room
had
been
struck
by
the
sight
of
a
pianoforte
*punct* ,
a
very
elegant
looking
instrument
*punct* ,
not
a
grand
*punct* ,
but
a
large-sized
square
pianoforte
*punct* ;
and
the
substance
of
the
story
*punct* ,
the
end
of
all
the
dialogue
which
ensued
of
surprize
*punct* ,
and
inquiry
*punct* ,
and
congratulations
on
her
side
*punct* ,
and
explanations
on
miss
bates's
*punct* ,
was
*punct* ,
that
this
pianoforte
had
arrived
from
broadwood's
the
day
before
*punct* ,
to
the
great
astonishment
of
both
aunt
and
niece
*punct* ,
entirely
unexpected
*punct* ;
that
at
first
*punct* ,
by
miss
bates's
account
*punct* ,
jane
herself
was
quite
at
a
loss
*punct* ,
quite
bewildered
to
think
who
could
possibly
have
ordered
it
*punct* ,
but
now
*punct* ,
they
were
both
perfectly
satisfied
that
it
could
be
from
only
one
quarter;
*punct* ,
of
course
it
must
be
from
colonel
campbell
*punct* .
*break*
one
can
suppose
nothing
else
*punct* ,
added
mrs.
cole
*punct* ,
and
i
was
only
surprized
that
there
could
ever
have
been
a
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
but
jane
*punct* ,
it
seems
*punct* ,
had
a
letter
from
them
very
lately
*punct* ,
and
not
a
word
was
said
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
knows
their
ways
best
*punct* ;
but
i
should
not
consider
their
silence
as
any
reason
for
their
not
meaning
to
make
the
present
*punct* .
*break*
they
might
chuse
to
surprize
her
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
cole
had
many
to
agree
with
her
*punct* ;
every
body
who
spoke
on
the
subject
was
equally
convinced
that
it
must
come
from
colonel
campbell
*punct* ,
and
equally
rejoiced
that
such
a
present
had
been
made
*punct* ;
and
there
were
enough
ready
to
speak
to
allow
emma
to
think
her
own
way
*punct* ,
and
still
listen
to
mrs.
cole
*punct* .
*break*
i
declare
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
when
i
have
heard
any
thing
that
has
given
me
more
satisfaction!
*punct* ,
it
always
has
quite
hurt
me
that
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
who
plays
so
delightfully
*punct* ,
should
not
have
an
instrument
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
quite
a
shame
*punct* ,
especially
considering
how
many
houses
there
are
where
fine
instruments
are
absolutely
thrown
away
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
like
giving
ourselves
a
slap
*punct* ,
to
be
sure
*punct* !
*break*
and
it
was
but
yesterday
i
was
telling
mr.
cole
*punct* ,
i
really
was
ashamed
to
look
at
our
new
grand
pianoforte
in
the
drawing-room
*punct* ,
while
i
do
not
know
one
note
from
another
*punct* ,
and
our
little
girls
*punct* ,
who
are
but
just
beginning
*punct* ,
perhaps
may
never
make
any
thing
of
it
*punct* ;
and
there
is
poor
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
who
is
mistress
of
music
*punct* ,
has
not
any
thing
of
the
nature
of
an
instrument
*punct* ,
not
even
the
pitifullest
old
spinet
in
the
world
*punct* ,
to
amuse
herself
with.
*punct* ,
i
was
saying
this
to
mr.
cole
but
yesterday
*punct* ,
and
he
quite
agreed
with
me
*punct* ;
only
he
is
so
particularly
fond
of
music
that
he
could
not
help
indulging
himself
in
the
purchase
*punct* ,
hoping
that
some
of
our
good
neighbours
might
be
so
obliging
occasionally
to
put
it
to
a
better
use
than
we
can
*punct* ;
and
that
really
is
the
reason
why
the
instrument
was
bought
*punct* ,
or
else
i
am
sure
we
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
it.
*punct* ,
we
are
in
great
hopes
that
miss
woodhouse
may
be
prevailed
with
to
try
it
this
evening
*punct* .
*break*
miss
woodhouse
made
the
proper
acquiescence
*punct* ;
and
finding
that
nothing
more
was
to
be
entrapped
from
any
communication
of
mrs.
cole's
*punct* ,
turned
to
frank
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
why
do
you
smile
*punct* ?
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
why
do
you
*punct* ?
*break*
me!
*punct* ,
i
suppose
i
smile
for
pleasure
at
colonel
campbell's
being
so
rich
and
so
liberal.
*punct* ,
it
is
a
handsome
present
*punct* .
*break*
i
rather
wonder
that
it
was
never
made
before
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
miss
fairfax
has
never
been
staying
here
so
long
before
*punct* .
*break*
or
that
he
did
not
give
her
the
use
of
their
own
instrument
*punct* ,
which
must
now
be
shut
up
in
london
*punct* ,
untouched
by
any
body
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
a
grand
pianoforte
*punct* ,
and
he
might
think
it
too
large
for
mrs.
bates's
house
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
say
what
you
chuse
*punct* ,
but
your
countenance
testifies
that
your
thoughts
on
this
subject
are
very
much
like
mine
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
*punct* .
*break*
i
rather
believe
you
are
giving
me
more
credit
for
acuteness
than
i
deserve
*punct* .
*break*
i
smile
because
you
smile
*punct* ,
and
shall
probably
suspect
whatever
i
find
you
suspect
*punct* ;
but
at
present
i
do
not
see
what
there
is
to
question
*punct* .
*break*
if
colonel
campbell
is
not
the
person
*punct* ,
who
can
be
*punct* ?
*break*
what
do
you
say
to
mrs.
dixon
*punct* ?
*break*
very
true
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
not
thought
of
mrs.
dixon
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
know
as
well
as
her
father
*punct* ,
how
acceptable
an
instrument
would
be
*punct* ;
and
perhaps
the
mode
of
it
*punct* ,
the
mystery
*punct* ,
the
surprize
*punct* ,
is
more
like
a
young
woman's
scheme
than
an
elderly
man's
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
mrs.
dixon
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* .
*break*
i
told
you
that
your
suspicions
would
guide
mine
*punct* .
*break*
if
so
*punct* ,
you
must
extend
your
suspicions
and
comprehend
mr.
dixon
in
them
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
dixon.
*punct* ,
very
well
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
immediately
perceive
that
it
must
be
the
joint
present
of
mr.
and
mrs.
dixon
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
speaking
the
other
day
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
of
his
being
so
warm
an
admirer
of
her
performance
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
and
what
you
told
me
on
that
head
*punct* ,
confirmed
an
idea
which
i
had
entertained
before.
*punct* ,
i
do
not
mean
to
reflect
upon
the
good
intentions
of
either
mr.
dixon
or
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
but
i
cannot
help
suspecting
either
that
*punct* ,
after
making
his
proposals
to
her
friend
*punct* ,
he
had
the
misfortune
to
fall
in
love
with
her
*punct* ,
or
that
he
became
conscious
of
a
little
attachment
on
her
side
*punct* .
*break*
one
might
guess
twenty
things
without
guessing
exactly
the
right
*punct* ;
but
i
am
sure
there
must
be
a
particular
cause
for
her
chusing
to
come
to
highbury
instead
of
going
with
the
campbells
to
ireland
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
she
must
be
leading
a
life
of
privation
and
penance
*punct* ;
there
it
would
have
been
all
enjoyment
*punct* .
*break*
as
to
the
pretence
of
trying
her
native
air
*punct* ,
i
look
upon
that
as
a
mere
excuse.
*punct* ,
in
the
summer
it
might
have
passed
*punct* ;
but
what
can
any
body's
native
air
do
for
them
in
the
months
of
january
*punct* ,
february
*punct* ,
and
march
*punct* ?
*break*
good
fires
and
carriages
would
be
much
more
to
the
purpose
in
most
cases
of
delicate
health
*punct* ,
and
i
dare
say
in
her's
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
require
you
to
adopt
all
my
suspicions
*punct* ,
though
you
make
so
noble
a
profession
of
doing
it
*punct* ,
but
i
honestly
tell
you
what
they
are
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
they
have
an
air
of
great
probability
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
dixon's
preference
of
her
music
to
her
friend's
*punct* ,
i
can
answer
for
being
very
decided
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
*punct* ,
he
saved
her
life
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
ever
hear
of
that?
*punct* ,
a
water
party
*punct* ;
and
by
some
accident
she
was
falling
overboard
*punct* .
*break*
he
caught
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
there
*punct* ,
one
of
the
party
*punct* .
*break*
were
you
really?
*punct* ,
well!
*punct* ,
but
you
observed
nothing
of
course
*punct* ,
for
it
seems
to
be
a
new
idea
to
you.
*punct* ,
if
i
had
been
there
*punct* ,
i
think
i
should
have
made
some
discoveries
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
you
would
*punct* ;
but
i
*punct* ,
simple
i
*punct* ,
saw
nothing
but
the
fact
*punct* ,
that
miss
fairfax
was
nearly
dashed
from
the
vessel
and
that
mr.
dixon
caught
her.
*punct* ,
it
was
the
work
of
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
and
though
the
consequent
shock
and
alarm
was
very
great
and
much
more
durable
*punct* ,
indeed
i
believe
it
was
half
an
hour
before
any
of
us
were
comfortable
again
*punct* ,
yet
that
was
too
general
a
sensation
for
any
thing
of
peculiar
anxiety
to
be
observable
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
mean
to
say
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
that
you
might
not
have
made
discoveries
*punct* .
*break*
the
conversation
was
here
interrupted
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
called
on
to
share
in
the
awkwardness
of
a
rather
long
interval
between
the
courses
*punct* ,
and
obliged
to
be
as
formal
and
as
orderly
as
the
others
*punct* ;
but
when
the
table
was
again
safely
covered
*punct* ,
when
every
corner
dish
was
placed
exactly
right
*punct* ,
and
occupation
and
ease
were
generally
restored
*punct* ,
emma
said
*punct* ,
the
arrival
of
this
pianoforte
is
decisive
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
wanted
to
know
a
little
more
*punct* ,
and
this
tells
me
quite
enough
*punct* .
*break*
depend
upon
it
*punct* ,
we
shall
soon
hear
that
it
is
a
present
from
mr.
and
mrs.
dixon
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
the
dixons
should
absolutely
deny
all
knowledge
of
it
we
must
conclude
it
to
come
from
the
campbells
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
it
is
not
from
the
campbells
*punct* .
*break*
miss
fairfax
knows
it
is
not
from
the
campbells
*punct* ,
or
they
would
have
been
guessed
at
first
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
not
have
been
puzzled
*punct* ,
had
she
dared
fix
on
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
not
have
convinced
you
perhaps
*punct* ,
but
i
am
perfectly
convinced
myself
that
mr.
dixon
is
a
principal
in
the
business
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
you
injure
me
if
you
suppose
me
unconvinced
*punct* .
*break*
your
reasonings
carry
my
judgment
along
with
them
entirely
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
*punct* ,
while
i
supposed
you
satisfied
that
colonel
campbell
was
the
giver
*punct* ,
i
saw
it
only
as
paternal
kindness
*punct* ,
and
thought
it
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
you
mentioned
mrs.
dixon
*punct* ,
i
felt
how
much
more
probable
that
it
should
be
the
tribute
of
warm
female
friendship
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
i
can
see
it
in
no
other
light
than
as
an
offering
of
love
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
occasion
to
press
the
matter
farther
*punct* .
*break*
the
conviction
seemed
real
*punct* ;
he
looked
as
if
he
felt
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
said
no
more
*punct* ,
other
subjects
took
their
turn
*punct* ;
and
the
rest
of
the
dinner
passed
away
*punct* ;
the
dessert
succeeded
*punct* ,
the
children
came
in
*punct* ,
and
were
talked
to
and
admired
amid
the
usual
rate
of
conversation
*punct* ;
a
few
clever
things
said
*punct* ,
a
few
downright
silly
*punct* ,
but
by
much
the
larger
proportion
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
*punct* ,
nothing
worse
than
everyday
remarks
*punct* ,
dull
repetitions
*punct* ,
old
news
*punct* ,
and
heavy
jokes
*punct* .
*break*
the
ladies
had
not
been
long
in
the
drawing-room
*punct* ,
before
the
other
ladies
*punct* ,
in
their
different
divisions
*punct* ,
arrived
*punct* .
*break*
emma
watched
the
entree
of
her
own
particular
little
friend
*punct* ;
and
if
she
could
not
exult
in
her
dignity
and
grace
*punct* ,
she
could
not
only
love
the
blooming
sweetness
and
the
artless
manner
*punct* ,
but
could
most
heartily
rejoice
in
that
light
*punct* ,
cheerful
*punct* ,
unsentimental
disposition
which
allowed
her
so
many
alleviations
of
pleasure
*punct* ,
in
the
midst
of
the
pangs
of
disappointed
affection
*punct* .
*break*
there
she
sat
*punct* ,
and
who
would
have
guessed
how
many
tears
she
had
been
lately
shedding
*punct* ?
*break*
to
be
in
company
*punct* ,
nicely
dressed
herself
and
seeing
others
nicely
dressed
*punct* ,
to
sit
and
smile
and
look
pretty
*punct* ,
and
say
nothing
*punct* ,
was
enough
for
the
happiness
of
the
present
hour
*punct* .
*break*
jane
fairfax
did
look
and
move
superior
*punct* ;
but
emma
suspected
she
might
have
been
glad
to
change
feelings
with
harriet
*punct* ,
very
glad
to
have
purchased
the
mortification
of
having
loved
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
of
having
loved
even
mr.
elton
in
vain
*punct* ,
by
the
surrender
of
all
the
dangerous
pleasure
of
knowing
herself
beloved
by
the
husband
of
her
friend
*punct* .
*break*
in
so
large
a
party
it
was
not
necessary
that
emma
should
approach
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
did
not
wish
to
speak
of
the
pianoforte
*punct* ,
she
felt
too
much
in
the
secret
herself
*punct* ,
to
think
the
appearance
of
curiosity
or
interest
fair
*punct* ,
and
therefore
purposely
kept
at
a
distance
*punct* ;
but
by
the
others
*punct* ,
the
subject
was
almost
immediately
introduced
*punct* ,
and
she
saw
the
blush
of
consciousness
with
which
congratulations
were
received
*punct* ,
the
blush
of
guilt
which
accompanied
the
name
of
my
excellent
friend
colonel
campbell
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
kind-hearted
and
musical
*punct* ,
was
particularly
interested
by
the
circumstance
*punct* ,
and
emma
could
not
help
being
amused
at
her
perseverance
in
dwelling
on
the
subject
*punct* ;
and
having
so
much
to
ask
and
to
say
as
to
tone
*punct* ,
touch
*punct* ,
and
pedal
*punct* ,
totally
unsuspicious
of
that
wish
of
saying
as
little
about
it
as
possible
*punct* ,
which
she
plainly
read
in
the
fair
heroine's
countenance
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
soon
joined
by
some
of
the
gentlemen
*punct* ;
and
the
very
first
of
the
early
was
frank
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
in
he
walked
*punct* ,
the
first
and
the
handsomest
*punct* ;
and
after
paying
his
compliments
en
passant
to
miss
bates
and
her
niece
*punct* ,
made
his
way
directly
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
circle
*punct* ,
where
sat
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ;
and
till
he
could
find
a
seat
by
her
*punct* ,
would
not
sit
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
emma
divined
what
every
body
present
must
be
thinking
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
his
object
*punct* ,
and
every
body
must
perceive
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
introduced
him
to
her
friend
*punct* ,
miss
smith
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
at
convenient
moments
afterwards
*punct* ,
heard
what
each
thought
of
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
never
seen
so
lovely
a
face
*punct* ,
and
was
delighted
with
her
naivete
*punct* .
*break*
and
she
*punct* ,
only
to
be
sure
it
was
paying
him
too
great
a
compliment
*punct* ,
but
she
did
think
there
were
some
looks
a
little
like
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
emma
restrained
her
indignation
*punct* ,
and
only
turned
from
her
in
silence
*punct* .
*break*
smiles
of
intelligence
passed
between
her
and
the
gentleman
on
first
glancing
towards
miss
fairfax
*punct* ;
but
it
was
most
prudent
to
avoid
speech
*punct* .
*break*
he
told
her
that
he
had
been
impatient
to
leave
the
dining-room
*punct* ,
hated
sitting
long
*punct* ,
was
always
the
first
to
move
when
he
could
*punct* ,
that
his
father
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
mr.
cox
*punct* ,
and
mr.
cole
*punct* ,
were
left
very
busy
over
parish
business
*punct* ,
that
as
long
as
he
had
staid
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
it
had
been
pleasant
enough
*punct* ,
as
he
had
found
them
in
general
a
set
of
gentlemanlike
*punct* ,
sensible
men
*punct* ;
and
spoke
so
handsomely
of
highbury
altogether
*punct* ,
thought
it
so
abundant
in
agreeable
families
*punct* ,
that
emma
began
to
feel
she
had
been
used
to
despise
the
place
rather
too
much
*punct* .
*break*
she
questioned
him
as
to
the
society
in
yorkshire
*punct* ,
the
extent
of
the
neighbourhood
about
enscombe
*punct* ,
and
the
sort
*punct* ;
and
could
make
out
from
his
answers
that
*punct* ,
as
far
as
enscombe
was
concerned
*punct* ,
there
was
very
little
going
on
*punct* ,
that
their
visitings
were
among
a
range
of
great
families
*punct* ,
none
very
near
*punct* ;
and
that
even
when
days
were
fixed
*punct* ,
and
invitations
accepted
*punct* ,
it
was
an
even
chance
that
mrs.
churchill
were
not
in
health
and
spirits
for
going
*punct* ;
that
they
made
a
point
of
visiting
no
fresh
person
*punct* ;
and
that
*punct* ,
though
he
had
his
separate
engagements
*punct* ,
it
was
not
without
difficulty
*punct* ,
without
considerable
address
at
times
*punct* ,
that
he
could
get
away
*punct* ,
or
introduce
an
acquaintance
for
a
night
*punct* .
*break*
she
saw
that
enscombe
could
not
satisfy
*punct* ,
and
that
highbury
*punct* ,
taken
at
its
best
*punct* ,
might
reasonably
please
a
young
man
who
had
more
retirement
at
home
than
he
liked
*punct* .
*break*
his
importance
at
enscombe
was
very
evident
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
boast
*punct* ,
but
it
naturally
betrayed
itself
*punct* ,
that
he
had
persuaded
his
aunt
where
his
uncle
could
do
nothing
*punct* ,
and
on
her
laughing
and
noticing
it
*punct* ,
he
owned
that
he
believed
*punct* ,
excepting
one
or
two
points
*punct* ,
he
could
with
time
persuade
her
to
any
thing
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
those
points
on
which
his
influence
failed
*punct* ,
he
then
mentioned
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
wanted
very
much
to
go
abroad
*punct* ,
had
been
very
eager
indeed
to
be
allowed
to
travel
*punct* ,
but
she
would
not
hear
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
this
had
happened
the
year
before
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
he
was
beginning
to
have
no
longer
the
same
wish
*punct* .
*break*
the
unpersuadable
point
*punct* ,
which
he
did
not
mention
*punct* ,
emma
guessed
to
be
good
behaviour
to
his
father
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
made
a
most
wretched
discovery
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
after
a
short
pause.
*punct* ,
i
have
been
here
a
week
to-morrow
*punct* ,
half
my
time
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
knew
days
fly
so
fast
*punct* .
*break*
a
week
to-morrow!
*punct* ,
and
i
have
hardly
begun
to
enjoy
myself
*punct* .
*break*
but
just
got
acquainted
with
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
and
others!
*punct* ,
i
hate
the
recollection
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
you
may
now
begin
to
regret
that
you
spent
one
whole
day
*punct* ,
out
of
so
few
*punct* ,
in
having
your
hair
cut
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
smiling
*punct* ,
that
is
no
subject
of
regret
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
pleasure
in
seeing
my
friends
*punct* ,
unless
i
can
believe
myself
fit
to
be
seen
*punct* .
*break*
the
rest
of
the
gentlemen
being
now
in
the
room
*punct* ,
emma
found
herself
obliged
to
turn
from
him
for
a
few
minutes
*punct* ,
and
listen
to
mr.
cole
*punct* .
*break*
when
mr.
cole
had
moved
away
*punct* ,
and
her
attention
could
be
restored
as
before
*punct* ,
she
saw
frank
churchill
looking
intently
across
the
room
at
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
who
was
sitting
exactly
opposite
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
the
matter
*punct* ?
*break*
thank
you
for
rousing
me
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
i
have
been
very
rude
*punct* ;
but
really
miss
fairfax
has
done
her
hair
in
so
odd
a
way
*punct* ,
so
very
odd
a
way
*punct* ,
that
i
cannot
keep
my
eyes
from
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
saw
any
thing
so
outree!
*punct* ,
those
curls!
*punct* ,
this
must
be
a
fancy
of
her
own
*punct* .
*break*
i
see
nobody
else
looking
like
her!
*punct* ,
i
must
go
and
ask
her
whether
it
is
an
irish
fashion
*punct* .
*break*
shall
i?
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
i
will
*punct* ,
i
declare
i
will
*punct* ,
and
you
shall
see
how
she
takes
it;
*punct* ,
whether
she
colours
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
gone
immediately
*punct* ;
and
emma
soon
saw
him
standing
before
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
and
talking
to
her
*punct* ;
but
as
to
its
effect
on
the
young
lady
*punct* ,
as
he
had
improvidently
placed
himself
exactly
between
them
*punct* ,
exactly
in
front
of
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
she
could
absolutely
distinguish
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
before
he
could
return
to
his
chair
*punct* ,
it
was
taken
by
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
the
luxury
of
a
large
party
*punct* ,
said
she:
*punct* ,
one
can
get
near
every
body
*punct* ,
and
say
every
thing
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
i
am
longing
to
talk
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
been
making
discoveries
and
forming
plans
*punct* ,
just
like
yourself
*punct* ,
and
i
must
tell
them
while
the
idea
is
fresh
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
know
how
miss
bates
and
her
niece
came
here
*punct* ?
*break*
how?
*punct* ,
they
were
invited
*punct* ,
were
not
they
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
but
how
they
were
conveyed
hither?
*punct* ,
the
manner
of
their
coming
*punct* ?
*break*
they
walked
*punct* ,
i
conclude
*punct* .
*break*
how
else
could
they
come
*punct* ?
*break*
very
true.
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
a
little
while
ago
it
occurred
to
me
how
very
sad
it
would
be
to
have
jane
fairfax
walking
home
again
*punct* ,
late
at
night
*punct* ,
and
cold
as
the
nights
are
now
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
i
looked
at
her
*punct* ,
though
i
never
saw
her
appear
to
more
advantage
*punct* ,
it
struck
me
that
she
was
heated
*punct* ,
and
would
therefore
be
particularly
liable
to
take
cold
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
it
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
mr.
weston
came
into
the
room
*punct* ,
and
i
could
get
at
him
*punct* ,
i
spoke
to
him
about
the
carriage
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
guess
how
readily
he
came
into
my
wishes
*punct* ;
and
having
his
approbation
*punct* ,
i
made
my
way
directly
to
miss
bates
*punct* ,
to
assure
her
that
the
carriage
would
be
at
her
service
before
it
took
us
home
*punct* ;
for
i
thought
it
would
be
making
her
comfortable
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
as
grateful
as
possible
*punct* ,
you
may
be
sure
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
was
ever
so
fortunate
as
herself!'
*punct* ,
but
with
many
*punct* ,
many
thanks
*punct* ,
there
was
no
occasion
to
trouble
us
*punct* ,
for
mr.
knightley's
carriage
had
brought
*punct* ,
and
was
to
take
them
home
again
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
quite
surprized;
*punct* ,
very
glad
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* ;
but
really
quite
surprized
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
very
kind
attention
*punct* ,
and
so
thoughtful
an
attention!
*punct* ,
the
sort
of
thing
that
so
few
men
would
think
of
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
from
knowing
his
usual
ways
*punct* ,
i
am
very
much
inclined
to
think
that
it
was
for
their
accommodation
the
carriage
was
used
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
suspect
he
would
not
have
had
a
pair
of
horses
for
himself
*punct* ,
and
that
it
was
only
as
an
excuse
for
assisting
them
*punct* .
*break*
very
likely
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
nothing
more
likely
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
no
man
more
likely
than
mr.
knightley
to
do
the
sort
of
thing
*punct* ,
to
do
any
thing
really
good-natured
*punct* ,
useful
*punct* ,
considerate
*punct* ,
or
benevolent
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
not
a
gallant
man
*punct* ,
but
he
is
a
very
humane
one
*punct* ;
and
this
*punct* ,
considering
jane
fairfax's
ill-health
*punct* ,
would
appear
a
case
of
humanity
to
him;
*punct* ,
and
for
an
act
of
unostentatious
kindness
*punct* ,
there
is
nobody
whom
i
would
fix
on
more
than
on
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
he
had
horses
to-day
*punct* ,
for
we
arrived
together
*punct* ;
and
i
laughed
at
him
about
it
*punct* ,
but
he
said
not
a
word
that
could
betray
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
smiling
*punct* ,
you
give
him
credit
for
more
simple
*punct* ,
disinterested
benevolence
in
this
instance
than
i
do
*punct* ;
for
while
miss
bates
was
speaking
*punct* ,
a
suspicion
darted
into
my
head
*punct* ,
and
i
have
never
been
able
to
get
it
out
again
*punct* .
*break*
the
more
i
think
of
it
*punct* ,
the
more
probable
it
appears
*punct* .
*break*
in
short
*punct* ,
i
have
made
a
match
between
mr.
knightley
and
jane
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
see
the
consequence
of
keeping
you
company!
*punct* ,
what
do
you
say
to
it
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
knightley
and
jane
fairfax
*punct* !
*break*
dear
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
how
could
you
think
of
such
a
thing?
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley!
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
must
not
marry!
*punct* ,
you
would
not
have
little
henry
cut
out
from
donwell?
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
henry
must
have
donwell
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
at
all
consent
to
mr.
knightley's
marrying
*punct* ;
and
i
am
sure
it
is
not
at
all
likely
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
amazed
that
you
should
think
of
such
a
thing
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
i
have
told
you
what
led
me
to
think
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
want
the
match
*punct* ,
i
do
not
want
to
injure
dear
little
henry
*punct* ,
but
the
idea
has
been
given
me
by
circumstances
*punct* ;
and
if
mr.
knightley
really
wished
to
marry
*punct* ,
you
would
not
have
him
refrain
on
henry's
account
*punct* ,
a
boy
of
six
years
old
*punct* ,
who
knows
nothing
of
the
matter
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
would
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
bear
to
have
henry
supplanted.
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
marry!
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
i
have
never
had
such
an
idea
*punct* ,
and
i
cannot
adopt
it
now
*punct* .
*break*
and
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
of
all
women
*punct* !
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
she
has
always
been
a
first
favourite
with
him
*punct* ,
as
you
very
well
know
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
imprudence
of
such
a
match
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
not
speaking
of
its
prudence
*punct* ;
merely
its
probability
*punct* .
*break*
i
see
no
probability
in
it
*punct* ,
unless
you
have
any
better
foundation
than
what
you
mention
*punct* .
*break*
his
good-nature
*punct* ,
his
humanity
*punct* ,
as
i
tell
you
*punct* ,
would
be
quite
enough
to
account
for
the
horses
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
a
great
regard
for
the
bateses
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
independent
of
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
and
is
always
glad
to
shew
them
attention
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
do
not
take
to
match-making
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
it
very
ill
*punct* .
*break*
jane
fairfax
mistress
of
the
abbey!
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no;
*punct* ,
every
feeling
revolts
*punct* .
*break*
for
his
own
sake
*punct* ,
i
would
not
have
him
do
so
mad
a
thing
*punct* .
*break*
imprudent
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* ,
but
not
mad
*punct* .
*break*
excepting
inequality
of
fortune
*punct* ,
and
perhaps
a
little
disparity
of
age
*punct* ,
i
can
see
nothing
unsuitable
*punct* .
*break*
but
mr.
knightley
does
not
want
to
marry
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
he
has
not
the
least
idea
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
put
it
into
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
why
should
he
marry?
*punct* ,
he
is
as
happy
as
possible
by
himself
*punct* ;
with
his
farm
*punct* ,
and
his
sheep
*punct* ,
and
his
library
*punct* ,
and
all
the
parish
to
manage
*punct* ;
and
he
is
extremely
fond
of
his
brother's
children
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
no
occasion
to
marry
*punct* ,
either
to
fill
up
his
time
or
his
heart
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
as
long
as
he
thinks
so
*punct* ,
it
is
so
*punct* ;
but
if
he
really
loves
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
nonsense
*punct* !
*break*
he
does
not
care
about
jane
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
way
of
love
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
he
does
not
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
do
any
good
to
her
*punct* ,
or
her
family
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
laughing
*punct* ,
perhaps
the
greatest
good
he
could
do
them
*punct* ,
would
be
to
give
jane
such
a
respectable
home
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
would
be
good
to
her
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
it
would
be
evil
to
himself
*punct* ;
a
very
shameful
and
degrading
connexion
*punct* .
*break*
how
would
he
bear
to
have
miss
bates
belonging
to
him?
*punct* ,
to
have
her
haunting
the
abbey
*punct* ,
and
thanking
him
all
day
long
for
his
great
kindness
in
marrying
jane?
*punct* ,
so
very
kind
and
obliging!
*punct* ,
but
he
always
had
been
such
a
very
kind
neighbour
*punct* !
*break*
and
then
fly
off
*punct* ,
through
half
a
sentence
*punct* ,
to
her
mother's
old
petticoat
*punct* .
*break*
not
that
it
was
such
a
very
old
petticoat
either
*punct* ,
for
still
it
would
last
a
great
while
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
she
must
thankfully
say
that
their
petticoats
were
all
very
strong
*punct* .
*break*
for
shame
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* !
*break*
do
not
mimic
her
*punct* .
*break*
you
divert
me
against
my
conscience
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
i
do
not
think
mr.
knightley
would
be
much
disturbed
by
miss
bates
*punct* .
*break*
little
things
do
not
irritate
him
*punct* .
*break*
she
might
talk
on
*punct* ;
and
if
he
wanted
to
say
any
thing
himself
*punct* ,
he
would
only
talk
louder
*punct* ,
and
drown
her
voice
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
question
is
not
*punct* ,
whether
it
would
be
a
bad
connexion
for
him
*punct* ,
but
whether
he
wishes
it
*punct* ;
and
i
think
he
does
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
heard
him
speak
*punct* ,
and
so
must
you
*punct* ,
so
very
highly
of
jane
fairfax
*punct* !
*break*
the
interest
he
takes
in
her
*punct* ,
his
anxiety
about
her
health
*punct* ,
his
concern
that
she
should
have
no
happier
prospect
*punct* !
*break*
i
have
heard
him
express
himself
so
warmly
on
those
points!
*punct* ,
such
an
admirer
of
her
performance
on
the
pianoforte
*punct* ,
and
of
her
voice
*punct* !
*break*
i
have
heard
him
say
that
he
could
listen
to
her
for
ever
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
had
almost
forgotten
one
idea
that
occurred
to
me
*punct* ,
this
pianoforte
that
has
been
sent
here
by
somebody
*punct* ,
though
we
have
all
been
so
well
satisfied
to
consider
it
a
present
from
the
campbells
*punct* ,
may
it
not
be
from
mr.
knightley
*punct* ?
*break*
i
cannot
help
suspecting
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
he
is
just
the
person
to
do
it
*punct* ,
even
without
being
in
love
*punct* .
*break*
then
it
can
be
no
argument
to
prove
that
he
is
in
love
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
at
all
a
likely
thing
for
him
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
does
nothing
mysteriously
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
heard
him
lamenting
her
having
no
instrument
repeatedly
*punct* ;
oftener
than
i
should
suppose
such
a
circumstance
would
*punct* ,
in
the
common
course
of
things
*punct* ,
occur
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
very
well
*punct* ;
and
if
he
had
intended
to
give
her
one
*punct* ,
he
would
have
told
her
so
*punct* .
*break*
there
might
be
scruples
of
delicacy
*punct* ,
my
dear
emma
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
a
very
strong
notion
that
it
comes
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
he
was
particularly
silent
when
mrs.
cole
told
us
of
it
at
dinner
*punct* .
*break*
you
take
up
an
idea
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
and
run
away
with
it
*punct* ;
as
you
have
many
a
time
reproached
me
with
doing
*punct* .
*break*
i
see
no
sign
of
attachment
*punct* ,
i
believe
nothing
of
the
pianoforte
*punct* ,
and
proof
only
shall
convince
me
that
mr.
knightley
has
any
thought
of
marrying
jane
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
they
combated
the
point
some
time
longer
in
the
same
way
*punct* ;
emma
rather
gaining
ground
over
the
mind
of
her
friend
*punct* ;
for
mrs.
weston
was
the
most
used
of
the
two
to
yield
*punct* ;
till
a
little
bustle
in
the
room
shewed
them
that
tea
was
over
*punct* ,
and
the
instrument
in
preparation;
*punct* ,
and
at
the
same
moment
mr.
cole
approaching
to
entreat
miss
woodhouse
would
do
them
the
honour
of
trying
it
*punct* .
*break*
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
of
whom
*punct* ,
in
the
eagerness
of
her
conversation
with
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
she
had
been
seeing
nothing
*punct* ,
except
that
he
had
found
a
seat
by
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
followed
mr.
cole
*punct* ,
to
add
his
very
pressing
entreaties
*punct* ;
and
as
*punct* ,
in
every
respect
*punct* ,
it
suited
emma
best
to
lead
*punct* ,
she
gave
a
very
proper
compliance
*punct* .
*break*
she
knew
the
limitations
of
her
own
powers
too
well
to
attempt
more
than
she
could
perform
with
credit
*punct* ;
she
wanted
neither
taste
nor
spirit
in
the
little
things
which
are
generally
acceptable
*punct* ,
and
could
accompany
her
own
voice
well
*punct* .
*break*
one
accompaniment
to
her
song
took
her
agreeably
by
surprize
*punct* ,
a
second
*punct* ,
slightly
but
correctly
taken
by
frank
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
her
pardon
was
duly
begged
at
the
close
of
the
song
*punct* ,
and
every
thing
usual
followed
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
accused
of
having
a
delightful
voice
*punct* ,
and
a
perfect
knowledge
of
music
*punct* ;
which
was
properly
denied
*punct* ;
and
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
*punct* ,
and
had
no
voice
at
all
*punct* ,
roundly
asserted
*punct* .
*break*
they
sang
together
once
more
*punct* ;
and
emma
would
then
resign
her
place
to
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
whose
performance
*punct* ,
both
vocal
and
instrumental
*punct* ,
she
never
could
attempt
to
conceal
from
herself
*punct* ,
was
infinitely
superior
to
her
own
*punct* .
*break*
with
mixed
feelings
*punct* ,
she
seated
herself
at
a
little
distance
from
the
numbers
round
the
instrument
*punct* ,
to
listen
*punct* .
*break*
frank
churchill
sang
again
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
sung
together
once
or
twice
*punct* ,
it
appeared
*punct* ,
at
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
sight
of
mr.
knightley
among
the
most
attentive
*punct* ,
soon
drew
away
half
emma's
mind
*punct* ;
and
she
fell
into
a
train
of
thinking
on
the
subject
of
mrs.
weston's
suspicions
*punct* ,
to
which
the
sweet
sounds
of
the
united
voices
gave
only
momentary
interruptions
*punct* .
*break*
her
objections
to
mr.
knightley's
marrying
did
not
in
the
least
subside
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
see
nothing
but
evil
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
a
great
disappointment
to
mr.
john
knightley
*punct* ;
consequently
to
isabella
*punct* .
*break*
a
real
injury
to
the
children
*punct* ,
a
most
mortifying
change
*punct* ,
and
material
loss
to
them
all;
*punct* ,
a
very
great
deduction
from
her
father's
daily
comfort
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
to
herself
*punct* ,
she
could
not
at
all
endure
the
idea
of
jane
fairfax
at
donwell
abbey
*punct* .
*break*
a
mrs.
knightley
for
them
all
to
give
way
to!
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
must
never
marry
*punct* .
*break*
little
henry
must
remain
the
heir
of
donwell
*punct* .
*break*
presently
mr.
knightley
looked
back
*punct* ,
and
came
and
sat
down
by
her
*punct* .
*break*
they
talked
at
first
only
of
the
performance
*punct* .
*break*
his
admiration
was
certainly
very
warm
*punct* ;
yet
she
thought
*punct* ,
but
for
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
it
would
not
have
struck
her
*punct* .
*break*
as
a
sort
of
touchstone
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
she
began
to
speak
of
his
kindness
in
conveying
the
aunt
and
niece
*punct* ;
and
though
his
answer
was
in
the
spirit
of
cutting
the
matter
short
*punct* ,
she
believed
it
to
indicate
only
his
disinclination
to
dwell
on
any
kindness
of
his
own
*punct* .
*break*
i
often
feel
concern
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
that
i
dare
not
make
our
carriage
more
useful
on
such
occasions
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
that
i
am
without
the
wish
*punct* ;
but
you
know
how
impossible
my
father
would
deem
it
that
james
should
put-to
for
such
a
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
quite
out
of
the
question
*punct* ,
quite
out
of
the
question
*punct* ,
he
replied;
*punct* ,
but
you
must
often
wish
it
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
smiled
with
such
seeming
pleasure
at
the
conviction
*punct* ,
that
she
must
proceed
another
step
*punct* .
*break*
this
present
from
the
campbells
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
this
pianoforte
is
very
kindly
given
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
and
without
the
smallest
apparent
embarrassment.
*punct* ,
but
they
would
have
done
better
had
they
given
her
notice
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
surprizes
are
foolish
things
*punct* .
*break*
the
pleasure
is
not
enhanced
*punct* ,
and
the
inconvenience
is
often
considerable
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
have
expected
better
judgment
in
colonel
campbell
*punct* .
*break*
from
that
moment
*punct* ,
emma
could
have
taken
her
oath
that
mr.
knightley
had
had
no
concern
in
giving
the
instrument
*punct* .
*break*
but
whether
he
were
entirely
free
from
peculiar
attachment
*punct* ,
whether
there
were
no
actual
preference
*punct* ,
remained
a
little
longer
doubtful
*punct* .
*break*
towards
the
end
of
jane's
second
song
*punct* ,
her
voice
grew
thick
*punct* .
*break*
that
will
do
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
when
it
was
finished
*punct* ,
thinking
aloud
*punct* ,
you
have
sung
quite
enough
for
one
evening
*punct* ,
now
be
quiet
*punct* .
*break*
another
song
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
was
soon
begged
for
*punct* .
*break*
one
more;
*punct* ,
they
would
not
fatigue
miss
fairfax
on
any
account
*punct* ,
and
would
only
ask
for
one
more
*punct* .
*break*
and
frank
churchill
was
heard
to
say
*punct* ,
i
think
you
could
manage
this
without
effort
*punct* ;
the
first
part
is
so
very
trifling
*punct* .
*break*
the
strength
of
the
song
falls
on
the
second
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
grew
angry
*punct* .
*break*
that
fellow
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
indignantly
*punct* ,
thinks
of
nothing
but
shewing
off
his
own
voice
*punct* .
*break*
this
must
not
be
*punct* .
*break*
and
touching
miss
bates
*punct* ,
who
at
that
moment
passed
near
*punct* ,
miss
bates
*punct* ,
are
you
mad
*punct* ,
to
let
your
niece
sing
herself
hoarse
in
this
manner
*punct* ?
*break*
go
*punct* ,
and
interfere
*punct* .
*break*
they
have
no
mercy
on
her
*punct* .
*break*
miss
bates
*punct* ,
in
her
real
anxiety
for
jane
*punct* ,
could
hardly
stay
even
to
be
grateful
*punct* ,
before
she
stept
forward
and
put
an
end
to
all
farther
singing
*punct* .
*break*
here
ceased
the
concert
part
of
the
evening
*punct* ,
for
miss
woodhouse
and
miss
fairfax
were
the
only
young
lady
performers
*punct* ;
but
soon
*punct* ,
within
five
minutes
*punct* ,
the
proposal
of
dancing
*punct* ,
originating
nobody
exactly
knew
where
*punct* ,
was
so
effectually
promoted
by
mr.
and
mrs.
cole
*punct* ,
that
every
thing
was
rapidly
clearing
away
*punct* ,
to
give
proper
space
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
capital
in
her
country-dances
*punct* ,
was
seated
*punct* ,
and
beginning
an
irresistible
waltz
*punct* ;
and
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
coming
up
with
most
becoming
gallantry
to
emma
*punct* ,
had
secured
her
hand
*punct* ,
and
led
her
up
to
the
top
*punct* .
*break*
while
waiting
till
the
other
young
people
could
pair
themselves
off
*punct* ,
emma
found
time
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
the
compliments
she
was
receiving
on
her
voice
and
her
taste
*punct* ,
to
look
about
*punct* ,
and
see
what
became
of
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
this
would
be
a
trial
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
no
dancer
in
general
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
were
to
be
very
alert
in
engaging
jane
fairfax
now
*punct* ,
it
might
augur
something
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
immediate
appearance
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ;
he
was
talking
to
mrs.
cole
*punct* ,
he
was
looking
on
unconcerned
*punct* ;
jane
was
asked
by
somebody
else
*punct* ,
and
he
was
still
talking
to
mrs.
cole
*punct* .
*break*
emma
had
no
longer
an
alarm
for
henry
*punct* ;
his
interest
was
yet
safe
*punct* ;
and
she
led
off
the
dance
with
genuine
spirit
and
enjoyment
*punct* .
*break*
not
more
than
five
couple
could
be
mustered
*punct* ;
but
the
rarity
and
the
suddenness
of
it
made
it
very
delightful
*punct* ,
and
she
found
herself
well
matched
in
a
partner
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
a
couple
worth
looking
at
*punct* .
*break*
two
dances
*punct* ,
unfortunately
*punct* ,
were
all
that
could
be
allowed
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
growing
late
*punct* ,
and
miss
bates
became
anxious
to
get
home
*punct* ,
on
her
mother's
account
*punct* .
*break*
after
some
attempts
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
to
be
permitted
to
begin
again
*punct* ,
they
were
obliged
to
thank
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
look
sorrowful
*punct* ,
and
have
done
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
it
is
as
well
*punct* ,
said
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
as
he
attended
emma
to
her
carriage
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
have
asked
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
and
her
languid
dancing
would
not
have
agreed
with
me
*punct* ,
after
your's
*punct* .
*break*
emma
did
not
repent
her
condescension
in
going
to
the
coles
*punct* .
*break*
the
visit
afforded
her
many
pleasant
recollections
the
next
day
*punct* ;
and
all
that
she
might
be
supposed
to
have
lost
on
the
side
of
dignified
seclusion
*punct* ,
must
be
amply
repaid
in
the
splendour
of
popularity
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
have
delighted
the
coles
*punct* ,
worthy
people
*punct* ,
who
deserved
to
be
made
happy!
*punct* ,
and
left
a
name
behind
her
that
would
not
soon
die
away
*punct* .
*break*
perfect
happiness
*punct* ,
even
in
memory
*punct* ,
is
not
common
*punct* ;
and
there
were
two
points
on
which
she
was
not
quite
easy
*punct* .
*break*
she
doubted
whether
she
had
not
transgressed
the
duty
of
woman
by
woman
*punct* ,
in
betraying
her
suspicions
of
jane
fairfax's
feelings
to
frank
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
hardly
right
*punct* ;
but
it
had
been
so
strong
an
idea
*punct* ,
that
it
would
escape
her
*punct* ,
and
his
submission
to
all
that
she
told
*punct* ,
was
a
compliment
to
her
penetration
*punct* ,
which
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
be
quite
certain
that
she
ought
to
have
held
her
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
the
other
circumstance
of
regret
related
also
to
jane
fairfax
*punct* ;
and
there
she
had
no
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
she
did
unfeignedly
and
unequivocally
regret
the
inferiority
of
her
own
playing
and
singing
*punct* .
*break*
she
did
most
heartily
grieve
over
the
idleness
of
her
childhood
*punct* ,
and
sat
down
and
practised
vigorously
an
hour
and
a
half
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
then
interrupted
by
harriet's
coming
in
*punct* ;
and
if
harriet's
praise
could
have
satisfied
her
*punct* ,
she
might
soon
have
been
comforted
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
could
but
play
as
well
as
you
and
miss
fairfax
*punct* !
*break*
don't
class
us
together
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
my
playing
is
no
more
like
her's
*punct* ,
than
a
lamp
is
like
sunshine
*punct* .
*break*
dear
*punct* ,
i
think
you
play
the
best
of
the
two
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
you
play
quite
as
well
as
she
does
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
i
had
much
rather
hear
you
*punct* .
*break*
every
body
last
night
said
how
well
you
played
*punct* .
*break*
those
who
knew
any
thing
about
it
*punct* ,
must
have
felt
the
difference
*punct* .
*break*
the
truth
is
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
that
my
playing
is
just
good
enough
to
be
praised
*punct* ,
but
jane
fairfax's
is
much
beyond
it
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
i
always
shall
think
that
you
play
quite
as
well
as
she
does
*punct* ,
or
that
if
there
is
any
difference
nobody
would
ever
find
it
out
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
cole
said
how
much
taste
you
had
*punct* ;
and
mr.
frank
churchill
talked
a
great
deal
about
your
taste
*punct* ,
and
that
he
valued
taste
much
more
than
execution
*punct* .
*break*
but
jane
fairfax
has
them
both
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
are
you
sure
*punct* ?
*break*
i
saw
she
had
execution
*punct* ,
but
i
did
not
know
she
had
any
taste
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
talked
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
hate
italian
singing.
*punct* ,
there
is
no
understanding
a
word
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
if
she
does
play
so
very
well
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
it
is
no
more
than
she
is
obliged
to
do
*punct* ,
because
she
will
have
to
teach
*punct* .
*break*
the
coxes
were
wondering
last
night
whether
she
would
get
into
any
great
family
*punct* .
*break*
how
did
you
think
the
coxes
looked
*punct* ?
*break*
just
as
they
always
do
*punct* ,
very
vulgar
*punct* .
*break*
they
told
me
something
*punct* ,
said
harriet
rather
hesitatingly
*punct* ;
but
it
is
nothing
of
any
consequence
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
obliged
to
ask
what
they
had
told
her
*punct* ,
though
fearful
of
its
producing
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
they
told
me
*punct* ,
that
mr.
martin
dined
with
them
last
saturday
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
to
their
father
upon
some
business
*punct* ,
and
he
asked
him
to
stay
to
dinner
*punct* .
*break*
they
talked
a
great
deal
about
him
*punct* ,
especially
anne
cox
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
what
she
meant
*punct* ,
but
she
asked
me
if
i
thought
i
should
go
and
stay
there
again
next
summer
*punct* .
*break*
she
meant
to
be
impertinently
curious
*punct* ,
just
as
such
an
anne
cox
should
be
*punct* .
*break*
she
said
he
was
very
agreeable
the
day
he
dined
there
*punct* .
*break*
he
sat
by
her
at
dinner
*punct* .
*break*
miss
nash
thinks
either
of
the
coxes
would
be
very
glad
to
marry
him
*punct* .
*break*
very
likely.
*punct* ,
i
think
they
are
*punct* ,
without
exception
*punct* ,
the
most
vulgar
girls
in
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
had
business
at
ford's.
*punct* ,
emma
thought
it
most
prude
nt
to
go
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
another
accidental
meeting
with
the
martins
was
possible
*punct* ,
and
in
her
present
state
*punct* ,
would
be
dangerous
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
*punct* ,
tempted
by
every
thing
and
swayed
by
half
a
word
*punct* ,
was
always
very
long
at
a
purchase
*punct* ;
and
while
she
was
still
hanging
over
muslins
and
changing
her
mind
*punct* ,
emma
went
to
the
door
for
amusement.
*punct* ,
much
could
not
be
hoped
from
the
traffic
of
even
the
busiest
part
of
highbury;
*punct* ,
mr.
perry
walking
hastily
by
*punct* ,
mr.
william
cox
letting
himself
in
at
the
office-door
*punct* ,
mr.
cole's
carriage-horses
returning
from
exercise
*punct* ,
or
a
stray
letter-boy
on
an
obstinate
mule
*punct* ,
were
the
liveliest
objects
she
could
presume
to
expect
*punct* ;
and
when
her
eyes
fell
only
on
the
butcher
with
his
tray
*punct* ,
a
tidy
old
woman
travelling
homewards
from
shop
with
her
full
basket
*punct* ,
two
curs
quarrelling
over
a
dirty
bone
*punct* ,
and
a
string
of
dawdling
children
round
the
baker's
little
bow-window
eyeing
the
gingerbread
*punct* ,
she
knew
she
had
no
reason
to
complain
*punct* ,
and
was
amused
enough
*punct* ;
quite
enough
still
to
stand
at
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
a
mind
lively
and
at
ease
*punct* ,
can
do
with
seeing
nothing
*punct* ,
and
can
see
nothing
that
does
not
answer
*punct* .
*break*
she
looked
down
the
randalls
road
*punct* .
*break*
the
scene
enlarged
*punct* ;
two
persons
appeared
*punct* ;
mrs.
weston
and
her
son-in-law
*punct* ;
they
were
walking
into
highbury;
*punct* ,
to
hartfield
of
course
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
stopping
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
in
the
first
place
at
mrs.
bates's
*punct* ;
whose
house
was
a
little
nearer
randalls
than
ford's
*punct* ;
and
had
all
but
knocked
*punct* ,
when
emma
caught
their
eye.
*punct* ,
immediately
they
crossed
the
road
and
came
forward
to
her
*punct* ;
and
the
agreeableness
of
yesterday's
engagement
seemed
to
give
fresh
pleasure
to
the
present
meeting
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
informed
her
that
she
was
going
to
call
on
the
bateses
*punct* ,
in
order
to
hear
the
new
instrument
*punct* .
*break*
for
my
companion
tells
me
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
that
i
absolutely
promised
miss
bates
last
night
*punct* ,
that
i
would
come
this
morning
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
not
aware
of
it
myself
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
not
know
that
i
had
fixed
a
day
*punct* ,
but
as
he
says
i
did
*punct* ,
i
am
going
now
*punct* .
*break*
and
while
mrs.
weston
pays
her
visit
*punct* ,
i
may
be
allowed
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ,
said
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
to
join
your
party
and
wait
for
her
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
if
you
are
going
home
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
was
disappointed
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
you
meant
to
go
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
they
would
be
very
much
pleased
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
be
quite
in
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
i
may
be
equally
in
the
way
here
*punct* .
*break*
miss
woodhouse
looks
as
if
she
did
not
want
me
*punct* .
*break*
my
aunt
always
sends
me
off
when
she
is
shopping
*punct* .
*break*
she
says
i
fidget
her
to
death
*punct* ;
and
miss
woodhouse
looks
as
if
she
could
almost
say
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
what
am
i
to
do
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
here
on
no
business
of
my
own
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ;
i
am
only
waiting
for
my
friend
*punct* .
*break*
she
will
probably
have
soon
done
*punct* ,
and
then
we
shall
go
home
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
had
better
go
with
mrs.
weston
and
hear
the
instrument
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
if
you
advise
it.
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
with
a
smile
*punct* ,
if
colonel
campbell
should
have
employed
a
careless
friend
*punct* ,
and
if
it
should
prove
to
have
an
indifferent
tone
*punct* ,
what
shall
i
say
*punct* ?
*break*
i
shall
be
no
support
to
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
she
might
do
very
well
by
herself
*punct* .
*break*
a
disagreeable
truth
would
be
palatable
through
her
lips
*punct* ,
but
i
am
the
wretchedest
being
in
the
world
at
a
civil
falsehood
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
believe
any
such
thing
*punct* ,
replied
emma.
*punct* ,
i
am
persuaded
that
you
can
be
as
insincere
as
your
neighbours
*punct* ,
when
it
is
necessary
*punct* ;
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
the
instrument
is
indifferent
*punct* .
*break*
quite
otherwise
indeed
*punct* ,
if
i
understood
miss
fairfax's
opinion
last
night
*punct* .
*break*
do
come
with
me
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
if
it
be
not
very
disagreeable
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
it
need
not
detain
us
long
*punct* .
*break*
we
will
go
to
hartfield
afterwards
*punct* .
*break*
we
will
follow
them
to
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
i
really
wish
you
to
call
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
be
felt
so
great
an
attention
*punct* !
*break*
and
i
always
thought
you
meant
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
say
no
more
*punct* ;
and
with
the
hope
of
hartfield
to
reward
him
*punct* ,
returned
with
mrs.
weston
to
mrs.
bates's
door
*punct* .
*break*
emma
watched
them
in
*punct* ,
and
then
joined
harriet
at
the
interesting
counter,
*punct* ,
trying
*punct* ,
with
all
the
force
of
her
own
mind
*punct* ,
to
convince
her
that
if
she
wanted
plain
muslin
it
was
of
no
use
to
look
at
figured
*punct* ;
and
that
a
blue
ribbon
*punct* ,
be
it
ever
so
beautiful
*punct* ,
would
still
never
match
her
yellow
pattern
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
it
was
all
settled
*punct* ,
even
to
the
destination
of
the
parcel
*punct* .
*break*
should
i
send
it
to
mrs.
goddard's
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ?
*break*
asked
mrs.
ford.
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
to
mrs.
goddard's
*punct* .
*break*
only
my
pattern
gown
is
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
you
shall
send
it
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* .
*break*
but
then
*punct* ,
mrs.
goddard
will
want
to
see
it.
*punct* ,
and
i
could
take
the
pattern
gown
home
any
day
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
shall
want
the
ribbon
directly
*punct* ,
so
it
had
better
go
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
at
least
the
ribbon
*punct* .
*break*
you
could
make
it
into
two
parcels
*punct* ,
mrs.
ford
*punct* ,
could
not
you
*punct* ?
*break*
it
is
not
worth
while
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
to
give
mrs.
ford
the
trouble
of
two
parcels
*punct* .
*break*
no
more
it
is
*punct* .
*break*
no
trouble
in
the
world
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ,
said
the
obliging
mrs.
ford
*punct* .
*break*
but
indeed
i
would
much
rather
have
it
only
in
one
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* ,
you
shall
send
it
all
to
mrs.
goddard's
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
i
may
just
as
well
have
it
sent
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
and
take
it
home
with
me
at
night
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
advise
*punct* ?
*break*
that
you
do
not
give
another
half-second
to
the
subject
*punct* .
*break*
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* ,
mrs.
ford
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
that
will
be
much
best
*punct* ,
said
harriet
*punct* ,
quite
satisfied
*punct* ,
i
should
not
at
all
like
to
have
it
sent
to
mrs.
goddard's
*punct* .
*break*
voices
approached
the
shop
*punct* ,
or
rather
one
voice
and
two
ladies
*punct* :
mrs.
weston
and
miss
bates
met
them
at
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
said
the
latter
*punct* ,
i
am
just
run
across
to
entreat
the
favour
of
you
to
come
and
sit
down
with
us
a
little
while
*punct* ,
and
give
us
your
opinion
of
our
new
instrument
*punct* ;
you
and
miss
smith
*punct* .
*break*
how
do
you
do
*punct* ,
miss
smith?
*punct* ,
very
well
i
thank
you.
*punct* ,
and
i
begged
mrs.
weston
to
come
with
me
*punct* ,
that
i
might
be
sure
of
succeeding
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
mrs.
bates
and
miss
fairfax
are
*punct* ,
very
well
*punct* ,
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
my
mother
is
delightfully
well
*punct* ;
and
jane
caught
no
cold
last
night
*punct* .
*break*
how
is
mr.
woodhouse?
*punct* ,
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
such
a
good
account
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
told
me
you
were
here.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
then
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
i
must
run
across
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
miss
woodhouse
will
allow
me
just
to
run
across
and
entreat
her
to
come
in
*punct* ;
my
mother
will
be
so
very
happy
to
see
her
*punct* ,
and
now
we
are
such
a
nice
party
*punct* ,
she
cannot
refuse.
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
pray
do
*punct* ,
said
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse's
opinion
of
the
instrument
will
be
worth
having.'
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
i
shall
be
more
sure
of
succeeding
if
one
of
you
will
go
with
me.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
wait
half
a
minute
*punct* ,
till
i
have
finished
my
job;'
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
would
you
believe
it
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
there
he
is
*punct* ,
in
the
most
obliging
manner
in
the
world
*punct* ,
fastening
in
the
rivet
of
my
mother's
spectacles.
*punct* ,
the
rivet
came
out
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
this
morning.
*punct* ,
so
very
obliging!
*punct* ,
for
my
mother
had
no
use
of
her
spectacles
*punct* ,
could
not
put
them
on
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
by
the
bye
*punct* ,
every
body
ought
to
have
two
pair
of
spectacles
*punct* ;
they
should
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
jane
said
so
*punct* .
*break*
i
meant
to
take
them
over
to
john
saunders
the
first
thing
i
did
*punct* ,
but
something
or
other
hindered
me
all
the
morning
*punct* ;
first
one
thing
*punct* ,
then
another
*punct* ,
there
is
no
saying
what
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
at
one
time
patty
came
to
say
she
thought
the
kitchen
chimney
wanted
sweeping
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
patty
do
not
come
with
your
bad
news
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
here
is
the
rivet
of
your
mistress's
spectacles
out
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
baked
apples
came
home
*punct* ,
mrs.
wallis
sent
them
by
her
boy
*punct* ;
they
are
extremely
civil
and
obliging
to
us
*punct* ,
the
wallises
*punct* ,
always
*punct* ,
i
have
heard
some
people
say
that
mrs.
wallis
can
be
uncivil
and
give
a
very
rude
answer
*punct* ,
but
we
have
never
known
any
thing
but
the
greatest
attention
from
them
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
cannot
be
for
the
value
of
our
custom
now
*punct* ,
for
what
is
our
consumption
of
bread
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ?
*break*
only
three
of
us.
*punct* ,
besides
dear
jane
at
present
*punct* ,
and
she
really
eats
nothing
*punct* ,
makes
such
a
shocking
breakfast
*punct* ,
you
would
be
quite
frightened
if
you
saw
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
not
let
my
mother
know
how
little
she
eats
*punct* ,
so
i
say
one
thing
and
then
i
say
another
*punct* ,
and
it
passes
off
*punct* .
*break*
but
about
the
middle
of
the
day
she
gets
hungry
*punct* ,
and
there
is
nothing
she
likes
so
well
as
these
baked
apples
*punct* ,
and
they
are
extremely
wholesome
*punct* ,
for
i
took
the
opportunity
the
other
day
of
asking
mr.
perry
*punct* ;
i
happened
to
meet
him
in
the
street
*punct* .
*break*
not
that
i
had
any
doubt
before
*punct* ,
i
have
so
often
heard
mr.
woodhouse
recommend
a
baked
apple
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
it
is
the
only
way
that
mr.
woodhouse
thinks
the
fruit
thoroughly
wholesome
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
apple-dumplings
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
very
often
*punct* .
*break*
patty
makes
an
excellent
apple-dumpling
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
you
have
prevailed
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ,
and
these
ladies
will
oblige
us
*punct* .
*break*
emma
would
be
very
happy
to
wait
on
mrs.
bates
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
and
they
did
at
last
move
out
of
the
shop
*punct* ,
with
no
farther
delay
from
miss
bates
than
*punct* ,
how
do
you
do
*punct* ,
mrs.
ford
*punct* ?
*break*
i
beg
your
pardon
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
not
see
you
before
*punct* .
*break*
i
hear
you
have
a
charming
collection
of
new
ribbons
from
town
*punct* .
*break*
jane
came
back
delighted
yesterday
*punct* .
*break*
thank
ye
*punct* ,
the
gloves
do
very
well
*punct* ,
only
a
little
too
large
about
the
wrist
*punct* ;
but
jane
is
taking
them
in
*punct* .
*break*
what
was
i
talking
of
*punct* ?
*break*
said
she
*punct* ,
beginning
again
when
they
were
all
in
the
street
*punct* .
*break*
emma
wondered
on
what
*punct* ,
of
all
the
medley
*punct* ,
she
would
fix
*punct* .
*break*
i
declare
i
cannot
recollect
what
i
was
talking
of.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
my
mother's
spectacles
*punct* .
*break*
so
very
obliging
of
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* !
*break*
said
he
*punct* ,
i
do
think
i
can
fasten
the
rivet
*punct* ;
i
like
a
job
of
this
kind
excessively.'
*punct* ,
which
you
know
shewed
him
to
be
so
very
*punct* ...
indeed
i
must
say
that
*punct* ,
much
as
i
had
heard
of
him
before
and
much
as
i
had
expected
*punct* ,
he
very
far
exceeds
any
thing
*punct* ...
i
do
congratulate
you
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
most
warmly
*punct* .
*break*
he
seems
every
thing
the
fondest
parent
could
*punct* ...
oh
*punct* !
*break*
said
he
*punct* ,
i
can
fasten
the
rivet
*punct* .
*break*
i
like
a
job
of
that
sort
excessively
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
shall
forget
his
manner
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
i
brought
out
the
baked
apples
from
the
closet
*punct* ,
and
hoped
our
friends
would
be
so
very
obliging
as
to
take
some
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
said
he
directly
*punct* ,
there
is
nothing
in
the
way
of
fruit
half
so
good
*punct* ,
and
these
are
the
finest-looking
home-baked
apples
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
*punct* .
*break*
that
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
was
so
very
*punct* ...
and
i
am
sure
*punct* ,
by
his
manner
*punct* ,
it
was
no
compliment
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
they
are
very
delightful
apples
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
wallis
does
them
full
justice
*punct* ,
only
we
do
not
have
them
baked
more
than
twice
*punct* ,
and
mr.
woodhouse
made
us
promise
to
have
them
done
three
times
*punct* ,
but
miss
woodhouse
will
be
so
good
as
not
to
mention
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
apples
themselves
are
the
very
finest
sort
for
baking
*punct* ,
beyond
a
doubt
*punct* ;
all
from
donwell
*punct* ,
some
of
mr.
knightley's
most
liberal
supply
*punct* .
*break*
he
sends
us
a
sack
every
year
*punct* ;
and
certainly
there
never
was
such
a
keeping
apple
anywhere
as
one
of
his
trees
*punct* ,
i
believe
there
is
two
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
my
mother
says
the
orchard
was
always
famous
in
her
younger
days
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
was
really
quite
shocked
the
other
day
*punct* ,
for
mr.
knightley
called
one
morning
*punct* ,
and
jane
was
eating
these
apples
*punct* ,
and
we
talked
about
them
and
said
how
much
she
enjoyed
them
*punct* ,
and
he
asked
whether
we
were
not
got
to
the
end
of
our
stock
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
you
must
be
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
and
i
will
send
you
another
supply
*punct* ;
for
i
have
a
great
many
more
than
i
can
ever
use
*punct* .
*break*
william
larkins
let
me
keep
a
larger
quantity
than
usual
this
year
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
send
you
some
more
*punct* ,
before
they
get
good
for
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
so
i
begged
he
would
not
*punct* ,
for
really
as
to
ours
being
gone
*punct* ,
i
could
not
absolutely
say
that
we
had
a
great
many
left
*punct* ,
it
was
but
half
a
dozen
indeed
*punct* ;
but
they
should
be
all
kept
for
jane
*punct* ;
and
i
could
not
at
all
bear
that
he
should
be
sending
us
more
*punct* ,
so
liberal
as
he
had
been
already
*punct* ;
and
jane
said
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
he
was
gone
*punct* ,
she
almost
quarrelled
with
me
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
i
should
not
say
quarrelled
*punct* ,
for
we
never
had
a
quarrel
in
our
lives
*punct* ;
but
she
was
quite
distressed
that
i
had
owned
the
apples
were
so
nearly
gone
*punct* ;
she
wished
i
had
made
him
believe
we
had
a
great
many
left
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
i
did
say
as
much
as
i
could
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
the
very
same
evening
william
larkins
came
over
with
a
large
basket
of
apples
*punct* ,
the
same
sort
of
apples
*punct* ,
a
bushel
at
least
*punct* ,
and
i
was
very
much
obliged
*punct* ,
and
went
down
and
spoke
to
william
larkins
and
said
every
thing
*punct* ,
as
you
may
suppose
*punct* .
*break*
william
larkins
is
such
an
old
acquaintance
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
always
glad
to
see
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
i
found
afterwards
from
patty
*punct* ,
that
william
said
it
was
all
the
apples
of
that
sort
his
master
had
*punct* ;
he
had
brought
them
all
*punct* ,
and
now
his
master
had
not
one
left
to
bake
or
boil
*punct* .
*break*
william
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
himself
*punct* ,
he
was
so
pleased
to
think
his
master
had
sold
so
many
*punct* ;
for
william
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
thinks
more
of
his
master's
profit
than
any
thing
*punct* ;
but
mrs.
hodges
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
was
quite
displeased
at
their
being
all
sent
away
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
not
bear
that
her
master
should
not
be
able
to
have
another
apple-tart
this
spring
*punct* .
*break*
he
told
patty
this
*punct* ,
but
bid
her
not
mind
it
*punct* ,
and
be
sure
not
to
say
any
thing
to
us
about
it
*punct* ,
for
mrs.
hodges
would
be
cross
sometimes
*punct* ,
and
as
long
as
so
many
sacks
were
sold
*punct* ,
it
did
not
signify
who
ate
the
remainder
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
patty
told
me
*punct* ,
and
i
was
excessively
shocked
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
i
would
not
have
mr.
knightley
know
any
thing
about
it
for
the
world
*punct* !
*break*
he
would
be
so
very
*punct* ...
i
wanted
to
keep
it
from
jane's
knowledge
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
unluckily
*punct* ,
i
had
mentioned
it
before
i
was
aware
*punct* .
*break*
miss
bates
had
just
done
as
patty
opened
the
door
*punct* ;
and
her
visitors
walked
upstairs
without
having
any
regular
narration
to
attend
to
*punct* ,
pursued
only
by
the
sounds
of
her
desultory
good-will
*punct* .
*break*
pray
take
care
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
there
is
a
step
at
the
turning
*punct* .
*break*
pray
take
care
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
ours
is
rather
a
dark
staircase
*punct* ,
rather
darker
and
narrower
than
one
could
wish
*punct* .
*break*
miss
smith
*punct* ,
pray
take
care
*punct* .
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
i
am
quite
concerned
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
you
hit
your
foot
*punct* .
*break*
miss
smith
*punct* ,
the
step
at
the
turning
*punct* .
*break*
the
appearance
of
the
little
sitting-room
as
they
entered
*punct* ,
was
tranquillity
itself
*punct* ;
mrs.
bates
*punct* ,
deprived
of
her
usual
employment
*punct* ,
slumbering
on
one
side
of
the
fire
*punct* ,
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
at
a
table
near
her
*punct* ,
most
deedily
occupied
about
her
spectacles
*punct* ,
and
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
standing
with
her
back
to
them
*punct* ,
intent
on
her
pianoforte
*punct* .
*break*
busy
as
he
was
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
the
young
man
was
yet
able
to
shew
a
most
happy
countenance
on
seeing
emma
again
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
a
pleasure
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
in
rather
a
low
voice
*punct* ,
coming
at
least
ten
minutes
earlier
than
i
had
calculated
*punct* .
*break*
you
find
me
trying
to
be
useful
*punct* ;
tell
me
if
you
think
i
shall
succeed
*punct* .
*break*
said
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
have
not
you
finished
it
yet
*punct* ?
*break*
you
would
not
earn
a
very
good
livelihood
as
a
working
silversmith
at
this
rate
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
not
been
working
uninterruptedly
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
i
have
been
assisting
miss
fairfax
in
trying
to
make
her
instrument
stand
steadily
*punct* ,
it
was
not
quite
firm
*punct* ;
an
unevenness
in
the
floor
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* .
*break*
you
see
we
have
been
wedging
one
leg
with
paper
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
very
kind
of
you
to
be
persuaded
to
come
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
almost
afraid
you
would
be
hurrying
home
*punct* .
*break*
he
contrived
that
she
should
be
seated
by
him
*punct* ;
and
was
sufficiently
employed
in
looking
out
the
best
baked
apple
for
her
*punct* ,
and
trying
to
make
her
help
or
advise
him
in
his
work
*punct* ,
till
jane
fairfax
was
quite
ready
to
sit
down
to
the
pianoforte
again
*punct* .
*break*
that
she
was
not
immediately
ready
*punct* ,
emma
did
suspect
to
arise
from
the
state
of
her
nerves
*punct* ;
she
had
not
yet
possessed
the
instrument
long
enough
to
touch
it
without
emotion
*punct* ;
she
must
reason
herself
into
the
power
of
performance
*punct* ;
and
emma
could
not
but
pity
such
feelings
*punct* ,
whatever
their
origin
*punct* ,
and
could
not
but
resolve
never
to
expose
them
to
her
neighbour
again
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
jane
began
*punct* ,
and
though
the
first
bars
were
feebly
given
*punct* ,
the
powers
of
the
instrument
were
gradually
done
full
justice
to
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
had
been
delighted
before
*punct* ,
and
was
delighted
again
*punct* ;
emma
joined
her
in
all
her
praise
*punct* ;
and
the
pianoforte
*punct* ,
with
every
proper
discrimination
*punct* ,
was
pronounced
to
be
altogether
of
the
highest
promise
*punct* .
*break*
whoever
colonel
campbell
might
employ
*punct* ,
said
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
with
a
smile
at
emma
*punct* ,
the
person
has
not
chosen
ill
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
a
good
deal
of
colonel
campbell's
taste
at
weymouth
*punct* ;
and
the
softness
of
the
upper
notes
i
am
sure
is
exactly
what
he
and
all
that
party
would
particularly
prize
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
*punct* ,
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
that
he
either
gave
his
friend
very
minute
directions
*punct* ,
or
wrote
to
broadwood
himself
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
you
think
so
*punct* ?
*break*
jane
did
not
look
round
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
not
obliged
to
hear
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
had
been
speaking
to
her
at
the
same
moment
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
fair
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
in
a
whisper
*punct* ;
mine
was
a
random
guess
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
distress
her
*punct* .
*break*
he
shook
his
head
with
a
smile
*punct* ,
and
looked
as
if
he
had
very
little
doubt
and
very
little
mercy
*punct* .
*break*
soon
afterwards
he
began
again
*punct* ,
how
much
your
friends
in
ireland
must
be
enjoying
your
pleasure
on
this
occasion
*punct* ,
miss
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
they
often
think
of
you
*punct* ,
and
wonder
which
will
be
the
day
*punct* ,
the
precise
day
of
the
instrument's
coming
to
hand
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
imagine
colonel
campbell
knows
the
business
to
be
going
forward
just
at
this
time?
*punct* ,
do
you
imagine
it
to
be
the
consequence
of
an
immediate
commission
from
him
*punct* ,
or
that
he
may
have
sent
only
a
general
direction
*punct* ,
an
order
indefinite
as
to
time
*punct* ,
to
depend
upon
contingencies
and
conveniences
*punct* ?
*break*
she
could
not
but
hear
*punct* ;
she
could
not
avoid
answering
*punct* ,
till
i
have
a
letter
from
colonel
campbell
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
in
a
voice
of
forced
calmness
*punct* ,
i
can
imagine
nothing
with
any
confidence
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
be
all
conjecture
*punct* .
*break*
conjecture
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
sometimes
one
conjectures
right
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
one
conjectures
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
i
could
conjecture
how
soon
i
shall
make
this
rivet
quite
firm
*punct* .
*break*
what
nonsense
one
talks
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
when
hard
at
work
*punct* ,
if
one
talks
at
all;
*punct* ,
your
real
workmen
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
hold
their
tongues
*punct* ;
but
we
gentlemen
labourers
if
we
get
hold
of
a
word
*punct* ,
miss
fairfax
said
something
about
conjecturing
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
it
is
done
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
the
pleasure
*punct* ,
madam
*punct* ,
to
mrs.
bates,
*punct* ,
of
restoring
your
spectacles
*punct* ,
healed
for
the
present
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
very
warmly
thanked
both
by
mother
and
daughter
*punct* ;
to
escape
a
little
from
the
latter
*punct* ,
he
went
to
the
pianoforte
*punct* ,
and
begged
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
who
was
still
sitting
at
it
*punct* ,
to
play
something
more
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
are
very
kind
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
it
will
be
one
of
the
waltzes
we
danced
last
night;
*punct* ,
let
me
live
them
over
again
*punct* .
*break*
you
did
not
enjoy
them
as
i
did
*punct* ;
you
appeared
tired
the
whole
time
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
you
were
glad
we
danced
no
longer
*punct* ;
but
i
would
have
given
worlds
*punct* ,
all
the
worlds
one
ever
has
to
give
*punct* ,
for
another
half-hour
*punct* .
*break*
what
felicity
it
is
to
hear
a
tune
again
which
has
made
one
happy!
*punct* ,
if
i
mistake
not
that
was
danced
at
weymouth
*punct* .
*break*
she
looked
up
at
him
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
coloured
deeply
*punct* ,
and
played
something
else
*punct* .
*break*
he
took
some
music
from
a
chair
near
the
pianoforte
*punct* ,
and
turning
to
emma
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
here
is
something
quite
new
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
know
it?
*punct* ,
cramer.
*punct* ,
and
here
are
a
new
set
of
irish
melodies
*punct* .
*break*
that
*punct* ,
from
such
a
quarter
*punct* ,
one
might
expect
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
all
sent
with
the
instrument
*punct* .
*break*
very
thoughtful
of
colonel
campbell
*punct* ,
was
not
it?
*punct* ,
he
knew
miss
fairfax
could
have
no
music
here
*punct* .
*break*
i
honour
that
part
of
the
attention
particularly
*punct* ;
it
shews
it
to
have
been
so
thoroughly
from
the
heart
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
hastily
done
*punct* ;
nothing
incomplete
*punct* .
*break*
true
affection
only
could
have
prompted
it
*punct* .
*break*
emma
wished
he
would
be
less
pointed
*punct* ,
yet
could
not
help
being
amused
*punct* ;
and
when
on
glancing
her
eye
towards
jane
fairfax
she
caught
the
remains
of
a
smile
*punct* ,
when
she
saw
that
with
all
the
deep
blush
of
consciousness
*punct* ,
there
had
been
a
smile
of
secret
delight
*punct* ,
she
had
less
scruple
in
the
amusement
*punct* ,
and
much
less
compunction
with
respect
to
her.
*punct* ,
this
amiable
*punct* ,
upright
*punct* ,
perfect
jane
fairfax
was
apparently
cherishing
very
reprehensible
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
he
brought
all
the
music
to
her
*punct* ,
and
they
looked
it
over
together.
*punct* ,
emma
took
the
opportunity
of
whispering
*punct* ,
you
speak
too
plain
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
understand
you
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
she
does
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
have
her
understand
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
in
the
least
ashamed
of
my
meaning
*punct* .
*break*
but
really
*punct* ,
i
am
half
ashamed
*punct* ,
and
wish
i
had
never
taken
up
the
idea
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
very
glad
you
did
*punct* ,
and
that
you
communicated
it
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
now
a
key
to
all
her
odd
looks
and
ways
*punct* .
*break*
leave
shame
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
if
she
does
wrong
*punct* ,
she
ought
to
feel
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
not
entirely
without
it
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
see
much
sign
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
playing
robin
adair
at
this
moment
*punct* ,
his
favourite
*punct* .
*break*
shortly
afterwards
miss
bates
*punct* ,
passing
near
the
window
*punct* ,
descried
mr.
knightley
on
horse-back
not
far
off
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
i
declare!
*punct* ,
i
must
speak
to
him
if
possible
*punct* ,
just
to
thank
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
not
open
the
window
here
*punct* ;
it
would
give
you
all
cold
*punct* ;
but
i
can
go
into
my
mother's
room
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
he
will
come
in
when
he
knows
who
is
here
*punct* .
*break*
quite
delightful
to
have
you
all
meet
so!
*punct* ,
our
little
room
so
honoured
*punct* !
*break*
she
was
in
the
adjoining
chamber
while
she
still
spoke
*punct* ,
and
opening
the
casement
there
*punct* ,
immediately
called
mr.
knightley's
attention
*punct* ,
and
every
syllable
of
their
conversation
was
as
distinctly
heard
by
the
others
*punct* ,
as
if
it
had
passed
within
the
same
apartment
*punct* .
*break*
so
obliged
to
you
for
the
carriage
last
night
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
just
in
time
*punct* ;
my
mother
just
ready
for
us
*punct* .
*break*
pray
come
in
*punct* ;
do
come
in
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
find
some
friends
here
*punct* .
*break*
so
began
miss
bates
*punct* ;
and
mr.
knightley
seemed
determined
to
be
heard
in
his
turn
*punct* ,
for
most
resolutely
and
commandingly
did
he
say
*punct* ,
how
is
your
niece
*punct* ,
miss
bates?
*punct* ,
i
want
to
inquire
after
you
all
*punct* ,
but
particularly
your
niece
*punct* .
*break*
how
is
miss
fairfax?
*punct* ,
i
hope
she
caught
no
cold
last
night
*punct* .
*break*
how
is
she
to-day
*punct* ?
*break*
tell
me
how
miss
fairfax
is
*punct* .
*break*
and
miss
bates
was
obliged
to
give
a
direct
answer
before
he
would
hear
her
in
any
thing
else
*punct* .
*break*
the
listeners
were
amused
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
weston
gave
emma
a
look
of
particular
meaning
*punct* .
*break*
but
emma
still
shook
her
head
in
steady
scepticism
*punct* .
*break*
so
obliged
to
you!
*punct* ,
so
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
carriage
*punct* ,
resumed
miss
bates
*punct* .
*break*
he
cut
her
short
with
*punct* ,
i
am
going
to
kingston
*punct* .
*break*
can
i
do
anything
for
you
*punct* ?
*break*
dear
*punct* ,
kingston
*punct* ,
are
you?
*punct* ,
mrs.
cole
was
saying
the
other
day
she
wanted
something
from
kingston
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
cole
has
servants
to
send
*punct* .
*break*
can
i
do
any
thing
for
you
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
thank
you
*punct* .
*break*
but
do
come
in
*punct* .
*break*
who
do
you
think
is
here?
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
and
miss
smith
*punct* ;
so
kind
as
to
call
to
hear
the
new
pianoforte
*punct* .
*break*
do
put
up
your
horse
at
the
crown
*punct* ,
and
come
in
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
in
a
deliberating
manner
*punct* ,
for
five
minutes
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* .
*break*
and
here
is
mrs.
weston
and
mr.
frank
churchill
too!
*punct* ,
quite
delightful
*punct* ;
so
many
friends
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
not
now
*punct* ,
i
thank
you
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
stay
two
minutes
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
get
on
to
kingston
as
fast
as
i
can
*punct* .
*break*
do
come
in
*punct* .
*break*
they
will
be
so
very
happy
to
see
you
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ;
your
room
is
full
enough
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
call
another
day
*punct* ,
and
hear
the
pianoforte
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
i
am
so
sorry!
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
what
a
delightful
party
last
night
*punct* ;
how
extremely
pleasant.
*punct* ,
did
you
ever
see
such
dancing?
*punct* ,
was
not
it
delightful?
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
and
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* ;
i
never
saw
any
thing
equal
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
very
delightful
indeed
*punct* ;
i
can
say
nothing
less
*punct* ,
for
i
suppose
miss
woodhouse
and
mr.
frank
churchill
are
hearing
every
thing
that
passes
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
raising
his
voice
still
more
*punct* ,
i
do
not
see
why
miss
fairfax
should
not
be
mentioned
too
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
miss
fairfax
dances
very
well
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
weston
is
the
very
best
country-dance
player
*punct* ,
without
exception
*punct* ,
in
england
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
if
your
friends
have
any
gratitude
*punct* ,
they
will
say
something
pretty
loud
about
you
and
me
in
return
*punct* ;
but
i
cannot
stay
to
hear
it
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
one
moment
more
*punct* ;
something
of
consequence
*punct* ,
so
shocked!
*punct* ,
jane
and
i
are
both
so
shocked
about
the
apples
*punct* !
*break*
what
is
the
matter
now
*punct* ?
*break*
to
think
of
your
sending
us
all
your
store
apples
*punct* .
*break*
you
said
you
had
a
great
many
*punct* ,
and
now
you
have
not
one
left
*punct* .
*break*
we
really
are
so
shocked
*punct* !
*break*
mrs.
hodges
may
well
be
angry
*punct* .
*break*
william
larkins
mentioned
it
here
*punct* .
*break*
you
should
not
have
done
it
*punct* ,
indeed
you
should
not
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
off
*punct* .
*break*
he
never
can
bear
to
be
thanked
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
thought
he
would
have
staid
now
*punct* ,
and
it
would
have
been
a
pity
not
to
have
mentioned
*punct* ...
well
*punct* ,
returning
to
the
room,
*punct* ,
i
have
not
been
able
to
succeed
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
cannot
stop
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
going
to
kingston
*punct* .
*break*
he
asked
me
if
he
could
do
any
thing
*punct* ...
yes
*punct* ,
said
jane
*punct* ,
we
heard
his
kind
offers
*punct* ,
we
heard
every
thing
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
you
might
*punct* ,
because
you
know
*punct* ,
the
door
was
open
*punct* ,
and
the
window
was
open
*punct* ,
and
mr.
knightley
spoke
loud
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
have
heard
every
thing
to
be
sure
*punct* .
*break*
can
i
do
any
thing
for
you
at
kingston
*punct* ?
*break*
said
he
*punct* ;
so
i
just
mentioned
*punct* ...
oh
*punct* !
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
must
you
be
going?
*punct* ,
you
seem
but
just
come
*punct* ,
so
very
obliging
of
you
*punct* .
*break*
emma
found
it
really
time
to
be
at
home
*punct* ;
the
visit
had
already
lasted
long
*punct* ;
and
on
examining
watches
*punct* ,
so
much
of
the
morning
was
perceived
to
be
gone
*punct* ,
that
mrs.
weston
and
her
companion
taking
leave
also
*punct* ,
could
allow
themselves
only
to
walk
with
the
two
young
ladies
to
hartfield
gates
*punct* ,
before
they
set
off
for
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
be
possible
to
do
without
dancing
entirely
*punct* .
*break*
instances
have
been
known
of
young
people
passing
many
*punct* ,
many
months
successively
*punct* ,
without
being
at
any
ball
of
any
description
*punct* ,
and
no
material
injury
accrue
either
to
body
or
mind;
*punct* ,
but
when
a
beginning
is
made
*punct* ,
when
the
felicities
of
rapid
motion
have
once
been
*punct* ,
though
slightly
*punct* ,
felt
*punct* ,
it
must
be
a
very
heavy
set
that
does
not
ask
for
more
*punct* .
*break*
frank
churchill
had
danced
once
at
highbury
*punct* ,
and
longed
to
dance
again
*punct* ;
and
the
last
half-hour
of
an
evening
which
mr.
woodhouse
was
persuaded
to
spend
with
his
daughter
at
randalls
*punct* ,
was
passed
by
the
two
young
people
in
schemes
on
the
subject
*punct* .
*break*
frank's
was
the
first
idea
*punct* ;
and
his
the
greatest
zeal
in
pursuing
it
*punct* ;
for
the
lady
was
the
best
judge
of
the
difficulties
*punct* ,
and
the
most
solicitous
for
accommodation
and
appearance
*punct* .
*break*
but
still
she
had
inclination
enough
for
shewing
people
again
how
delightfully
mr.
frank
churchill
and
miss
woodhouse
danced
*punct* ,
for
doing
that
in
which
she
need
not
blush
to
compare
herself
with
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
and
even
for
simple
dancing
itself
*punct* ,
without
any
of
the
wicked
aids
of
vanity
*punct* ,
to
assist
him
first
in
pacing
out
the
room
they
were
in
to
see
what
it
could
be
made
to
hold
*punct* ,
and
then
in
taking
the
dimensions
of
the
other
parlour
*punct* ,
in
the
hope
of
discovering
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
all
that
mr.
weston
could
say
of
their
exactly
equal
size
*punct* ,
that
it
was
a
little
the
largest
*punct* .
*break*
his
first
proposition
and
request
*punct* ,
that
the
dance
begun
at
mr.
cole's
should
be
finished
there
*punct* ,
that
the
same
party
should
be
collected
*punct* ,
and
the
same
musician
engaged
*punct* ,
met
with
the
readiest
acquiescence
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
entered
into
the
idea
with
thorough
enjoyment
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
weston
most
willingly
undertook
to
play
as
long
as
they
could
wish
to
dance
*punct* ;
and
the
interesting
employment
had
followed
*punct* ,
of
reckoning
up
exactly
who
there
would
be
*punct* ,
and
portioning
out
the
indispensable
division
of
space
to
every
couple
*punct* .
*break*
you
and
miss
smith
*punct* ,
and
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
will
be
three
*punct* ,
and
the
two
miss
coxes
five
*punct* ,
had
been
repeated
many
times
over
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
will
be
the
two
gilberts
*punct* ,
young
cox
*punct* ,
my
father
*punct* ,
and
myself
*punct* ,
besides
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
that
will
be
quite
enough
for
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
you
and
miss
smith
*punct* ,
and
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
will
be
three
*punct* ,
and
the
two
miss
coxes
five
*punct* ;
and
for
five
couple
there
will
be
plenty
of
room
*punct* .
*break*
but
soon
it
came
to
be
on
one
side
*punct* ,
but
will
there
be
good
room
for
five
couple?
*punct* ,
i
really
do
not
think
there
will
*punct* .
*break*
on
another
*punct* ,
and
after
all
*punct* ,
five
couple
are
not
enough
to
make
it
worth
while
to
stand
up
*punct* .
*break*
five
couple
are
nothing
*punct* ,
when
one
thinks
seriously
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
not
do
to
invite
five
couple
*punct* .
*break*
it
can
be
allowable
only
as
the
thought
of
the
moment
*punct* .
*break*
somebody
said
that
miss
gilbert
was
expected
at
her
brother's
*punct* ,
and
must
be
invited
with
the
rest
*punct* .
*break*
somebody
else
believed
mrs.
gilbert
would
have
danced
the
other
evening
*punct* ,
if
she
had
been
asked
*punct* .
*break*
a
word
was
put
in
for
a
second
young
cox
*punct* ;
and
at
last
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
naming
one
family
of
cousins
who
must
be
included
*punct* ,
and
another
of
very
old
acquaintance
who
could
not
be
left
out
*punct* ,
it
became
a
certainty
that
the
five
couple
would
be
at
least
ten
*punct* ,
and
a
very
interesting
speculation
in
what
possible
manner
they
could
be
disposed
of
*punct* .
*break*
the
doors
of
the
two
rooms
were
just
opposite
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
might
not
they
use
both
rooms
*punct* ,
and
dance
across
the
passage
*punct* ?
*break*
it
seemed
the
best
scheme
*punct* ;
and
yet
it
was
not
so
good
but
that
many
of
them
wanted
a
better
*punct* .
*break*
emma
said
it
would
be
awkward
*punct* ;
mrs.
weston
was
in
distress
about
the
supper
*punct* ;
and
mr.
woodhouse
opposed
it
earnestly
*punct* ,
on
the
score
of
health
*punct* .
*break*
it
made
him
so
very
unhappy
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
that
it
could
not
be
persevered
in
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ;
it
would
be
the
extreme
of
imprudence
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
bear
it
for
emma!
*punct* ,
emma
is
not
strong
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
catch
a
dreadful
cold
*punct* .
*break*
so
would
poor
little
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
so
you
would
all
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
you
would
be
quite
laid
up
*punct* ;
do
not
let
them
talk
of
such
a
wild
thing
*punct* .
*break*
pray
do
not
let
them
talk
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
that
young
man
*punct* ,
speaking
lower
*punct* ,
is
very
thoughtless
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
tell
his
father
*punct* ,
but
that
young
man
is
not
quite
the
thing
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
been
opening
the
doors
very
often
this
evening
*punct* ,
and
keeping
them
open
very
inconsiderately
*punct* .
*break*
he
does
not
think
of
the
draught
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
mean
to
set
you
against
him
*punct* ,
but
indeed
he
is
not
quite
the
thing
*punct* !
*break*
mrs.
weston
was
sorry
for
such
a
charge
*punct* .
*break*
she
knew
the
importance
of
it
*punct* ,
and
said
every
thing
in
her
power
to
do
it
away
*punct* .
*break*
every
door
was
now
closed
*punct* ,
the
passage
plan
given
up
*punct* ,
and
the
first
scheme
of
dancing
only
in
the
room
they
were
in
resorted
to
again
*punct* ;
and
with
such
good-will
on
frank
churchill's
part
*punct* ,
that
the
space
which
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
had
been
deemed
barely
sufficient
for
five
couple
*punct* ,
was
now
endeavoured
to
be
made
out
quite
enough
for
ten
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
too
magnificent
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* .
*break*
we
allowed
unnecessary
room
*punct* .
*break*
ten
couple
may
stand
here
very
well
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
a
crowd
*punct* ,
a
sad
crowd
*punct* ;
and
what
could
be
worse
than
dancing
without
space
to
turn
in
*punct* ?
*break*
very
true
*punct* ,
he
gravely
replied
*punct* ;
it
was
very
bad
*punct* .
*break*
but
still
he
went
on
measuring
*punct* ,
and
still
he
ended
with
*punct* ,
i
think
there
will
be
very
tolerable
room
for
ten
couple
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
you
are
quite
unreasonable
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
dreadful
to
be
standing
so
close
*punct* !
*break*
nothing
can
be
farther
from
pleasure
than
to
be
dancing
in
a
crowd
*punct* ,
and
a
crowd
in
a
little
room
*punct* !
*break*
there
is
no
denying
it
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* .
*break*
i
agree
with
you
exactly
*punct* .
*break*
a
crowd
in
a
little
room
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
you
have
the
art
of
giving
pictures
in
a
few
words
*punct* .
*break*
exquisite
*punct* ,
quite
exquisite!
*punct* ,
still
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
having
proceeded
so
far
*punct* ,
one
is
unwilling
to
give
the
matter
up
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
a
disappointment
to
my
father
*punct* ,
and
altogether
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
that
*punct* ,
i
am
rather
of
opinion
that
ten
couple
might
stand
here
very
well
*punct* .
*break*
emma
perceived
that
the
nature
of
his
gallantry
was
a
little
self-willed
*punct* ,
and
that
he
would
rather
oppose
than
lose
the
pleasure
of
dancing
with
her
*punct* ;
but
she
took
the
compliment
*punct* ,
and
forgave
the
rest
*punct* .
*break*
had
she
intended
ever
to
marry
him
*punct* ,
it
might
have
been
worth
while
to
pause
and
consider
*punct* ,
and
try
to
understand
the
value
of
his
preference
*punct* ,
and
the
character
of
his
temper
*punct* ;
but
for
all
the
purposes
of
their
acquaintance
*punct* ,
he
was
quite
amiable
enough
*punct* .
*break*
before
the
middle
of
the
next
day
*punct* ,
he
was
at
hartfield
*punct* ;
and
he
entered
the
room
with
such
an
agreeable
smile
as
certified
the
continuance
of
the
scheme
*punct* .
*break*
it
soon
appeared
that
he
came
to
announce
an
improvement
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
he
almost
immediately
began
*punct* ,
your
inclination
for
dancing
has
not
been
quite
frightened
away
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ,
by
the
terrors
of
my
father's
little
rooms
*punct* .
*break*
i
bring
a
new
proposal
on
the
subject:
*punct* ,
a
thought
of
my
father's
*punct* ,
which
waits
only
your
approbation
to
be
acted
upon
*punct* .
*break*
may
i
hope
for
the
honour
of
your
hand
for
the
two
first
dances
of
this
little
projected
ball
*punct* ,
to
be
given
*punct* ,
not
at
randalls
*punct* ,
but
at
the
crown
inn
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ;
if
you
and
mr.
woodhouse
see
no
objection
*punct* ,
and
i
trust
you
cannot
*punct* ,
my
father
hopes
his
friends
will
be
so
kind
as
to
visit
him
there
*punct* .
*break*
better
accommodations
*punct* ,
he
can
promise
them
*punct* ,
and
not
a
less
grateful
welcome
than
at
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
his
own
idea
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
sees
no
objection
to
it
*punct* ,
provided
you
are
satisfied
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
what
we
all
feel
*punct* .
*break*
you
were
perfectly
right
*punct* !
*break*
ten
couple
*punct* ,
in
either
of
the
randalls
rooms
*punct* ,
would
have
been
insufferable!
*punct* ,
dreadful!
*punct* ,
i
felt
how
right
you
were
the
whole
time
*punct* ,
but
was
too
anxious
for
securing
any
thing
to
like
to
yield
*punct* .
*break*
is
not
it
a
good
exchange?
*punct* ,
you
consent
*punct* ,
i
hope
you
consent
*punct* ?
*break*
it
appears
to
me
a
plan
that
nobody
can
object
to
*punct* ,
if
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
do
not
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
it
admirable
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
as
far
as
i
can
answer
for
myself
*punct* ,
shall
be
most
happy
*punct* ,
it
seems
the
only
improvement
that
could
be
*punct* .
*break*
papa
*punct* ,
do
you
not
think
it
an
excellent
improvement
*punct* ?
*break*
she
was
obliged
to
repeat
and
explain
it
*punct* ,
before
it
was
fully
comprehended
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
being
quite
new
*punct* ,
farther
representations
were
necessary
to
make
it
acceptable
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ;
he
thought
it
very
far
from
an
improvement
*punct* ,
a
very
bad
plan
*punct* ,
much
worse
than
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
a
room
at
an
inn
was
always
damp
and
dangerous
*punct* ;
never
properly
aired
*punct* ,
or
fit
to
be
inhabited
*punct* .
*break*
if
they
must
dance
*punct* ,
they
had
better
dance
at
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
never
been
in
the
room
at
the
crown
in
his
life
*punct* ,
did
not
know
the
people
who
kept
it
by
sight.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
a
very
bad
plan
*punct* .
*break*
they
would
catch
worse
colds
at
the
crown
than
anywhere
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
going
to
observe
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
that
one
of
the
great
recommendations
of
this
change
would
be
the
very
little
danger
of
any
body's
catching
cold
*punct* ,
so
much
less
danger
at
the
crown
than
at
randalls
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
perry
might
have
reason
to
regret
the
alteration
*punct* ,
but
nobody
else
could
*punct* .
*break*
sir
*punct* ,
said
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
rather
warmly
*punct* ,
you
are
very
much
mistaken
if
you
suppose
mr.
perry
to
be
that
sort
of
character
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
perry
is
extremely
concerned
when
any
of
us
are
ill
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
do
not
understand
how
the
room
at
the
crown
can
be
safer
for
you
than
your
father's
house
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
very
circumstance
of
its
being
larger
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
have
no
occasion
to
open
the
windows
at
all
*punct* ,
not
once
the
whole
evening
*punct* ;
and
it
is
that
dreadful
habit
of
opening
the
windows
*punct* ,
letting
in
cold
air
upon
heated
bodies
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
as
you
well
know
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
does
the
mischief
*punct* .
*break*
open
the
windows!
*punct* ,
but
surely
*punct* ,
mr.
churchill
*punct* ,
nobody
would
think
of
opening
the
windows
at
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
could
be
so
imprudent
*punct* !
*break*
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
*punct* .
*break*
dancing
with
open
windows!
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* ,
neither
your
father
nor
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
poor
miss
taylor
that
was
*punct* ,
would
suffer
it
*punct* .
*break*
sir
*punct* ,
but
a
thoughtless
young
person
will
sometimes
step
behind
a
window-curtain
*punct* ,
and
throw
up
a
sash
*punct* ,
without
its
being
suspected
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
often
known
it
done
myself
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
indeed
*punct* ,
sir?
*punct* ,
bless
me
*punct* !
*break*
i
never
could
have
supposed
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
live
out
of
the
world
*punct* ,
and
am
often
astonished
at
what
i
hear
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
this
does
make
a
difference
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
when
we
come
to
talk
it
over
*punct* ,
but
these
sort
of
things
require
a
good
deal
of
consideration
*punct* .
*break*
one
cannot
resolve
upon
them
in
a
hurry
*punct* .
*break*
if
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
will
be
so
obliging
as
to
call
here
one
morning
*punct* ,
we
may
talk
it
over
*punct* ,
and
see
what
can
be
done
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
unfortunately
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
my
time
is
so
limited
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
interrupted
emma
*punct* ,
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
for
talking
every
thing
over
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
hurry
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
can
be
contrived
to
be
at
the
crown
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* ,
it
will
be
very
convenient
for
the
horses
*punct* .
*break*
they
will
be
so
near
their
own
stable
*punct* .
*break*
so
they
will
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
a
great
thing
*punct* .
*break*
not
that
james
ever
complains
*punct* ;
but
it
is
right
to
spare
our
horses
when
we
can
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
could
be
sure
of
the
rooms
being
thoroughly
aired
*punct* ,
but
is
mrs.
stokes
to
be
trusted
*punct* ?
*break*
i
doubt
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
her
*punct* ,
even
by
sight
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
answer
for
every
thing
of
that
nature
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
because
it
will
be
under
mrs.
weston's
care
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
undertakes
to
direct
the
whole
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
papa!
*punct* ,
now
you
must
be
satisfied
*punct* ,
our
own
dear
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
who
is
carefulness
itself
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
you
remember
what
mr.
perry
said
*punct* ,
so
many
years
ago
*punct* ,
when
i
had
the
measles
*punct* ?
*break*
if
miss
taylor
undertakes
to
wrap
miss
emma
up
*punct* ,
you
need
not
have
any
fears
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
how
often
have
i
heard
you
speak
of
it
as
such
a
compliment
to
her
*punct* !
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
very
true
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
perry
did
say
so
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
never
forget
it
*punct* .
*break*
poor
little
emma
*punct* !
*break*
you
were
very
bad
with
the
measles
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
you
would
have
been
very
bad
*punct* ,
but
for
perry's
great
attention
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
four
times
a
day
for
a
week
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
*punct* ,
from
the
first
*punct* ,
it
was
a
very
good
sort
*punct* ,
which
was
our
great
comfort
*punct* ;
but
the
measles
are
a
dreadful
complaint
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
whenever
poor
isabella's
little
ones
have
the
measles
*punct* ,
she
will
send
for
perry
*punct* .
*break*
my
father
and
mrs.
weston
are
at
the
crown
at
this
moment
*punct* ,
said
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
examining
the
capabilities
of
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
i
left
them
there
and
came
on
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
impatient
for
your
opinion
*punct* ,
and
hoping
you
might
be
persuaded
to
join
them
and
give
your
advice
on
the
spot
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
desired
to
say
so
from
both
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
the
greatest
pleasure
to
them
*punct* ,
if
you
could
allow
me
to
attend
you
there
*punct* .
*break*
they
can
do
nothing
satisfactorily
without
you
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
most
happy
to
be
called
to
such
a
council
*punct* ;
and
her
father
*punct* ,
engaging
to
think
it
all
over
while
she
was
gone
*punct* ,
the
two
young
people
set
off
together
without
delay
for
the
crown
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
*punct* ;
delighted
to
see
her
and
receive
her
approbation
*punct* ,
very
busy
and
very
happy
in
their
different
way
*punct* ;
she
*punct* ,
in
some
little
distress
*punct* ;
and
he
*punct* ,
finding
every
thing
perfect
*punct* .
*break*
emma
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
this
paper
is
worse
than
i
expected
*punct* .
*break*
in
places
you
see
it
is
dreadfully
dirty
*punct* ;
and
the
wainscot
is
more
yellow
and
forlorn
than
any
thing
i
could
have
imagined
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
you
are
too
particular
*punct* ,
said
her
husband
*punct* .
*break*
what
does
all
that
signify
*punct* ?
*break*
you
will
see
nothing
of
it
by
candlelight
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
be
as
clean
as
randalls
by
candlelight
*punct* .
*break*
we
never
see
any
thing
of
it
on
our
club-nights
*punct* .
*break*
the
ladies
here
probably
exchanged
looks
which
meant
*punct* ,
men
never
know
when
things
are
dirty
or
not
*punct* ;
and
the
gentlemen
perhaps
thought
each
to
himself
*punct* ,
women
will
have
their
little
nonsenses
and
needless
cares
*punct* .
*break*
one
perplexity
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
arose
*punct* ,
which
the
gentlemen
did
not
disdain
*punct* .
*break*
it
regarded
a
supper-room
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
time
of
the
ballroom's
being
built
*punct* ,
suppers
had
not
been
in
question
*punct* ;
and
a
small
card-room
adjoining
*punct* ,
was
the
only
addition
*punct* .
*break*
what
was
to
be
done
*punct* ?
*break*
this
card-room
would
be
wanted
as
a
card-room
now
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
if
cards
were
conveniently
voted
unnecessary
by
their
four
selves
*punct* ,
still
was
it
not
too
small
for
any
comfortable
supper
*punct* ?
*break*
another
room
of
much
better
size
might
be
secured
for
the
purpose
*punct* ;
but
it
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
*punct* ,
and
a
long
awkward
passage
must
be
gone
through
to
get
at
it
*punct* .
*break*
this
made
a
difficulty
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
was
afraid
of
draughts
for
the
young
people
in
that
passage
*punct* ;
and
neither
emma
nor
the
gentlemen
could
tolerate
the
prospect
of
being
miserably
crowded
at
supper
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
proposed
having
no
regular
supper
*punct* ;
merely
sandwiches
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
set
out
in
the
little
room
*punct* ;
but
that
was
scouted
as
a
wretched
suggestion
*punct* .
*break*
a
private
dance
*punct* ,
without
sitting
down
to
supper
*punct* ,
was
pronounced
an
infamous
fraud
upon
the
rights
of
men
and
women
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
weston
must
not
speak
of
it
again
*punct* .
*break*
she
then
took
another
line
of
expediency
*punct* ,
and
looking
into
the
doubtful
room
*punct* ,
observed
*punct* ,
i
do
not
think
it
is
so
very
small
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
not
be
many
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
and
mr.
weston
at
the
same
time
*punct* ,
walking
briskly
with
long
steps
through
the
passage
*punct* ,
was
calling
out
*punct* ,
you
talk
a
great
deal
of
the
length
of
this
passage
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
mere
nothing
after
all
*punct* ;
and
not
the
least
draught
from
the
stairs
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
one
could
know
which
arrangement
our
guests
in
general
would
like
best
*punct* .
*break*
to
do
what
would
be
most
generally
pleasing
must
be
our
object
*punct* ,
if
one
could
but
tell
what
that
would
be
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
very
true
*punct* ,
cried
frank
*punct* ,
very
true
*punct* .
*break*
you
want
your
neighbours
opinions
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
wonder
at
you
*punct* .
*break*
if
one
could
ascertain
what
the
chief
of
them
*punct* ,
the
coles
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
not
far
off
*punct* .
*break*
shall
i
call
upon
them
*punct* ?
*break*
or
miss
bates
*punct* ?
*break*
she
is
still
nearer.
*punct* ,
and
i
do
not
know
whether
miss
bates
is
not
as
likely
to
understand
the
inclinations
of
the
rest
of
the
people
as
any
body
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
we
do
want
a
larger
council
*punct* .
*break*
suppose
i
go
and
invite
miss
bates
to
join
us
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
weston
rather
hesitating
*punct* ,
if
you
think
she
will
be
of
any
use
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
get
nothing
to
the
purpose
from
miss
bates
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* .
*break*
she
will
be
all
delight
and
gratitude
*punct* ,
but
she
will
tell
you
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
she
will
not
even
listen
to
your
questions
*punct* .
*break*
i
see
no
advantage
in
consulting
miss
bates
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
is
so
amusing
*punct* ,
so
extremely
amusing
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
very
fond
of
hearing
miss
bates
talk
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
need
not
bring
the
whole
family
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
here
mr.
weston
joined
them
*punct* ,
and
on
hearing
what
was
proposed
*punct* ,
gave
it
his
decided
approbation
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
do
*punct* ,
frank.
*punct* ,
go
and
fetch
miss
bates
*punct* ,
and
let
us
end
the
matter
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
she
will
enjoy
the
scheme
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* ;
and
i
do
not
know
a
properer
person
for
shewing
us
how
to
do
away
difficulties
*punct* .
*break*
fetch
miss
bates
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
growing
a
little
too
nice
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
a
standing
lesson
of
how
to
be
happy
*punct* .
*break*
but
fetch
them
both
*punct* .
*break*
invite
them
both
*punct* .
*break*
can
the
old
lady?
*punct* ...
the
old
lady
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
the
young
lady
*punct* ,
to
be
sure
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
think
you
a
great
blockhead
*punct* ,
frank
*punct* ,
if
you
bring
the
aunt
without
the
niece
*punct* .
*break*
i
beg
your
pardon
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
not
immediately
recollect
*punct* .
*break*
undoubtedly
if
you
wish
it
*punct* ,
i
will
endeavour
to
persuade
them
both
*punct* .
*break*
and
away
he
ran
*punct* .
*break*
long
before
he
reappeared
*punct* ,
attending
the
short
*punct* ,
neat
*punct* ,
brisk-moving
aunt
*punct* ,
and
her
elegant
niece,
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
like
a
sweet-tempered
woman
and
a
good
wife
*punct* ,
had
examined
the
passage
again
*punct* ,
and
found
the
evils
of
it
much
less
than
she
had
supposed
before
*punct* ,
indeed
very
trifling
*punct* ;
and
here
ended
the
difficulties
of
decision
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
rest
*punct* ,
in
speculation
at
least
*punct* ,
was
perfectly
smooth
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
minor
arrangements
of
table
and
chair
*punct* ,
lights
and
music
*punct* ,
tea
and
supper
*punct* ,
made
themselves
*punct* ;
or
were
left
as
mere
trifles
to
be
settled
at
any
time
between
mrs.
weston
and
mrs.
stokes.
*punct* ,
every
body
invited
*punct* ,
was
certainly
to
come
*punct* ;
frank
had
already
written
to
enscombe
to
propose
staying
a
few
days
beyond
his
fortnight
*punct* ,
which
could
not
possibly
be
refused
*punct* .
*break*
and
a
delightful
dance
it
was
to
be
*punct* .
*break*
most
cordially
*punct* ,
when
miss
bates
arrived
*punct* ,
did
she
agree
that
it
must
*punct* .
*break*
as
a
counsellor
she
was
not
wanted
*punct* ;
but
as
an
approver
*punct* ,
a
much
safer
character,
*punct* ,
she
was
truly
welcome
*punct* .
*break*
her
approbation
*punct* ,
at
once
general
and
minute
*punct* ,
warm
and
incessant
*punct* ,
could
not
but
please
*punct* ;
and
for
another
half-hour
they
were
all
walking
to
and
fro
*punct* ,
between
the
different
rooms
*punct* ,
some
suggesting
*punct* ,
some
attending
*punct* ,
and
all
in
happy
enjoyment
of
the
future
*punct* .
*break*
the
party
did
not
break
up
without
emma's
being
positively
secured
for
the
two
first
dances
by
the
hero
of
the
evening
*punct* ,
nor
without
her
overhearing
mr.
weston
whisper
to
his
wife
*punct* ,
he
has
asked
her
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
he
would
*punct* !
*break*
one
thing
only
was
wanting
to
make
the
prospect
of
the
ball
completely
satisfactory
to
emma
*punct* ,
its
being
fixed
for
a
day
within
the
granted
term
of
frank
churchill's
stay
in
surry
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
mr.
weston's
confidence
*punct* ,
she
could
not
think
it
so
very
impossible
that
the
churchills
might
not
allow
their
nephew
to
remain
a
day
beyond
his
fortnight
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
was
not
judged
feasible
*punct* .
*break*
the
preparations
must
take
their
time
*punct* ,
nothing
could
be
properly
ready
till
the
third
week
were
entered
on
*punct* ,
and
for
a
few
days
they
must
be
planning
*punct* ,
proceeding
and
hoping
in
uncertainty
*punct* ,
at
the
risk
*punct* ,
in
her
opinion
*punct* ,
the
great
risk
*punct* ,
of
its
being
all
in
vain
*punct* .
*break*
enscombe
however
was
gracious
*punct* ,
gracious
in
fact
*punct* ,
if
not
in
word
*punct* .
*break*
his
wish
of
staying
longer
evidently
did
not
please
*punct* ;
but
it
was
not
opposed
*punct* .
*break*
all
was
safe
and
prosperous
*punct* ;
and
as
the
removal
of
one
solicitude
generally
makes
way
for
another
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
being
now
certain
of
her
ball
*punct* ,
began
to
adopt
as
the
next
vexation
mr.
knightley's
provoking
indifference
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
either
because
he
did
not
dance
himself
*punct* ,
or
because
the
plan
had
been
formed
without
his
being
consulted
*punct* ,
he
seemed
resolved
that
it
should
not
interest
him
*punct* ,
determined
against
its
exciting
any
present
curiosity
*punct* ,
or
affording
him
any
future
amusement
*punct* .
*break*
to
her
voluntary
communications
emma
could
get
no
more
approving
reply
*punct* ,
than
*punct* ,
very
well
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
westons
think
it
worth
while
to
be
at
all
this
trouble
for
a
few
hours
of
noisy
entertainment
*punct* ,
i
have
nothing
to
say
against
it
*punct* ,
but
that
they
shall
not
chuse
pleasures
for
me.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
must
be
there
*punct* ;
i
could
not
refuse
*punct* ;
and
i
will
keep
as
much
awake
as
i
can
*punct* ;
but
i
would
rather
be
at
home
*punct* ,
looking
over
william
larkins's
week's
account
*punct* ;
much
rather
*punct* ,
i
confess.
*punct* ,
pleasure
in
seeing
dancing!
*punct* ,
not
i
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
i
never
look
at
it
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
who
does.
*punct* ,
fine
dancing
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
like
virtue
*punct* ,
must
be
its
own
reward
*punct* .
*break*
those
who
are
standing
by
are
usually
thinking
of
something
very
different
*punct* .
*break*
this
emma
felt
was
aimed
at
her
*punct* ;
and
it
made
her
quite
angry
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
in
compliment
to
jane
fairfax
however
that
he
was
so
indifferent
*punct* ,
or
so
indignant
*punct* ;
he
was
not
guided
by
her
feelings
in
reprobating
the
ball
*punct* ,
for
she
enjoyed
the
thought
of
it
to
an
extraordinary
degree
*punct* .
*break*
it
made
her
animated
*punct* ,
open
hearted
*punct* ,
she
voluntarily
said;
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
i
hope
nothing
may
happen
to
prevent
the
ball
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
disappointment
it
would
be
*punct* !
*break*
i
do
look
forward
to
it
*punct* ,
i
own
*punct* ,
with
very
great
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
to
oblige
jane
fairfax
therefore
that
he
would
have
preferred
the
society
of
william
larkins
*punct* .
*break*
no!
*punct* ,
she
was
more
and
more
convinced
that
mrs.
weston
was
quite
mistaken
in
that
surmise
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
great
deal
of
friendly
and
of
compassionate
attachment
on
his
side
*punct* ,
but
no
love
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
soon
no
leisure
for
quarrelling
with
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
two
days
of
joyful
security
were
immediately
followed
by
the
over-throw
of
every
thing
*punct* .
*break*
a
letter
arrived
from
mr.
churchill
to
urge
his
nephew's
instant
return
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
churchill
was
unwell
*punct* ,
far
too
unwell
to
do
without
him
*punct* ;
she
had
been
in
a
very
suffering
state
*punct* ,
so
said
her
husband
*punct* ,
when
writing
to
her
nephew
two
days
before
*punct* ,
though
from
her
usual
unwillingness
to
give
pain
*punct* ,
and
constant
habit
of
never
thinking
of
herself
*punct* ,
she
had
not
mentioned
it
*punct* ;
but
now
she
was
too
ill
to
trifle
*punct* ,
and
must
entreat
him
to
set
off
for
enscombe
without
delay
*punct* .
*break*
the
substance
of
this
letter
was
forwarded
to
emma
*punct* ,
in
a
note
from
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
instantly
*punct* .
*break*
as
to
his
going
*punct* ,
it
was
inevitable
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
be
gone
within
a
few
hours
*punct* ,
though
without
feeling
any
real
alarm
for
his
aunt
*punct* ,
to
lessen
his
repugnance
*punct* .
*break*
he
knew
her
illnesses
*punct* ;
they
never
occurred
but
for
her
own
convenience
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
added
*punct* ,
that
he
could
only
allow
himself
time
to
hurry
to
highbury
*punct* ,
after
breakfast
*punct* ,
and
take
leave
of
the
few
friends
there
whom
he
could
suppose
to
feel
any
interest
in
him
*punct* ;
and
that
he
might
be
expected
at
hartfield
very
soon
*punct* .
*break*
this
wretched
note
was
the
finale
of
emma's
breakfast
*punct* .
*break*
when
once
it
had
been
read
*punct* ,
there
was
no
doing
any
thing
*punct* ,
but
lament
and
exclaim
*punct* .
*break*
the
loss
of
the
ball
*punct* ,
the
loss
of
the
young
man
*punct* ,
and
all
that
the
young
man
might
be
feeling!
*punct* ,
it
was
too
wretched!
*punct* ,
such
a
delightful
evening
as
it
would
have
been!
*punct* ,
every
body
so
happy
*punct* !
*break*
and
she
and
her
partner
the
happiest!
*punct* ,
i
said
it
would
be
so
*punct* ,
was
the
only
consolation
*punct* .
*break*
her
father's
feelings
were
quite
distinct
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
principally
of
mrs.
churchill's
illness
*punct* ,
and
wanted
to
know
how
she
was
treated
*punct* ;
and
as
for
the
ball
*punct* ,
it
was
shocking
to
have
dear
emma
disappointed
*punct* ;
but
they
would
all
be
safer
at
home
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
ready
for
her
visitor
some
time
before
he
appeared
*punct* ;
but
if
this
reflected
at
all
upon
his
impatience
*punct* ,
his
sorrowful
look
and
total
want
of
spirits
when
he
did
come
might
redeem
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
the
going
away
almost
too
much
to
speak
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
his
dejection
was
most
evident
*punct* .
*break*
he
sat
really
lost
in
thought
for
the
first
few
minutes
*punct* ;
and
when
rousing
himself
*punct* ,
it
was
only
to
say
*punct* ,
of
all
horrid
things
*punct* ,
leave-taking
is
the
worst
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
will
come
again
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* .
*break*
this
will
not
be
your
only
visit
to
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
ah!
*punct* ,
shaking
his
head
*punct* ,
the
uncertainty
of
when
i
may
be
able
to
return!
*punct* ,
i
shall
try
for
it
with
a
zeal!
*punct* ,
it
will
be
the
object
of
all
my
thoughts
and
cares!
*punct* ,
and
if
my
uncle
and
aunt
go
to
town
this
spring
*punct* ,
but
i
am
afraid
*punct* ,
they
did
not
stir
last
spring
*punct* ,
i
am
afraid
it
is
a
custom
gone
for
ever
*punct* .
*break*
our
poor
ball
must
be
quite
given
up
*punct* .
*break*
that
ball!
*punct* ,
why
did
we
wait
for
any
thing?
*punct* ,
why
not
seize
the
pleasure
at
once?
*punct* ,
how
often
is
happiness
destroyed
by
preparation
*punct* ,
foolish
preparation!
*punct* ,
you
told
us
it
would
be
so.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
why
are
you
always
so
right
*punct* ?
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
i
am
very
sorry
to
be
right
in
this
instance
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
much
rather
have
been
merry
than
wise
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
can
come
again
*punct* ,
we
are
still
to
have
our
ball
*punct* .
*break*
my
father
depends
on
it
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
forget
your
engagement
*punct* .
*break*
emma
looked
graciously
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
fortnight
as
it
has
been
*punct* !
*break*
he
continued
*punct* ;
every
day
more
precious
and
more
delightful
than
the
day
before!
*punct* ,
every
day
making
me
less
fit
to
bear
any
other
place
*punct* .
*break*
happy
those
*punct* ,
who
can
remain
at
highbury
*punct* !
*break*
as
you
do
us
such
ample
justice
now
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
laughing
*punct* ,
i
will
venture
to
ask
*punct* ,
whether
you
did
not
come
a
little
doubtfully
at
first
*punct* ?
*break*
do
not
we
rather
surpass
your
expectations
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
sure
we
do
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
you
did
not
much
expect
to
like
us
*punct* .
*break*
you
would
not
have
been
so
long
in
coming
*punct* ,
if
you
had
had
a
pleasant
idea
of
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
he
laughed
rather
consciously
*punct* ;
and
though
denying
the
sentiment
*punct* ,
emma
was
convinced
that
it
had
been
so
*punct* .
*break*
and
you
must
be
off
this
very
morning
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ;
my
father
is
to
join
me
here
*punct* :
we
shall
walk
back
together
*punct* ,
and
i
must
be
off
immediately
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
almost
afraid
that
every
moment
will
bring
him
*punct* .
*break*
not
five
minutes
to
spare
even
for
your
friends
miss
fairfax
and
miss
bates
*punct* ?
*break*
miss
bates's
powerful
*punct* ,
argumentative
mind
might
have
strengthened
yours
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
have
called
there
*punct* ;
passing
the
door
*punct* ,
i
thought
it
better
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
right
thing
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
i
went
in
for
three
minutes
*punct* ,
and
was
detained
by
miss
bates's
being
absent
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
out
*punct* ;
and
i
felt
it
impossible
not
to
wait
till
she
came
in
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
a
woman
that
one
may
*punct* ,
that
one
must
laugh
at
*punct* ;
but
that
one
would
not
wish
to
slight
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
better
to
pay
my
visit
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
he
hesitated
*punct* ,
got
up
*punct* ,
walked
to
a
window
*punct* .
*break*
in
short
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
i
think
you
can
hardly
be
quite
without
suspicion
*punct* ,
he
looked
at
her
*punct* ,
as
if
wanting
to
read
her
thoughts
*punct* .
*break*
she
hardly
knew
what
to
say
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
like
the
forerunner
of
something
absolutely
serious
*punct* ,
which
she
did
not
wish
*punct* .
*break*
forcing
herself
to
speak
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
in
the
hope
of
putting
it
by
*punct* ,
she
calmly
said
*punct* ,
you
are
quite
in
the
right
*punct* ;
it
was
most
natural
to
pay
your
visit
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
he
was
silent
*punct* .
*break*
she
believed
he
was
looking
at
her
*punct* ;
probably
reflecting
on
what
she
had
said
*punct* ,
and
trying
to
understand
the
manner
*punct* .
*break*
she
heard
him
sigh
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
natural
for
him
to
feel
that
he
had
cause
to
sigh
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
believe
her
to
be
encouraging
him
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
awkward
moments
passed
*punct* ,
and
he
sat
down
again
*punct* ;
and
in
a
more
determined
manner
said
*punct* ,
it
was
something
to
feel
that
all
the
rest
of
my
time
might
be
given
to
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
my
regard
for
hartfield
is
most
warm
*punct* ,
he
stopt
again
*punct* ,
rose
again
*punct* ,
and
seemed
quite
embarrassed.
*punct* ,
he
was
more
in
love
with
her
than
emma
had
supposed
*punct* ;
and
who
can
say
how
it
might
have
ended
*punct* ,
if
his
father
had
not
made
his
appearance
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
soon
followed
*punct* ;
and
the
necessity
of
exertion
made
him
composed
*punct* .
*break*
a
very
few
minutes
more
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
completed
the
present
trial
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
always
alert
when
business
was
to
be
done
*punct* ,
and
as
incapable
of
procrastinating
any
evil
that
was
inevitable
*punct* ,
as
of
foreseeing
any
that
was
doubtful
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
it
was
time
to
go
*punct* ;
and
the
young
man
*punct* ,
though
he
might
and
did
sigh
*punct* ,
could
not
but
agree
*punct* ,
to
take
leave
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
hear
about
you
all
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ;
that
is
my
chief
consolation
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
hear
of
every
thing
that
is
going
on
among
you
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
engaged
mrs.
weston
to
correspond
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
she
has
been
so
kind
as
to
promise
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
blessing
of
a
female
correspondent
*punct* ,
when
one
is
really
interested
in
the
absent!
*punct* ,
she
will
tell
me
every
thing
*punct* .
*break*
in
her
letters
i
shall
be
at
dear
highbury
again
*punct* .
*break*
a
very
friendly
shake
of
the
hand
*punct* ,
a
very
earnest
good-bye
*punct* ,
closed
the
speech
*punct* ,
and
the
door
had
soon
shut
out
frank
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
short
had
been
the
notice
*punct* ,
short
their
meeting
*punct* ;
he
was
gone
*punct* ;
and
emma
felt
so
sorry
to
part
*punct* ,
and
foresaw
so
great
a
loss
to
their
little
society
from
his
absence
as
to
begin
to
be
afraid
of
being
too
sorry
*punct* ,
and
feeling
it
too
much
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
sad
change
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
been
meeting
almost
every
day
since
his
arrival
*punct* .
*break*
certainly
his
being
at
randalls
had
given
great
spirit
to
the
last
two
weeks
*punct* ,
indescribable
spirit
*punct* ;
the
idea
*punct* ,
the
expectation
of
seeing
him
which
every
morning
had
brought
*punct* ,
the
assurance
of
his
attentions
*punct* ,
his
liveliness
*punct* ,
his
manners
*punct* !
*break*
it
had
been
a
very
happy
fortnight
*punct* ,
and
forlorn
must
be
the
sinking
from
it
into
the
common
course
of
hartfield
days
*punct* .
*break*
to
complete
every
other
recommendation
*punct* ,
he
had
almost
told
her
that
he
loved
her
*punct* .
*break*
what
strength
*punct* ,
or
what
constancy
of
affection
he
might
be
subject
to
*punct* ,
was
another
point
*punct* ;
but
at
present
she
could
not
doubt
his
having
a
decidedly
warm
admiration
*punct* ,
a
conscious
preference
of
herself
*punct* ;
and
this
persuasion
*punct* ,
joined
to
all
the
rest
*punct* ,
made
her
think
that
she
must
be
a
little
in
love
with
him
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
every
previous
determination
against
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
certainly
must
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* .
*break*
this
sensation
of
listlessness
*punct* ,
weariness
*punct* ,
stupidity
*punct* ,
this
disinclination
to
sit
down
and
employ
myself
*punct* ,
this
feeling
of
every
thing's
being
dull
and
insipid
about
the
house!
*punct* ,
i
must
be
in
love
*punct* ;
i
should
be
the
oddest
creature
in
the
world
if
i
were
not
*punct* ,
for
a
few
weeks
at
least
*punct* .
*break*
evil
to
some
is
always
good
to
others
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
have
many
fellow-mourners
for
the
ball
*punct* ,
if
not
for
frank
churchill
*punct* ;
but
mr.
knightley
will
be
happy
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
spend
the
evening
with
his
dear
william
larkins
now
if
he
likes
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
shewed
no
triumphant
happiness
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
say
that
he
was
sorry
on
his
own
account
*punct* ;
his
very
cheerful
look
would
have
contradicted
him
if
he
had
*punct* ;
but
he
said
*punct* ,
and
very
steadily
*punct* ,
that
he
was
sorry
for
the
disappointment
of
the
others
*punct* ,
and
with
considerable
kindness
added
*punct* ,
you
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
who
have
so
few
opportunities
of
dancing
*punct* ,
you
are
really
out
of
luck
*punct* ;
you
are
very
much
out
of
luck
*punct* !
*break*
it
was
some
days
before
she
saw
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
to
judge
of
her
honest
regret
in
this
woeful
change
*punct* ;
but
when
they
did
meet
*punct* ,
her
composure
was
odious
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
been
particularly
unwell
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
suffering
from
headache
to
a
degree
*punct* ,
which
made
her
aunt
declare
*punct* ,
that
had
the
ball
taken
place
*punct* ,
she
did
not
think
jane
could
have
attended
it
*punct* ;
and
it
was
charity
to
impute
some
of
her
unbecoming
indifference
to
the
languor
of
ill-health
*punct* .
*break*
emma
continued
to
entertain
no
doubt
of
her
being
in
love
*punct* .
*break*
her
ideas
only
varied
as
to
the
how
much
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
*punct* ,
she
thought
it
was
a
good
deal
*punct* ;
and
afterwards
*punct* ,
but
little
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
great
pleasure
in
hearing
frank
churchill
talked
of
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
for
his
sake
*punct* ,
greater
pleasure
than
ever
in
seeing
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
*punct* ;
she
was
very
often
thinking
of
him
*punct* ,
and
quite
impatient
for
a
letter
*punct* ,
that
she
might
know
how
he
was
*punct* ,
how
were
his
spirits
*punct* ,
how
was
his
aunt
*punct* ,
and
what
was
the
chance
of
his
coming
to
randalls
again
this
spring
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
she
could
not
admit
herself
to
be
unhappy
*punct* ,
nor
*punct* ,
after
the
first
morning
*punct* ,
to
be
less
disposed
for
employment
than
usual
*punct* ;
she
was
still
busy
and
cheerful
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
pleasing
as
he
was
*punct* ,
she
could
yet
imagine
him
to
have
faults
*punct* ;
and
farther
*punct* ,
though
thinking
of
him
so
much
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
she
sat
drawing
or
working
*punct* ,
forming
a
thousand
amusing
schemes
for
the
progress
and
close
of
their
attachment
*punct* ,
fancying
interesting
dialogues
*punct* ,
and
inventing
elegant
letters
*punct* ;
the
conclusion
of
every
imaginary
declaration
on
his
side
was
that
she
refused
him
*punct* .
*break*
their
affection
was
always
to
subside
into
friendship
*punct* .
*break*
every
thing
tender
and
charming
was
to
mark
their
parting
*punct* ;
but
still
they
were
to
part
*punct* .
*break*
when
she
became
sensible
of
this
*punct* ,
it
struck
her
that
she
could
not
be
very
much
in
love
*punct* ;
for
in
spite
of
her
previous
and
fixed
determination
never
to
quit
her
father
*punct* ,
never
to
marry
*punct* ,
a
strong
attachment
certainly
must
produce
more
of
a
struggle
than
she
could
foresee
in
her
own
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
find
myself
making
any
use
of
the
word
sacrifice
*punct* ,
said
she.
*punct* ,
in
not
one
of
all
my
clever
replies
*punct* ,
my
delicate
negatives
*punct* ,
is
there
any
allusion
to
making
a
sacrifice
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
suspect
that
he
is
not
really
necessary
to
my
happiness
*punct* .
*break*
so
much
the
better
*punct* .
*break*
i
certainly
will
not
persuade
myself
to
feel
more
than
i
do
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
quite
enough
in
love
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
be
sorry
to
be
more
*punct* .
*break*
upon
the
whole
*punct* ,
she
was
equally
contented
with
her
view
of
his
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
undoubtedly
very
much
in
love
*punct* ,
every
thing
denotes
it
*punct* ,
very
much
in
love
indeed!
*punct* ,
and
when
he
comes
again
*punct* ,
if
his
affection
continue
*punct* ,
i
must
be
on
my
guard
not
to
encourage
it.
*punct* ,
it
would
be
most
inexcusable
to
do
otherwise
*punct* ,
as
my
own
mind
is
quite
made
up
*punct* .
*break*
not
that
i
imagine
he
can
think
i
have
been
encouraging
him
hitherto
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
if
he
had
believed
me
at
all
to
share
his
feelings
*punct* ,
he
would
not
have
been
so
wretched
*punct* .
*break*
could
he
have
thought
himself
encouraged
*punct* ,
his
looks
and
language
at
parting
would
have
been
different.
*punct* ,
still
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
i
must
be
on
my
guard
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
in
the
supposition
of
his
attachment
continuing
what
it
now
is
*punct* ;
but
i
do
not
know
that
i
expect
it
will
*punct* ;
i
do
not
look
upon
him
to
be
quite
the
sort
of
man
*punct* ,
i
do
not
altogether
build
upon
his
steadiness
or
constancy.
*punct* ,
his
feelings
are
warm
*punct* ,
but
i
can
imagine
them
rather
changeable.
*punct* ,
every
consideration
of
the
subject
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
makes
me
thankful
that
my
happiness
is
not
more
deeply
involved.
*punct* ,
i
shall
do
very
well
again
after
a
little
while
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
it
will
be
a
good
thing
over
*punct* ;
for
they
say
every
body
is
in
love
once
in
their
lives
*punct* ,
and
i
shall
have
been
let
off
easily
*punct* .
*break*
when
his
letter
to
mrs.
weston
arrived
*punct* ,
emma
had
the
perusal
of
it
*punct* ;
and
she
read
it
with
a
degree
of
pleasure
and
admiration
which
made
her
at
first
shake
her
head
over
her
own
sensations
*punct* ,
and
think
she
had
undervalued
their
strength
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
long
*punct* ,
well-written
letter
*punct* ,
giving
the
particulars
of
his
journey
and
of
his
feelings
*punct* ,
expressing
all
the
affection
*punct* ,
gratitude
*punct* ,
and
respect
which
was
natural
and
honourable
*punct* ,
and
describing
every
thing
exterior
and
local
that
could
be
supposed
attractive
*punct* ,
with
spirit
and
precision
*punct* .
*break*
no
suspicious
flourishes
now
of
apology
or
concern
*punct* ;
it
was
the
language
of
real
feeling
towards
mrs.
weston
*punct* ;
and
the
transition
from
highbury
to
enscombe
*punct* ,
the
contrast
between
the
places
in
some
of
the
first
blessings
of
social
life
was
just
enough
touched
on
to
shew
how
keenly
it
was
felt
*punct* ,
and
how
much
more
might
have
been
said
but
for
the
restraints
of
propriety.
*punct* ,
the
charm
of
her
own
name
was
not
wanting
*punct* .
*break*
miss
woodhouse
appeared
more
than
once
*punct* ,
and
never
without
a
something
of
pleasing
connexion
*punct* ,
either
a
compliment
to
her
taste
*punct* ,
or
a
remembrance
of
what
she
had
said
*punct* ;
and
in
the
very
last
time
of
its
meeting
her
eye
*punct* ,
unadorned
as
it
was
by
any
such
broad
wreath
of
gallantry
*punct* ,
she
yet
could
discern
the
effect
of
her
influence
and
acknowledge
the
greatest
compliment
perhaps
of
all
conveyed
*punct* .
*break*
compressed
into
the
very
lowest
vacant
corner
were
these
words
*punct* ,
i
had
not
a
spare
moment
on
tuesday
*punct* ,
as
you
know
*punct* ,
for
miss
woodhouse's
beautiful
little
friend
*punct* .
*break*
pray
make
my
excuses
and
adieus
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
this
*punct* ,
emma
could
not
doubt
*punct* ,
was
all
for
herself
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
was
remembered
only
from
being
her
friend
*punct* .
*break*
his
information
and
prospects
as
to
enscombe
were
neither
worse
nor
better
than
had
been
anticipated
*punct* ;
mrs.
churchill
was
recovering
*punct* ,
and
he
dared
not
yet
*punct* ,
even
in
his
own
imagination
*punct* ,
fix
a
time
for
coming
to
randalls
again
*punct* .
*break*
gratifying
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
and
stimulative
as
was
the
letter
in
the
material
part
*punct* ,
its
sentiments
*punct* ,
she
yet
found
*punct* ,
when
it
was
folded
up
and
returned
to
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
that
it
had
not
added
any
lasting
warmth
*punct* ,
that
she
could
still
do
without
the
writer
*punct* ,
and
that
he
must
learn
to
do
without
her
*punct* .
*break*
her
intentions
were
unchanged
*punct* .
*break*
her
resolution
of
refusal
only
grew
more
interesting
by
the
addition
of
a
scheme
for
his
subsequent
consolation
and
happiness
*punct* .
*break*
his
recollection
of
harriet
*punct* ,
and
the
words
which
clothed
it
*punct* ,
the
beautiful
little
friend
*punct* ,
suggested
to
her
the
idea
of
harriet's
succeeding
her
in
his
affections
*punct* .
*break*
was
it
impossible?
*punct* ,
no.
*punct* ,
harriet
undoubtedly
was
greatly
his
inferior
in
understanding
*punct* ;
but
he
had
been
very
much
struck
with
the
loveliness
of
her
face
and
the
warm
simplicity
of
her
manner
*punct* ;
and
all
the
probabilities
of
circumstance
and
connexion
were
in
her
favour.
*punct* ,
for
harriet
*punct* ,
it
would
be
advantageous
and
delightful
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
not
dwell
upon
it
*punct* ,
said
she.
*punct* ,
i
must
not
think
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
the
danger
of
indulging
such
speculations
*punct* .
*break*
but
stranger
things
have
happened
*punct* ;
and
when
we
cease
to
care
for
each
other
as
we
do
now
*punct* ,
it
will
be
the
means
of
confirming
us
in
that
sort
of
true
disinterested
friendship
which
i
can
already
look
forward
to
with
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
well
to
have
a
comfort
in
store
on
harriet's
behalf
*punct* ,
though
it
might
be
wise
to
let
the
fancy
touch
it
seldom
*punct* ;
for
evil
in
that
quarter
was
at
hand
*punct* .
*break*
as
frank
churchill's
arrival
had
succeeded
mr.
elton's
engagement
in
the
conversation
of
highbury
*punct* ,
as
the
latest
interest
had
entirely
borne
down
the
first
*punct* ,
so
now
upon
frank
churchill's
disappearance
*punct* ,
mr.
elton's
concerns
were
assuming
the
most
irresistible
form.
*punct* ,
his
wedding-day
was
named
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
soon
be
among
them
again
*punct* ;
mr.
elton
and
his
bride
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
hardly
time
to
talk
over
the
first
letter
from
enscombe
before
mr.
elton
and
his
bride
was
in
every
body's
mouth
*punct* ,
and
frank
churchill
was
forgotten
*punct* .
*break*
emma
grew
sick
at
the
sound
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
had
three
weeks
of
happy
exemption
from
mr.
elton
*punct* ;
and
harriet's
mind
*punct* ,
she
had
been
willing
to
hope
*punct* ,
had
been
lately
gaining
strength
*punct* .
*break*
with
mr.
weston's
ball
in
view
at
least
*punct* ,
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
insensibility
to
other
things
*punct* ;
but
it
was
now
too
evident
that
she
had
not
attained
such
a
state
of
composure
as
could
stand
against
the
actual
approach
*punct* ,
new
carriage
*punct* ,
bell-ringing
*punct* ,
and
all
*punct* .
*break*
poor
harriet
was
in
a
flutter
of
spirits
which
required
all
the
reasonings
and
soothings
and
attentions
of
every
kind
that
emma
could
give
*punct* .
*break*
emma
felt
that
she
could
not
do
too
much
for
her
*punct* ,
that
harriet
had
a
right
to
all
her
ingenuity
and
all
her
patience
*punct* ;
but
it
was
heavy
work
to
be
for
ever
convincing
without
producing
any
effect
*punct* ,
for
ever
agreed
to
*punct* ,
without
being
able
to
make
their
opinions
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
listened
submissively
*punct* ,
and
said
it
was
very
true
*punct* ,
it
was
just
as
miss
woodhouse
described
*punct* ,
it
was
not
worth
while
to
think
about
them
*punct* ,
and
she
would
not
think
about
them
any
longer
but
no
change
of
subject
could
avail
*punct* ,
and
the
next
half-hour
saw
her
as
anxious
and
restless
about
the
eltons
as
before
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
emma
attacked
her
on
another
ground
*punct* .
*break*
your
allowing
yourself
to
be
so
occupied
and
so
unhappy
about
mr.
elton's
marrying
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
is
the
strongest
reproach
you
can
make
me
*punct* .
*break*
you
could
not
give
me
a
greater
reproof
for
the
mistake
i
fell
into
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
all
my
doing
*punct* ,
i
know
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
not
forgotten
it
*punct* ,
i
assure
you.
*punct* ,
deceived
myself
*punct* ,
i
did
very
miserably
deceive
you
*punct* ,
and
it
will
be
a
painful
reflection
to
me
for
ever
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
imagine
me
in
danger
of
forgetting
it
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
felt
this
too
much
to
utter
more
than
a
few
words
of
eager
exclamation
*punct* .
*break*
emma
continued
*punct* ,
i
have
not
said
*punct* ,
exert
yourself
harriet
for
my
sake
*punct* ;
think
less
*punct* ,
talk
less
of
mr.
elton
for
my
sake
*punct* ;
because
for
your
own
sake
rather
*punct* ,
i
would
wish
it
to
be
done
*punct* ,
for
the
sake
of
what
is
more
important
than
my
comfort
*punct* ,
a
habit
of
self-command
in
you
*punct* ,
a
consideration
of
what
is
your
duty
*punct* ,
an
attention
to
propriety
*punct* ,
an
endeavour
to
avoid
the
suspicions
of
others
*punct* ,
to
save
your
health
and
credit
*punct* ,
and
restore
your
tranquillity
*punct* .
*break*
these
are
the
motives
which
i
have
been
pressing
on
you
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
very
important
*punct* ,
and
sorry
i
am
that
you
cannot
feel
them
sufficiently
to
act
upon
them
*punct* .
*break*
my
being
saved
from
pain
is
a
very
secondary
consideration
*punct* .
*break*
i
want
you
to
save
yourself
from
greater
pain
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
i
may
sometimes
have
felt
that
harriet
would
not
forget
what
was
due
*punct* ,
or
rather
what
would
be
kind
by
me
*punct* .
*break*
this
appeal
to
her
affections
did
more
than
all
the
rest
*punct* .
*break*
the
idea
of
wanting
gratitude
and
consideration
for
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
whom
she
really
loved
extremely
*punct* ,
made
her
wretched
for
a
while
*punct* ,
and
when
the
violence
of
grief
was
comforted
away
*punct* ,
still
remained
powerful
enough
to
prompt
to
what
was
right
and
support
her
in
it
very
tolerably
*punct* .
*break*
you
*punct* ,
who
have
been
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
in
my
life
*punct* ,
want
gratitude
to
you!
*punct* ,
nobody
is
equal
to
you!
*punct* ,
i
care
for
nobody
as
i
do
for
you!
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
how
ungrateful
i
have
been
*punct* !
*break*
such
expressions
*punct* ,
assisted
as
they
were
by
every
thing
that
look
and
manner
could
do
*punct* ,
made
emma
feel
that
she
had
never
loved
harriet
so
well
*punct* ,
nor
valued
her
affection
so
highly
before
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
charm
equal
to
tenderness
of
heart
*punct* ,
said
she
afterwards
to
herself
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
nothing
to
be
compared
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
warmth
and
tenderness
of
heart
*punct* ,
with
an
affectionate
*punct* ,
open
manner
*punct* ,
will
beat
all
the
clearness
of
head
in
the
world
*punct* ,
for
attraction
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
it
will
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
tenderness
of
heart
which
makes
my
dear
father
so
generally
beloved
*punct* ,
which
gives
isabella
all
her
popularity.
*punct* ,
i
have
it
not
*punct* ,
but
i
know
how
to
prize
and
respect
it.
*punct* ,
harriet
is
my
superior
in
all
the
charm
and
all
the
felicity
it
gives
*punct* .
*break*
dear
harriet!
*punct* ,
i
would
not
change
you
for
the
clearest-headed
*punct* ,
longest-sighted
*punct* ,
best-judging
female
breathing
*punct* .
*break*
the
coldness
of
a
jane
fairfax!
*punct* ,
harriet
is
worth
a
hundred
such
*punct* ,
and
for
a
wife
*punct* ,
a
sensible
man's
wife
*punct* ,
it
is
invaluable
*punct* .
*break*
i
mention
no
names
*punct* ;
but
happy
the
man
who
changes
emma
for
harriet
*punct* !
*break*
mrs.
elton
was
first
seen
at
church
*punct* :
but
though
devotion
might
be
interrupted
*punct* ,
curiosity
could
not
be
satisfied
by
a
bride
in
a
pew
*punct* ,
and
it
must
be
left
for
the
visits
in
form
which
were
then
to
be
paid
*punct* ,
to
settle
whether
she
were
very
pretty
indeed
*punct* ,
or
only
rather
pretty
*punct* ,
or
not
pretty
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
emma
had
feelings
*punct* ,
less
of
curiosity
than
of
pride
or
propriety
*punct* ,
to
make
her
resolve
on
not
being
the
last
to
pay
her
respects
*punct* ;
and
she
made
a
point
of
harriet's
going
with
her
*punct* ,
that
the
worst
of
the
business
might
be
gone
through
as
soon
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
not
enter
the
house
again
*punct* ,
could
not
be
in
the
same
room
to
which
she
had
with
such
vain
artifice
retreated
three
months
ago
*punct* ,
to
lace
up
her
boot
*punct* ,
without
recollecting
*punct* .
*break*
a
thousand
vexatious
thoughts
would
recur
*punct* .
*break*
compliments
*punct* ,
charades
*punct* ,
and
horrible
blunders
*punct* ;
and
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
poor
harriet
should
not
be
recollecting
too
*punct* ;
but
she
behaved
very
well
*punct* ,
and
was
only
rather
pale
and
silent
*punct* .
*break*
the
visit
was
of
course
short
*punct* ;
and
there
was
so
much
embarrassment
and
occupation
of
mind
to
shorten
it
*punct* ,
that
emma
would
not
allow
herself
entirely
to
form
an
opinion
of
the
lady
*punct* ,
and
on
no
account
to
give
one
*punct* ,
beyond
the
nothing-meaning
terms
of
being
elegantly
dressed
*punct* ,
and
very
pleasing
*punct* .
*break*
she
did
not
really
like
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
find
fault
*punct* ,
but
she
suspected
that
there
was
no
elegance;
*punct* ,
ease
*punct* ,
but
not
elegance.
*punct* ,
she
was
almost
sure
that
for
a
young
woman
*punct* ,
a
stranger
*punct* ,
a
bride
*punct* ,
there
was
too
much
ease
*punct* .
*break*
her
person
was
rather
good
*punct* ;
her
face
not
unpretty
*punct* ;
but
neither
feature
*punct* ,
nor
air
*punct* ,
nor
voice
*punct* ,
nor
manner
*punct* ,
were
elegant
*punct* .
*break*
emma
thought
at
least
it
would
turn
out
so
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
his
manners
did
not
appear
*punct* ,
but
no
*punct* ,
she
would
not
permit
a
hasty
or
a
witty
word
from
herself
about
his
manners
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
an
awkward
ceremony
at
any
time
to
be
receiving
wedding
visits
*punct* ,
and
a
man
had
need
be
all
grace
to
acquit
himself
well
through
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
woman
was
better
off
*punct* ;
she
might
have
the
assistance
of
fine
clothes
*punct* ,
and
the
privilege
of
bashfulness
*punct* ,
but
the
man
had
only
his
own
good
sense
to
depend
on
*punct* ;
and
when
she
considered
how
peculiarly
unlucky
poor
mr.
elton
was
in
being
in
the
same
room
at
once
with
the
woman
he
had
just
married
*punct* ,
the
woman
he
had
wanted
to
marry
*punct* ,
and
the
woman
whom
he
had
been
expected
to
marry
*punct* ,
she
must
allow
him
to
have
the
right
to
look
as
little
wise
*punct* ,
and
to
be
as
much
affectedly
*punct* ,
and
as
little
really
easy
as
could
be
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
said
harriet
*punct* ,
when
they
had
quitted
the
house
*punct* ,
and
after
waiting
in
vain
for
her
friend
to
begin
*punct* ;
well
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
with
a
gentle
sigh,
*punct* ,
what
do
you
think
of
her?
*punct* ,
is
not
she
very
charming
*punct* ?
*break*
there
was
a
little
hesitation
in
emma's
answer
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
very
*punct* ,
a
very
pleasing
young
woman
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
her
beautiful
*punct* ,
quite
beautiful
*punct* .
*break*
very
nicely
dressed
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ;
a
remarkably
elegant
gown
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
at
all
surprized
that
he
should
have
fallen
in
love
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
there
is
nothing
to
surprize
one
at
all.
*punct* ,
a
pretty
fortune
*punct* ;
and
she
came
in
his
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
*punct* ,
returned
harriet
*punct* ,
sighing
again
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
she
was
very
much
attached
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
she
might
*punct* ;
but
it
is
not
every
man's
fate
to
marry
the
woman
who
loves
him
best
*punct* .
*break*
miss
hawkins
perhaps
wanted
a
home
*punct* ,
and
thought
this
the
best
offer
she
was
likely
to
have
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
harriet
earnestly
*punct* ,
and
well
she
might
*punct* ,
nobody
could
ever
have
a
better
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
i
wish
them
happy
with
all
my
heart
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
i
do
not
think
i
shall
mind
seeing
them
again
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
just
as
superior
as
ever;
*punct* ,
but
being
married
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
it
is
quite
a
different
thing
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
you
need
not
be
afraid
*punct* ;
i
can
sit
and
admire
him
now
without
any
great
misery
*punct* .
*break*
to
know
that
he
has
not
thrown
himself
away
*punct* ,
is
such
a
comfort!
*punct* ,
she
does
seem
a
charming
young
woman
*punct* ,
just
what
he
deserves
*punct* .
*break*
he
called
her
augusta
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
visit
was
returned
*punct* ,
emma
made
up
her
mind
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
then
see
more
and
judge
better
*punct* .
*break*
from
harriet's
happening
not
to
be
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
and
her
father's
being
present
to
engage
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
she
had
a
quarter
of
an
hour
of
the
lady's
conversation
to
herself
*punct* ,
and
could
composedly
attend
to
her
*punct* ;
and
the
quarter
of
an
hour
quite
convinced
her
that
mrs.
elton
was
a
vain
woman
*punct* ,
extremely
well
satisfied
with
herself
*punct* ,
and
thinking
much
of
her
own
importance
*punct* ;
that
she
meant
to
shine
and
be
very
superior
*punct* ,
but
with
manners
which
had
been
formed
in
a
bad
school
*punct* ,
pert
and
familiar
*punct* ;
that
all
her
notions
were
drawn
from
one
set
of
people
*punct* ,
and
one
style
of
living
*punct* ;
that
if
not
foolish
she
was
ignorant
*punct* ,
and
that
her
society
would
certainly
do
mr.
elton
no
good
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
would
have
been
a
better
match
*punct* .
*break*
if
not
wise
or
refined
herself
*punct* ,
she
would
have
connected
him
with
those
who
were
*punct* ;
but
miss
hawkins
*punct* ,
it
might
be
fairly
supposed
from
her
easy
conceit
*punct* ,
had
been
the
best
of
her
own
set
*punct* .
*break*
the
rich
brother-in-law
near
bristol
was
the
pride
of
the
alliance
*punct* ,
and
his
place
and
his
carriages
were
the
pride
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
very
first
subject
after
being
seated
was
maple
grove
*punct* ,
my
brother
mr.
suckling's
seat;
*punct* ,
a
comparison
of
hartfield
to
maple
grove
*punct* .
*break*
the
grounds
of
hartfield
were
small
*punct* ,
but
neat
and
pretty
*punct* ;
and
the
house
was
modern
and
well-built
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
seemed
most
favourably
impressed
by
the
size
of
the
room
*punct* ,
the
entrance
*punct* ,
and
all
that
she
could
see
or
imagine
*punct* .
*break*
very
like
maple
grove
indeed!
*punct* ,
she
was
quite
struck
by
the
likeness!
*punct* ,
that
room
was
the
very
shape
and
size
of
the
morning-room
at
maple
grove
*punct* ;
her
sister's
favourite
room.
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
was
appealed
to.
*punct* ,
was
not
it
astonishingly
like?
*punct* ,
she
could
really
almost
fancy
herself
at
maple
grove
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
staircase
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
as
i
came
in
*punct* ,
i
observed
how
very
like
the
staircase
was
*punct* ;
placed
exactly
in
the
same
part
of
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
i
really
could
not
help
exclaiming
*punct* !
*break*
i
assure
you
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
it
is
very
delightful
to
me
*punct* ,
to
be
reminded
of
a
place
i
am
so
extremely
partial
to
as
maple
grove
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
spent
so
many
happy
months
there
*punct* !
*break*
a
charming
place
*punct* ,
undoubtedly
*punct* .
*break*
every
body
who
sees
it
is
struck
by
its
beauty
*punct* ;
but
to
me
*punct* ,
it
has
been
quite
a
home
*punct* .
*break*
whenever
you
are
transplanted
*punct* ,
like
me
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
you
will
understand
how
very
delightful
it
is
to
meet
with
any
thing
at
all
like
what
one
has
left
behind
*punct* .
*break*
i
always
say
this
is
quite
one
of
the
evils
of
matrimony
*punct* .
*break*
emma
made
as
slight
a
reply
as
she
could
*punct* ;
but
it
was
fully
sufficient
for
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
who
only
wanted
to
be
talking
herself
*punct* .
*break*
so
extremely
like
maple
grove
*punct* !
*break*
and
it
is
not
merely
the
house
*punct* ,
the
grounds
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* ,
as
far
as
i
could
observe
*punct* ,
are
strikingly
like
*punct* .
*break*
the
laurels
at
maple
grove
are
in
the
same
profusion
as
here
*punct* ,
and
stand
very
much
in
the
same
way
*punct* ,
just
across
the
lawn
*punct* ;
and
i
had
a
glimpse
of
a
fine
large
tree
*punct* ,
with
a
bench
round
it
*punct* ,
which
put
me
so
exactly
in
mind
*punct* !
*break*
my
brother
and
sister
will
be
enchanted
with
this
place
*punct* .
*break*
people
who
have
extensive
grounds
themselves
are
always
pleased
with
any
thing
in
the
same
style
*punct* .
*break*
emma
doubted
the
truth
of
this
sentiment
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
a
great
idea
that
people
who
had
extensive
grounds
themselves
cared
very
little
for
the
extensive
grounds
of
any
body
else
*punct* ;
but
it
was
not
worth
while
to
attack
an
error
so
double-dyed
*punct* ,
and
therefore
only
said
in
reply
*punct* ,
when
you
have
seen
more
of
this
country
*punct* ,
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
you
have
overrated
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
surry
is
full
of
beauties
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
am
quite
aware
of
that
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
the
garden
of
england
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
surry
is
the
garden
of
england
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ;
but
we
must
not
rest
our
claims
on
that
distinction
*punct* .
*break*
many
counties
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
are
called
the
garden
of
england
*punct* ,
as
well
as
surry
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
fancy
not
*punct* ,
replied
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
with
a
most
satisfied
smile
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
heard
any
county
but
surry
called
so
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
silenced
*punct* .
*break*
my
brother
and
sister
have
promised
us
a
visit
in
the
spring
*punct* ,
or
summer
at
farthest
*punct* ,
continued
mrs.
elton
*punct* ;
and
that
will
be
our
time
for
exploring
*punct* .
*break*
while
they
are
with
us
*punct* ,
we
shall
explore
a
great
deal
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* .
*break*
they
will
have
their
barouche-landau
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
which
holds
four
perfectly
*punct* ;
and
therefore
*punct* ,
without
saying
any
thing
of
our
carriage
*punct* ,
we
should
be
able
to
explore
the
different
beauties
extremely
well
*punct* .
*break*
they
would
hardly
come
in
their
chaise
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
at
that
season
of
the
year
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
when
the
time
draws
on
*punct* ,
i
shall
decidedly
recommend
their
bringing
the
barouche-landau
*punct* ;
it
will
be
so
very
much
preferable
*punct* .
*break*
when
people
come
into
a
beautiful
country
of
this
sort
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
one
naturally
wishes
them
to
see
as
much
as
possible
*punct* ;
and
mr.
suckling
is
extremely
fond
of
exploring
*punct* .
*break*
we
explored
to
king's-weston
twice
last
summer
*punct* ,
in
that
way
*punct* ,
most
delightfully
*punct* ,
just
after
their
first
having
the
barouche-landau
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
many
parties
of
that
kind
here
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
every
summer
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ;
not
immediately
here
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
rather
out
of
distance
of
the
very
striking
beauties
which
attract
the
sort
of
parties
you
speak
of
*punct* ;
and
we
are
a
very
quiet
set
of
people
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ;
more
disposed
to
stay
at
home
than
engage
in
schemes
of
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
nothing
like
staying
at
home
for
real
comfort
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
can
be
more
devoted
to
home
than
i
am
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
quite
a
proverb
for
it
at
maple
grove
*punct* .
*break*
many
a
time
has
selina
said
*punct* ,
when
she
has
been
going
to
bristol
*punct* ,
i
really
cannot
get
this
girl
to
move
from
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
i
absolutely
must
go
in
by
myself
*punct* ,
though
i
hate
being
stuck
up
in
the
barouche-landau
without
a
companion
*punct* ;
but
augusta
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
with
her
own
good-will
*punct* ,
would
never
stir
beyond
the
park
paling
*punct* .
*break*
many
a
time
has
she
said
so
*punct* ;
and
yet
i
am
no
advocate
for
entire
seclusion
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
*punct* ,
on
the
contrary
*punct* ,
when
people
shut
themselves
up
entirely
from
society
*punct* ,
it
is
a
very
bad
thing
*punct* ;
and
that
it
is
much
more
advisable
to
mix
in
the
world
in
a
proper
degree
*punct* ,
without
living
in
it
either
too
much
or
too
little
*punct* .
*break*
i
perfectly
understand
your
situation
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
looking
towards
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
your
father's
state
of
health
must
be
a
great
drawback
*punct* .
*break*
why
does
not
he
try
bath?
*punct* ,
indeed
he
should
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
recommend
bath
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
i
assure
you
i
have
no
doubt
of
its
doing
mr.
woodhouse
good
*punct* .
*break*
my
father
tried
it
more
than
once
*punct* ,
formerly
*punct* ;
but
without
receiving
any
benefit
*punct* ;
and
mr.
perry
*punct* ,
whose
name
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* ,
is
not
unknown
to
you
*punct* ,
does
not
conceive
it
would
be
at
all
more
likely
to
be
useful
now
*punct* .
*break*
that's
a
great
pity
*punct* ;
for
i
assure
you
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
where
the
waters
do
agree
*punct* ,
it
is
quite
wonderful
the
relief
they
give
*punct* .
*break*
in
my
bath
life
*punct* ,
i
have
seen
such
instances
of
it
*punct* !
*break*
and
it
is
so
cheerful
a
place
*punct* ,
that
it
could
not
fail
of
being
of
use
to
mr.
woodhouse's
spirits
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
i
understand
*punct* ,
are
sometimes
much
depressed
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
to
its
recommendations
to
you
*punct* ,
i
fancy
i
need
not
take
much
pains
to
dwell
on
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
advantages
of
bath
to
the
young
are
pretty
generally
understood
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
a
charming
introduction
for
you
*punct* ,
who
have
lived
so
secluded
a
life
*punct* ;
and
i
could
immediately
secure
you
some
of
the
best
society
in
the
place
*punct* .
*break*
a
line
from
me
would
bring
you
a
little
host
of
acquaintance
*punct* ;
and
my
particular
friend
*punct* ,
mrs.
partridge
*punct* ,
the
lady
i
have
always
resided
with
when
in
bath
*punct* ,
would
be
most
happy
to
shew
you
any
attentions
*punct* ,
and
would
be
the
very
person
for
you
to
go
into
public
with
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
as
much
as
emma
could
bear
*punct* ,
without
being
impolite
*punct* .
*break*
the
idea
of
her
being
indebted
to
mrs.
elton
for
what
was
called
an
introduction
*punct* ,
of
her
going
into
public
under
the
auspices
of
a
friend
of
mrs.
elton's
*punct* ,
probably
some
vulgar
*punct* ,
dashing
widow
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
with
the
help
of
a
boarder
*punct* ,
just
made
a
shift
to
live!
*punct* ,
the
dignity
of
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
of
hartfield
*punct* ,
was
sunk
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
she
restrained
herself
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
from
any
of
the
reproofs
she
could
have
given
*punct* ,
and
only
thanked
mrs.
elton
coolly
*punct* ;
but
their
going
to
bath
was
quite
out
of
the
question
*punct* ;
and
she
was
not
perfectly
convinced
that
the
place
might
suit
her
better
than
her
father
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
*punct* ,
to
prevent
farther
outrage
and
indignation
*punct* ,
changed
the
subject
directly
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
ask
whether
you
are
musical
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
upon
these
occasions
*punct* ,
a
lady's
character
generally
precedes
her
*punct* ;
and
highbury
has
long
known
that
you
are
a
superior
performer
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ;
i
must
protest
against
any
such
idea
*punct* .
*break*
a
superior
performer!
*punct* ,
very
far
from
it
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* .
*break*
consider
from
how
partial
a
quarter
your
information
came
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
doatingly
fond
of
music
*punct* ,
passionately
fond;
*punct* ,
and
my
friends
say
i
am
not
entirely
devoid
of
taste
*punct* ;
but
as
to
any
thing
else
*punct* ,
upon
my
honour
my
performance
is
mediocre
to
the
last
degree
*punct* .
*break*
you
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
i
well
know
*punct* ,
play
delightfully
*punct* .
*break*
i
assure
you
it
has
been
the
greatest
satisfaction
*punct* ,
comfort
*punct* ,
and
delight
to
me
*punct* ,
to
hear
what
a
musical
society
i
am
got
into
*punct* .
*break*
i
absolutely
cannot
do
without
music
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
necessary
of
life
to
me
*punct* ;
and
having
always
been
used
to
a
very
musical
society
*punct* ,
both
at
maple
grove
and
in
bath
*punct* ,
it
would
have
been
a
most
serious
sacrifice
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
was
speaking
of
my
future
home
*punct* ,
and
expressing
his
fears
lest
the
retirement
of
it
should
be
disagreeable
*punct* ;
and
the
inferiority
of
the
house
too
*punct* ,
knowing
what
i
had
been
accustomed
to
*punct* ,
of
course
he
was
not
wholly
without
apprehension
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
was
speaking
of
it
in
that
way
*punct* ,
i
honestly
said
that
the
world
i
could
give
up
*punct* ,
parties
*punct* ,
balls
*punct* ,
plays
*punct* ,
for
i
had
no
fear
of
retirement
*punct* .
*break*
blessed
with
so
many
resources
within
myself
*punct* ,
the
world
was
not
necessary
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
do
very
well
without
it
*punct* .
*break*
to
those
who
had
no
resources
it
was
a
different
thing
*punct* ;
but
my
resources
made
me
quite
independent
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
to
smaller-sized
rooms
than
i
had
been
used
to
*punct* ,
i
really
could
not
give
it
a
thought
*punct* .
*break*
i
hoped
i
was
perfectly
equal
to
any
sacrifice
of
that
description
*punct* .
*break*
certainly
i
had
been
accustomed
to
every
luxury
at
maple
grove
*punct* ;
but
i
did
assure
him
that
two
carriages
were
not
necessary
to
my
happiness
*punct* ,
nor
were
spacious
apartments
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
to
be
quite
honest
*punct* ,
i
do
not
think
i
can
live
without
something
of
a
musical
society
*punct* .
*break*
i
condition
for
nothing
else
*punct* ;
but
without
music
*punct* ,
life
would
be
a
blank
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
we
cannot
suppose
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
smiling
*punct* ,
that
mr.
elton
would
hesitate
to
assure
you
of
there
being
a
very
musical
society
in
highbury
*punct* ;
and
i
hope
you
will
not
find
he
has
outstepped
the
truth
more
than
may
be
pardoned
*punct* ,
in
consideration
of
the
motive
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
i
have
no
doubts
at
all
on
that
head
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
delighted
to
find
myself
in
such
a
circle
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
we
shall
have
many
sweet
little
concerts
together
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
you
and
i
must
establish
a
musical
club
*punct* ,
and
have
regular
weekly
meetings
at
your
house
*punct* ,
or
ours
*punct* .
*break*
will
not
it
be
a
good
plan
*punct* ?
*break*
if
we
exert
ourselves
*punct* ,
i
think
we
shall
not
be
long
in
want
of
allies
*punct* .
*break*
something
of
that
nature
would
be
particularly
desirable
for
me
*punct* ,
as
an
inducement
to
keep
me
in
practice
*punct* ;
for
married
women
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
there
is
a
sad
story
against
them
*punct* ,
in
general
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
but
too
apt
to
give
up
music
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
*punct* ,
who
are
so
extremely
fond
of
it
*punct* ,
there
can
be
no
danger
*punct* ,
surely
*punct* ?
*break*
i
should
hope
not
*punct* ;
but
really
when
i
look
around
among
my
acquaintance
*punct* ,
i
tremble
*punct* .
*break*
selina
has
entirely
given
up
music
*punct* ,
never
touches
the
instrument
*punct* ,
though
she
played
sweetly
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
same
may
be
said
of
mrs.
jeffereys
*punct* ,
clara
partridge
*punct* ,
that
was
*punct* ,
and
of
the
two
milmans
*punct* ,
now
mrs.
bird
and
mrs.
james
cooper
*punct* ;
and
of
more
than
i
can
enumerate
*punct* .
*break*
upon
my
word
it
is
enough
to
put
one
in
a
fright
*punct* .
*break*
i
used
to
be
quite
angry
with
selina
*punct* ;
but
really
i
begin
now
to
comprehend
that
a
married
woman
has
many
things
to
call
her
attention
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
i
was
half
an
hour
this
morning
shut
up
with
my
housekeeper
*punct* .
*break*
but
every
thing
of
that
kind
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
will
soon
be
in
so
regular
a
train
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
laughing
*punct* ,
we
shall
see
*punct* .
*break*
emma
*punct* ,
finding
her
so
determined
upon
neglecting
her
music
*punct* ,
had
nothing
more
to
say
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
after
a
moment's
pause
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
chose
another
subject
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
been
calling
at
randalls
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
and
found
them
both
at
home
*punct* ;
and
very
pleasant
people
they
seem
to
be
*punct* .
*break*
i
like
them
extremely
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
seems
an
excellent
creature
*punct* ,
quite
a
first-rate
favourite
with
me
already
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* .
*break*
and
she
appears
so
truly
good
*punct* ,
there
is
something
so
motherly
and
kind-hearted
about
her
*punct* ,
that
it
wins
upon
one
directly
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
your
governess
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ?
*break*
emma
was
almost
too
much
astonished
to
answer
*punct* ;
but
mrs.
elton
hardly
waited
for
the
affirmative
before
she
went
on
*punct* .
*break*
having
understood
as
much
*punct* ,
i
was
rather
astonished
to
find
her
so
very
lady-like
*punct* !
*break*
but
she
is
really
quite
the
gentlewoman
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston's
manners
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
were
always
particularly
good
*punct* .
*break*
their
propriety
*punct* ,
simplicity
*punct* ,
and
elegance
*punct* ,
would
make
them
the
safest
model
for
any
young
woman
*punct* .
*break*
and
who
do
you
think
came
in
while
we
were
there
*punct* ?
*break*
emma
was
quite
at
a
loss
*punct* .
*break*
the
tone
implied
some
old
acquaintance
*punct* ,
and
how
could
she
possibly
guess
*punct* ?
*break*
continued
mrs.
elton
*punct* ;
knightley
himself!
*punct* ,
was
not
it
lucky?
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
not
being
within
when
he
called
the
other
day
*punct* ,
i
had
never
seen
him
before
*punct* ;
and
of
course
*punct* ,
as
so
particular
a
friend
of
mr.
e.'s
*punct* ,
i
had
a
great
curiosity
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend
knightley
had
been
so
often
mentioned
*punct* ,
that
i
was
really
impatient
to
see
him
*punct* ;
and
i
must
do
my
caro
sposo
the
justice
to
say
that
he
need
not
be
ashamed
of
his
friend
*punct* .
*break*
knightley
is
quite
the
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
i
like
him
very
much
*punct* .
*break*
decidedly
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
a
very
gentleman-like
man
*punct* .
*break*
happily
*punct* ,
it
was
now
time
to
be
gone
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
off
*punct* ;
and
emma
could
breathe
*punct* .
*break*
was
her
immediate
exclamation
*punct* .
*break*
worse
than
i
had
supposed
*punct* .
*break*
knightley!
*punct* ,
i
could
not
have
believed
it
*punct* .
*break*
knightley!
*punct* ,
never
seen
him
in
her
life
before
*punct* ,
and
call
him
knightley!
*punct* ,
and
discover
that
he
is
a
gentleman
*punct* !
*break*
a
little
upstart
*punct* ,
vulgar
being
*punct* ,
with
her
mr.
e.
*punct* ,
and
her
caro
sposo
*punct* ,
and
her
resources
*punct* ,
and
all
her
airs
of
pert
pretension
and
underbred
finery
*punct* .
*break*
actually
to
discover
that
mr.
knightley
is
a
gentleman
*punct* !
*break*
i
doubt
whether
he
will
return
the
compliment
*punct* ,
and
discover
her
to
be
a
lady
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
have
believed
it
*punct* !
*break*
and
to
propose
that
she
and
i
should
unite
to
form
a
musical
club
*punct* !
*break*
one
would
fancy
we
were
bosom
friends
*punct* !
*break*
and
mrs.
weston!
*punct* ,
astonished
that
the
person
who
had
brought
me
up
should
be
a
gentlewoman
*punct* !
*break*
worse
and
worse
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
met
with
her
equal
*punct* .
*break*
much
beyond
my
hopes
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
is
disgraced
by
any
comparison
*punct* .
*break*
what
would
frank
churchill
say
to
her
*punct* ,
if
he
were
here
*punct* ?
*break*
how
angry
and
how
diverted
he
would
be
*punct* !
*break*
there
i
am
*punct* ,
thinking
of
him
directly
*punct* .
*break*
always
the
first
person
to
be
thought
of
*punct* !
*break*
how
i
catch
myself
out
*punct* !
*break*
frank
churchill
comes
as
regularly
into
my
mind!
*punct* ,
all
this
ran
so
glibly
through
her
thoughts
*punct* ,
that
by
the
time
her
father
had
arranged
himself
*punct* ,
after
the
bustle
of
the
eltons
departure
*punct* ,
and
was
ready
to
speak
*punct* ,
she
was
very
tolerably
capable
of
attending
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
he
deliberately
began
*punct* ,
considering
we
never
saw
her
before
*punct* ,
she
seems
a
very
pretty
sort
of
young
lady
*punct* ;
and
i
dare
say
she
was
very
much
pleased
with
you
*punct* .
*break*
she
speaks
a
little
too
quick
*punct* .
*break*
a
little
quickness
of
voice
there
is
which
rather
hurts
the
ear
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
believe
i
am
nice
*punct* ;
i
do
not
like
strange
voices
*punct* ;
and
nobody
speaks
like
you
and
poor
miss
taylor
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
she
seems
a
very
obliging
*punct* ,
pretty-behaved
young
lady
*punct* ,
and
no
doubt
will
make
him
a
very
good
wife
*punct* .
*break*
though
i
think
he
had
better
not
have
married
*punct* .
*break*
i
made
the
best
excuses
i
could
for
not
having
been
able
to
wait
on
him
and
mrs.
elton
on
this
happy
occasion
*punct* ;
i
said
that
i
hoped
i
should
in
the
course
of
the
summer
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
ought
to
have
gone
before
*punct* .
*break*
not
to
wait
upon
a
bride
is
very
remiss
*punct* .
*break*
it
shews
what
a
sad
invalid
i
am
*punct* !
*break*
but
i
do
not
like
the
corner
into
vicarage
lane
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
your
apologies
were
accepted
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
knows
you
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* :
but
a
young
lady
*punct* ,
a
bride
*punct* ,
i
ought
to
have
paid
my
respects
to
her
if
possible
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
being
very
deficient
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
my
dear
papa
*punct* ,
you
are
no
friend
to
matrimony
*punct* ;
and
therefore
why
should
you
be
so
anxious
to
pay
your
respects
to
a
bride
*punct* ?
*break*
it
ought
to
be
no
recommendation
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
encouraging
people
to
marry
if
you
make
so
much
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
i
never
encouraged
any
body
to
marry
*punct* ,
but
i
would
always
wish
to
pay
every
proper
attention
to
a
lady
*punct* ,
and
a
bride
*punct* ,
especially
*punct* ,
is
never
to
be
neglected
*punct* .
*break*
more
is
avowedly
due
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
a
bride
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
is
always
the
first
in
company
*punct* ,
let
the
others
be
who
they
may
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
papa
*punct* ,
if
this
is
not
encouragement
to
marry
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
what
is
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
should
never
have
expected
you
to
be
lending
your
sanction
to
such
vanity-baits
for
poor
young
ladies
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
you
do
not
understand
me
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
a
matter
of
mere
common
politeness
and
good-breeding
*punct* ,
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
encouragement
to
people
to
marry
*punct* .
*break*
emma
had
done
*punct* .
*break*
her
father
was
growing
nervous
*punct* ,
and
could
not
understand
her
*punct* .
*break*
her
mind
returned
to
mrs.
elton's
offences
*punct* ,
and
long
*punct* ,
very
long
*punct* ,
did
they
occupy
her
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
not
required
*punct* ,
by
any
subsequent
discovery
*punct* ,
to
retract
her
ill
opinion
of
mrs.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
her
observation
had
been
pretty
correct
*punct* .
*break*
such
as
mrs.
elton
appeared
to
her
on
this
second
interview
*punct* ,
such
she
appeared
whenever
they
met
again,
*punct* ,
self-important
*punct* ,
presuming
*punct* ,
familiar
*punct* ,
ignorant
*punct* ,
and
ill-bred
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
a
little
beauty
and
a
little
accomplishment
*punct* ,
but
so
little
judgment
that
she
thought
herself
coming
with
superior
knowledge
of
the
world
*punct* ,
to
enliven
and
improve
a
country
neighbourhood
*punct* ;
and
conceived
miss
hawkins
to
have
held
such
a
place
in
society
as
mrs.
elton's
consequence
only
could
surpass
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
mr.
elton
thought
at
all
differently
from
his
wife
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
not
merely
happy
with
her
*punct* ,
but
proud
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
the
air
of
congratulating
himself
on
having
brought
such
a
woman
to
highbury
*punct* ,
as
not
even
miss
woodhouse
could
equal
*punct* ;
and
the
greater
part
of
her
new
acquaintance
*punct* ,
disposed
to
commend
*punct* ,
or
not
in
the
habit
of
judging
*punct* ,
following
the
lead
of
miss
bates's
good-will
*punct* ,
or
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
bride
must
be
as
clever
and
as
agreeable
as
she
professed
herself
*punct* ,
were
very
well
satisfied
*punct* ;
so
that
mrs.
elton's
praise
passed
from
one
mouth
to
another
as
it
ought
to
do
*punct* ,
unimpeded
by
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
who
readily
continued
her
first
contribution
and
talked
with
a
good
grace
of
her
being
very
pleasant
and
very
elegantly
dressed
*punct* .
*break*
in
one
respect
mrs.
elton
grew
even
worse
than
she
had
appeared
at
first
*punct* .
*break*
her
feelings
altered
towards
emma.
*punct* ,
offended
*punct* ,
probably
*punct* ,
by
the
little
encouragement
which
her
proposals
of
intimacy
met
with
*punct* ,
she
drew
back
in
her
turn
and
gradually
became
much
more
cold
and
distant
*punct* ;
and
though
the
effect
was
agreeable
*punct* ,
the
ill-will
which
produced
it
was
necessarily
increasing
emma's
dislike
*punct* .
*break*
her
manners
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
and
mr.
elton's
*punct* ,
were
unpleasant
towards
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
sneering
and
negligent
*punct* .
*break*
emma
hoped
it
must
rapidly
work
harriet's
cure
*punct* ;
but
the
sensations
which
could
prompt
such
behaviour
sunk
them
both
very
much.
*punct* ,
it
was
not
to
be
doubted
that
poor
harriet's
attachment
had
been
an
offering
to
conjugal
unreserve
*punct* ,
and
her
own
share
in
the
story
*punct* ,
under
a
colouring
the
least
favourable
to
her
and
the
most
soothing
to
him
*punct* ,
had
in
all
likelihood
been
given
also
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
the
object
of
their
joint
dislike.
*punct* ,
when
they
had
nothing
else
to
say
*punct* ,
it
must
be
always
easy
to
begin
abusing
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ;
and
the
enmity
which
they
dared
not
shew
in
open
disrespect
to
her
*punct* ,
found
a
broader
vent
in
contemptuous
treatment
of
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
took
a
great
fancy
to
jane
fairfax
*punct* ;
and
from
the
first
*punct* .
*break*
not
merely
when
a
state
of
warfare
with
one
young
lady
might
be
supposed
to
recommend
the
other
*punct* ,
but
from
the
very
first
*punct* ;
and
she
was
not
satisfied
with
expressing
a
natural
and
reasonable
admiration
*punct* ,
but
without
solicitation
*punct* ,
or
plea
*punct* ,
or
privilege
*punct* ,
she
must
be
wanting
to
assist
and
befriend
her.
*punct* ,
before
emma
had
forfeited
her
confidence
*punct* ,
and
about
the
third
time
of
their
meeting
*punct* ,
she
heard
all
mrs.
elton's
knight-errantry
on
the
subject.
*punct* ,
jane
fairfax
is
absolutely
charming
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse.
*punct* ,
i
quite
rave
about
jane
fairfax.
*punct* ,
a
sweet
*punct* ,
interesting
creature
*punct* .
*break*
so
mild
and
ladylike
*punct* ,
and
with
such
talents!
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
i
think
she
has
very
extraordinary
talents
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
scruple
to
say
that
she
plays
extremely
well
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
enough
of
music
to
speak
decidedly
on
that
point
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
absolutely
charming
*punct* !
*break*
you
will
laugh
at
my
warmth
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
i
talk
of
nothing
but
jane
fairfax.
*punct* ,
and
her
situation
is
so
calculated
to
affect
one!
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
we
must
exert
ourselves
and
endeavour
to
do
something
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
bring
her
forward
*punct* .
*break*
such
talent
as
hers
must
not
be
suffered
to
remain
unknown.
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
you
have
heard
those
charming
lines
of
the
poet
*punct* ,
full
many
a
flower
is
born
to
blush
unseen
*punct* ,
and
waste
its
fragrance
on
the
desert
air
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
not
allow
them
to
be
verified
in
sweet
jane
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
think
there
is
any
danger
of
it
*punct* ,
was
emma's
calm
answer
*punct* ,
and
when
you
are
better
acquainted
with
miss
fairfax's
situation
and
understand
what
her
home
has
been
*punct* ,
with
colonel
and
mrs.
campbell
*punct* ,
i
have
no
idea
that
you
will
suppose
her
talents
can
be
unknown
*punct* .
*break*
but
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
she
is
now
in
such
retirement
*punct* ,
such
obscurity
*punct* ,
so
thrown
away.
*punct* ,
whatever
advantages
she
may
have
enjoyed
with
the
campbells
are
so
palpably
at
an
end
*punct* !
*break*
and
i
think
she
feels
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
she
does
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
very
timid
and
silent
*punct* .
*break*
one
can
see
that
she
feels
the
want
of
encouragement
*punct* .
*break*
i
like
her
the
better
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
confess
it
is
a
recommendation
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
a
great
advocate
for
timidity
*punct* ,
and
i
am
sure
one
does
not
often
meet
with
it.
*punct* ,
but
in
those
who
are
at
all
inferior
*punct* ,
it
is
extremely
prepossessing
*punct* .
*break*
i
assure
you
*punct* ,
jane
fairfax
is
a
very
delightful
character
*punct* ,
and
interests
me
more
than
i
can
express
*punct* .
*break*
you
appear
to
feel
a
great
deal
*punct* ,
but
i
am
not
aware
how
you
or
any
of
miss
fairfax's
acquaintance
here
*punct* ,
any
of
those
who
have
known
her
longer
than
yourself
*punct* ,
can
shew
her
any
other
attention
than
*punct* ,
my
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
a
vast
deal
may
be
done
by
those
who
dare
to
act
*punct* .
*break*
you
and
i
need
not
be
afraid
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
set
the
example
*punct* ,
many
will
follow
it
as
far
as
they
can
*punct* ;
though
all
have
not
our
situations
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
carriages
to
fetch
and
convey
her
home
*punct* ,
and
we
live
in
a
style
which
could
not
make
the
addition
of
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
at
any
time
*punct* ,
the
least
inconvenient.
*punct* ,
i
should
be
extremely
displeased
if
wright
were
to
send
us
up
such
a
dinner
*punct* ,
as
could
make
me
regret
having
asked
more
than
jane
fairfax
to
partake
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
idea
of
that
sort
of
thing
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
likely
that
i
should
*punct* ,
considering
what
i
have
been
used
to
*punct* .
*break*
my
greatest
danger
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
in
housekeeping
*punct* ,
may
be
quite
the
other
way
*punct* ,
in
doing
too
much
*punct* ,
and
being
too
careless
of
expense
*punct* .
*break*
maple
grove
will
probably
be
my
model
more
than
it
ought
to
be
*punct* ,
for
we
do
not
at
all
affect
to
equal
my
brother
*punct* ,
mr.
suckling
*punct* ,
in
income.
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
my
resolution
is
taken
as
to
noticing
jane
fairfax.
*punct* ,
i
shall
certainly
have
her
very
often
at
my
house
*punct* ,
shall
introduce
her
wherever
i
can
*punct* ,
shall
have
musical
parties
to
draw
out
her
talents
*punct* ,
and
shall
be
constantly
on
the
watch
for
an
eligible
situation
*punct* .
*break*
my
acquaintance
is
so
very
extensive
*punct* ,
that
i
have
little
doubt
of
hearing
of
something
to
suit
her
shortly.
*punct* ,
i
shall
introduce
her
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
very
particularly
to
my
brother
and
sister
when
they
come
to
us
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
they
will
like
her
extremely
*punct* ;
and
when
she
gets
a
little
acquainted
with
them
*punct* ,
her
fears
will
completely
wear
off
*punct* ,
for
there
really
is
nothing
in
the
manners
of
either
but
what
is
highly
conciliating.
*punct* ,
i
shall
have
her
very
often
indeed
while
they
are
with
me
*punct* ,
and
i
dare
say
we
shall
sometimes
find
a
seat
for
her
in
the
barouche-landau
in
some
of
our
exploring
parties
*punct* .
*break*
poor
jane
fairfax!
*punct* ,
thought
emma.
*punct* ,
you
have
not
deserved
this
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
have
done
wrong
with
regard
to
mr.
dixon
*punct* ,
but
this
is
a
punishment
beyond
what
you
can
have
merited!
*punct* ,
the
kindness
and
protection
of
mrs.
elton!
*punct* ,
jane
fairfax
and
jane
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
not
suppose
that
she
dares
go
about
*punct* ,
emma
woodhouse-ing
me!
*punct* ,
but
upon
my
honour
*punct* ,
there
seems
no
limits
to
the
licentiousness
of
that
woman's
tongue
*punct* !
*break*
emma
had
not
to
listen
to
such
paradings
again
*punct* ,
to
any
so
exclusively
addressed
to
herself
*punct* ,
so
disgustingly
decorated
with
a
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* .
*break*
the
change
on
mrs.
elton's
side
soon
afterwards
appeared
*punct* ,
and
she
was
left
in
peace
*punct* ,
neither
forced
to
be
the
very
particular
friend
of
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
nor
*punct* ,
under
mrs.
elton's
guidance
*punct* ,
the
very
active
patroness
of
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
and
only
sharing
with
others
in
a
general
way
*punct* ,
in
knowing
what
was
felt
*punct* ,
what
was
meditated
*punct* ,
what
was
done
*punct* .
*break*
she
looked
on
with
some
amusement.
*punct* ,
miss
bates's
gratitude
for
mrs.
elton's
attentions
to
jane
was
in
the
first
style
of
guileless
simplicity
and
warmth
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
quite
one
of
her
worthies
*punct* ,
the
most
amiable
*punct* ,
affable
*punct* ,
delightful
woman
*punct* ,
just
as
accomplished
and
condescending
as
mrs.
elton
meant
to
be
considered
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
only
surprize
was
that
jane
fairfax
should
accept
those
attentions
and
tolerate
mrs.
elton
as
she
seemed
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
she
heard
of
her
walking
with
the
eltons
*punct* ,
sitting
with
the
eltons
*punct* ,
spending
a
day
with
the
eltons
*punct* !
*break*
this
was
astonishing!
*punct* ,
she
could
not
have
believed
it
possible
that
the
taste
or
the
pride
of
miss
fairfax
could
endure
such
society
and
friendship
as
the
vicarage
had
to
offer
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
a
riddle
*punct* ,
quite
a
riddle
*punct* !
*break*
said
she.
*punct* ,
to
chuse
to
remain
here
month
after
month
*punct* ,
under
privations
of
every
sort
*punct* !
*break*
and
now
to
chuse
the
mortification
of
mrs.
elton's
notice
and
the
penury
of
her
conversation
*punct* ,
rather
than
return
to
the
superior
companions
who
have
always
loved
her
with
such
real
*punct* ,
generous
affection
*punct* .
*break*
jane
had
come
to
highbury
professedly
for
three
months
*punct* ;
the
campbells
were
gone
to
ireland
for
three
months
*punct* ;
but
now
the
campbells
had
promised
their
daughter
to
stay
at
least
till
midsummer
*punct* ,
and
fresh
invitations
had
arrived
for
her
to
join
them
there
*punct* .
*break*
according
to
miss
bates
*punct* ,
it
all
came
from
her
*punct* ,
mrs.
dixon
had
written
most
pressingly
*punct* .
*break*
would
jane
but
go
*punct* ,
means
were
to
be
found
*punct* ,
servants
sent
*punct* ,
friends
contrived
*punct* ,
no
travelling
difficulty
allowed
to
exist
*punct* ;
but
still
she
had
declined
it
*punct* !
*break*
she
must
have
some
motive
*punct* ,
more
powerful
than
appears
*punct* ,
for
refusing
this
invitation
*punct* ,
was
emma's
conclusion
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
be
under
some
sort
of
penance
*punct* ,
inflicted
either
by
the
campbells
or
herself
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
great
fear
*punct* ,
great
caution
*punct* ,
great
resolution
somewhere.
*punct* ,
she
is
not
to
be
with
the
dixons
*punct* .
*break*
the
decree
is
issued
by
somebody
*punct* .
*break*
but
why
must
she
consent
to
be
with
the
eltons?
*punct* ,
here
is
quite
a
separate
puzzle
*punct* .
*break*
upon
her
speaking
her
wonder
aloud
on
that
part
of
the
subject
*punct* ,
before
the
few
who
knew
her
opinion
of
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
ventured
this
apology
for
jane
*punct* .
*break*
we
cannot
suppose
that
she
has
any
great
enjoyment
at
the
vicarage
*punct* ,
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
but
it
is
better
than
being
always
at
home
*punct* .
*break*
her
aunt
is
a
good
creature
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
as
a
constant
companion
*punct* ,
must
be
very
tiresome
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
consider
what
miss
fairfax
quits
*punct* ,
before
we
condemn
her
taste
for
what
she
goes
to
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
right
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
warmly
*punct* ,
miss
fairfax
is
as
capable
as
any
of
us
of
forming
a
just
opinion
of
mrs.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
could
she
have
chosen
with
whom
to
associate
*punct* ,
she
would
not
have
chosen
her
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
with
a
reproachful
smile
at
emma
*punct* ,
she
receives
attentions
from
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
which
nobody
else
pays
her
*punct* .
*break*
emma
felt
that
mrs.
weston
was
giving
her
a
momentary
glance
*punct* ;
and
she
was
herself
struck
by
his
warmth
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
faint
blush
*punct* ,
she
presently
replied
*punct* ,
such
attentions
as
mrs.
elton's
*punct* ,
i
should
have
imagined
*punct* ,
would
rather
disgust
than
gratify
miss
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton's
invitations
i
should
have
imagined
any
thing
but
inviting
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
not
wonder
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
if
miss
fairfax
were
to
have
been
drawn
on
beyond
her
own
inclination
*punct* ,
by
her
aunt's
eagerness
in
accepting
mrs.
elton's
civilities
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
poor
miss
bates
may
very
likely
have
committed
her
niece
and
hurried
her
into
a
greater
appearance
of
intimacy
than
her
own
good
sense
would
have
dictated
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
the
very
natural
wish
of
a
little
change
*punct* .
*break*
both
felt
rather
anxious
to
hear
him
speak
again
*punct* ;
and
after
a
few
minutes
silence
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
another
thing
must
be
taken
into
consideration
too
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
does
not
talk
to
miss
fairfax
as
she
speaks
of
her
*punct* .
*break*
we
all
know
the
difference
between
the
pronouns
he
or
she
and
thou
*punct* ,
the
plainest
spoken
amongst
us
*punct* ;
we
all
feel
the
influence
of
a
something
beyond
common
civility
in
our
personal
intercourse
with
each
other
*punct* ,
a
something
more
early
implanted
*punct* .
*break*
we
cannot
give
any
body
the
disagreeable
hints
that
we
may
have
been
very
full
of
the
hour
before
*punct* .
*break*
we
feel
things
differently
*punct* .
*break*
and
besides
the
operation
of
this
*punct* ,
as
a
general
principle
*punct* ,
you
may
be
sure
that
miss
fairfax
awes
mrs.
elton
by
her
superiority
both
of
mind
and
manner
*punct* ;
and
that
*punct* ,
face
to
face
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
treats
her
with
all
the
respect
which
she
has
a
claim
to
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
woman
as
jane
fairfax
probably
never
fell
in
mrs.
elton's
way
before
*punct* ,
and
no
degree
of
vanity
can
prevent
her
acknowledging
her
own
comparative
littleness
in
action
*punct* ,
if
not
in
consciousness
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
how
highly
you
think
of
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* .
*break*
little
henry
was
in
her
thoughts
*punct* ,
and
a
mixture
of
alarm
and
delicacy
made
her
irresolute
what
else
to
say
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
any
body
may
know
how
highly
i
think
of
her
*punct* .
*break*
and
yet
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
beginning
hastily
and
with
an
arch
look
*punct* ,
but
soon
stopping
*punct* ,
it
was
better
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
to
know
the
worst
at
once
*punct* ,
she
hurried
on
*punct* ,
and
yet
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
you
may
hardly
be
aware
yourself
how
highly
it
is
*punct* .
*break*
the
extent
of
your
admiration
may
take
you
by
surprize
some
day
or
other
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
was
hard
at
work
upon
the
lower
buttons
of
his
thick
leather
gaiters
*punct* ,
and
either
the
exertion
of
getting
them
together
*punct* ,
or
some
other
cause
*punct* ,
brought
the
colour
into
his
face
*punct* ,
as
he
answered
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
are
you
there?
*punct* ,
but
you
are
miserably
behindhand
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
cole
gave
me
a
hint
of
it
six
weeks
ago
*punct* .
*break*
he
stopped.
*punct* ,
emma
felt
her
foot
pressed
by
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
and
did
not
herself
know
what
to
think
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
moment
he
went
on
*punct* ,
that
will
never
be
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
i
can
assure
you
*punct* .
*break*
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* ,
would
not
have
me
if
i
were
to
ask
her
*punct* ,
and
i
am
very
sure
i
shall
never
ask
her
*punct* .
*break*
emma
returned
her
friend's
pressure
with
interest
*punct* ;
and
was
pleased
enough
to
exclaim
*punct* ,
you
are
not
vain
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
say
that
for
you
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
hardly
to
hear
her
*punct* ;
he
was
thoughtful
*punct* ,
and
in
a
manner
which
shewed
him
not
pleased
*punct* ,
soon
afterwards
said
*punct* ,
so
you
have
been
settling
that
i
should
marry
jane
fairfax
*punct* ?
*break*
no
indeed
i
have
not
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
scolded
me
too
much
for
match-making
*punct* ,
for
me
to
presume
to
take
such
a
liberty
with
you
*punct* .
*break*
what
i
said
just
now
*punct* ,
meant
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
one
says
those
sort
of
things
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
without
any
idea
of
a
serious
meaning
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
upon
my
word
i
have
not
the
smallest
wish
for
your
marrying
jane
fairfax
or
jane
any
body
*punct* .
*break*
you
would
not
come
in
and
sit
with
us
in
this
comfortable
way
*punct* ,
if
you
were
married
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
was
thoughtful
again
*punct* .
*break*
the
result
of
his
reverie
was
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
i
do
not
think
the
extent
of
my
admiration
for
her
will
ever
take
me
by
surprize.
*punct* ,
i
never
had
a
thought
of
her
in
that
way
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* .
*break*
and
soon
afterwards
*punct* ,
jane
fairfax
is
a
very
charming
young
woman
*punct* ,
but
not
even
jane
fairfax
is
perfect
*punct* .
*break*
she
has
a
fault
*punct* .
*break*
she
has
not
the
open
temper
which
a
man
would
wish
for
in
a
wife
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
but
rejoice
to
hear
that
she
had
a
fault
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
and
you
soon
silenced
mr.
cole
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
very
soon
*punct* .
*break*
he
gave
me
a
quiet
hint
*punct* ;
i
told
him
he
was
mistaken
*punct* ;
he
asked
my
pardon
and
said
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
cole
does
not
want
to
be
wiser
or
wittier
than
his
neighbours
*punct* .
*break*
in
that
respect
how
unlike
dear
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
who
wants
to
be
wiser
and
wittier
than
all
the
world
*punct* !
*break*
i
wonder
how
she
speaks
of
the
coles
*punct* ,
what
she
calls
them
*punct* !
*break*
how
can
she
find
any
appellation
for
them
*punct* ,
deep
enough
in
familiar
vulgarity
*punct* ?
*break*
she
calls
you
*punct* ,
knightley
*punct* ,
what
can
she
do
for
mr.
cole
*punct* ?
*break*
and
so
i
am
not
to
be
surprized
that
jane
fairfax
accepts
her
civilities
and
consents
to
be
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
your
argument
weighs
most
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
much
more
readily
enter
into
the
temptation
of
getting
away
from
miss
bates
*punct* ,
than
i
can
believe
in
the
triumph
of
miss
fairfax's
mind
over
mrs.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
faith
in
mrs.
elton's
acknowledging
herself
the
inferior
in
thought
*punct* ,
word
*punct* ,
or
deed
*punct* ;
or
in
her
being
under
any
restraint
beyond
her
own
scanty
rule
of
good-breeding
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
imagine
that
she
will
not
be
continually
insulting
her
visitor
with
praise
*punct* ,
encouragement
*punct* ,
and
offers
of
service
*punct* ;
that
she
will
not
be
continually
detailing
her
magnificent
intentions
*punct* ,
from
the
procuring
her
a
permanent
situation
to
the
including
her
in
those
delightful
exploring
parties
which
are
to
take
place
in
the
barouche-landau
*punct* .
*break*
jane
fairfax
has
feeling
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
i
do
not
accuse
her
of
want
of
feeling
*punct* .
*break*
her
sensibilities
*punct* ,
i
suspect
*punct* ,
are
strong
*punct* ,
and
her
temper
excellent
in
its
power
of
forbearance
*punct* ,
patience
*punct* ,
self-controul
*punct* ;
but
it
wants
openness
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
reserved
*punct* ,
more
reserved
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
than
she
used
to
be
*punct* ,
and
i
love
an
open
temper
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
till
cole
alluded
to
my
supposed
attachment
*punct* ,
it
had
never
entered
my
head
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
jane
fairfax
and
conversed
with
her
*punct* ,
with
admiration
and
pleasure
always
*punct* ,
but
with
no
thought
beyond
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
said
emma
triumphantly
when
he
left
them
*punct* ,
what
do
you
say
now
to
mr.
knightley's
marrying
jane
fairfax
*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
really
*punct* ,
dear
emma
*punct* ,
i
say
that
he
is
so
very
much
occupied
by
the
idea
of
not
being
in
love
with
her
*punct* ,
that
i
should
not
wonder
if
it
were
to
end
in
his
being
so
at
last
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
beat
me
*punct* .
*break*
every
body
in
and
about
highbury
who
had
ever
visited
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
was
disposed
to
pay
him
attention
on
his
marriage
*punct* .
*break*
dinner-parties
and
evening-parties
were
made
for
him
and
his
lady
*punct* ;
and
invitations
flowed
in
so
fast
that
she
had
soon
the
pleasure
of
apprehending
they
were
never
to
have
a
disengaged
day
*punct* .
*break*
i
see
how
it
is
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* .
*break*
i
see
what
a
life
i
am
to
lead
among
you
*punct* .
*break*
upon
my
word
we
shall
be
absolutely
dissipated
*punct* .
*break*
we
really
seem
quite
the
fashion
*punct* .
*break*
if
this
is
living
in
the
country
*punct* ,
it
is
nothing
very
formidable
*punct* .
*break*
from
monday
next
to
saturday
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
we
have
not
a
disengaged
day!
*punct* ,
a
woman
with
fewer
resources
than
i
have
*punct* ,
need
not
have
been
at
a
loss
*punct* .
*break*
no
invitation
came
amiss
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
her
bath
habits
made
evening-parties
perfectly
natural
to
her
*punct* ,
and
maple
grove
had
given
her
a
taste
for
dinners
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
a
little
shocked
at
the
want
of
two
drawing
rooms
*punct* ,
at
the
poor
attempt
at
rout-cakes
*punct* ,
and
there
being
no
ice
in
the
highbury
card-parties
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
bates
*punct* ,
mrs.
perry
*punct* ,
mrs.
goddard
and
others
*punct* ,
were
a
good
deal
behind-hand
in
knowledge
of
the
world
*punct* ,
but
she
would
soon
shew
them
how
every
thing
ought
to
be
arranged
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
course
of
the
spring
she
must
return
their
civilities
by
one
very
superior
party
*punct* ,
in
which
her
card-tables
should
be
set
out
with
their
separate
candles
and
unbroken
packs
in
the
true
style
*punct* ,
and
more
waiters
engaged
for
the
evening
than
their
own
establishment
could
furnish
*punct* ,
to
carry
round
the
refreshments
at
exactly
the
proper
hour
*punct* ,
and
in
the
proper
order
*punct* .
*break*
emma
*punct* ,
in
the
meanwhile
*punct* ,
could
not
be
satisfied
without
a
dinner
at
hartfield
for
the
eltons
*punct* .
*break*
they
must
not
do
less
than
others
*punct* ,
or
she
should
be
exposed
to
odious
suspicions
*punct* ,
and
imagined
capable
of
pitiful
resentment
*punct* .
*break*
a
dinner
there
must
be
*punct* .
*break*
after
emma
had
talked
about
it
for
ten
minutes
*punct* ,
mr.
woodhouse
felt
no
unwillingness
*punct* ,
and
only
made
the
usual
stipulation
of
not
sitting
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
himself
*punct* ,
with
the
usual
regular
difficulty
of
deciding
who
should
do
it
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
persons
to
be
invited
*punct* ,
required
little
thought
*punct* .
*break*
besides
the
eltons
*punct* ,
it
must
be
the
westons
and
mr.
knightley
*punct* ;
so
far
it
was
all
of
course
*punct* ,
and
it
was
hardly
less
inevitable
that
poor
little
harriet
must
be
asked
to
make
the
eighth:
*punct* ,
but
this
invitation
was
not
given
with
equal
satisfaction
*punct* ,
and
on
many
accounts
emma
was
particularly
pleased
by
harriet's
begging
to
be
allowed
to
decline
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
rather
not
be
in
his
company
more
than
she
could
help
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
not
yet
quite
able
to
see
him
and
his
charming
happy
wife
together
*punct* ,
without
feeling
uncomfortable
*punct* .
*break*
if
miss
woodhouse
would
not
be
displeased
*punct* ,
she
would
rather
stay
at
home
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
precisely
what
emma
would
have
wished
*punct* ,
had
she
deemed
it
possible
enough
for
wishing
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
delighted
with
the
fortitude
of
her
little
friend
*punct* ,
for
fortitude
she
knew
it
was
in
her
to
give
up
being
in
company
and
stay
at
home
*punct* ;
and
she
could
now
invite
the
very
person
whom
she
really
wanted
to
make
the
eighth
*punct* ,
jane
fairfax.
*punct* ,
since
her
last
conversation
with
mrs.
weston
and
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
she
was
more
conscience-stricken
about
jane
fairfax
than
she
had
often
been.
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley's
words
dwelt
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
said
that
jane
fairfax
received
attentions
from
mrs.
elton
which
nobody
else
paid
her
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
very
true
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
at
least
as
far
as
relates
to
me
*punct* ,
which
was
all
that
was
meant
*punct* ,
and
it
is
very
shameful.
*punct* ,
of
the
same
age
*punct* ,
and
always
knowing
her
*punct* ,
i
ought
to
have
been
more
her
friend.
*punct* ,
she
will
never
like
me
now
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
neglected
her
too
long
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
will
shew
her
greater
attention
than
i
have
done
*punct* .
*break*
every
invitation
was
successful
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
all
disengaged
and
all
happy.
*punct* ,
the
preparatory
interest
of
this
dinner
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
was
not
yet
over
*punct* .
*break*
a
circumstance
rather
unlucky
occurred
*punct* .
*break*
the
two
eldest
little
knightleys
were
engaged
to
pay
their
grandpapa
and
aunt
a
visit
of
some
weeks
in
the
spring
*punct* ,
and
their
papa
now
proposed
bringing
them
*punct* ,
and
staying
one
whole
day
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
which
one
day
would
be
the
very
day
of
this
party.
*punct* ,
his
professional
engagements
did
not
allow
of
his
being
put
off
*punct* ,
but
both
father
and
daughter
were
disturbed
by
its
happening
so
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
considered
eight
persons
at
dinner
together
as
the
utmost
that
his
nerves
could
bear
*punct* ,
and
here
would
be
a
ninth
*punct* ,
and
emma
apprehended
that
it
would
be
a
ninth
very
much
out
of
humour
at
not
being
able
to
come
even
to
hartfield
for
forty-eight
hours
without
falling
in
with
a
dinner-party
*punct* .
*break*
she
comforted
her
father
better
than
she
could
comfort
herself
*punct* ,
by
representing
that
though
he
certainly
would
make
them
nine
*punct* ,
yet
he
always
said
so
little
*punct* ,
that
the
increase
of
noise
would
be
very
immaterial
*punct* .
*break*
she
thought
it
in
reality
a
sad
exchange
for
herself
*punct* ,
to
have
him
with
his
grave
looks
and
reluctant
conversation
opposed
to
her
instead
of
his
brother
*punct* .
*break*
the
event
was
more
favourable
to
mr.
woodhouse
than
to
emma
*punct* .
*break*
john
knightley
came
*punct* ;
but
mr.
weston
was
unexpectedly
summoned
to
town
and
must
be
absent
on
the
very
day
*punct* .
*break*
he
might
be
able
to
join
them
in
the
evening
*punct* ,
but
certainly
not
to
dinner
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
was
quite
at
ease
*punct* ;
and
the
seeing
him
so
*punct* ,
with
the
arrival
of
the
little
boys
and
the
philosophic
composure
of
her
brother
on
hearing
his
fate
*punct* ,
removed
the
chief
of
even
emma's
vexation
*punct* .
*break*
the
day
came
*punct* ,
the
party
were
punctually
assembled
*punct* ,
and
mr.
john
knightley
seemed
early
to
devote
himself
to
the
business
of
being
agreeable
*punct* .
*break*
instead
of
drawing
his
brother
off
to
a
window
while
they
waited
for
dinner
*punct* ,
he
was
talking
to
miss
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
as
elegant
as
lace
and
pearls
could
make
her
*punct* ,
he
looked
at
in
silence
*punct* ,
wanting
only
to
observe
enough
for
isabella's
information
*punct* ,
but
miss
fairfax
was
an
old
acquaintance
and
a
quiet
girl
*punct* ,
and
he
could
talk
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
met
her
before
breakfast
as
he
was
returning
from
a
walk
with
his
little
boys
*punct* ,
when
it
had
been
just
beginning
to
rain
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
natural
to
have
some
civil
hopes
on
the
subject
*punct* ,
and
he
said
*punct* ,
i
hope
you
did
not
venture
far
*punct* ,
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
this
morning
*punct* ,
or
i
am
sure
you
must
have
been
wet.
*punct* ,
we
scarcely
got
home
in
time
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
you
turned
directly
*punct* .
*break*
i
went
only
to
the
post-office
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
and
reached
home
before
the
rain
was
much
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
my
daily
errand
*punct* .
*break*
i
always
fetch
the
letters
when
i
am
here
*punct* .
*break*
it
saves
trouble
*punct* ,
and
is
a
something
to
get
me
out
*punct* .
*break*
a
walk
before
breakfast
does
me
good
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
walk
in
the
rain
*punct* ,
i
should
imagine
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
but
it
did
not
absolutely
rain
when
i
set
out
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
john
knightley
smiled
*punct* ,
and
replied
*punct* ,
that
is
to
say
*punct* ,
you
chose
to
have
your
walk
*punct* ,
for
you
were
not
six
yards
from
your
own
door
when
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
you
*punct* ;
and
henry
and
john
had
seen
more
drops
than
they
could
count
long
before
*punct* .
*break*
the
post-office
has
a
great
charm
at
one
period
of
our
lives
*punct* .
*break*
when
you
have
lived
to
my
age
*punct* ,
you
will
begin
to
think
letters
are
never
worth
going
through
the
rain
for
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
little
blush
*punct* ,
and
then
this
answer
*punct* ,
i
must
not
hope
to
be
ever
situated
as
you
are
*punct* ,
in
the
midst
of
every
dearest
connexion
*punct* ,
and
therefore
i
cannot
expect
that
simply
growing
older
should
make
me
indifferent
about
letters
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
never
conceived
you
could
become
indifferent
*punct* .
*break*
letters
are
no
matter
of
indifference
*punct* ;
they
are
generally
a
very
positive
curse
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
speaking
of
letters
of
business
*punct* ;
mine
are
letters
of
friendship
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
often
thought
them
the
worst
of
the
two
*punct* ,
replied
he
coolly
*punct* .
*break*
business
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
may
bring
money
*punct* ,
but
friendship
hardly
ever
does
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
not
serious
now
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
mr.
john
knightley
too
well
*punct* ,
i
am
very
sure
he
understands
the
value
of
friendship
as
well
as
any
body
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
easily
believe
that
letters
are
very
little
to
you
*punct* ,
much
less
than
to
me
*punct* ,
but
it
is
not
your
being
ten
years
older
than
myself
which
makes
the
difference
*punct* ,
it
is
not
age
*punct* ,
but
situation
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
every
body
dearest
to
you
always
at
hand
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
probably
*punct* ,
never
shall
again
*punct* ;
and
therefore
till
i
have
outlived
all
my
affections
*punct* ,
a
post-office
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
must
always
have
power
to
draw
me
out
*punct* ,
in
worse
weather
than
to-day
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
talked
of
your
being
altered
by
time
*punct* ,
by
the
progress
of
years
*punct* ,
said
john
knightley
*punct* ,
i
meant
to
imply
the
change
of
situation
which
time
usually
brings
*punct* .
*break*
i
consider
one
as
including
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
time
will
generally
lessen
the
interest
of
every
attachment
not
within
the
daily
circle
*punct* ,
but
that
is
not
the
change
i
had
in
view
for
you
*punct* .
*break*
as
an
old
friend
*punct* ,
you
will
allow
me
to
hope
*punct* ,
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
that
ten
years
hence
you
may
have
as
many
concentrated
objects
as
i
have
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
kindly
said
*punct* ,
and
very
far
from
giving
offence
*punct* .
*break*
a
pleasant
thank
you
seemed
meant
to
laugh
it
off
*punct* ,
but
a
blush
*punct* ,
a
quivering
lip
*punct* ,
a
tear
in
the
eye
*punct* ,
shewed
that
it
was
felt
beyond
a
laugh
*punct* .
*break*
her
attention
was
now
claimed
by
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
who
being
*punct* ,
according
to
his
custom
on
such
occasions
*punct* ,
making
the
circle
of
his
guests
*punct* ,
and
paying
his
particular
compliments
to
the
ladies
*punct* ,
was
ending
with
her
*punct* ,
and
with
all
his
mildest
urbanity
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
i
am
very
sorry
to
hear
*punct* ,
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
of
your
being
out
this
morning
in
the
rain
*punct* .
*break*
young
ladies
should
take
care
of
themselves.
*punct* ,
young
ladies
are
delicate
plants
*punct* .
*break*
they
should
take
care
of
their
health
and
their
complexion
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
did
you
change
your
stockings
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
i
did
indeed
*punct* ;
and
i
am
very
much
obliged
by
your
kind
solicitude
about
me
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
young
ladies
are
very
sure
to
be
cared
for.
*punct* ,
i
hope
your
good
grand-mama
and
aunt
are
well
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
some
of
my
very
old
friends
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
my
health
allowed
me
to
be
a
better
neighbour
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
us
a
great
deal
of
honour
to-day
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* .
*break*
my
daughter
and
i
are
both
highly
sensible
of
your
goodness
*punct* ,
and
have
the
greatest
satisfaction
in
seeing
you
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
the
kind-hearted
*punct* ,
polite
old
man
might
then
sit
down
and
feel
that
he
had
done
his
duty
*punct* ,
and
made
every
fair
lady
welcome
and
easy
*punct* .
*break*
by
this
time
*punct* ,
the
walk
in
the
rain
had
reached
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
and
her
remonstrances
now
opened
upon
jane
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
jane
*punct* ,
what
is
this
i
hear?
*punct* ,
going
to
the
post-office
in
the
rain!
*punct* ,
this
must
not
be
*punct* ,
i
assure
you.
*punct* ,
you
sad
girl
*punct* ,
how
could
you
do
such
a
thing?
*punct* ,
it
is
a
sign
i
was
not
there
to
take
care
of
you
*punct* .
*break*
jane
very
patiently
assured
her
that
she
had
not
caught
any
cold
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
tell
me
*punct* .
*break*
you
really
are
a
very
sad
girl
*punct* ,
and
do
not
know
how
to
take
care
of
yourself.
*punct* ,
to
the
post-office
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
*punct* ?
*break*
you
and
i
must
positively
exert
our
authority
*punct* .
*break*
my
advice
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
weston
kindly
and
persuasively
*punct* ,
i
certainly
do
feel
tempted
to
give
*punct* .
*break*
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
you
must
not
run
such
risks.
*punct* ,
liable
as
you
have
been
to
severe
colds
*punct* ,
indeed
you
ought
to
be
particularly
careful
*punct* ,
especially
at
this
time
of
year
*punct* .
*break*
the
spring
i
always
think
requires
more
than
common
care
*punct* .
*break*
better
wait
an
hour
or
two
*punct* ,
or
even
half
a
day
for
your
letters
*punct* ,
than
run
the
risk
of
bringing
on
your
cough
again
*punct* .
*break*
now
do
not
you
feel
that
you
had
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
you
are
much
too
reasonable
*punct* .
*break*
you
look
as
if
you
would
not
do
such
a
thing
again
*punct* .
*break*
she
shall
not
do
such
a
thing
again
*punct* ,
eagerly
rejoined
mrs.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
we
will
not
allow
her
to
do
such
a
thing
again:
*punct* ,
and
nodding
significantly
*punct* ,
there
must
be
some
arrangement
made
*punct* ,
there
must
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
who
fetches
our
letters
every
morning
*punct* ,
one
of
our
men
*punct* ,
i
forget
his
name
*punct* ,
shall
inquire
for
yours
too
and
bring
them
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
that
will
obviate
all
difficulties
you
know
*punct* ;
and
from
us
i
really
think
*punct* ,
my
dear
jane
*punct* ,
you
can
have
no
scruple
to
accept
such
an
accommodation
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
extremely
kind
*punct* ,
said
jane
*punct* ;
but
i
cannot
give
up
my
early
walk
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
advised
to
be
out
of
doors
as
much
as
i
can
*punct* ,
i
must
walk
somewhere
*punct* ,
and
the
post-office
is
an
object
*punct* ;
and
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
i
have
scarcely
ever
had
a
bad
morning
before
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
jane
*punct* ,
say
no
more
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
thing
is
determined
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
laughing
affectedly
*punct* ,
as
far
as
i
can
presume
to
determine
any
thing
without
the
concurrence
of
my
lord
and
master
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
you
and
i
must
be
cautious
how
we
express
ourselves
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
do
flatter
myself
*punct* ,
my
dear
jane
*punct* ,
that
my
influence
is
not
entirely
worn
out
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
meet
with
no
insuperable
difficulties
therefore
*punct* ,
consider
that
point
as
settled
*punct* .
*break*
excuse
me
*punct* ,
said
jane
earnestly
*punct* ,
i
cannot
by
any
means
consent
to
such
an
arrangement
*punct* ,
so
needlessly
troublesome
to
your
servant
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
errand
were
not
a
pleasure
to
me
*punct* ,
it
could
be
done
*punct* ,
as
it
always
is
when
i
am
not
here
*punct* ,
by
my
grandmama's
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ;
but
so
much
as
patty
has
to
do!
*punct* ,
and
it
is
a
kindness
to
employ
our
men
*punct* .
*break*
jane
looked
as
if
she
did
not
mean
to
be
conquered
*punct* ;
but
instead
of
answering
*punct* ,
she
began
speaking
again
to
mr.
john
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
the
post-office
is
a
wonderful
establishment
*punct* !
*break*
said
she.
*punct* ,
the
regularity
and
despatch
of
it
*punct* !
*break*
if
one
thinks
of
all
that
it
has
to
do
*punct* ,
and
all
that
it
does
so
well
*punct* ,
it
is
really
astonishing
*punct* !
*break*
it
is
certainly
very
well
regulated
*punct* .
*break*
so
seldom
that
any
negligence
or
blunder
appears
*punct* !
*break*
so
seldom
that
a
letter
*punct* ,
among
the
thousands
that
are
constantly
passing
about
the
kingdom
*punct* ,
is
even
carried
wrong
*punct* ,
and
not
one
in
a
million
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
actually
lost
*punct* !
*break*
and
when
one
considers
the
variety
of
hands
*punct* ,
and
of
bad
hands
too
*punct* ,
that
are
to
be
deciphered
*punct* ,
it
increases
the
wonder
*punct* .
*break*
the
clerks
grow
expert
from
habit.
*punct* ,
they
must
begin
with
some
quickness
of
sight
and
hand
*punct* ,
and
exercise
improves
them
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
want
any
farther
explanation
*punct* ,
continued
he
*punct* ,
smiling
*punct* ,
they
are
paid
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
the
key
to
a
great
deal
of
capacity
*punct* .
*break*
the
public
pays
and
must
be
served
well
*punct* .
*break*
the
varieties
of
handwriting
were
farther
talked
of
*punct* ,
and
the
usual
observations
made
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
heard
it
asserted
*punct* ,
said
john
knightley
*punct* ,
that
the
same
sort
of
handwriting
often
prevails
in
a
family
*punct* ;
and
where
the
same
master
teaches
*punct* ,
it
is
natural
enough
*punct* .
*break*
but
for
that
reason
*punct* ,
i
should
imagine
the
likeness
must
be
chiefly
confined
to
the
females
*punct* ,
for
boys
have
very
little
teaching
after
an
early
age
*punct* ,
and
scramble
into
any
hand
they
can
get
*punct* .
*break*
isabella
and
emma
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
do
write
very
much
alike
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
not
always
known
their
writing
apart
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
his
brother
hesitatingly
*punct* ,
there
is
a
likeness
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
what
you
mean
*punct* ,
but
emma's
hand
is
the
strongest
*punct* .
*break*
isabella
and
emma
both
write
beautifully
*punct* ,
said
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ;
and
always
did
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
does
poor
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
with
half
a
sigh
and
half
a
smile
at
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
saw
any
gentleman's
handwriting
*punct* ,
emma
began
*punct* ,
looking
also
at
mrs.
weston
*punct* ;
but
stopped
*punct* ,
on
perceiving
that
mrs.
weston
was
attending
to
some
one
else
*punct* ,
and
the
pause
gave
her
time
to
reflect
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
how
am
i
going
to
introduce
him?
*punct* ,
am
i
unequal
to
speaking
his
name
at
once
before
all
these
people
*punct* ?
*break*
is
it
necessary
for
me
to
use
any
roundabout
phrase?
*punct* ,
your
yorkshire
friend
*punct* ,
your
correspondent
in
yorkshire;
*punct* ,
that
would
be
the
way
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
if
i
were
very
bad.
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
i
can
pronounce
his
name
without
the
smallest
distress
*punct* .
*break*
i
certainly
get
better
and
better.
*punct* ,
now
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
was
disengaged
and
emma
began
again
*punct* ,
mr.
frank
churchill
writes
one
of
the
best
gentleman's
hands
i
ever
saw
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
admire
it
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
too
small
*punct* ,
wants
strength
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
like
a
woman's
writing
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
not
submitted
to
by
either
lady
*punct* .
*break*
they
vindicated
him
against
the
base
aspersion
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
it
by
no
means
wanted
strength
*punct* ,
it
was
not
a
large
hand
*punct* ,
but
very
clear
and
certainly
strong
*punct* .
*break*
had
not
mrs.
weston
any
letter
about
her
to
produce
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
she
had
heard
from
him
very
lately
*punct* ,
but
having
answered
the
letter
*punct* ,
had
put
it
away
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
were
in
the
other
room
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
if
i
had
my
writing-desk
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
i
could
produce
a
specimen
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
a
note
of
his.
*punct* ,
do
not
you
remember
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
employing
him
to
write
for
you
one
day
*punct* ?
*break*
he
chose
to
say
he
was
employed
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
i
have
that
note
*punct* ;
and
can
shew
it
after
dinner
to
convince
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
when
a
gallant
young
man
*punct* ,
like
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
dryly
*punct* ,
writes
to
a
fair
lady
like
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
he
will
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
put
forth
his
best
*punct* .
*break*
dinner
was
on
table.
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
before
she
could
be
spoken
to
*punct* ,
was
ready
*punct* ;
and
before
mr.
woodhouse
had
reached
her
with
his
request
to
be
allowed
to
hand
her
into
the
dining-parlour
*punct* ,
was
saying
*punct* ,
must
i
go
first
*punct* ?
*break*
i
really
am
ashamed
of
always
leading
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
jane's
solicitude
about
fetching
her
own
letters
had
not
escaped
emma
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
heard
and
seen
it
all
*punct* ;
and
felt
some
curiosity
to
know
whether
the
wet
walk
of
this
morning
had
produced
any
*punct* .
*break*
she
suspected
that
it
had
*punct* ;
that
it
would
not
have
been
so
resolutely
encountered
but
in
full
expectation
of
hearing
from
some
one
very
dear
*punct* ,
and
that
it
had
not
been
in
vain
*punct* .
*break*
she
thought
there
was
an
air
of
greater
happiness
than
usual
*punct* ,
a
glow
both
of
complexion
and
spirits
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
have
made
an
inquiry
or
two
*punct* ,
as
to
the
expedition
and
the
expense
of
the
irish
mails;
*punct* ,
it
was
at
her
tongue's
end
*punct* ,
but
she
abstained
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
quite
determined
not
to
utter
a
word
that
should
hurt
jane
fairfax's
feelings
*punct* ;
and
they
followed
the
other
ladies
out
of
the
room
*punct* ,
arm
in
arm
*punct* ,
with
an
appearance
of
good-will
highly
becoming
to
the
beauty
and
grace
of
each
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
ladies
returned
to
the
drawing-room
after
dinner
*punct* ,
emma
found
it
hardly
possible
to
prevent
their
making
two
distinct
parties;
*punct* ,
with
so
much
perseverance
in
judging
and
behaving
ill
did
mrs.
elton
engross
jane
fairfax
and
slight
herself
*punct* .
*break*
she
and
mrs.
weston
were
obliged
to
be
almost
always
either
talking
together
or
silent
together
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
left
them
no
choice
*punct* .
*break*
if
jane
repressed
her
for
a
little
time
*punct* ,
she
soon
began
again
*punct* ;
and
though
much
that
passed
between
them
was
in
a
half-whisper
*punct* ,
especially
on
mrs.
elton's
side
*punct* ,
there
was
no
avoiding
a
knowledge
of
their
principal
subjects
*punct* :
the
post-office
*punct* ,
catching
cold
*punct* ,
fetching
letters
*punct* ,
and
friendship
*punct* ,
were
long
under
discussion
*punct* ;
and
to
them
succeeded
one
*punct* ,
which
must
be
at
least
equally
unpleasant
to
jane
*punct* ,
inquiries
whether
she
had
yet
heard
of
any
situation
likely
to
suit
her
*punct* ,
and
professions
of
mrs.
elton's
meditated
activity
*punct* .
*break*
here
is
april
come
*punct* !
*break*
said
she
*punct* ,
i
get
quite
anxious
about
you
*punct* .
*break*
june
will
soon
be
here
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
have
never
fixed
on
june
or
any
other
month
*punct* ,
merely
looked
forward
to
the
summer
in
general
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
not
even
made
any
inquiry
*punct* ;
i
do
not
wish
to
make
any
yet
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
we
cannot
begin
too
early
*punct* ;
you
are
not
aware
of
the
difficulty
of
procuring
exactly
the
desirable
thing
*punct* .
*break*
i
not
aware
*punct* !
*break*
said
jane
*punct* ,
shaking
her
head
*punct* ;
dear
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
who
can
have
thought
of
it
as
i
have
done
*punct* ?
*break*
but
you
have
not
seen
so
much
of
the
world
as
i
have
*punct* .
*break*
you
do
not
know
how
many
candidates
there
always
are
for
the
first
situations
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
a
vast
deal
of
that
in
the
neighbourhood
round
maple
grove
*punct* .
*break*
a
cousin
of
mr.
suckling
*punct* ,
mrs.
bragge
*punct* ,
had
such
an
infinity
of
applications
*punct* ;
every
body
was
anxious
to
be
in
her
family
*punct* ,
for
she
moves
in
the
first
circle
*punct* .
*break*
wax-candles
in
the
schoolroom
*punct* !
*break*
you
may
imagine
how
desirable
*punct* !
*break*
of
all
houses
in
the
kingdom
mrs.
bragge's
is
the
one
i
would
most
wish
to
see
you
in
*punct* .
*break*
colonel
and
mrs.
campbell
are
to
be
in
town
again
by
midsummer
*punct* ,
said
jane
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
spend
some
time
with
them
*punct* ;
i
am
sure
they
will
want
it;
*punct* ,
afterwards
i
may
probably
be
glad
to
dispose
of
myself
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
would
not
wish
you
to
take
the
trouble
of
making
any
inquiries
at
present
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
i
know
your
scruples
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
afraid
of
giving
me
trouble
*punct* ;
but
i
assure
you
*punct* ,
my
dear
jane
*punct* ,
the
campbells
can
hardly
be
more
interested
about
you
than
i
am
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
write
to
mrs.
partridge
in
a
day
or
two
*punct* ,
and
shall
give
her
a
strict
charge
to
be
on
the
look-out
for
any
thing
eligible
*punct* .
*break*
thank
you
*punct* ,
but
i
would
rather
you
did
not
mention
the
subject
to
her
*punct* ;
till
the
time
draws
nearer
*punct* ,
i
do
not
wish
to
be
giving
any
body
trouble
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
my
dear
child
*punct* ,
the
time
is
drawing
near
*punct* ;
here
is
april
*punct* ,
and
june
*punct* ,
or
say
even
july
*punct* ,
is
very
near
*punct* ,
with
such
business
to
accomplish
before
us
*punct* .
*break*
your
inexperience
really
amuses
me
*punct* !
*break*
a
situation
such
as
you
deserve
*punct* ,
and
your
friends
would
require
for
you
*punct* ,
is
no
everyday
occurrence
*punct* ,
is
not
obtained
at
a
moment's
notice
*punct* ;
indeed
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
we
must
begin
inquiring
directly
*punct* .
*break*
excuse
me
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ,
but
this
is
by
no
means
my
intention
*punct* ;
i
make
no
inquiry
myself
*punct* ,
and
should
be
sorry
to
have
any
made
by
my
friends
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
am
quite
determined
as
to
the
time
*punct* ,
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
being
long
unemployed
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
places
in
town
*punct* ,
offices
*punct* ,
where
inquiry
would
soon
produce
something
*punct* ,
offices
for
the
sale
*punct* ,
not
quite
of
human
flesh
*punct* ,
but
of
human
intellect
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
human
flesh
*punct* !
*break*
you
quite
shock
me
*punct* ;
if
you
mean
a
fling
at
the
slave-trade
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
mr.
suckling
was
always
rather
a
friend
to
the
abolition
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
not
mean
*punct* ,
i
was
not
thinking
of
the
slave-trade
*punct* ,
replied
jane
*punct* ;
governess-trade
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* ,
was
all
that
i
had
in
view
*punct* ;
widely
different
certainly
as
to
the
guilt
of
those
who
carry
it
on
*punct* ;
but
as
to
the
greater
misery
of
the
victims
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
where
it
lies
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
only
mean
to
say
that
there
are
advertising
offices
*punct* ,
and
that
by
applying
to
them
i
should
have
no
doubt
of
very
soon
meeting
with
something
that
would
do
*punct* .
*break*
something
that
would
do
*punct* !
*break*
repeated
mrs.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
that
may
suit
your
humble
ideas
of
yourself;
*punct* ,
i
know
what
a
modest
creature
you
are
*punct* ;
but
it
will
not
satisfy
your
friends
to
have
you
taking
up
with
any
thing
that
may
offer
*punct* ,
any
inferior
*punct* ,
commonplace
situation
*punct* ,
in
a
family
not
moving
in
a
certain
circle
*punct* ,
or
able
to
command
the
elegancies
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
very
obliging
*punct* ;
but
as
to
all
that
*punct* ,
i
am
very
indifferent
*punct* ;
it
would
be
no
object
to
me
to
be
with
the
rich
*punct* ;
my
mortifications
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
would
only
be
the
greater
*punct* ;
i
should
suffer
more
from
comparison
*punct* .
*break*
a
gentleman's
family
is
all
that
i
should
condition
for
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
you
*punct* ,
i
know
you
*punct* ;
you
would
take
up
with
any
thing
*punct* ;
but
i
shall
be
a
little
more
nice
*punct* ,
and
i
am
sure
the
good
campbells
will
be
quite
on
my
side
*punct* ;
with
your
superior
talents
*punct* ,
you
have
a
right
to
move
in
the
first
circle
*punct* .
*break*
your
musical
knowledge
alone
would
entitle
you
to
name
your
own
terms
*punct* ,
have
as
many
rooms
as
you
like
*punct* ,
and
mix
in
the
family
as
much
as
you
chose;
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
*punct* ,
if
you
knew
the
harp
*punct* ,
you
might
do
all
that
*punct* ,
i
am
very
sure
*punct* ;
but
you
sing
as
well
as
play;
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
i
really
believe
you
might
*punct* ,
even
without
the
harp
*punct* ,
stipulate
for
what
you
chose;
*punct* ,
and
you
must
and
shall
be
delightfully
*punct* ,
honourably
and
comfortably
settled
before
the
campbells
or
i
have
any
rest
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
well
class
the
delight
*punct* ,
the
honour
*punct* ,
and
the
comfort
of
such
a
situation
together
*punct* ,
said
jane
*punct* ,
they
are
pretty
sure
to
be
equal
*punct* ;
however
*punct* ,
i
am
very
serious
in
not
wishing
any
thing
to
be
attempted
at
present
for
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
you
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
i
am
obliged
to
any
body
who
feels
for
me
*punct* ,
but
i
am
quite
serious
in
wishing
nothing
to
be
done
till
the
summer
*punct* .
*break*
for
two
or
three
months
longer
i
shall
remain
where
i
am
*punct* ,
and
as
i
am
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
am
quite
serious
too
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* ,
replied
mrs.
elton
gaily
*punct* ,
in
resolving
to
be
always
on
the
watch
*punct* ,
and
employing
my
friends
to
watch
also
*punct* ,
that
nothing
really
unexceptionable
may
pass
us
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
style
she
ran
on
*punct* ;
never
thoroughly
stopped
by
any
thing
till
mr.
woodhouse
came
into
the
room
*punct* ;
her
vanity
had
then
a
change
of
object
*punct* ,
and
emma
heard
her
saying
in
the
same
half-whisper
to
jane
*punct* ,
here
comes
this
dear
old
beau
of
mine
*punct* ,
i
protest!
*punct* ,
only
think
of
his
gallantry
in
coming
away
before
the
other
men!
*punct* ,
what
a
dear
creature
he
is;
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
i
like
him
excessively
*punct* .
*break*
i
admire
all
that
quaint
*punct* ,
old-fashioned
politeness
*punct* ;
it
is
much
more
to
my
taste
than
modern
ease
*punct* ;
modern
ease
often
disgusts
me
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
good
old
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
i
wish
you
had
heard
his
gallant
speeches
to
me
at
dinner
*punct* .
*break*
i
assure
you
i
began
to
think
my
caro
sposo
would
be
absolutely
jealous
*punct* .
*break*
i
fancy
i
am
rather
a
favourite
*punct* ;
he
took
notice
of
my
gown
*punct* .
*break*
how
do
you
like
it?
*punct* ,
selina's
choice
*punct* ,
handsome
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
but
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
not
over-trimmed
*punct* ;
i
have
the
greatest
dislike
to
the
idea
of
being
over-trimmed
*punct* ,
quite
a
horror
of
finery
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
put
on
a
few
ornaments
now
*punct* ,
because
it
is
expected
of
me
*punct* .
*break*
a
bride
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
must
appear
like
a
bride
*punct* ,
but
my
natural
taste
is
all
for
simplicity
*punct* ;
a
simple
style
of
dress
is
so
infinitely
preferable
to
finery
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
am
quite
in
the
minority
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ;
few
people
seem
to
value
simplicity
of
dress,
*punct* ,
show
and
finery
are
every
thing
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
some
notion
of
putting
such
a
trimming
as
this
to
my
white
and
silver
poplin
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
think
it
will
look
well
*punct* ?
*break*
the
whole
party
were
but
just
reassembled
in
the
drawing-room
when
mr.
weston
made
his
appearance
among
them
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
returned
to
a
late
dinner
*punct* ,
and
walked
to
hartfield
as
soon
as
it
was
over
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
too
much
expected
by
the
best
judges
*punct* ,
for
surprize
*punct* ,
but
there
was
great
joy
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
was
almost
as
glad
to
see
him
now
*punct* ,
as
he
would
have
been
sorry
to
see
him
before
*punct* .
*break*
john
knightley
only
was
in
mute
astonishment.
*punct* ,
that
a
man
who
might
have
spent
his
evening
quietly
at
home
after
a
day
of
business
in
london
*punct* ,
should
set
off
again
*punct* ,
and
walk
half
a
mile
to
another
man's
house
*punct* ,
for
the
sake
of
being
in
mixed
company
till
bed-time
*punct* ,
of
finishing
his
day
in
the
efforts
of
civility
and
the
noise
of
numbers
*punct* ,
was
a
circumstance
to
strike
him
deeply
*punct* .
*break*
a
man
who
had
been
in
motion
since
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
*punct* ,
and
might
now
have
been
still
*punct* ,
who
had
been
long
talking
*punct* ,
and
might
have
been
silent
*punct* ,
who
had
been
in
more
than
one
crowd
*punct* ,
and
might
have
been
alone!
*punct* ,
such
a
man
*punct* ,
to
quit
the
tranquillity
and
independence
of
his
own
fireside
*punct* ,
and
on
the
evening
of
a
cold
sleety
april
day
rush
out
again
into
the
world!
*punct* ,
could
he
by
a
touch
of
his
finger
have
instantly
taken
back
his
wife
*punct* ,
there
would
have
been
a
motive
*punct* ;
but
his
coming
would
probably
prolong
rather
than
break
up
the
party
*punct* .
*break*
john
knightley
looked
at
him
with
amazement
*punct* ,
then
shrugged
his
shoulders
*punct* ,
and
said
*punct* ,
i
could
not
have
believed
it
even
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
meanwhile
*punct* ,
perfectly
unsuspicious
of
the
indignation
he
was
exciting
*punct* ,
happy
and
cheerful
as
usual
*punct* ,
and
with
all
the
right
of
being
principal
talker
*punct* ,
which
a
day
spent
anywhere
from
home
confers
*punct* ,
was
making
himself
agreeable
among
the
rest
*punct* ;
and
having
satisfied
the
inquiries
of
his
wife
as
to
his
dinner
*punct* ,
convincing
her
that
none
of
all
her
careful
directions
to
the
servants
had
been
forgotten
*punct* ,
and
spread
abroad
what
public
news
he
had
heard
*punct* ,
was
proceeding
to
a
family
communication
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
though
principally
addressed
to
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
he
had
not
the
smallest
doubt
of
being
highly
interesting
to
every
body
in
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
he
gave
her
a
letter
*punct* ,
it
was
from
frank
*punct* ,
and
to
herself
*punct* ;
he
had
met
with
it
in
his
way
*punct* ,
and
had
taken
the
liberty
of
opening
it
*punct* .
*break*
read
it
*punct* ,
read
it
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
it
will
give
you
pleasure
*punct* ;
only
a
few
lines
*punct* ,
will
not
take
you
long
*punct* ;
read
it
to
emma
*punct* .
*break*
the
two
ladies
looked
over
it
together
*punct* ;
and
he
sat
smiling
and
talking
to
them
the
whole
time
*punct* ,
in
a
voice
a
little
subdued
*punct* ,
but
very
audible
to
every
body
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
he
is
coming
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* ;
good
news
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
what
do
you
say
to
it?
*punct* ,
i
always
told
you
he
would
be
here
again
soon
*punct* ,
did
not
i?
*punct* ,
anne
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
did
not
i
always
tell
you
so
*punct* ,
and
you
would
not
believe
me?
*punct* ,
in
town
next
week
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* ,
at
the
latest
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* ;
for
she
is
as
impatient
as
the
black
gentleman
when
any
thing
is
to
be
done
*punct* ;
most
likely
they
will
be
there
to-morrow
or
saturday
*punct* .
*break*
as
to
her
illness
*punct* ,
all
nothing
of
course
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
an
excellent
thing
to
have
frank
among
us
again
*punct* ,
so
near
as
town
*punct* .
*break*
they
will
stay
a
good
while
when
they
do
come
*punct* ,
and
he
will
be
half
his
time
with
us
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
precisely
what
i
wanted
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
pretty
good
news
*punct* ,
is
not
it
*punct* ?
*break*
have
you
finished
it
*punct* ?
*break*
has
emma
read
it
all
*punct* ?
*break*
put
it
up
*punct* ,
put
it
up
*punct* ;
we
will
have
a
good
talk
about
it
some
other
time
*punct* ,
but
it
will
not
do
now
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
only
just
mention
the
circumstance
to
the
others
in
a
common
way
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
was
most
comfortably
pleased
on
the
occasion
*punct* .
*break*
her
looks
and
words
had
nothing
to
restrain
them
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
happy
*punct* ,
she
knew
she
was
happy
*punct* ,
and
knew
she
ought
to
be
happy
*punct* .
*break*
her
congratulations
were
warm
and
open
*punct* ;
but
emma
could
not
speak
so
fluently
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
a
little
occupied
in
weighing
her
own
feelings
*punct* ,
and
trying
to
understand
the
degree
of
her
agitation
*punct* ,
which
she
rather
thought
was
considerable
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
too
eager
to
be
very
observant
*punct* ,
too
communicative
to
want
others
to
talk
*punct* ,
was
very
well
satisfied
with
what
she
did
say
*punct* ,
and
soon
moved
away
to
make
the
rest
of
his
friends
happy
by
a
partial
communication
of
what
the
whole
room
must
have
overheard
already
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
well
that
he
took
every
body's
joy
for
granted
*punct* ,
or
he
might
not
have
thought
either
mr.
woodhouse
or
mr.
knightley
particularly
delighted
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
the
first
entitled
*punct* ,
after
mrs.
weston
and
emma
*punct* ,
to
be
made
happy;
*punct* ,
from
them
he
would
have
proceeded
to
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
but
she
was
so
deep
in
conversation
with
john
knightley
*punct* ,
that
it
would
have
been
too
positive
an
interruption
*punct* ;
and
finding
himself
close
to
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
and
her
attention
disengaged
*punct* ,
he
necessarily
began
on
the
subject
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
i
shall
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
introducing
my
son
to
you
*punct* ,
said
mr.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
very
willing
to
suppose
a
particular
compliment
intended
her
by
such
a
hope
*punct* ,
smiled
most
graciously
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
heard
of
a
certain
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
i
presume
*punct* ,
he
continued
*punct* ,
and
know
him
to
be
my
son
*punct* ,
though
he
does
not
bear
my
name
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
and
i
shall
be
very
happy
in
his
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
mr.
elton
will
lose
no
time
in
calling
on
him
*punct* ;
and
we
shall
both
have
great
pleasure
in
seeing
him
at
the
vicarage
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
very
obliging.
*punct* ,
frank
will
be
extremely
happy
*punct* ,
i
am
sure.
*punct* ,
he
is
to
be
in
town
next
week
*punct* ,
if
not
sooner
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
notice
of
it
in
a
letter
to-day
*punct* .
*break*
i
met
the
letters
in
my
way
this
morning
*punct* ,
and
seeing
my
son's
hand
*punct* ,
presumed
to
open
it
*punct* ,
though
it
was
not
directed
to
me
*punct* ,
it
was
to
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
his
principal
correspondent
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* .
*break*
i
hardly
ever
get
a
letter
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
you
absolutely
opened
what
was
directed
to
her
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
laughing
affectedly
*punct* ,
i
must
protest
against
that.
*punct* ,
a
most
dangerous
precedent
indeed!
*punct* ,
i
beg
you
will
not
let
your
neighbours
follow
your
example.
*punct* ,
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
if
this
is
what
i
am
to
expect
*punct* ,
we
married
women
must
begin
to
exert
ourselves!
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
i
could
not
have
believed
it
of
you
*punct* !
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
we
men
are
sad
fellows
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
take
care
of
yourself
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton.
*punct* ,
this
letter
tells
us
*punct* ,
it
is
a
short
letter
*punct* ,
written
in
a
hurry
*punct* ,
merely
to
give
us
notice
*punct* ,
it
tells
us
that
they
are
all
coming
up
to
town
directly
*punct* ,
on
mrs.
churchill's
account
*punct* ,
she
has
not
been
well
the
whole
winter
*punct* ,
and
thinks
enscombe
too
cold
for
her
*punct* ,
so
they
are
all
to
move
southward
without
loss
of
time
*punct* .
*break*
indeed!
*punct* ,
from
yorkshire
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* .
*break*
enscombe
is
in
yorkshire
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
they
are
about
one
hundred
and
ninety
miles
from
london
*punct* .
*break*
a
considerable
journey
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
very
considerable
*punct* .
*break*
sixty-five
miles
farther
than
from
maple
grove
to
london
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
is
distance
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
to
people
of
large
fortune?
*punct* ,
you
would
be
amazed
to
hear
how
my
brother
*punct* ,
mr.
suckling
*punct* ,
sometimes
flies
about
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
hardly
believe
me
*punct* ,
but
twice
in
one
week
he
and
mr.
bragge
went
to
london
and
back
again
with
four
horses
*punct* .
*break*
the
evil
of
the
distance
from
enscombe
*punct* ,
said
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
that
mrs.
churchill
*punct* ,
as
we
understand
*punct* ,
has
not
been
able
to
leave
the
sofa
for
a
week
together
*punct* .
*break*
in
frank's
last
letter
she
complained
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
of
being
too
weak
to
get
into
her
conservatory
without
having
both
his
arm
and
his
uncle's
*punct* !
*break*
this
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
speaks
a
great
degree
of
weakness
*punct* ,
but
now
she
is
so
impatient
to
be
in
town
*punct* ,
that
she
means
to
sleep
only
two
nights
on
the
road.
*punct* ,
so
frank
writes
word
*punct* .
*break*
certainly
*punct* ,
delicate
ladies
have
very
extraordinary
constitutions
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
grant
me
that
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
i
shall
grant
you
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
i
always
take
the
part
of
my
own
sex
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
i
give
you
notice
*punct* ,
you
will
find
me
a
formidable
antagonist
on
that
point
*punct* .
*break*
i
always
stand
up
for
women
*punct* ,
and
i
assure
you
*punct* ,
if
you
knew
how
selina
feels
with
respect
to
sleeping
at
an
inn
*punct* ,
you
would
not
wonder
at
mrs.
churchill's
making
incredible
exertions
to
avoid
it
*punct* .
*break*
selina
says
it
is
quite
horror
to
her
*punct* ,
and
i
believe
i
have
caught
a
little
of
her
nicety
*punct* .
*break*
she
always
travels
with
her
own
sheets
*punct* ;
an
excellent
precaution
*punct* .
*break*
does
mrs.
churchill
do
the
same
*punct* ?
*break*
depend
upon
it
*punct* ,
mrs.
churchill
does
every
thing
that
any
other
fine
lady
ever
did
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
churchill
will
not
be
second
to
any
lady
in
the
land
for
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
eagerly
interposed
with
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
do
not
mistake
me
*punct* .
*break*
selina
is
no
fine
lady
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
run
away
with
such
an
idea
*punct* .
*break*
is
not
she
*punct* ?
*break*
then
she
is
no
rule
for
mrs.
churchill
*punct* ,
who
is
as
thorough
a
fine
lady
as
any
body
ever
beheld
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
began
to
think
she
had
been
wrong
in
disclaiming
so
warmly
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
by
no
means
her
object
to
have
it
believed
that
her
sister
was
not
a
fine
lady
*punct* ;
perhaps
there
was
want
of
spirit
in
the
pretence
of
it;
*punct* ,
and
she
was
considering
in
what
way
she
had
best
retract
*punct* ,
when
mr.
weston
went
on
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
churchill
is
not
much
in
my
good
graces
*punct* ,
as
you
may
suspect
*punct* ,
but
this
is
quite
between
ourselves
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
very
fond
of
frank
*punct* ,
and
therefore
i
would
not
speak
ill
of
her
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
she
is
out
of
health
now
*punct* ;
but
that
indeed
*punct* ,
by
her
own
account
*punct* ,
she
has
always
been
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
not
say
so
to
every
body
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
but
i
have
not
much
faith
in
mrs.
churchill's
illness
*punct* .
*break*
if
she
is
really
ill
*punct* ,
why
not
go
to
bath
*punct* ,
mr.
weston?
*punct* ,
to
bath
*punct* ,
or
to
clifton
*punct* ?
*break*
she
has
taken
it
into
her
head
that
enscombe
is
too
cold
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
the
fact
is
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
that
she
is
tired
of
enscombe
*punct* .
*break*
she
has
now
been
a
longer
time
stationary
there
*punct* ,
than
she
ever
was
before
*punct* ,
and
she
begins
to
want
change
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
retired
place
*punct* .
*break*
a
fine
place
*punct* ,
but
very
retired
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
like
maple
grove
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
can
stand
more
retired
from
the
road
than
maple
grove
*punct* .
*break*
such
an
immense
plantation
all
round
it
*punct* !
*break*
you
seem
shut
out
from
every
thing
*punct* ,
in
the
most
complete
retirement.
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
churchill
probably
has
not
health
or
spirits
like
selina
to
enjoy
that
sort
of
seclusion
*punct* .
*break*
or
*punct* ,
perhaps
she
may
not
have
resources
enough
in
herself
to
be
qualified
for
a
country
life
*punct* .
*break*
i
always
say
a
woman
cannot
have
too
many
resources
*punct* ,
and
i
feel
very
thankful
that
i
have
so
many
myself
as
to
be
quite
independent
of
society
*punct* .
*break*
frank
was
here
in
february
for
a
fortnight
*punct* .
*break*
so
i
remember
to
have
heard
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
find
an
addition
to
the
society
of
highbury
when
he
comes
again
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
if
i
may
presume
to
call
myself
an
addition
*punct* .
*break*
but
perhaps
he
may
never
have
heard
of
there
being
such
a
creature
in
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
too
loud
a
call
for
a
compliment
to
be
passed
by
*punct* ,
and
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
with
a
very
good
grace
*punct* ,
immediately
exclaimed
*punct* ,
my
dear
madam
*punct* !
*break*
nobody
but
yourself
could
imagine
such
a
thing
possible
*punct* .
*break*
not
heard
of
you!
*punct* ,
i
believe
mrs.
weston's
letters
lately
have
been
full
of
very
little
else
than
mrs.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
done
his
duty
and
could
return
to
his
son
*punct* .
*break*
when
frank
left
us
*punct* ,
continued
he
*punct* ,
it
was
quite
uncertain
when
we
might
see
him
again
*punct* ,
which
makes
this
day's
news
doubly
welcome
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
been
completely
unexpected
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
*punct* ,
i
always
had
a
strong
persuasion
he
would
be
here
again
soon
*punct* ,
i
was
sure
something
favourable
would
turn
up
*punct* ,
but
nobody
believed
me
*punct* .
*break*
he
and
mrs.
weston
were
both
dreadfully
desponding
*punct* .
*break*
how
could
he
contrive
to
come
*punct* ?
*break*
and
how
could
it
be
supposed
that
his
uncle
and
aunt
would
spare
him
again
*punct* ?
*break*
and
so
forth
*punct* ,
i
always
felt
that
something
would
happen
in
our
favour
*punct* ;
and
so
it
has
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
observed
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
in
the
course
of
my
life
*punct* ,
that
if
things
are
going
untowardly
one
month
*punct* ,
they
are
sure
to
mend
the
next
*punct* .
*break*
very
true
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
perfectly
true
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
just
what
i
used
to
say
to
a
certain
gentleman
in
company
in
the
days
of
courtship
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
because
things
did
not
go
quite
right
*punct* ,
did
not
proceed
with
all
the
rapidity
which
suited
his
feelings
*punct* ,
he
was
apt
to
be
in
despair
*punct* ,
and
exclaim
that
he
was
sure
at
this
rate
it
would
be
may
before
hymen's
saffron
robe
would
be
put
on
for
us
*punct* .
*break*
the
pains
i
have
been
at
to
dispel
those
gloomy
ideas
and
give
him
cheerfuller
views
*punct* !
*break*
the
carriage
*punct* ,
we
had
disappointments
about
the
carriage;
*punct* ,
one
morning
*punct* ,
i
remember
*punct* ,
he
came
to
me
quite
in
despair
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
stopped
by
a
slight
fit
of
coughing
*punct* ,
and
mr.
weston
instantly
seized
the
opportunity
of
going
on
*punct* .
*break*
you
were
mentioning
may
*punct* .
*break*
may
is
the
very
month
which
mrs.
churchill
is
ordered
*punct* ,
or
has
ordered
herself
*punct* ,
to
spend
in
some
warmer
place
than
enscombe
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
to
spend
in
london
*punct* ;
so
that
we
have
the
agreeable
prospect
of
frequent
visits
from
frank
the
whole
spring
*punct* ,
precisely
the
season
of
the
year
which
one
should
have
chosen
for
it
*punct* :
days
almost
at
the
longest
*punct* ;
weather
genial
and
pleasant
*punct* ,
always
inviting
one
out
*punct* ,
and
never
too
hot
for
exercise
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
was
here
before
*punct* ,
we
made
the
best
of
it
*punct* ;
but
there
was
a
good
deal
of
wet
*punct* ,
damp
*punct* ,
cheerless
weather
*punct* ;
there
always
is
in
february
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
and
we
could
not
do
half
that
we
intended
*punct* .
*break*
now
will
be
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
this
will
be
complete
enjoyment
*punct* ;
and
i
do
not
know
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
whether
the
uncertainty
of
our
meetings
*punct* ,
the
sort
of
constant
expectation
there
will
be
of
his
coming
in
to-day
or
to-morrow
*punct* ,
and
at
any
hour
*punct* ,
may
not
be
more
friendly
to
happiness
than
having
him
actually
in
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
it
is
so
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
it
is
the
state
of
mind
which
gives
most
spirit
and
delight
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
you
will
be
pleased
with
my
son
*punct* ;
but
you
must
not
expect
a
prodigy
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
generally
thought
a
fine
young
man
*punct* ,
but
do
not
expect
a
prodigy
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston's
partiality
for
him
is
very
great
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
you
may
suppose
*punct* ,
most
gratifying
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
she
thinks
nobody
equal
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
assure
you
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
i
have
very
little
doubt
that
my
opinion
will
be
decidedly
in
his
favour
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
heard
so
much
in
praise
of
mr.
frank
churchill.
*punct* ,
at
the
same
time
it
is
fair
to
observe
*punct* ,
that
i
am
one
of
those
who
always
judge
for
themselves
*punct* ,
and
are
by
no
means
implicitly
guided
by
others
*punct* .
*break*
i
give
you
notice
that
as
i
find
your
son
*punct* ,
so
i
shall
judge
of
him.
*punct* ,
i
am
no
flatterer
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
was
musing
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
*punct* ,
said
he
presently
*punct* ,
i
have
not
been
severe
upon
poor
mrs.
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
if
she
is
ill
i
should
be
sorry
to
do
her
injustice
*punct* ;
but
there
are
some
traits
in
her
character
which
make
it
difficult
for
me
to
speak
of
her
with
the
forbearance
i
could
wish
*punct* .
*break*
you
cannot
be
ignorant
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
of
my
connexion
with
the
family
*punct* ,
nor
of
the
treatment
i
have
met
with
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
between
ourselves
*punct* ,
the
whole
blame
of
it
is
to
be
laid
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
the
instigator
*punct* .
*break*
frank's
mother
would
never
have
been
slighted
as
she
was
but
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
churchill
has
pride
*punct* ;
but
his
pride
is
nothing
to
his
wife's
*punct* :
his
is
a
quiet
*punct* ,
indolent
*punct* ,
gentlemanlike
sort
of
pride
that
would
harm
nobody
*punct* ,
and
only
make
himself
a
little
helpless
and
tiresome
*punct* ;
but
her
pride
is
arrogance
and
insolence
*punct* !
*break*
and
what
inclines
one
less
to
bear
*punct* ,
she
has
no
fair
pretence
of
family
or
blood
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
nobody
when
he
married
her
*punct* ,
barely
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
*punct* ;
but
ever
since
her
being
turned
into
a
churchill
she
has
out-churchill'd
them
all
in
high
and
mighty
claims
*punct* :
but
in
herself
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* ,
she
is
an
upstart
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
that
must
be
infinitely
provoking
*punct* !
*break*
i
have
quite
a
horror
of
upstarts
*punct* .
*break*
maple
grove
has
given
me
a
thorough
disgust
to
people
of
that
sort
*punct* ;
for
there
is
a
family
in
that
neighbourhood
who
are
such
an
annoyance
to
my
brother
and
sister
from
the
airs
they
give
themselves
*punct* !
*break*
your
description
of
mrs.
churchill
made
me
think
of
them
directly
*punct* .
*break*
people
of
the
name
of
tupman
*punct* ,
very
lately
settled
there
*punct* ,
and
encumbered
with
many
low
connexions
*punct* ,
but
giving
themselves
immense
airs
*punct* ,
and
expecting
to
be
on
a
footing
with
the
old
established
families
*punct* .
*break*
a
year
and
a
half
is
the
very
utmost
that
they
can
have
lived
at
west
hall
*punct* ;
and
how
they
got
their
fortune
nobody
knows
*punct* .
*break*
they
came
from
birmingham
*punct* ,
which
is
not
a
place
to
promise
much
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
one
has
not
great
hopes
from
birmingham
*punct* .
*break*
i
always
say
there
is
something
direful
in
the
sound
*punct* :
but
nothing
more
is
positively
known
of
the
tupmans
*punct* ,
though
a
good
many
things
i
assure
you
are
suspected
*punct* ;
and
yet
by
their
manners
they
evidently
think
themselves
equal
even
to
my
brother
*punct* ,
mr.
suckling
*punct* ,
who
happens
to
be
one
of
their
nearest
neighbours
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
infinitely
too
bad
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
suckling
*punct* ,
who
has
been
eleven
years
a
resident
at
maple
grove
*punct* ,
and
whose
father
had
it
before
him
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
i
am
almost
sure
that
old
mr.
suckling
had
completed
the
purchase
before
his
death
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
interrupted
*punct* .
*break*
tea
was
carrying
round
*punct* ,
and
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
having
said
all
that
he
wanted
*punct* ,
soon
took
the
opportunity
of
walking
away
*punct* .
*break*
after
tea
*punct* ,
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
and
mr.
elton
sat
down
with
mr.
woodhouse
to
cards
*punct* .
*break*
the
remaining
five
were
left
to
their
own
powers
*punct* ,
and
emma
doubted
their
getting
on
very
well
*punct* ;
for
mr.
knightley
seemed
little
disposed
for
conversation
*punct* ;
mrs.
elton
was
wanting
notice
*punct* ,
which
nobody
had
inclination
to
pay
*punct* ,
and
she
was
herself
in
a
worry
of
spirits
which
would
have
made
her
prefer
being
silent
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
john
knightley
proved
more
talkative
than
his
brother
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
to
leave
them
early
the
next
day
*punct* ;
and
he
soon
began
with
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
i
do
not
believe
i
have
any
thing
more
to
say
about
the
boys
*punct* ;
but
you
have
your
sister's
letter
*punct* ,
and
every
thing
is
down
at
full
length
there
we
may
be
sure
*punct* .
*break*
my
charge
would
be
much
more
concise
than
her's
*punct* ,
and
probably
not
much
in
the
same
spirit
*punct* ;
all
that
i
have
to
recommend
being
comprised
in
*punct* ,
do
not
spoil
them
*punct* ,
and
do
not
physic
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
rather
hope
to
satisfy
you
both
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
for
i
shall
do
all
in
my
power
to
make
them
happy
*punct* ,
which
will
be
enough
for
isabella
*punct* ;
and
happiness
must
preclude
false
indulgence
and
physic
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
you
find
them
troublesome
*punct* ,
you
must
send
them
home
again
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
very
likely
*punct* .
*break*
you
think
so
*punct* ,
do
not
you
*punct* ?
*break*
i
hope
i
am
aware
that
they
may
be
too
noisy
for
your
father
*punct* ,
or
even
may
be
some
encumbrance
to
you
*punct* ,
if
your
visiting
engagements
continue
to
increase
as
much
as
they
have
done
lately
*punct* .
*break*
certainly
*punct* ;
you
must
be
sensible
that
the
last
half-year
has
made
a
great
difference
in
your
way
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
no
indeed
i
am
not
*punct* .
*break*
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
your
being
much
more
engaged
with
company
than
you
used
to
be
*punct* .
*break*
witness
this
very
time
*punct* .
*break*
here
am
i
come
down
for
only
one
day
*punct* ,
and
you
are
engaged
with
a
dinner-party!
*punct* ,
when
did
it
happen
before
*punct* ,
or
any
thing
like
it
*punct* ?
*break*
your
neighbourhood
is
increasing
*punct* ,
and
you
mix
more
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
a
little
while
ago
*punct* ,
every
letter
to
isabella
brought
an
account
of
fresh
gaieties
*punct* ;
dinners
at
mr.
cole's
*punct* ,
or
balls
at
the
crown
*punct* .
*break*
the
difference
which
randalls
*punct* ,
randalls
alone
makes
in
your
goings-on
*punct* ,
is
very
great
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
his
brother
quickly
*punct* ,
it
is
randalls
that
does
it
all
*punct* .
*break*
very
well
*punct* ,
and
as
randalls
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
is
not
likely
to
have
less
influence
than
heretofore
*punct* ,
it
strikes
me
as
a
possible
thing
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
that
henry
and
john
may
be
sometimes
in
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
they
are
*punct* ,
i
only
beg
you
to
send
them
home
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
cried
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
that
need
not
be
the
consequence
*punct* .
*break*
let
them
be
sent
to
donwell
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
certainly
be
at
leisure
*punct* .
*break*
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
exclaimed
emma
*punct* ,
you
amuse
me
*punct* !
*break*
i
should
like
to
know
how
many
of
all
my
numerous
engagements
take
place
without
your
being
of
the
party
*punct* ;
and
why
i
am
to
be
supposed
in
danger
of
wanting
leisure
to
attend
to
the
little
boys
*punct* .
*break*
these
amazing
engagements
of
mine
*punct* ,
what
have
they
been
*punct* ?
*break*
dining
once
with
the
coles
*punct* ,
and
having
a
ball
talked
of
*punct* ,
which
never
took
place
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
understand
you
*punct* ,
nodding
at
mr.
john
knightley
*punct* ,
your
good
fortune
in
meeting
with
so
many
of
your
friends
at
once
here
*punct* ,
delights
you
too
much
to
pass
unnoticed
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
*punct* ,
turning
to
mr.
knightley,
*punct* ,
who
know
how
very
*punct* ,
very
seldom
i
am
ever
two
hours
from
hartfield
*punct* ,
why
you
should
foresee
such
a
series
of
dissipation
for
me
*punct* ,
i
cannot
imagine
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
to
my
dear
little
boys
*punct* ,
i
must
say
*punct* ,
that
if
aunt
emma
has
not
time
for
them
*punct* ,
i
do
not
think
they
would
fare
much
better
with
uncle
knightley
*punct* ,
who
is
absent
from
home
about
five
hours
where
she
is
absent
one
*punct* ,
and
who
*punct* ,
when
he
is
at
home
*punct* ,
is
either
reading
to
himself
or
settling
his
accounts
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
seemed
to
be
trying
not
to
smile
*punct* ;
and
succeeded
without
difficulty
*punct* ,
upon
mrs.
elton's
beginning
to
talk
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
a
very
little
quiet
reflection
was
enough
to
satisfy
emma
as
to
the
nature
of
her
agitation
on
hearing
this
news
of
frank
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
soon
convinced
that
it
was
not
for
herself
she
was
feeling
at
all
apprehensive
or
embarrassed
*punct* ;
it
was
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
her
own
attachment
had
really
subsided
into
a
mere
nothing
*punct* ;
it
was
not
worth
thinking
of;
*punct* ,
but
if
he
*punct* ,
who
had
undoubtedly
been
always
so
much
the
most
in
love
of
the
two
*punct* ,
were
to
be
returning
with
the
same
warmth
of
sentiment
which
he
had
taken
away
*punct* ,
it
would
be
very
distressing
*punct* .
*break*
if
a
separation
of
two
months
should
not
have
cooled
him
*punct* ,
there
were
dangers
and
evils
before
her:
*punct* ,
caution
for
him
and
for
herself
would
be
necessary
*punct* .
*break*
she
did
not
mean
to
have
her
own
affections
entangled
again
*punct* ,
and
it
would
be
incumbent
on
her
to
avoid
any
encouragement
of
his
*punct* .
*break*
she
wished
she
might
be
able
to
keep
him
from
an
absolute
declaration
*punct* .
*break*
that
would
be
so
very
painful
a
conclusion
of
their
present
acquaintance
*punct* !
*break*
and
yet
*punct* ,
she
could
not
help
rather
anticipating
something
decisive
*punct* .
*break*
she
felt
as
if
the
spring
would
not
pass
without
bringing
a
crisis
*punct* ,
an
event
*punct* ,
a
something
to
alter
her
present
composed
and
tranquil
state
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
very
long
*punct* ,
though
rather
longer
than
mr.
weston
had
foreseen
*punct* ,
before
she
had
the
power
of
forming
some
opinion
of
frank
churchill's
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
the
enscombe
family
were
not
in
town
quite
so
soon
as
had
been
imagined
*punct* ,
but
he
was
at
highbury
very
soon
afterwards
*punct* .
*break*
he
rode
down
for
a
couple
of
hours
*punct* ;
he
could
not
yet
do
more
*punct* ;
but
as
he
came
from
randalls
immediately
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
she
could
then
exercise
all
her
quick
observation
*punct* ,
and
speedily
determine
how
he
was
influenced
*punct* ,
and
how
she
must
act
*punct* .
*break*
they
met
with
the
utmost
friendliness
*punct* .
*break*
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
great
pleasure
in
seeing
her
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
had
an
almost
instant
doubt
of
his
caring
for
her
as
he
had
done
*punct* ,
of
his
feeling
the
same
tenderness
in
the
same
degree
*punct* .
*break*
she
watched
him
well
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
clear
thing
he
was
less
in
love
than
he
had
been
*punct* .
*break*
absence
*punct* ,
with
the
conviction
probably
of
her
indifference
*punct* ,
had
produced
this
very
natural
and
very
desirable
effect
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
in
high
spirits
*punct* ;
as
ready
to
talk
and
laugh
as
ever
*punct* ,
and
seemed
delighted
to
speak
of
his
former
visit
*punct* ,
and
recur
to
old
stories
*punct* :
and
he
was
not
without
agitation
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
in
his
calmness
that
she
read
his
comparative
difference
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
not
calm
*punct* ;
his
spirits
were
evidently
fluttered
*punct* ;
there
was
restlessness
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
lively
as
he
was
*punct* ,
it
seemed
a
liveliness
that
did
not
satisfy
himself
*punct* ;
but
what
decided
her
belief
on
the
subject
*punct* ,
was
his
staying
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*punct* ,
and
hurrying
away
to
make
other
calls
in
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
seen
a
group
of
old
acquaintance
in
the
street
as
he
passed
*punct* ,
he
had
not
stopped
*punct* ,
he
would
not
stop
for
more
than
a
word
*punct* ,
but
he
had
the
vanity
to
think
they
would
be
disappointed
if
he
did
not
call
*punct* ,
and
much
as
he
wished
to
stay
longer
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
he
must
hurry
off
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
no
doubt
as
to
his
being
less
in
love
*punct* ,
but
neither
his
agitated
spirits
*punct* ,
nor
his
hurrying
away
*punct* ,
seemed
like
a
perfect
cure
*punct* ;
and
she
was
rather
inclined
to
think
it
implied
a
dread
of
her
returning
power
*punct* ,
and
a
discreet
resolution
of
not
trusting
himself
with
her
long
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
the
only
visit
from
frank
churchill
in
the
course
of
ten
days
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
often
hoping
*punct* ,
intending
to
come
*punct* ,
but
was
always
prevented
*punct* .
*break*
his
aunt
could
not
bear
to
have
him
leave
her
*punct* .
*break*
such
was
his
own
account
at
randall's
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
were
quite
sincere
*punct* ,
if
he
really
tried
to
come
*punct* ,
it
was
to
be
inferred
that
mrs.
churchill's
removal
to
london
had
been
of
no
service
to
the
wilful
or
nervous
part
of
her
disorder
*punct* .
*break*
that
she
was
really
ill
was
very
certain
*punct* ;
he
had
declared
himself
convinced
of
it
*punct* ,
at
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
though
much
might
be
fancy
*punct* ,
he
could
not
doubt
*punct* ,
when
he
looked
back
*punct* ,
that
she
was
in
a
weaker
state
of
health
than
she
had
been
half
a
year
ago
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
believe
it
to
proceed
from
any
thing
that
care
and
medicine
might
not
remove
*punct* ,
or
at
least
that
she
might
not
have
many
years
of
existence
before
her
*punct* ;
but
he
could
not
be
prevailed
on
*punct* ,
by
all
his
father's
doubts
*punct* ,
to
say
that
her
complaints
were
merely
imaginary
*punct* ,
or
that
she
was
as
strong
as
ever
*punct* .
*break*
it
soon
appeared
that
london
was
not
the
place
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
not
endure
its
noise
*punct* .
*break*
her
nerves
were
under
continual
irritation
and
suffering
*punct* ;
and
by
the
ten
days
end
*punct* ,
her
nephew's
letter
to
randalls
communicated
a
change
of
plan
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
going
to
remove
immediately
to
richmond
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
churchill
had
been
recommended
to
the
medical
skill
of
an
eminent
person
there
*punct* ,
and
had
otherwise
a
fancy
for
the
place
*punct* .
*break*
a
ready-furnished
house
in
a
favourite
spot
was
engaged
*punct* ,
and
much
benefit
expected
from
the
change
*punct* .
*break*
emma
heard
that
frank
wrote
in
the
highest
spirits
of
this
arrangement
*punct* ,
and
seemed
most
fully
to
appreciate
the
blessing
of
having
two
months
before
him
of
such
near
neighbourhood
to
many
dear
friends
*punct* ,
for
the
house
was
taken
for
may
and
june
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
told
that
now
he
wrote
with
the
greatest
confidence
of
being
often
with
them
*punct* ,
almost
as
often
as
he
could
even
wish
*punct* .
*break*
emma
saw
how
mr.
weston
understood
these
joyous
prospects
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
considering
her
as
the
source
of
all
the
happiness
they
offered
*punct* .
*break*
she
hoped
it
was
not
so
*punct* .
*break*
two
months
must
bring
it
to
the
proof
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston's
own
happiness
was
indisputable
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
quite
delighted
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
very
circumstance
he
could
have
wished
for
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
it
would
be
really
having
frank
in
their
neighbourhood
*punct* .
*break*
what
were
nine
miles
to
a
young
man?
*punct* ,
an
hour's
ride
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
be
always
coming
over
*punct* .
*break*
the
difference
in
that
respect
of
richmond
and
london
was
enough
to
make
the
whole
difference
of
seeing
him
always
and
seeing
him
never
*punct* .
*break*
sixteen
miles
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
eighteen
*punct* ,
it
must
be
full
eighteen
to
manchester-street
*punct* ,
was
a
serious
obstacle
*punct* .
*break*
were
he
ever
able
to
get
away
*punct* ,
the
day
would
be
spent
in
coming
and
returning
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
comfort
in
having
him
in
london
*punct* ;
he
might
as
well
be
at
enscombe
*punct* ;
but
richmond
was
the
very
distance
for
easy
intercourse
*punct* .
*break*
better
than
nearer
*punct* !
*break*
one
good
thing
was
immediately
brought
to
a
certainty
by
this
removal,
*punct* ,
the
ball
at
the
crown
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
not
been
forgotten
before
*punct* ,
but
it
had
been
soon
acknowledged
vain
to
attempt
to
fix
a
day
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
it
was
absolutely
to
be
*punct* ;
every
preparation
was
resumed
*punct* ,
and
very
soon
after
the
churchills
had
removed
to
richmond
*punct* ,
a
few
lines
from
frank
*punct* ,
to
say
that
his
aunt
felt
already
much
better
for
the
change
*punct* ,
and
that
he
had
no
doubt
of
being
able
to
join
them
for
twenty-four
hours
at
any
given
time
*punct* ,
induced
them
to
name
as
early
a
day
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston's
ball
was
to
be
a
real
thing
*punct* .
*break*
a
very
few
to-morrows
stood
between
the
young
people
of
highbury
and
happiness
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
was
resigned
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
of
year
lightened
the
evil
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
may
was
better
for
every
thing
than
february
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
bates
was
engaged
to
spend
the
evening
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
james
had
due
notice
*punct* ,
and
he
sanguinely
hoped
that
neither
dear
little
henry
nor
dear
little
john
would
have
any
thing
the
matter
with
them
*punct* ,
while
dear
emma
were
gone
*punct* .
*break*
no
misfortune
occurred
*punct* ,
again
to
prevent
the
ball
*punct* .
*break*
the
day
approached
*punct* ,
the
day
arrived
*punct* ;
and
after
a
morning
of
some
anxious
watching
*punct* ,
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
in
all
the
certainty
of
his
own
self
*punct* ,
reached
randalls
before
dinner
*punct* ,
and
every
thing
was
safe
*punct* .
*break*
no
second
meeting
had
there
yet
been
between
him
and
emma
*punct* .
*break*
the
room
at
the
crown
was
to
witness
it;
*punct* ,
but
it
would
be
better
than
a
common
meeting
in
a
crowd
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
had
been
so
very
earnest
in
his
entreaties
for
her
arriving
there
as
soon
as
possible
after
themselves
*punct* ,
for
the
purpose
of
taking
her
opinion
as
to
the
propriety
and
comfort
of
the
rooms
before
any
other
persons
came
*punct* ,
that
she
could
not
refuse
him
*punct* ,
and
must
therefore
spend
some
quiet
interval
in
the
young
man's
company
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
to
convey
harriet
*punct* ,
and
they
drove
to
the
crown
in
good
time
*punct* ,
the
randalls
party
just
sufficiently
before
them
*punct* .
*break*
frank
churchill
seemed
to
have
been
on
the
watch
*punct* ;
and
though
he
did
not
say
much
*punct* ,
his
eyes
declared
that
he
meant
to
have
a
delightful
evening
*punct* .
*break*
they
all
walked
about
together
*punct* ,
to
see
that
every
thing
was
as
it
should
be
*punct* ;
and
within
a
few
minutes
were
joined
by
the
contents
of
another
carriage
*punct* ,
which
emma
could
not
hear
the
sound
of
at
first
*punct* ,
without
great
surprize
*punct* .
*break*
so
unreasonably
early
*punct* !
*break*
she
was
going
to
exclaim
*punct* ;
but
she
presently
found
that
it
was
a
family
of
old
friends
*punct* ,
who
were
coming
*punct* ,
like
herself
*punct* ,
by
particular
desire
*punct* ,
to
help
mr.
weston's
judgment
*punct* ;
and
they
were
so
very
closely
followed
by
another
carriage
of
cousins
*punct* ,
who
had
been
entreated
to
come
early
with
the
same
distinguishing
earnestness
*punct* ,
on
the
same
errand
*punct* ,
that
it
seemed
as
if
half
the
company
might
soon
be
collected
together
for
the
purpose
of
preparatory
inspection
*punct* .
*break*
emma
perceived
that
her
taste
was
not
the
only
taste
on
which
mr.
weston
depended
*punct* ,
and
felt
*punct* ,
that
to
be
the
favourite
and
intimate
of
a
man
who
had
so
many
intimates
and
confidantes
*punct* ,
was
not
the
very
first
distinction
in
the
scale
of
vanity
*punct* .
*break*
she
liked
his
open
manners
*punct* ,
but
a
little
less
of
open-heartedness
would
have
made
him
a
higher
character.
*punct* ,
general
benevolence
*punct* ,
but
not
general
friendship
*punct* ,
made
a
man
what
he
ought
to
be.
*punct* ,
she
could
fancy
such
a
man
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
party
walked
about
*punct* ,
and
looked
*punct* ,
and
praised
again
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
having
nothing
else
to
do
*punct* ,
formed
a
sort
of
half-circle
round
the
fire
*punct* ,
to
observe
in
their
various
modes
*punct* ,
till
other
subjects
were
started
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
though
may
*punct* ,
a
fire
in
the
evening
was
still
very
pleasant
*punct* .
*break*
emma
found
that
it
was
not
mr.
weston's
fault
that
the
number
of
privy
councillors
was
not
yet
larger
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
stopped
at
mrs.
bates's
door
to
offer
the
use
of
their
carriage
*punct* ,
but
the
aunt
and
niece
were
to
be
brought
by
the
eltons
*punct* .
*break*
frank
was
standing
by
her
*punct* ,
but
not
steadily
*punct* ;
there
was
a
restlessness
*punct* ,
which
shewed
a
mind
not
at
ease
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
looking
about
*punct* ,
he
was
going
to
the
door
*punct* ,
he
was
watching
for
the
sound
of
other
carriages,
*punct* ,
impatient
to
begin
*punct* ,
or
afraid
of
being
always
near
her
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
was
spoken
of
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
she
must
be
here
soon
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
a
great
curiosity
to
see
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
i
have
heard
so
much
of
her
*punct* .
*break*
it
cannot
be
long
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
before
she
comes
*punct* .
*break*
a
carriage
was
heard
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
on
the
move
immediately
*punct* ;
but
coming
back
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
i
am
forgetting
that
i
am
not
acquainted
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
never
seen
either
mr.
or
mrs.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
business
to
put
myself
forward
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
and
mrs.
elton
appeared
*punct* ;
and
all
the
smiles
and
the
proprieties
passed
*punct* .
*break*
but
miss
bates
and
miss
fairfax
*punct* !
*break*
said
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
looking
about
*punct* .
*break*
we
thought
you
were
to
bring
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
mistake
had
been
slight
*punct* .
*break*
the
carriage
was
sent
for
them
now
*punct* .
*break*
emma
longed
to
know
what
frank's
first
opinion
of
mrs.
elton
might
be
*punct* ;
how
he
was
affected
by
the
studied
elegance
of
her
dress
*punct* ,
and
her
smiles
of
graciousness
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
immediately
qualifying
himself
to
form
an
opinion
*punct* ,
by
giving
her
very
proper
attention
*punct* ,
after
the
introduction
had
passed
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
few
minutes
the
carriage
returned.
*punct* ,
somebody
talked
of
rain.
*punct* ,
i
will
see
that
there
are
umbrellas
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
frank
to
his
father
*punct* :
miss
bates
must
not
be
forgotten
*punct* :
and
away
he
went
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
was
following
*punct* ;
but
mrs.
elton
detained
him
*punct* ,
to
gratify
him
by
her
opinion
of
his
son
*punct* ;
and
so
briskly
did
she
begin
*punct* ,
that
the
young
man
himself
*punct* ,
though
by
no
means
moving
slowly
*punct* ,
could
hardly
be
out
of
hearing
*punct* .
*break*
a
very
fine
young
man
indeed
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
i
candidly
told
you
i
should
form
my
own
opinion
*punct* ;
and
i
am
happy
to
say
that
i
am
extremely
pleased
with
him.
*punct* ,
you
may
believe
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
compliment
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
him
a
very
handsome
young
man
*punct* ,
and
his
manners
are
precisely
what
i
like
and
approve
*punct* ,
so
truly
the
gentleman
*punct* ,
without
the
least
conceit
or
puppyism
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
know
i
have
a
vast
dislike
to
puppies
*punct* ,
quite
a
horror
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
never
tolerated
at
maple
grove
*punct* .
*break*
neither
mr.
suckling
nor
me
had
ever
any
patience
with
them
*punct* ;
and
we
used
sometimes
to
say
very
cutting
things
*punct* !
*break*
selina
*punct* ,
who
is
mild
almost
to
a
fault
*punct* ,
bore
with
them
much
better
*punct* .
*break*
while
she
talked
of
his
son
*punct* ,
mr.
weston's
attention
was
chained
*punct* ;
but
when
she
got
to
maple
grove
*punct* ,
he
could
recollect
that
there
were
ladies
just
arriving
to
be
attended
to
*punct* ,
and
with
happy
smiles
must
hurry
away
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
turned
to
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
doubt
of
its
being
our
carriage
with
miss
bates
and
jane
*punct* .
*break*
our
coachman
and
horses
are
so
extremely
expeditious!
*punct* ,
i
believe
we
drive
faster
than
any
body.
*punct* ,
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
send
one's
carriage
for
a
friend!
*punct* ,
i
understand
you
were
so
kind
as
to
offer
*punct* ,
but
another
time
it
will
be
quite
unnecessary
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
be
very
sure
i
shall
always
take
care
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
miss
bates
and
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
escorted
by
the
two
gentlemen
*punct* ,
walked
into
the
room
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
elton
seemed
to
think
it
as
much
her
duty
as
mrs.
weston's
to
receive
them
*punct* .
*break*
her
gestures
and
movements
might
be
understood
by
any
one
who
looked
on
like
emma
*punct* ;
but
her
words
*punct* ,
every
body's
words
*punct* ,
were
soon
lost
under
the
incessant
flow
of
miss
bates
*punct* ,
who
came
in
talking
*punct* ,
and
had
not
finished
her
speech
under
many
minutes
after
her
being
admitted
into
the
circle
at
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
door
opened
she
was
heard
*punct* ,
so
very
obliging
of
you!
*punct* ,
no
rain
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
to
signify
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
care
for
myself
*punct* .
*break*
quite
thick
shoes
*punct* .
*break*
and
jane
declares
*punct* ,
well!
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
she
was
within
the
door
*punct* ,
well
*punct* !
*break*
this
is
brilliant
indeed!
*punct* ,
this
is
admirable!
*punct* ,
excellently
contrived
*punct* ,
upon
my
word
*punct* .
*break*
could
not
have
imagined
it.
*punct* ,
so
well
lighted
up!
*punct* ,
jane
*punct* ,
jane
*punct* ,
look!
*punct* ,
did
you
ever
see
any
thing
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
you
must
really
have
had
aladdin's
lamp
*punct* .
*break*
good
mrs.
stokes
would
not
know
her
own
room
again
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
her
as
i
came
in
*punct* ;
she
was
standing
in
the
entrance
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
stokes
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
but
i
had
not
time
for
more
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
now
met
by
mrs.
weston.
*punct* ,
very
well
*punct* ,
i
thank
you
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
you
are
quite
well
*punct* .
*break*
very
happy
to
hear
it
*punct* .
*break*
so
afraid
you
might
have
a
headach!
*punct* ,
seeing
you
pass
by
so
often
*punct* ,
and
knowing
how
much
trouble
you
must
have
*punct* .
*break*
delighted
to
hear
it
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
dear
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
so
obliged
to
you
for
the
carriage!
*punct* ,
excellent
time
*punct* .
*break*
jane
and
i
quite
ready
*punct* .
*break*
did
not
keep
the
horses
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
most
comfortable
carriage.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
and
i
am
sure
our
thanks
are
due
to
you
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
on
that
score
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
had
most
kindly
sent
jane
a
note
*punct* ,
or
we
should
have
been.
*punct* ,
but
two
such
offers
in
one
day!
*punct* ,
never
were
such
neighbours
*punct* .
*break*
thank
you
*punct* ,
my
mother
is
remarkably
well
*punct* .
*break*
gone
to
mr.
woodhouse's
*punct* .
*break*
i
made
her
take
her
shawl
*punct* ,
for
the
evenings
are
not
warm
*punct* ,
her
large
new
shawl
*punct* ,
mrs.
dixon's
wedding-present.
*punct* ,
so
kind
of
her
to
think
of
my
mother
*punct* !
*break*
bought
at
weymouth
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
mr.
dixon's
choice
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
three
others
*punct* ,
jane
says
*punct* ,
which
they
hesitated
about
some
time
*punct* .
*break*
colonel
campbell
rather
preferred
an
olive
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
jane
*punct* ,
are
you
sure
you
did
not
wet
your
feet?
*punct* ,
it
was
but
a
drop
or
two
*punct* ,
but
i
am
so
afraid:
*punct* ,
but
mr.
frank
churchill
was
so
extremely
*punct* ,
and
there
was
a
mat
to
step
upon
*punct* ,
i
shall
never
forget
his
extreme
politeness.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
i
must
tell
you
my
mother's
spectacles
have
never
been
in
fault
since
*punct* ;
the
rivet
never
came
out
again
*punct* .
*break*
my
mother
often
talks
of
your
good-nature
*punct* .
*break*
does
not
she
*punct* ,
jane?
*punct* ,
do
not
we
often
talk
of
mr.
frank
churchill?
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* !
*break*
here's
miss
woodhouse.
*punct* ,
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
how
do
you
do?
*punct* ,
very
well
i
thank
you
*punct* ,
quite
well
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
meeting
quite
in
fairy-land!
*punct* ,
such
a
transformation!
*punct* ,
must
not
compliment
*punct* ,
i
know
*punct* ,
eyeing
emma
most
complacently
*punct* ,
that
would
be
rude
*punct* ,
but
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
you
do
look
*punct* ,
how
do
you
like
jane's
hair?
*punct* ,
you
are
a
judge.
*punct* ,
she
did
it
all
herself
*punct* .
*break*
quite
wonderful
how
she
does
her
hair!
*punct* ,
no
hairdresser
from
london
i
think

a
moment.

*break*

mr.

*punct* ,
i

other

likely

upon
my
word
*punct* ,
this
is
charming
to

standing
about
among
such
friends
*punct* !
*break*
and
such
a
noble

here

*break*
every
thing
so
good
*punct* !
*break*
frank
churchill
returned
to
his
station
by
emma
*punct* ;
and
as
soon
as
miss
bates
was
quiet
*punct* ,
she
found
herself
necessarily
overhearing
the
discourse
of
mrs.
elton
and
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
who
were
standing
a
little
way
behind
her.
*punct* ,
he
was
thoughtful
*punct* .
*break*
whether
he
were
overhearing
too
*punct* ,
she
could
not
determine
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
good
many
compliments
to
jane
on
her
dress
and
look
*punct* ,
compliments
very
quietly
and
properly
taken
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
was
evidently
wanting
to
be
complimented
herself
*punct* ,
and
it
was
*punct* ,
how
do
you
like
my
gown?
*punct* ,
how
do
you
like
my
trimming?
*punct* ,
how
has
wright
done
my
hair?
*punct* ,
with
many
other
relative
questions
*punct* ,
all
answered
with
patient
politeness
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
then
said
*punct* ,
nobody
can
think
less
of
dress
in
general
than
i
do
*punct* ,
but
upon
such
an
occasion
as
this
*punct* ,
when
every
body's
eyes
are
so
much
upon
me
*punct* ,
and
in
compliment
to
the
westons
*punct* ,
who
i
have
no
doubt
are
giving
this
ball
chiefly
to
do
me
honour
*punct* ,
i
would
not
wish
to
be
inferior
to
others
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
see
very
few
pearls
in
the
room
except
mine.
*punct* ,
so
frank
churchill
is
a
capital
dancer
*punct* ,
i
understand.
*punct* ,
we
shall
see
if
our
styles
suit.
*punct* ,
a
fine
young
man
certainly
is
frank
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
i
like
him
very
well
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
moment
frank
began
talking
so
vigorously
*punct* ,
that
emma
could
not
but
imagine
he
had
overheard
his
own
praises
*punct* ,
and
did
not
want
to
hear
more;
*punct* ,
and
the
voices
of
the
ladies
were
drowned
for
a
while
*punct* ,
till
another
suspension
brought
mrs.
elton's
tones
again
distinctly
forward.
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
had
just
joined
them
*punct* ,
and
his
wife
was
exclaiming
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
you
have
found
us
out
at
last
*punct* ,
have
you
*punct* ,
in
our
seclusion?
*punct* ,
i
was
this
moment
telling
jane
*punct* ,
i
thought
you
would
begin
to
be
impatient
for
tidings
of
us
*punct* .
*break*
jane!
*punct* ,
repeated
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
with
a
look
of
surprize
and
displeasure.
*punct* ,
that
is
easy
*punct* ,
but
miss
fairfax
does
not
disapprove
it
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* .
*break*
how
do
you
like
mrs.
elton
*punct* ?
*break*
said
emma
in
a
whisper
*punct* .
*break*
not
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
ungrateful
*punct* .
*break*
ungrateful!
*punct* ,
what
do
you
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
then
changing
from
a
frown
to
a
smile
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
do
not
tell
me
*punct* ,
i
do
not
want
to
know
what
you
mean.
*punct* ,
where
is
my
father?
*punct* ,
when
are
we
to
begin
dancing
*punct* ?
*break*
emma
could
hardly
understand
him
*punct* ;
he
seemed
in
an
odd
humour
*punct* .
*break*
he
walked
off
to
find
his
father
*punct* ,
but
was
quickly
back
again
with
both
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
met
with
them
in
a
little
perplexity
*punct* ,
which
must
be
laid
before
emma
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
just
occurred
to
mrs.
weston
that
mrs.
elton
must
be
asked
to
begin
the
ball
*punct* ;
that
she
would
expect
it
*punct* ;
which
interfered
with
all
their
wishes
of
giving
emma
that
distinction.
*punct* ,
emma
heard
the
sad
truth
with
fortitude
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
are
we
to
do
for
a
proper
partner
for
her
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mr.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
she
will
think
frank
ought
to
ask
her
*punct* .
*break*
frank
turned
instantly
to
emma
*punct* ,
to
claim
her
former
promise
*punct* ;
and
boasted
himself
an
engaged
man
*punct* ,
which
his
father
looked
his
most
perfect
approbation
of
*punct* ,
and
it
then
appeared
that
mrs.
weston
was
wanting
him
to
dance
with
mrs.
elton
himself
*punct* ,
and
that
their
business
was
to
help
to
persuade
him
into
it
*punct* ,
which
was
done
pretty
soon.
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
and
mrs.
elton
led
the
way
*punct* ,
mr.
frank
churchill
and
miss
woodhouse
followed
*punct* .
*break*
emma
must
submit
to
stand
second
to
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
though
she
had
always
considered
the
ball
as
peculiarly
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
almost
enough
to
make
her
think
of
marrying
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
had
undoubtedly
the
advantage
*punct* ,
at
this
time
*punct* ,
in
vanity
completely
gratified
*punct* ;
for
though
she
had
intended
to
begin
with
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
she
could
not
lose
by
the
change
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
might
be
his
son's
superior.
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
this
little
rub
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
emma
was
smiling
with
enjoyment
*punct* ,
delighted
to
see
the
respectable
length
of
the
set
as
it
was
forming
*punct* ,
and
to
feel
that
she
had
so
many
hours
of
unusual
festivity
before
her.
*punct* ,
she
was
more
disturbed
by
mr.
knightley's
not
dancing
than
by
any
thing
else.
*punct* ,
there
he
was
*punct* ,
among
the
standers-by
*punct* ,
where
he
ought
not
to
be
*punct* ;
he
ought
to
be
dancing,
*punct* ,
not
classing
himself
with
the
husbands
*punct* ,
and
fathers
*punct* ,
and
whist-players
*punct* ,
who
were
pretending
to
feel
an
interest
in
the
dance
till
their
rubbers
were
made
up,
*punct* ,
so
young
as
he
looked!
*punct* ,
he
could
not
have
appeared
to
greater
advantage
perhaps
anywhere
*punct* ,
than
where
he
had
placed
himself
*punct* .
*break*
his
tall
*punct* ,
firm
*punct* ,
upright
figure
*punct* ,
among
the
bulky
forms
and
stooping
shoulders
of
the
elderly
men
*punct* ,
was
such
as
emma
felt
must
draw
every
body's
eyes
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
excepting
her
own
partner
*punct* ,
there
was
not
one
among
the
whole
row
of
young
men
who
could
be
compared
with
him.
*punct* ,
he
moved
a
few
steps
nearer
*punct* ,
and
those
few
steps
were
enough
to
prove
in
how
gentlemanlike
a
manner
*punct* ,
with
what
natural
grace
*punct* ,
he
must
have
danced
*punct* ,
would
he
but
take
the
trouble.
*punct* ,
whenever
she
caught
his
eye
*punct* ,
she
forced
him
to
smile
*punct* ;
but
in
general
he
was
looking
grave
*punct* .
*break*
she
wished
he
could
love
a
ballroom
better
*punct* ,
and
could
like
frank
churchill
better.
*punct* ,
he
seemed
often
observing
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
not
flatter
herself
that
he
thought
of
her
dancing
*punct* ,
but
if
he
were
criticising
her
behaviour
*punct* ,
she
did
not
feel
afraid
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
nothing
like
flirtation
between
her
and
her
partner
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
more
like
cheerful
*punct* ,
easy
friends
*punct* ,
than
lovers
*punct* .
*break*
that
frank
churchill
thought
less
of
her
than
he
had
done
*punct* ,
was
indubitable
*punct* .
*break*
the
ball
proceeded
pleasantly
*punct* .
*break*
the
anxious
cares
*punct* ,
the
incessant
attentions
of
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
were
not
thrown
away
*punct* .
*break*
every
body
seemed
happy
*punct* ;
and
the
praise
of
being
a
delightful
ball
*punct* ,
which
is
seldom
bestowed
till
after
a
ball
has
ceased
to
be
*punct* ,
was
repeatedly
given
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
existence
of
this
*punct* .
*break*
of
very
important
*punct* ,
very
recordable
events
*punct* ,
it
was
not
more
productive
than
such
meetings
usually
are
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
one
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
which
emma
thought
something
of.
*punct* ,
the
two
last
dances
before
supper
were
begun
*punct* ,
and
harriet
had
no
partner;
*punct* ,
the
only
young
lady
sitting
down;
*punct* ,
and
so
equal
had
been
hitherto
the
number
of
dancers
*punct* ,
that
how
there
could
be
any
one
disengaged
was
the
wonder!
*punct* ,
but
emma's
wonder
lessened
soon
afterwards
*punct* ,
on
seeing
mr.
elton
sauntering
about
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
not
ask
harriet
to
dance
if
it
were
possible
to
be
avoided
*punct* :
she
was
sure
he
would
not
*punct* ,
and
she
was
expecting
him
every
moment
to
escape
into
the
card-room
*punct* .
*break*
escape
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
was
not
his
plan
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
to
the
part
of
the
room
where
the
sitters-by
were
collected
*punct* ,
spoke
to
some
*punct* ,
and
walked
about
in
front
of
them
*punct* ,
as
if
to
shew
his
liberty
*punct* ,
and
his
resolution
of
maintaining
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
omit
being
sometimes
directly
before
miss
smith
*punct* ,
or
speaking
to
those
who
were
close
to
her.
*punct* ,
emma
saw
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
not
yet
dancing
*punct* ;
she
was
working
her
way
up
from
the
bottom
*punct* ,
and
had
therefore
leisure
to
look
around
*punct* ,
and
by
only
turning
her
head
a
little
she
saw
it
all
*punct* .
*break*
when
she
was
half-way
up
the
set
*punct* ,
the
whole
group
were
exactly
behind
her
*punct* ,
and
she
would
no
longer
allow
her
eyes
to
watch
*punct* ;
but
mr.
elton
was
so
near
*punct* ,
that
she
heard
every
syllable
of
a
dialogue
which
just
then
took
place
between
him
and
mrs.
weston
*punct* ;
and
she
perceived
that
his
wife
*punct* ,
who
was
standing
immediately
above
her
*punct* ,
was
not
only
listening
also
*punct* ,
but
even
encouraging
him
by
significant
glances.
*punct* ,
the
kind-hearted
*punct* ,
gentle
mrs.
weston
had
left
her
seat
to
join
him
and
say
*punct* ,
do
not
you
dance
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
*punct* ?
*break*
to
which
his
prompt
reply
was
*punct* ,
most
readily
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
if
you
will
dance
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
me!
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
would
get
you
a
better
partner
than
myself
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
no
dancer
*punct* .
*break*
if
mrs.
gilbert
wishes
to
dance
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
i
shall
have
great
pleasure
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
though
beginning
to
feel
myself
rather
an
old
married
man
*punct* ,
and
that
my
dancing
days
are
over
*punct* ,
it
would
give
me
very
great
pleasure
at
any
time
to
stand
up
with
an
old
friend
like
mrs.
gilbert
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
gilbert
does
not
mean
to
dance
*punct* ,
but
there
is
a
young
lady
disengaged
whom
i
should
be
very
glad
to
see
dancing
*punct* ,
miss
smith
*punct* .
*break*
miss
smith!
*punct* ,
oh!
*punct* ,
i
had
not
observed.
*punct* ,
you
are
extremely
obliging
*punct* ,
and
if
i
were
not
an
old
married
man.
*punct* ,
but
my
dancing
days
are
over
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
excuse
me
*punct* .
*break*
any
thing
else
i
should
be
most
happy
to
do
*punct* ,
at
your
command
*punct* ,
but
my
dancing
days
are
over
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
said
no
more
*punct* ;
and
emma
could
imagine
with
what
surprize
and
mortification
she
must
be
returning
to
her
seat
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
mr.
elton
*punct* !
*break*
the
amiable
*punct* ,
obliging
*punct* ,
gentle
mr.
elton.
*punct* ,
she
looked
round
for
a
moment
*punct* ;
he
had
joined
mr.
knightley
at
a
little
distance
*punct* ,
and
was
arranging
himself
for
settled
conversation
*punct* ,
while
smiles
of
high
glee
passed
between
him
and
his
wife
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
not
look
again
*punct* .
*break*
her
heart
was
in
a
glow
*punct* ,
and
she
feared
her
face
might
be
as
hot
*punct* .
*break*
in
another
moment
a
happier
sight
caught
her;
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
leading
harriet
to
the
set!
*punct* ,
never
had
she
been
more
surprized
*punct* ,
seldom
more
delighted
*punct* ,
than
at
that
instant
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
all
pleasure
and
gratitude
*punct* ,
both
for
harriet
and
herself
*punct* ,
and
longed
to
be
thanking
him
*punct* ;
and
though
too
distant
for
speech
*punct* ,
her
countenance
said
much
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
she
could
catch
his
eye
again
*punct* .
*break*
his
dancing
proved
to
be
just
what
she
had
believed
it
*punct* ,
extremely
good
*punct* ;
and
harriet
would
have
seemed
almost
too
lucky
*punct* ,
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
cruel
state
of
things
before
*punct* ,
and
for
the
very
complete
enjoyment
and
very
high
sense
of
the
distinction
which
her
happy
features
announced
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
thrown
away
on
her
*punct* ,
she
bounded
higher
than
ever
*punct* ,
flew
farther
down
the
middle
*punct* ,
and
was
in
a
continual
course
of
smiles
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
had
retreated
into
the
card-room
*punct* ,
looking
*punct* ,
emma
trusted
*punct* ,
very
foolish
*punct* .
*break*
she
did
not
think
he
was
quite
so
hardened
as
his
wife
*punct* ,
though
growing
very
like
her;
*punct* ,
she
spoke
some
of
her
feelings
*punct* ,
by
observing
audibly
to
her
partner
*punct* ,
knightley
has
taken
pity
on
poor
little
miss
smith!
*punct* ,
very
goodnatured
*punct* ,
i
declare
*punct* .
*break*
supper
was
announced
*punct* .
*break*
the
move
began
*punct* ;
and
miss
bates
might
be
heard
from
that
moment
*punct* ,
without
interruption
*punct* ,
till
her
being
seated
at
table
and
taking
up
her
spoon
*punct* .
*break*
jane
*punct* ,
jane
*punct* ,
my
dear
jane
*punct* ,
where
are
you?
*punct* ,
here
is
your
tippet
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
begs
you
to
put
on
your
tippet
*punct* .
*break*
she
says
she
is
afraid
there
will
be
draughts
in
the
passage
*punct* ,
though
every
thing
has
been
done
*punct* ,
one
door
nailed
up
*punct* ,
quantities
of
matting
*punct* ,
my
dear
jane
*punct* ,
indeed
you
must
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
churchill
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
you
are
too
obliging
*punct* !
*break*
how
well
you
put
it
on!
*punct* ,
so
gratified
*punct* !
*break*
excellent
dancing
indeed!
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
i
ran
home
*punct* ,
as
i
said
i
should
*punct* ,
to
help
grandmama
to
bed
*punct* ,
and
got
back
again
*punct* ,
and
nobody
missed
me.
*punct* ,
i
set
off
without
saying
a
word
*punct* ,
just
as
i
told
you
*punct* .
*break*
grandmama
was
quite
well
*punct* ,
had
a
charming
evening
with
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
a
vast
deal
of
chat
*punct* ,
and
backgammon.
*punct* ,
tea
was
made
downstairs
*punct* ,
biscuits
and
baked
apples
and
wine
before
she
came
away
*punct* :
amazing
luck
in
some
of
her
throws
*punct* :
and
she
inquired
a
great
deal
about
you
*punct* ,
how
you
were
amused
*punct* ,
and
who
were
your
partners
*punct* .
*break*
said
i
*punct* ,
i
shall
not
forestall
jane
*punct* ;
i
left
her
dancing
with
mr.
george
otway
*punct* ;
she
will
love
to
tell
you
all
about
it
herself
to-morrow
*punct* :
her
first
partner
was
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
who
will
ask
her
next
*punct* ,
perhaps
mr.
william
cox
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
you
are
too
obliging.
*punct* ,
is
there
nobody
you
would
not
rather?
*punct* ,
i
am
not
helpless
*punct* .
*break*
sir
*punct* ,
you
are
most
kind
*punct* .
*break*
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
jane
on
one
arm
*punct* ,
and
me
on
the
other!
*punct* ,
stop
*punct* ,
stop
*punct* ,
let
us
stand
a
little
back
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
is
going
*punct* ;
dear
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
how
elegant
she
looks!
*punct* ,
beautiful
lace!
*punct* ,
now
we
all
follow
in
her
train
*punct* .
*break*
quite
the
queen
of
the
evening!
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
here
we
are
at
the
passage
*punct* .
*break*
two
steps
*punct* ,
jane
*punct* ,
take
care
of
the
two
steps
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
there
is
but
one
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
i
was
persuaded
there
were
two
*punct* .
*break*
how
very
odd
*punct* !
*break*
i
was
convinced
there
were
two
*punct* ,
and
there
is
but
one
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
saw
any
thing
equal
to
the
comfort
and
style
*punct* ,
candles
everywhere.
*punct* ,
i
was
telling
you
of
your
grandmama
*punct* ,
jane,
*punct* ,
there
was
a
little
disappointment.
*punct* ,
the
baked
apples
and
biscuits
*punct* ,
excellent
in
their
way
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ;
but
there
was
a
delicate
fricassee
of
sweetbread
and
some
asparagus
brought
in
at
first
*punct* ,
and
good
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
not
thinking
the
asparagus
quite
boiled
enough
*punct* ,
sent
it
all
out
again
*punct* .
*break*
now
there
is
nothing
grandmama
loves
better
than
sweetbread
and
asparagus
*punct* ,
so
she
was
rather
disappointed
*punct* ,
but
we
agreed
we
would
not
speak
of
it
to
any
body
*punct* ,
for
fear
of
its
getting
round
to
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
who
would
be
so
very
much
concerned!
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
this
is
brilliant
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
all
amazement
*punct* !
*break*
could
not
have
supposed
any
thing!
*punct* ,
such
elegance
and
profusion!
*punct* ,
i
have
seen
nothing
like
it
since
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
where
shall
we
sit
*punct* ?
*break*
where
shall
we
sit
*punct* ?
*break*
anywhere
*punct* ,
so
that
jane
is
not
in
a
draught
*punct* .
*break*
where
i
sit
is
of
no
consequence
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
recommend
this
side?
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* ,
mr.
churchill
*punct* ,
only
it
seems
too
good
*punct* ,
but
just
as
you
please
*punct* .
*break*
what
you
direct
in
this
house
cannot
be
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
dear
jane
*punct* ,
how
shall
we
ever
recollect
half
the
dishes
for
grandmama
*punct* ?
*break*
i
should
not
be
helped
so
soon
*punct* ,
but
it
smells
most
excellent
*punct* ,
and
i
cannot
help
beginning
*punct* .
*break*
emma
had
no
opportunity
of
speaking
to
mr.
knightley
till
after
supper
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
when
they
were
all
in
the
ballroom
again
*punct* ,
her
eyes
invited
him
irresistibly
to
come
to
her
and
be
thanked
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
warm
in
his
reprobation
of
mr.
elton's
conduct
*punct* ;
it
had
been
unpardonable
rudeness
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
elton's
looks
also
received
the
due
share
of
censure
*punct* .
*break*
they
aimed
at
wounding
more
than
harriet
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* .
*break*
emma
*punct* ,
why
is
it
that
they
are
your
enemies
*punct* ?
*break*
he
looked
with
smiling
penetration
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
on
receiving
no
answer
*punct* ,
added
*punct* ,
she
ought
not
to
be
angry
with
you
*punct* ,
i
suspect
*punct* ,
whatever
he
may
be.
*punct* ,
to
that
surmise
*punct* ,
you
say
nothing
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ;
but
confess
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
that
you
did
want
him
to
marry
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
*punct* ,
replied
emma
*punct* ,
and
they
cannot
forgive
me
*punct* .
*break*
he
shook
his
head
*punct* ;
but
there
was
a
smile
of
indulgence
with
it
*punct* ,
and
he
only
said
*punct* ,
i
shall
not
scold
you
*punct* .
*break*
i
leave
you
to
your
own
reflections
*punct* .
*break*
can
you
trust
me
with
such
flatterers?
*punct* ,
does
my
vain
spirit
ever
tell
me
i
am
wrong
*punct* ?
*break*
not
your
vain
spirit
*punct* ,
but
your
serious
spirit.
*punct* ,
if
one
leads
you
wrong
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
the
other
tells
you
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
own
myself
to
have
been
completely
mistaken
in
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
a
littleness
about
him
which
you
discovered
*punct* ,
and
which
i
did
not
*punct* :
and
i
was
fully
convinced
of
his
being
in
love
with
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
through
a
series
of
strange
blunders
*punct* !
*break*
and
*punct* ,
in
return
for
your
acknowledging
so
much
*punct* ,
i
will
do
you
the
justice
to
say
*punct* ,
that
you
would
have
chosen
for
him
better
than
he
has
chosen
for
himself.
*punct* ,
harriet
smith
has
some
first-rate
qualities
*punct* ,
which
mrs.
elton
is
totally
without
*punct* .
*break*
an
unpretending
*punct* ,
single-minded
*punct* ,
artless
girl
*punct* ,
infinitely
to
be
preferred
by
any
man
of
sense
and
taste
to
such
a
woman
as
mrs.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
i
found
harriet
more
conversable
than
i
expected
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
extremely
gratified.
*punct* ,
they
were
interrupted
by
the
bustle
of
mr.
weston
calling
on
every
body
to
begin
dancing
again
*punct* .
*break*
come
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
miss
otway
*punct* ,
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
what
are
you
all
doing?
*punct* ,
come
emma
*punct* ,
set
your
companions
the
example
*punct* .
*break*
every
body
is
lazy
*punct* !
*break*
every
body
is
asleep
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
ready
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
whenever
i
am
wanted
*punct* .
*break*
whom
are
you
going
to
dance
with
*punct* ?
*break*
asked
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
she
hesitated
a
moment
*punct* ,
and
then
replied
*punct* ,
with
you
*punct* ,
if
you
will
ask
me
*punct* .
*break*
said
he
*punct* ,
offering
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
i
will
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
shewn
that
you
can
dance
*punct* ,
and
you
know
we
are
not
really
so
much
brother
and
sister
as
to
make
it
at
all
improper
*punct* .
*break*
brother
and
sister
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
this
little
explanation
with
mr.
knightley
gave
emma
considerable
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
one
of
the
agreeable
recollections
of
the
ball
*punct* ,
which
she
walked
about
the
lawn
the
next
morning
to
enjoy.
*punct* ,
she
was
extremely
glad
that
they
had
come
to
so
good
an
understanding
respecting
the
eltons
*punct* ,
and
that
their
opinions
of
both
husband
and
wife
were
so
much
alike
*punct* ;
and
his
praise
of
harriet
*punct* ,
his
concession
in
her
favour
*punct* ,
was
peculiarly
gratifying
*punct* .
*break*
the
impertinence
of
the
eltons
*punct* ,
which
for
a
few
minutes
had
threatened
to
ruin
the
rest
of
her
evening
*punct* ,
had
been
the
occasion
of
some
of
its
highest
satisfactions
*punct* ;
and
she
looked
forward
to
another
happy
result
*punct* ,
the
cure
of
harriet's
infatuation.
*punct* ,
from
harriet's
manner
of
speaking
of
the
circumstance
before
they
quitted
the
ballroom
*punct* ,
she
had
strong
hopes
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
as
if
her
eyes
were
suddenly
opened
*punct* ,
and
she
were
enabled
to
see
that
mr.
elton
was
not
the
superior
creature
she
had
believed
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
fever
was
over
*punct* ,
and
emma
could
harbour
little
fear
of
the
pulse
being
quickened
again
by
injurious
courtesy
*punct* .
*break*
she
depended
on
the
evil
feelings
of
the
eltons
for
supplying
all
the
discipline
of
pointed
neglect
that
could
be
farther
requisite.
*punct* ,
harriet
rational
*punct* ,
frank
churchill
not
too
much
in
love
*punct* ,
and
mr.
knightley
not
wanting
to
quarrel
with
her
*punct* ,
how
very
happy
a
summer
must
be
before
her
*punct* !
*break*
she
was
not
to
see
frank
churchill
this
morning
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
told
her
that
he
could
not
allow
himself
the
pleasure
of
stopping
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
as
he
was
to
be
at
home
by
the
middle
of
the
day
*punct* .
*break*
she
did
not
regret
it
*punct* .
*break*
having
arranged
all
these
matters
*punct* ,
looked
them
through
*punct* ,
and
put
them
all
to
rights
*punct* ,
she
was
just
turning
to
the
house
with
spirits
freshened
up
for
the
demands
of
the
two
little
boys
*punct* ,
as
well
as
of
their
grandpapa
*punct* ,
when
the
great
iron
sweep-gate
opened
*punct* ,
and
two
persons
entered
whom
she
had
never
less
expected
to
see
together
*punct* ,
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
with
harriet
leaning
on
his
arm
*punct* ,
actually
harriet!
*punct* ,
a
moment
sufficed
to
convince
her
that
something
extraordinary
had
happened
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
looked
white
and
frightened
*punct* ,
and
he
was
trying
to
cheer
her.
*punct* ,
the
iron
gates
and
the
front-door
were
not
twenty
yards
asunder;
*punct* ,
they
were
all
three
soon
in
the
hall
*punct* ,
and
harriet
immediately
sinking
into
a
chair
fainted
away
*punct* .
*break*
a
young
lady
who
faints
*punct* ,
must
be
recovered
*punct* ;
questions
must
be
answered
*punct* ,
and
surprizes
be
explained
*punct* .
*break*
such
events
are
very
interesting
*punct* ,
but
the
suspense
of
them
cannot
last
long
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
minutes
made
emma
acquainted
with
the
whole
*punct* .
*break*
miss
smith
*punct* ,
and
miss
bickerton
*punct* ,
another
parlour
boarder
at
mrs.
goddard's
*punct* ,
who
had
been
also
at
the
ball
*punct* ,
had
walked
out
together
*punct* ,
and
taken
a
road
*punct* ,
the
richmond
road
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
though
apparently
public
enough
for
safety
*punct* ,
had
led
them
into
alarm.
*punct* ,
about
half
a
mile
beyond
highbury
*punct* ,
making
a
sudden
turn
*punct* ,
and
deeply
shaded
by
elms
on
each
side
*punct* ,
it
became
for
a
considerable
stretch
very
retired
*punct* ;
and
when
the
young
ladies
had
advanced
some
way
into
it
*punct* ,
they
had
suddenly
perceived
at
a
small
distance
before
them
*punct* ,
on
a
broader
patch
of
greensward
by
the
side
*punct* ,
a
party
of
gipsies
*punct* .
*break*
but
poor
harriet
could
not
follow
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
suffered
very
much
from
cramp
after
dancing
*punct* ,
and
her
first
attempt
to
mount
the
bank
brought
on
such
a
return
of
it
as
made
her
absolutely
powerless
*punct* ,
and
in
this
state
*punct* ,
and
exceedingly
terrified
*punct* ,
she
had
been
obliged
to
remain
*punct* .
*break*
how
the
trampers
might
have
behaved
*punct* ,
had
the
young
ladies
been
more
courageous
*punct* ,
must
be
doubtful
*punct* ;
but
such
an
invitation
for
attack
could
not
be
resisted
*punct* ;
and
harriet
was
soon
assailed
by
half
a
dozen
children
*punct* ,
headed
by
a
stout
woman
and
a
great
boy
*punct* ,
all
clamorous
*punct* ,
and
impertinent
in
look
*punct* ,
though
not
absolutely
in
word.
*punct* ,
more
and
more
frightened
*punct* ,
she
immediately
promised
them
money
*punct* ,
and
taking
out
her
purse
*punct* ,
gave
them
a
shilling
*punct* ,
and
begged
them
not
to
want
more
*punct* ,
or
to
use
her
ill.
*punct* ,
she
was
then
able
to
walk
*punct* ,
though
but
slowly
*punct* ,
and
was
moving
away
*punct* ,
but
her
terror
and
her
purse
were
too
tempting
*punct* ,
and
she
was
followed
*punct* ,
or
rather
surrounded
*punct* ,
by
the
whole
gang
*punct* ,
demanding
more
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
state
frank
churchill
had
found
her
*punct* ,
she
trembling
and
conditioning
*punct* ,
they
loud
and
insolent
*punct* .
*break*
by
a
most
fortunate
chance
his
leaving
highbury
had
been
delayed
so
as
to
bring
him
to
her
assistance
at
this
critical
moment
*punct* .
*break*
the
pleasantness
of
the
morning
had
induced
him
to
walk
forward
*punct* ,
and
leave
his
horses
to
meet
him
by
another
road
*punct* ,
a
mile
or
two
beyond
highbury
*punct* ,
and
happening
to
have
borrowed
a
pair
of
scissors
the
night
before
of
miss
bates
*punct* ,
and
to
have
forgotten
to
restore
them
*punct* ,
he
had
been
obliged
to
stop
at
her
door
*punct* ,
and
go
in
for
a
few
minutes
*punct* :
he
was
therefore
later
than
he
had
intended
*punct* ;
and
being
on
foot
*punct* ,
was
unseen
by
the
whole
party
till
almost
close
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
terror
which
the
woman
and
boy
had
been
creating
in
harriet
was
then
their
own
portion
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
left
them
completely
frightened
*punct* ;
and
harriet
eagerly
clinging
to
him
*punct* ,
and
hardly
able
to
speak
*punct* ,
had
just
strength
enough
to
reach
hartfield
*punct* ,
before
her
spirits
were
quite
overcome
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
his
idea
to
bring
her
to
hartfield
*punct* :
he
had
thought
of
no
other
place
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
the
amount
of
the
whole
story,
*punct* ,
of
his
communication
and
of
harriet's
as
soon
as
she
had
recovered
her
senses
and
speech.
*punct* ,
he
dared
not
stay
longer
than
to
see
her
well
*punct* ;
these
several
delays
left
him
not
another
minute
to
lose
*punct* ;
and
emma
engaging
to
give
assurance
of
her
safety
to
mrs.
goddard
*punct* ,
and
notice
of
there
being
such
a
set
of
people
in
the
neighbourhood
to
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
he
set
off
*punct* ,
with
all
the
grateful
blessings
that
she
could
utter
for
her
friend
and
herself
*punct* .
*break*
such
an
adventure
as
this,
*punct* ,
a
fine
young
man
and
a
lovely
young
woman
thrown
together
in
such
a
way
*punct* ,
could
hardly
fail
of
suggesting
certain
ideas
to
the
coldest
heart
and
the
steadiest
brain
*punct* .
*break*
so
emma
thought
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* .
*break*
could
a
linguist
*punct* ,
could
a
grammarian
*punct* ,
could
even
a
mathematician
have
seen
what
she
did
*punct* ,
have
witnessed
their
appearance
together
*punct* ,
and
heard
their
history
of
it
*punct* ,
without
feeling
that
circumstances
had
been
at
work
to
make
them
peculiarly
interesting
to
each
other?
*punct* ,
how
much
more
must
an
imaginist
*punct* ,
like
herself
*punct* ,
be
on
fire
with
speculation
and
foresight!
*punct* ,
especially
with
such
a
groundwork
of
anticipation
as
her
mind
had
already
made
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
very
extraordinary
thing
*punct* !
*break*
nothing
of
the
sort
had
ever
occurred
before
to
any
young
ladies
in
the
place
*punct* ,
within
her
memory
*punct* ;
no
rencontre
*punct* ,
no
alarm
of
the
kind;
*punct* ,
and
now
it
had
happened
to
the
very
person
*punct* ,
and
at
the
very
hour
*punct* ,
when
the
other
very
person
was
chancing
to
pass
by
to
rescue
her!
*punct* ,
it
certainly
was
very
extraordinary!
*punct* ,
and
knowing
*punct* ,
as
she
did
*punct* ,
the
favourable
state
of
mind
of
each
at
this
period
*punct* ,
it
struck
her
the
more
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
wishing
to
get
the
better
of
his
attachment
to
herself
*punct* ,
she
just
recovering
from
her
mania
for
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
as
if
every
thing
united
to
promise
the
most
interesting
consequences
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
possible
that
the
occurrence
should
not
be
strongly
recommending
each
to
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
few
minutes
conversation
which
she
had
yet
had
with
him
*punct* ,
while
harriet
had
been
partially
insensible
*punct* ,
he
had
spoken
of
her
terror
*punct* ,
her
naivete
*punct* ,
her
fervour
as
she
seized
and
clung
to
his
arm
*punct* ,
with
a
sensibility
amused
and
delighted
*punct* ;
and
just
at
last
*punct* ,
after
harriet's
own
account
had
been
given
*punct* ,
he
had
expressed
his
indignation
at
the
abominable
folly
of
miss
bickerton
in
the
warmest
terms
*punct* .
*break*
every
thing
was
to
take
its
natural
course
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
neither
impelled
nor
assisted
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
not
stir
a
step
*punct* ,
nor
drop
a
hint
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
she
had
had
enough
of
interference
*punct* .
*break*
there
could
be
no
harm
in
a
scheme
*punct* ,
a
mere
passive
scheme
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
no
more
than
a
wish
*punct* .
*break*
beyond
it
she
would
on
no
account
proceed
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
first
resolution
was
to
keep
her
father
from
the
knowledge
of
what
had
passed,
*punct* ,
aware
of
the
anxiety
and
alarm
it
would
occasion
*punct* :
but
she
soon
felt
that
concealment
must
be
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
within
half
an
hour
it
was
known
all
over
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
very
event
to
engage
those
who
talk
most
*punct* ,
the
young
and
the
low
*punct* ;
and
all
the
youth
and
servants
in
the
place
were
soon
in
the
happiness
of
frightful
news
*punct* .
*break*
the
last
night's
ball
seemed
lost
in
the
gipsies
*punct* .
*break*
poor
mr.
woodhouse
trembled
as
he
sat
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
emma
had
foreseen
*punct* ,
would
scarcely
be
satisfied
without
their
promising
never
to
go
beyond
the
shrubbery
again
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
some
comfort
to
him
that
many
inquiries
after
himself
and
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
for
his
neighbours
knew
that
he
loved
to
be
inquired
after
*punct* ,
as
well
as
miss
smith
*punct* ,
were
coming
in
during
the
rest
of
the
day
*punct* ;
and
he
had
the
pleasure
of
returning
for
answer
*punct* ,
that
they
were
all
very
indifferent
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
though
not
exactly
true
*punct* ,
for
she
was
perfectly
well
*punct* ,
and
harriet
not
much
otherwise
*punct* ,
emma
would
not
interfere
with
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
an
unhappy
state
of
health
in
general
for
the
child
of
such
a
man
*punct* ,
for
she
hardly
knew
what
indisposition
was
*punct* ;
and
if
he
did
not
invent
illnesses
for
her
*punct* ,
she
could
make
no
figure
in
a
message
*punct* .
*break*
the
gipsies
did
not
wait
for
the
operations
of
justice
*punct* ;
they
took
themselves
off
in
a
hurry
*punct* .
*break*
the
young
ladies
of
highbury
might
have
walked
again
in
safety
before
their
panic
began
*punct* ,
and
the
whole
history
dwindled
soon
into
a
matter
of
little
importance
but
to
emma
and
her
nephews:
*punct* ,
in
her
imagination
it
maintained
its
ground
*punct* ,
and
henry
and
john
were
still
asking
every
day
for
the
story
of
harriet
and
the
gipsies
*punct* ,
and
still
tenaciously
setting
her
right
if
she
varied
in
the
slightest
particular
from
the
original
recital
*punct* .
*break*
a
very
few
days
had
passed
after
this
adventure
*punct* ,
when
harriet
came
one
morning
to
emma
with
a
small
parcel
in
her
hand
*punct* ,
and
after
sitting
down
and
hesitating
*punct* ,
thus
began
*punct* :
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
if
you
are
at
leisure
*punct* ,
i
have
something
that
i
should
like
to
tell
you
*punct* ,
a
sort
of
confession
to
make
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
it
will
be
over
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
a
good
deal
surprized
*punct* ;
but
begged
her
to
speak
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
seriousness
in
harriet's
manner
which
prepared
her
*punct* ,
quite
as
much
as
her
words
*punct* ,
for
something
more
than
ordinary
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
my
duty
*punct* ,
and
i
am
sure
it
is
my
wish
*punct* ,
she
continued
*punct* ,
to
have
no
reserves
with
you
on
this
subject
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
am
happily
quite
an
altered
creature
in
one
respect
*punct* ,
it
is
very
fit
that
you
should
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
want
to
say
more
than
is
necessary
*punct* ,
i
am
too
much
ashamed
of
having
given
way
as
i
have
done
*punct* ,
and
i
dare
say
you
understand
me
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
i
hope
i
do
*punct* .
*break*
how
i
could
so
long
a
time
be
fancying
myself!
*punct* ...
cried
harriet
*punct* ,
warmly
*punct* .
*break*
it
seems
like
madness
*punct* !
*break*
cannot
you
guess
what
this
parcel
holds
*punct* ?
*break*
said
she
*punct* ,
with
a
conscious
look
*punct* .
*break*
not
the
least
in
the
world.
*punct* ,
did
he
ever
give
you
any
thing
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
cannot
call
them
gifts
*punct* ;
but
they
are
things
that
i
have
valued
very
much
*punct* .
*break*
she
held
the
parcel
towards
her
*punct* ,
and
emma
read
the
words
most
precious
treasures
on
the
top
*punct* .
*break*
her
curiosity
was
greatly
excited
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
unfolded
the
parcel
*punct* ,
and
she
looked
on
with
impatience
*punct* .
*break*
within
abundance
of
silver
paper
was
a
pretty
little
tunbridge-ware
box
*punct* ,
which
harriet
opened
*punct* :
it
was
well
lined
with
the
softest
cotton
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
excepting
the
cotton
*punct* ,
emma
saw
only
a
small
piece
of
court-plaister
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
said
harriet
*punct* ,
you
must
recollect
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
indeed
i
do
not
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
you
could
forget
what
passed
in
this
very
room
about
court-plaister
*punct* ,
one
of
the
very
last
times
we
ever
met
in
it!
*punct* ,
it
was
but
a
very
few
days
before
i
had
my
sore
throat
*punct* ,
just
before
mr.
and
mrs.
john
knightley
came
*punct* ,
i
think
the
very
evening.
*punct* ,
do
not
you
remember
his
cutting
his
finger
with
your
new
penknife
*punct* ,
and
your
recommending
court-plaister?
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
as
you
had
none
about
you
*punct* ,
and
knew
i
had
*punct* ,
you
desired
me
to
supply
him
*punct* ;
and
so
i
took
mine
out
and
cut
him
a
piece
*punct* ;
but
it
was
a
great
deal
too
large
*punct* ,
and
he
cut
it
smaller
*punct* ,
and
kept
playing
some
time
with
what
was
left
*punct* ,
before
he
gave
it
back
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
then
*punct* ,
in
my
nonsense
*punct* ,
i
could
not
help
making
a
treasure
of
it
*punct* ,
so
i
put
it
by
never
to
be
used
*punct* ,
and
looked
at
it
now
and
then
as
a
great
treat
*punct* .
*break*
my
dearest
harriet
*punct* !
*break*
cried
emma
*punct* ,
putting
her
hand
before
her
face
*punct* ,
and
jumping
up
*punct* ,
you
make
me
more
ashamed
of
myself
than
i
can
bear
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
i
remember
it
all
now
*punct* ;
all
*punct* ,
except
your
saving
this
relic
*punct* ,
i
knew
nothing
of
that
till
this
moment
*punct* ,
but
the
cutting
the
finger
*punct* ,
and
my
recommending
court-plaister
*punct* ,
and
saying
i
had
none
about
me!
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
my
sins
*punct* ,
my
sins!
*punct* ,
and
i
had
plenty
all
the
while
in
my
pocket!
*punct* ,
one
of
my
senseless
tricks!
*punct* ,
i
deserve
to
be
under
a
continual
blush
all
the
rest
of
my
life.
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
sitting
down
again
*punct* ,
go
on
*punct* ,
what
else
*punct* ?
*break*
and
had
you
really
some
at
hand
yourself
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
sure
i
never
suspected
it
*punct* ,
you
did
it
so
naturally
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
you
actually
put
this
piece
of
court-plaister
by
for
his
sake
*punct* !
*break*
said
emma
*punct* ,
recovering
from
her
state
of
shame
and
feeling
divided
between
wonder
and
amusement
*punct* .
*break*
and
secretly
she
added
to
herself
*punct* ,
lord
bless
me
*punct* !
*break*
when
should
i
ever
have
thought
of
putting
by
in
cotton
a
piece
of
court-plaister
that
frank
churchill
had
been
pulling
about
*punct* !
*break*
i
never
was
equal
to
this
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
resumed
harriet
*punct* ,
turning
to
her
box
again
*punct* ,
here
is
something
still
more
valuable
*punct* ,
i
mean
that
has
been
more
valuable
*punct* ,
because
this
is
what
did
really
once
belong
to
him
*punct* ,
which
the
court-plaister
never
did
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
quite
eager
to
see
this
superior
treasure
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
end
of
an
old
pencil,
*punct* ,
the
part
without
any
lead
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
really
his
*punct* ,
said
harriet.
*punct* ,
do
not
you
remember
one
morning?
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
you
do
not
*punct* .
*break*
but
one
morning
*punct* ,
i
forget
exactly
the
day
*punct* ,
but
perhaps
it
was
the
tuesday
or
wednesday
before
that
evening
*punct* ,
he
wanted
to
make
a
memorandum
in
his
pocket-book
*punct* ;
it
was
about
spruce-beer
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
had
been
telling
him
something
about
brewing
spruce-beer
*punct* ,
and
he
wanted
to
put
it
down
*punct* ;
but
when
he
took
out
his
pencil
*punct* ,
there
was
so
little
lead
that
he
soon
cut
it
all
away
*punct* ,
and
it
would
not
do
*punct* ,
so
you
lent
him
another
*punct* ,
and
this
was
left
upon
the
table
as
good
for
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
kept
my
eye
on
it
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
i
dared
*punct* ,
caught
it
up
*punct* ,
and
never
parted
with
it
again
from
that
moment
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
remember
it
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* ;
i
perfectly
remember
it.
*punct* ,
talking
about
spruce-beer.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
and
i
both
saying
we
liked
it
*punct* ,
and
mr.
elton's
seeming
resolved
to
learn
to
like
it
too
*punct* .
*break*
i
perfectly
remember
it.
*punct* ,
stop
*punct* ;
mr.
knightley
was
standing
just
here
*punct* ,
was
not
he
*punct* ?
*break*
i
have
an
idea
he
was
standing
just
here
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
recollect.
*punct* ,
it
is
very
odd
*punct* ,
but
i
cannot
recollect.
*punct* ,
mr.
elton
was
sitting
here
*punct* ,
i
remember
*punct* ,
much
about
where
i
am
now.
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
go
on
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
nothing
more
to
shew
you
*punct* ,
or
to
say
*punct* ,
except
that
i
am
now
going
to
throw
them
both
behind
the
fire
*punct* ,
and
i
wish
you
to
see
me
do
it
*punct* .
*break*
my
poor
dear
harriet
*punct* !
*break*
and
have
you
actually
found
happiness
in
treasuring
up
these
things
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
simpleton
as
i
was!
*punct* ,
but
i
am
quite
ashamed
of
it
now
*punct* ,
and
wish
i
could
forget
as
easily
as
i
can
burn
them
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
very
wrong
of
me
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
to
keep
any
remembrances
*punct* ,
after
he
was
married
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
it
was
*punct* ,
but
had
not
resolution
enough
to
part
with
them
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
is
it
necessary
to
burn
the
court-plaister?
*punct* ,
i
have
not
a
word
to
say
for
the
bit
of
old
pencil
*punct* ,
but
the
court-plaister
might
be
useful
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
be
happier
to
burn
it
*punct* ,
replied
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
a
disagreeable
look
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
get
rid
of
every
thing.
*punct* ,
there
it
goes
*punct* ,
and
there
is
an
end
*punct* ,
thank
heaven
*punct* !
*break*
of
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
*punct* ,
thought
emma
*punct* ,
will
there
be
a
beginning
of
mr.
churchill
*punct* ?
*break*
she
had
soon
afterwards
reason
to
believe
that
the
beginning
was
already
made
*punct* ,
and
could
not
but
hope
that
the
gipsy
*punct* ,
though
she
had
told
no
fortune
*punct* ,
might
be
proved
to
have
made
harriet's.
*punct* ,
about
a
fortnight
after
the
alarm
*punct* ,
they
came
to
a
sufficient
explanation
*punct* ,
and
quite
undesignedly
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
not
thinking
of
it
at
the
moment
*punct* ,
which
made
the
information
she
received
more
valuable
*punct* .
*break*
she
merely
said
*punct* ,
in
the
course
of
some
trivial
chat
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
whenever
you
marry
i
would
advise
you
to
do
so
and
so
*punct* ,
and
thought
no
more
of
it
*punct* ,
till
after
a
minute's
silence
she
heard
harriet
say
in
a
very
serious
tone
*punct* ,
i
shall
never
marry
*punct* .
*break*
emma
then
looked
up
*punct* ,
and
immediately
saw
how
it
was
*punct* ;
and
after
a
moment's
debate
*punct* ,
as
to
whether
it
should
pass
unnoticed
or
not
*punct* ,
replied
*punct* ,
never
marry!
*punct* ,
this
is
a
new
resolution
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
one
that
i
shall
never
change
*punct* ,
however
*punct* .
*break*
after
another
short
hesitation
*punct* ,
i
hope
it
does
not
proceed
from
*punct* ,
i
hope
it
is
not
in
compliment
to
mr.
elton
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
elton
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
cried
harriet
indignantly.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
and
emma
could
just
catch
the
words
*punct* ,
so
superior
to
mr.
elton
*punct* !
*break*
she
then
took
a
longer
time
for
consideration
*punct* .
*break*
should
she
proceed
no
farther?
*punct* ,
should
she
let
it
pass
*punct* ,
and
seem
to
suspect
nothing?
*punct* ,
perhaps
harriet
might
think
her
cold
or
angry
if
she
did
*punct* ;
or
perhaps
if
she
were
totally
silent
*punct* ,
it
might
only
drive
harriet
into
asking
her
to
hear
too
much
*punct* ;
and
against
any
thing
like
such
an
unreserve
as
had
been
*punct* ,
such
an
open
and
frequent
discussion
of
hopes
and
chances
*punct* ,
she
was
perfectly
resolved.
*punct* ,
she
believed
it
would
be
wiser
for
her
to
say
and
know
at
once
*punct* ,
all
that
she
meant
to
say
and
know
*punct* .
*break*
plain
dealing
was
always
best
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
previously
determined
how
far
she
would
proceed
*punct* ,
on
any
application
of
the
sort
*punct* ;
and
it
would
be
safer
for
both
*punct* ,
to
have
the
judicious
law
of
her
own
brain
laid
down
with
speed.
*punct* ,
she
was
decided
*punct* ,
and
thus
spoke
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
i
will
not
affect
to
be
in
doubt
of
your
meaning
*punct* .
*break*
your
resolution
*punct* ,
or
rather
your
expectation
of
never
marrying
*punct* ,
results
from
an
idea
that
the
person
whom
you
might
prefer
*punct* ,
would
be
too
greatly
your
superior
in
situation
to
think
of
you
*punct* .
*break*
is
not
it
so
*punct* ?
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
believe
me
i
have
not
the
presumption
to
suppose
*punct* ,
indeed
i
am
not
so
mad.
*punct* ,
but
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
to
admire
him
at
a
distance
*punct* ,
and
to
think
of
his
infinite
superiority
to
all
the
rest
of
the
world
*punct* ,
with
the
gratitude
*punct* ,
wonder
*punct* ,
and
veneration
*punct* ,
which
are
so
proper
*punct* ,
in
me
especially
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
at
all
surprized
at
you
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
the
service
he
rendered
you
was
enough
to
warm
your
heart
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
such
an
inexpressible
obligation!
*punct* ,
the
very
recollection
of
it
*punct* ,
and
all
that
i
felt
at
the
time
*punct* ,
when
i
saw
him
coming
*punct* ,
his
noble
look
*punct* ,
and
my
wretchedness
before
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
change
*punct* !
*break*
in
one
moment
such
a
change
*punct* !
*break*
from
perfect
misery
to
perfect
happiness
*punct* !
*break*
it
is
very
natural
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
natural
*punct* ,
and
it
is
honourable.
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
honourable
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
to
chuse
so
well
and
so
gratefully.
*punct* ,
but
that
it
will
be
a
fortunate
preference
is
more
that
i
can
promise
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
advise
you
to
give
way
to
it
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
by
any
means
engage
for
its
being
returned
*punct* .
*break*
consider
what
you
are
about
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
it
will
be
wisest
in
you
to
check
your
feelings
while
you
can
*punct* :
at
any
rate
do
not
let
them
carry
you
far
*punct* ,
unless
you
are
persuaded
of
his
liking
you
*punct* .
*break*
be
observant
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
let
his
behaviour
be
the
guide
of
your
sensations
*punct* .
*break*
i
give
you
this
caution
now
*punct* ,
because
i
shall
never
speak
to
you
again
on
the
subject
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
determined
against
all
interference
*punct* .
*break*
henceforward
i
know
nothing
of
the
matter
*punct* .
*break*
let
no
name
ever
pass
our
lips
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
very
wrong
before
*punct* ;
we
will
be
cautious
now.
*punct* ,
he
is
your
superior
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* ,
and
there
do
seem
objections
and
obstacles
of
a
very
serious
nature
*punct* ;
but
yet
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
more
wonderful
things
have
taken
place
*punct* ,
there
have
been
matches
of
greater
disparity
*punct* .
*break*
but
take
care
of
yourself
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
not
have
you
too
sanguine
*punct* ;
though
*punct* ,
however
it
may
end
*punct* ,
be
assured
your
raising
your
thoughts
to
him
*punct* ,
is
a
mark
of
good
taste
which
i
shall
always
know
how
to
value
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
kissed
her
hand
in
silent
and
submissive
gratitude
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
very
decided
in
thinking
such
an
attachment
no
bad
thing
for
her
friend
*punct* .
*break*
its
tendency
would
be
to
raise
and
refine
her
mind
*punct* ,
and
it
must
be
saving
her
from
the
danger
of
degradation
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
state
of
schemes
*punct* ,
and
hopes
*punct* ,
and
connivance
*punct* ,
june
opened
upon
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
to
highbury
in
general
it
brought
no
material
change
*punct* .
*break*
the
eltons
were
still
talking
of
a
visit
from
the
sucklings
*punct* ,
and
of
the
use
to
be
made
of
their
barouche-landau
*punct* ;
and
jane
fairfax
was
still
at
her
grandmother's
*punct* ;
and
as
the
return
of
the
campbells
from
ireland
was
again
delayed
*punct* ,
and
august
*punct* ,
instead
of
midsummer
*punct* ,
fixed
for
it
*punct* ,
she
was
likely
to
remain
there
full
two
months
longer
*punct* ,
provided
at
least
she
were
able
to
defeat
mrs.
elton's
activity
in
her
service
*punct* ,
and
save
herself
from
being
hurried
into
a
delightful
situation
against
her
will
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
for
some
reason
best
known
to
himself
*punct* ,
had
certainly
taken
an
early
dislike
to
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
was
only
growing
to
dislike
him
more
*punct* .
*break*
he
began
to
suspect
him
of
some
double
dealing
in
his
pursuit
of
emma
*punct* .
*break*
that
emma
was
his
object
appeared
indisputable
*punct* .
*break*
every
thing
declared
it
*punct* ;
his
own
attentions
*punct* ,
his
father's
hints
*punct* ,
his
mother-in-law's
guarded
silence
*punct* ;
it
was
all
in
unison
*punct* ;
words
*punct* ,
conduct
*punct* ,
discretion
*punct* ,
and
indiscretion
*punct* ,
told
the
same
story
*punct* .
*break*
but
while
so
many
were
devoting
him
to
emma
*punct* ,
and
emma
herself
making
him
over
to
harriet
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
began
to
suspect
him
of
some
inclination
to
trifle
with
jane
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
understand
it
*punct* ;
but
there
were
symptoms
of
intelligence
between
them
*punct* ,
he
thought
so
at
least
*punct* ,
symptoms
of
admiration
on
his
side
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
having
once
observed
*punct* ,
he
could
not
persuade
himself
to
think
entirely
void
of
meaning
*punct* ,
however
he
might
wish
to
escape
any
of
emma's
errors
of
imagination
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
not
present
when
the
suspicion
first
arose
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
dining
with
the
randalls
family
*punct* ,
and
jane
*punct* ,
at
the
eltons'
*punct* ;
and
he
had
seen
a
look
*punct* ,
more
than
a
single
look
*punct* ,
at
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
from
the
admirer
of
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
seemed
somewhat
out
of
place
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
was
again
in
their
company
*punct* ,
he
could
not
help
remembering
what
he
had
seen
*punct* ;
nor
could
he
avoid
observations
which
*punct* ,
unless
it
were
like
cowper
and
his
fire
at
twilight
*punct* ,
myself
creating
what
i
saw
*punct* ,
brought
him
yet
stronger
suspicion
of
there
being
a
something
of
private
liking
*punct* ,
of
private
understanding
even
*punct* ,
between
frank
churchill
and
jane
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
walked
up
one
day
after
dinner
*punct* ,
as
he
very
often
did
*punct* ,
to
spend
his
evening
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
emma
and
harriet
were
going
to
walk
*punct* ;
he
joined
them
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
on
returning
*punct* ,
they
fell
in
with
a
larger
party
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
like
themselves
*punct* ,
judged
it
wisest
to
take
their
exercise
early
*punct* ,
as
the
weather
threatened
rain
*punct* ;
mr.
and
mrs.
weston
and
their
son
*punct* ,
miss
bates
and
her
niece
*punct* ,
who
had
accidentally
met
*punct* .
*break*
they
all
united
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
on
reaching
hartfield
gates
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
who
knew
it
was
exactly
the
sort
of
visiting
that
would
be
welcome
to
her
father
*punct* ,
pressed
them
all
to
go
in
and
drink
tea
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
randalls
party
agreed
to
it
immediately
*punct* ;
and
after
a
pretty
long
speech
from
miss
bates
*punct* ,
which
few
persons
listened
to
*punct* ,
she
also
found
it
possible
to
accept
dear
miss
woodhouse's
most
obliging
invitation
*punct* .
*break*
as
they
were
turning
into
the
grounds
*punct* ,
mr.
perry
passed
by
on
horseback
*punct* .
*break*
the
gentlemen
spoke
of
his
horse
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
bye
*punct* ,
said
frank
churchill
to
mrs.
weston
presently
*punct* ,
what
became
of
mr.
perry's
plan
of
setting
up
his
carriage
*punct* ?
*break*
mrs.
weston
looked
surprized
*punct* ,
and
said
*punct* ,
i
did
not
know
that
he
ever
had
any
such
plan
*punct* .
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
i
had
it
from
you
*punct* .
*break*
you
wrote
me
word
of
it
three
months
ago
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
you
did
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
it
perfectly
*punct* .
*break*
you
mentioned
it
as
what
was
certainly
to
be
very
soon
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
perry
had
told
somebody
*punct* ,
and
was
extremely
happy
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
owing
to
her
persuasion
*punct* ,
as
she
thought
his
being
out
in
bad
weather
did
him
a
great
deal
of
harm
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
remember
it
now
*punct* ?
*break*
upon
my
word
i
never
heard
of
it
till
this
moment
*punct* .
*break*
really
*punct* ,
never!
*punct* ,
bless
me
*punct* !
*break*
how
could
it
be?
*punct* ,
then
i
must
have
dreamt
it
*punct* ,
but
i
was
completely
persuaded
*punct* ,
miss
smith
*punct* ,
you
walk
as
if
you
were
tired
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
not
be
sorry
to
find
yourself
at
home
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
this?
*punct* ,
what
is
this
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
about
perry
and
a
carriage
*punct* ?
*break*
is
perry
going
to
set
up
his
carriage
*punct* ,
frank
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
glad
he
can
afford
it
*punct* .
*break*
you
had
it
from
himself
*punct* ,
had
you
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
replied
his
son
*punct* ,
laughing
*punct* ,
i
seem
to
have
had
it
from
nobody.
*punct* ,
very
odd!
*punct* ,
i
really
was
persuaded
of
mrs.
weston's
having
mentioned
it
in
one
of
her
letters
to
enscombe
*punct* ,
many
weeks
ago
*punct* ,
with
all
these
particulars
*punct* ,
but
as
she
declares
she
never
heard
a
syllable
of
it
before
*punct* ,
of
course
it
must
have
been
a
dream
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
a
great
dreamer
*punct* .
*break*
i
dream
of
every
body
at
highbury
when
i
am
away
*punct* ,
and
when
i
have
gone
through
my
particular
friends
*punct* ,
then
i
begin
dreaming
of
mr.
and
mrs.
perry
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
odd
though
*punct* ,
observed
his
father
*punct* ,
that
you
should
have
had
such
a
regular
connected
dream
about
people
whom
it
was
not
very
likely
you
should
be
thinking
of
at
enscombe
*punct* .
*break*
perry's
setting
up
his
carriage
*punct* !
*break*
and
his
wife's
persuading
him
to
it
*punct* ,
out
of
care
for
his
health
*punct* ,
just
what
will
happen
*punct* ,
i
have
no
doubt
*punct* ,
some
time
or
other
*punct* ;
only
a
little
premature
*punct* .
*break*
what
an
air
of
probability
sometimes
runs
through
a
dream
*punct* !
*break*
and
at
others
*punct* ,
what
a
heap
of
absurdities
it
is
*punct* !
*break*
well
*punct* ,
frank
*punct* ,
your
dream
certainly
shews
that
highbury
is
in
your
thoughts
when
you
are
absent
*punct* .
*break*
emma
*punct* ,
you
are
a
great
dreamer
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ?
*break*
emma
was
out
of
hearing
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
hurried
on
before
her
guests
to
prepare
her
father
for
their
appearance
*punct* ,
and
was
beyond
the
reach
of
mr.
weston's
hint
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
to
own
the
truth
*punct* ,
cried
miss
bates
*punct* ,
who
had
been
trying
in
vain
to
be
heard
the
last
two
minutes
*punct* ,
if
i
must
speak
on
this
subject
*punct* ,
there
is
no
denying
that
mr.
frank
churchill
might
have
*punct* ,
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
he
did
not
dream
it
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
i
have
sometimes
the
oddest
dreams
in
the
world
*punct* ,
but
if
i
am
questioned
about
it
*punct* ,
i
must
acknowledge
that
there
was
such
an
idea
last
spring
*punct* ;
for
mrs.
perry
herself
mentioned
it
to
my
mother
*punct* ,
and
the
coles
knew
of
it
as
well
as
ourselves
*punct* ,
but
it
was
quite
a
secret
*punct* ,
known
to
nobody
else
*punct* ,
and
only
thought
of
about
three
days
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
perry
was
very
anxious
that
he
should
have
a
carriage
*punct* ,
and
came
to
my
mother
in
great
spirits
one
morning
because
she
thought
she
had
prevailed
*punct* .
*break*
jane
*punct* ,
don't
you
remember
grandmama's
telling
us
of
it
when
we
got
home
*punct* ?
*break*
i
forget
where
we
had
been
walking
to
*punct* ,
very
likely
to
randalls
*punct* ;
yes
*punct* ,
i
think
it
was
to
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
perry
was
always
particularly
fond
of
my
mother
*punct* ,
indeed
i
do
not
know
who
is
not
*punct* ,
and
she
had
mentioned
it
to
her
in
confidence
*punct* ;
she
had
no
objection
to
her
telling
us
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
but
it
was
not
to
go
beyond
*punct* :
and
*punct* ,
from
that
day
to
this
*punct* ,
i
never
mentioned
it
to
a
soul
that
i
know
of
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
same
time
*punct* ,
i
will
not
positively
answer
for
my
having
never
dropt
a
hint
*punct* ,
because
i
know
i
do
sometimes
pop
out
a
thing
before
i
am
aware
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
a
talker
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ;
i
am
rather
a
talker
*punct* ;
and
now
and
then
i
have
let
a
thing
escape
me
which
i
should
not
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
like
jane
*punct* ;
i
wish
i
were
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
answer
for
it
she
never
betrayed
the
least
thing
in
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
she?
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
perfectly
remember
mrs.
perry's
coming.
*punct* ,
extraordinary
dream
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
they
were
entering
the
hall
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley's
eyes
had
preceded
miss
bates's
in
a
glance
at
jane
*punct* .
*break*
from
frank
churchill's
face
*punct* ,
where
he
thought
he
saw
confusion
suppressed
or
laughed
away
*punct* ,
he
had
involuntarily
turned
to
hers
*punct* ;
but
she
was
indeed
behind
*punct* ,
and
too
busy
with
her
shawl
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
had
walked
in
*punct* .
*break*
the
two
other
gentlemen
waited
at
the
door
to
let
her
pass
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
suspected
in
frank
churchill
the
determination
of
catching
her
eye
*punct* ,
he
seemed
watching
her
intently
*punct* ,
in
vain
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
if
it
were
so
*punct* ,
jane
passed
between
them
into
the
hall
*punct* ,
and
looked
at
neither
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
time
for
farther
remark
or
explanation
*punct* .
*break*
the
dream
must
be
borne
with
*punct* ,
and
mr.
knightley
must
take
his
seat
with
the
rest
round
the
large
modern
circular
table
which
emma
had
introduced
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
and
which
none
but
emma
could
have
had
power
to
place
there
and
persuade
her
father
to
use
*punct* ,
instead
of
the
small-sized
pembroke
*punct* ,
on
which
two
of
his
daily
meals
had
*punct* ,
for
forty
years
been
crowded
*punct* .
*break*
tea
passed
pleasantly
*punct* ,
and
nobody
seemed
in
a
hurry
to
move
*punct* .
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
said
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
after
examining
a
table
behind
him
*punct* ,
which
he
could
reach
as
he
sat
*punct* ,
have
your
nephews
taken
away
their
alphabets
*punct* ,
their
box
of
letters
*punct* ?
*break*
it
used
to
stand
here
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
this
is
a
sort
of
dull-looking
evening
*punct* ,
that
ought
to
be
treated
rather
as
winter
than
summer
*punct* .
*break*
we
had
great
amusement
with
those
letters
one
morning
*punct* .
*break*
i
want
to
puzzle
you
again
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
pleased
with
the
thought
*punct* ;
and
producing
the
box
*punct* ,
the
table
was
quickly
scattered
over
with
alphabets
*punct* ,
which
no
one
seemed
so
much
disposed
to
employ
as
their
two
selves
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
rapidly
forming
words
for
each
other
*punct* ,
or
for
any
body
else
who
would
be
puzzled
*punct* .
*break*
the
quietness
of
the
game
made
it
particularly
eligible
for
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
who
had
often
been
distressed
by
the
more
animated
sort
*punct* ,
which
mr.
weston
had
occasionally
introduced
*punct* ,
and
who
now
sat
happily
occupied
in
lamenting
*punct* ,
with
tender
melancholy
*punct* ,
over
the
departure
of
the
poor
little
boys
*punct* ,
or
in
fondly
pointing
out
*punct* ,
as
he
took
up
any
stray
letter
near
him
*punct* ,
how
beautifully
emma
had
written
it
*punct* .
*break*
frank
churchill
placed
a
word
before
miss
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
she
gave
a
slight
glance
round
the
table
*punct* ,
and
applied
herself
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
frank
was
next
to
emma
*punct* ,
jane
opposite
to
them
*punct* ,
and
mr.
knightley
so
placed
as
to
see
them
all
*punct* ;
and
it
was
his
object
to
see
as
much
as
he
could
*punct* ,
with
as
little
apparent
observation
*punct* .
*break*
the
word
was
discovered
*punct* ,
and
with
a
faint
smile
pushed
away
*punct* .
*break*
if
meant
to
be
immediately
mixed
with
the
others
*punct* ,
and
buried
from
sight
*punct* ,
she
should
have
looked
on
the
table
instead
of
looking
just
across
*punct* ,
for
it
was
not
mixed
*punct* ;
and
harriet
*punct* ,
eager
after
every
fresh
word
*punct* ,
and
finding
out
none
*punct* ,
directly
took
it
up
*punct* ,
and
fell
to
work
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
sitting
by
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
and
turned
to
him
for
help
*punct* .
*break*
the
word
was
blunder
*punct* ;
and
as
harriet
exultingly
proclaimed
it
*punct* ,
there
was
a
blush
on
jane's
cheek
which
gave
it
a
meaning
not
otherwise
ostensible
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
connected
it
with
the
dream
*punct* ;
but
how
it
could
all
be
*punct* ,
was
beyond
his
comprehension
*punct* .
*break*
how
the
delicacy
*punct* ,
the
discretion
of
his
favourite
could
have
been
so
lain
asleep
*punct* !
*break*
he
feared
there
must
be
some
decided
involvement
*punct* .
*break*
disingenuousness
and
double
dealing
seemed
to
meet
him
at
every
turn
*punct* .
*break*
these
letters
were
but
the
vehicle
for
gallantry
and
trick
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
child's
play
*punct* ,
chosen
to
conceal
a
deeper
game
on
frank
churchill's
part
*punct* .
*break*
with
great
indignation
did
he
continue
to
observe
him
*punct* ;
with
great
alarm
and
distrust
*punct* ,
to
observe
also
his
two
blinded
companions
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
a
short
word
prepared
for
emma
*punct* ,
and
given
to
her
with
a
look
sly
and
demure
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
that
emma
had
soon
made
it
out
*punct* ,
and
found
it
highly
entertaining
*punct* ,
though
it
was
something
which
she
judged
it
proper
to
appear
to
censure
*punct* ;
for
she
said
*punct* ,
nonsense
*punct* !
*break*
he
heard
frank
churchill
next
say
*punct* ,
with
a
glance
towards
jane
*punct* ,
i
will
give
it
to
her
*punct* ,
shall
i?
*punct* ,
and
as
clearly
heard
emma
opposing
it
with
eager
laughing
warmth
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
you
must
not
*punct* ;
you
shall
not
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
done
however
*punct* .
*break*
this
gallant
young
man
*punct* ,
who
seemed
to
love
without
feeling
*punct* ,
and
to
recommend
himself
without
complaisance
*punct* ,
directly
handed
over
the
word
to
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
and
with
a
particular
degree
of
sedate
civility
entreated
her
to
study
it
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley's
excessive
curiosity
to
know
what
this
word
might
be
*punct* ,
made
him
seize
every
possible
moment
for
darting
his
eye
towards
it
*punct* ,
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
saw
it
to
be
dixon
*punct* .
*break*
jane
fairfax's
perception
seemed
to
accompany
his
*punct* ;
her
comprehension
was
certainly
more
equal
to
the
covert
meaning
*punct* ,
the
superior
intelligence
*punct* ,
of
those
five
letters
so
arranged
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
evidently
displeased
*punct* ;
looked
up
*punct* ,
and
seeing
herself
watched
*punct* ,
blushed
more
deeply
than
he
had
ever
perceived
her
*punct* ,
and
saying
only
*punct* ,
i
did
not
know
that
proper
names
were
allowed
*punct* ,
pushed
away
the
letters
with
even
an
angry
spirit
*punct* ,
and
looked
resolved
to
be
engaged
by
no
other
word
that
could
be
offered
*punct* .
*break*
her
face
was
averted
from
those
who
had
made
the
attack
*punct* ,
and
turned
towards
her
aunt
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
very
true
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
cried
the
latter
*punct* ,
though
jane
had
not
spoken
a
word
*punct* ,
i
was
just
going
to
say
the
same
thing
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
time
for
us
to
be
going
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
the
evening
is
closing
in
*punct* ,
and
grandmama
will
be
looking
for
us
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
you
are
too
obliging
*punct* .
*break*
we
really
must
wish
you
good
night
*punct* .
*break*
jane's
alertness
in
moving
*punct* ,
proved
her
as
ready
as
her
aunt
had
preconceived
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
immediately
up
*punct* ,
and
wanting
to
quit
the
table
*punct* ;
but
so
many
were
also
moving
*punct* ,
that
she
could
not
get
away
*punct* ;
and
mr.
knightley
thought
he
saw
another
collection
of
letters
anxiously
pushed
towards
her
*punct* ,
and
resolutely
swept
away
by
her
unexamined
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
afterwards
looking
for
her
shawl
*punct* ,
frank
churchill
was
looking
also
*punct* ,
it
was
growing
dusk
*punct* ,
and
the
room
was
in
confusion
*punct* ;
and
how
they
parted
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
could
not
tell
*punct* .
*break*
he
remained
at
hartfield
after
all
the
rest
*punct* ,
his
thoughts
full
of
what
he
had
seen
*punct* ;
so
full
*punct* ,
that
when
the
candles
came
to
assist
his
observations
*punct* ,
he
must
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
he
certainly
must
*punct* ,
as
a
friend
*punct* ,
an
anxious
friend
*punct* ,
give
emma
some
hint
*punct* ,
ask
her
some
question
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
see
her
in
a
situation
of
such
danger
*punct* ,
without
trying
to
preserve
her
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
his
duty
*punct* .
*break*
pray
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
may
i
ask
in
what
lay
the
great
amusement
*punct* ,
the
poignant
sting
of
the
last
word
given
to
you
and
miss
fairfax
*punct* ?
*break*
i
saw
the
word
*punct* ,
and
am
curious
to
know
how
it
could
be
so
very
entertaining
to
the
one
*punct* ,
and
so
very
distressing
to
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
extremely
confused
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
not
endure
to
give
him
the
true
explanation
*punct* ;
for
though
her
suspicions
were
by
no
means
removed
*punct* ,
she
was
really
ashamed
of
having
ever
imparted
them
*punct* .
*break*
she
cried
in
evident
embarrassment
*punct* ,
it
all
meant
nothing
*punct* ;
a
mere
joke
among
ourselves
*punct* .
*break*
the
joke
*punct* ,
he
replied
gravely
*punct* ,
seemed
confined
to
you
and
mr.
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
hoped
she
would
speak
again
*punct* ,
but
she
did
not
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
rather
busy
herself
about
any
thing
than
speak
*punct* .
*break*
he
sat
a
little
while
in
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
a
variety
of
evils
crossed
his
mind
*punct* .
*break*
interference
*punct* ,
fruitless
interference
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
confusion
*punct* ,
and
the
acknowledged
intimacy
*punct* ,
seemed
to
declare
her
affection
engaged
*punct* .
*break*
yet
he
would
speak
*punct* .
*break*
he
owed
it
to
her
*punct* ,
to
risk
any
thing
that
might
be
involved
in
an
unwelcome
interference
*punct* ,
rather
than
her
welfare
*punct* ;
to
encounter
any
thing
*punct* ,
rather
than
the
remembrance
of
neglect
in
such
a
cause
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
said
he
at
last
*punct* ,
with
earnest
kindness
*punct* ,
do
you
think
you
perfectly
understand
the
degree
of
acquaintance
between
the
gentleman
and
lady
we
have
been
speaking
of
*punct* ?
*break*
between
mr.
frank
churchill
and
miss
fairfax
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
perfectly.
*punct* ,
why
do
you
make
a
doubt
of
it
*punct* ?
*break*
have
you
never
at
any
time
had
reason
to
think
that
he
admired
her
*punct* ,
or
that
she
admired
him
*punct* ?
*break*
never
*punct* ,
never
*punct* !
*break*
she
cried
with
a
most
open
eagerness
*punct* ,
never
*punct* ,
for
the
twentieth
part
of
a
moment
*punct* ,
did
such
an
idea
occur
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
and
how
could
it
possibly
come
into
your
head
*punct* ?
*break*
i
have
lately
imagined
that
i
saw
symptoms
of
attachment
between
them
*punct* ,
certain
expressive
looks
*punct* ,
which
i
did
not
believe
meant
to
be
public
*punct* .
*break*
you
amuse
me
excessively
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
delighted
to
find
that
you
can
vouchsafe
to
let
your
imagination
wander
*punct* ,
but
it
will
not
do
*punct* ,
very
sorry
to
check
you
in
your
first
essay
*punct* ,
but
indeed
it
will
not
do
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
admiration
between
them
*punct* ,
i
do
assure
you
*punct* ;
and
the
appearances
which
have
caught
you
*punct* ,
have
arisen
from
some
peculiar
circumstances
*punct* ,
feelings
rather
of
a
totally
different
nature
*punct* ,
it
is
impossible
exactly
to
explain:
*punct* ,
there
is
a
good
deal
of
nonsense
in
it
*punct* ,
but
the
part
which
is
capable
of
being
communicated
*punct* ,
which
is
sense
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
that
they
are
as
far
from
any
attachment
or
admiration
for
one
another
*punct* ,
as
any
two
beings
in
the
world
can
be
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
*punct* ,
i
presume
it
to
be
so
on
her
side
*punct* ,
and
i
can
answer
for
its
being
so
on
his
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
answer
for
the
gentleman's
indifference
*punct* .
*break*
she
spoke
with
a
confidence
which
staggered
*punct* ,
with
a
satisfaction
which
silenced
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
in
gay
spirits
*punct* ,
and
would
have
prolonged
the
conversation
*punct* ,
wanting
to
hear
the
particulars
of
his
suspicions
*punct* ,
every
look
described
*punct* ,
and
all
the
wheres
and
hows
of
a
circumstance
which
highly
entertained
her
*punct* :
but
his
gaiety
did
not
meet
hers
*punct* .
*break*
he
found
he
could
not
be
useful
*punct* ,
and
his
feelings
were
too
much
irritated
for
talking
*punct* .
*break*
that
he
might
not
be
irritated
into
an
absolute
fever
*punct* ,
by
the
fire
which
mr.
woodhouse's
tender
habits
required
almost
every
evening
throughout
the
year
*punct* ,
he
soon
afterwards
took
a
hasty
leave
*punct* ,
and
walked
home
to
the
coolness
and
solitude
of
donwell
abbey
*punct* .
*break*
after
being
long
fed
with
hopes
of
a
speedy
visit
from
mr.
and
mrs.
suckling
*punct* ,
the
highbury
world
were
obliged
to
endure
the
mortification
of
hearing
that
they
could
not
possibly
come
till
the
autumn
*punct* .
*break*
no
such
importation
of
novelties
could
enrich
their
intellectual
stores
at
present
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
daily
interchange
of
news
*punct* ,
they
must
be
again
restricted
to
the
other
topics
with
which
for
a
while
the
sucklings
coming
had
been
united
*punct* ,
such
as
the
last
accounts
of
mrs.
churchill
*punct* ,
whose
health
seemed
every
day
to
supply
a
different
report
*punct* ,
and
the
situation
of
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
whose
happiness
it
was
to
be
hoped
might
eventually
be
as
much
increased
by
the
arrival
of
a
child
*punct* ,
as
that
of
all
her
neighbours
was
by
the
approach
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
was
very
much
disappointed
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
delay
of
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
and
parade
*punct* .
*break*
her
introductions
and
recommendations
must
all
wait
*punct* ,
and
every
projected
party
be
still
only
talked
of
*punct* .
*break*
so
she
thought
at
first;
*punct* ,
but
a
little
consideration
convinced
her
that
every
thing
need
not
be
put
off
*punct* .
*break*
why
should
not
they
explore
to
box
hill
though
the
sucklings
did
not
come
*punct* ?
*break*
they
could
go
there
again
with
them
in
the
autumn
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
settled
that
they
should
go
to
box
hill
*punct* .
*break*
that
there
was
to
be
such
a
party
had
been
long
generally
known
*punct* :
it
had
even
given
the
idea
of
another
*punct* .
*break*
emma
had
never
been
to
box
hill
*punct* ;
she
wished
to
see
what
every
body
found
so
well
worth
seeing
*punct* ,
and
she
and
mr.
weston
had
agreed
to
chuse
some
fine
morning
and
drive
thither
*punct* .
*break*
two
or
three
more
of
the
chosen
only
were
to
be
admitted
to
join
them
*punct* ,
and
it
was
to
be
done
in
a
quiet
*punct* ,
unpretending
*punct* ,
elegant
way
*punct* ,
infinitely
superior
to
the
bustle
and
preparation
*punct* ,
the
regular
eating
and
drinking
*punct* ,
and
picnic
parade
of
the
eltons
and
the
sucklings
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
so
very
well
understood
between
them
*punct* ,
that
emma
could
not
but
feel
some
surprise
*punct* ,
and
a
little
displeasure
*punct* ,
on
hearing
from
mr.
weston
that
he
had
been
proposing
to
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
as
her
brother
and
sister
had
failed
her
*punct* ,
that
the
two
parties
should
unite
*punct* ,
and
go
together
*punct* ;
and
that
as
mrs.
elton
had
very
readily
acceded
to
it
*punct* ,
so
it
was
to
be
*punct* ,
if
she
had
no
objection
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
as
her
objection
was
nothing
but
her
very
great
dislike
of
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
of
which
mr.
weston
must
already
be
perfectly
aware
*punct* ,
it
was
not
worth
bringing
forward
again:
*punct* ,
it
could
not
be
done
without
a
reproof
to
him
*punct* ,
which
would
be
giving
pain
to
his
wife
*punct* ;
and
she
found
herself
therefore
obliged
to
consent
to
an
arrangement
which
she
would
have
done
a
great
deal
to
avoid
*punct* ;
an
arrangement
which
would
probably
expose
her
even
to
the
degradation
of
being
said
to
be
of
mrs.
elton's
party
*punct* !
*break*
every
feeling
was
offended
*punct* ;
and
the
forbearance
of
her
outward
submission
left
a
heavy
arrear
due
of
secret
severity
in
her
reflections
on
the
unmanageable
goodwill
of
mr.
weston's
temper
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
glad
you
approve
of
what
i
have
done
*punct* ,
said
he
very
comfortably
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
thought
you
would
*punct* .
*break*
such
schemes
as
these
are
nothing
without
numbers
*punct* .
*break*
one
cannot
have
too
large
a
party
*punct* .
*break*
a
large
party
secures
its
own
amusement
*punct* .
*break*
and
she
is
a
good-natured
woman
after
all
*punct* .
*break*
one
could
not
leave
her
out
*punct* .
*break*
emma
denied
none
of
it
aloud
*punct* ,
and
agreed
to
none
of
it
in
private
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
now
the
middle
of
june
*punct* ,
and
the
weather
fine
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
elton
was
growing
impatient
to
name
the
day
*punct* ,
and
settle
with
mr.
weston
as
to
pigeon-pies
and
cold
lamb
*punct* ,
when
a
lame
carriage-horse
threw
every
thing
into
sad
uncertainty
*punct* .
*break*
it
might
be
weeks
*punct* ,
it
might
be
only
a
few
days
*punct* ,
before
the
horse
were
useable
*punct* ;
but
no
preparations
could
be
ventured
on
*punct* ,
and
it
was
all
melancholy
stagnation
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton's
resources
were
inadequate
to
such
an
attack
*punct* .
*break*
is
not
this
most
vexations
*punct* ,
knightley
*punct* ?
*break*
she
cried.
*punct* ,
and
such
weather
for
exploring!
*punct* ,
these
delays
and
disappointments
are
quite
odious
*punct* .
*break*
what
are
we
to
do?
*punct* ,
the
year
will
wear
away
at
this
rate
*punct* ,
and
nothing
done
*punct* .
*break*
before
this
time
last
year
i
assure
you
we
had
had
a
delightful
exploring
party
from
maple
grove
to
kings
weston
*punct* .
*break*
you
had
better
explore
to
donwell
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
that
may
be
done
without
horses
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
and
eat
my
strawberries
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
ripening
fast
*punct* .
*break*
if
mr.
knightley
did
not
begin
seriously
*punct* ,
he
was
obliged
to
proceed
so
*punct* ,
for
his
proposal
was
caught
at
with
delight
*punct* ;
and
the
oh
*punct* !
*break*
i
should
like
it
of
all
things
*punct* ,
was
not
plainer
in
words
than
manner
*punct* .
*break*
donwell
was
famous
for
its
strawberry-beds
*punct* ,
which
seemed
a
plea
for
the
invitation
*punct* :
but
no
plea
was
necessary
*punct* ;
cabbage-beds
would
have
been
enough
to
tempt
the
lady
*punct* ,
who
only
wanted
to
be
going
somewhere
*punct* .
*break*
she
promised
him
again
and
again
to
come
*punct* ,
much
oftener
than
he
doubted
*punct* ,
and
was
extremely
gratified
by
such
a
proof
of
intimacy
*punct* ,
such
a
distinguishing
compliment
as
she
chose
to
consider
it
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
depend
upon
me
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* .
*break*
i
certainly
will
come
*punct* .
*break*
name
your
day
*punct* ,
and
i
will
come
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
allow
me
to
bring
jane
fairfax
*punct* ?
*break*
i
cannot
name
a
day
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
till
i
have
spoken
to
some
others
whom
i
would
wish
to
meet
you
*punct* .
*break*
leave
all
that
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
only
give
me
a
carte-blanche.
*punct* ,
i
am
lady
patroness
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
my
party
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
bring
friends
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
you
will
bring
elton
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* :
but
i
will
not
trouble
you
to
give
any
other
invitations
*punct* .
*break*
now
you
are
looking
very
sly
*punct* .
*break*
but
consider
*punct* ,
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
delegating
power
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
no
young
lady
on
her
preferment
*punct* .
*break*
married
women
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
may
be
safely
authorised
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
my
party
*punct* .
*break*
leave
it
all
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
invite
your
guests
*punct* .
*break*
no,
*punct* ,
he
calmly
replied,
*punct* ,
there
is
but
one
married
woman
in
the
world
whom
i
can
ever
allow
to
invite
what
guests
she
pleases
to
donwell
*punct* ,
and
that
one
is
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
interrupted
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
rather
mortified
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
mrs.
knightley;
*punct* ,
and
till
she
is
in
being
*punct* ,
i
will
manage
such
matters
myself
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
an
odd
creature
*punct* !
*break*
she
cried
*punct* ,
satisfied
to
have
no
one
preferred
to
herself.
*punct* ,
you
are
a
humourist
*punct* ,
and
may
say
what
you
like
*punct* .
*break*
quite
a
humourist
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
i
shall
bring
jane
with
me
*punct* ,
jane
and
her
aunt.
*punct* ,
the
rest
i
leave
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
objections
at
all
to
meeting
the
hartfield
family
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
you
are
attached
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
you
certainly
will
meet
them
if
i
can
prevail
*punct* ;
and
i
shall
call
on
miss
bates
in
my
way
home
*punct* .
*break*
that's
quite
unnecessary
*punct* ;
i
see
jane
every
day:
*punct* ,
but
as
you
like
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
to
be
a
morning
scheme
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
knightley
*punct* ;
quite
a
simple
thing
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
wear
a
large
bonnet
*punct* ,
and
bring
one
of
my
little
baskets
hanging
on
my
arm
*punct* .
*break*
here,
*punct* ,
probably
this
basket
with
pink
ribbon
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
can
be
more
simple
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* .
*break*
and
jane
will
have
such
another
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
to
be
no
form
or
parade
*punct* ,
a
sort
of
gipsy
party
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
to
walk
about
your
gardens
*punct* ,
and
gather
the
strawberries
ourselves
*punct* ,
and
sit
under
trees;
*punct* ,
and
whatever
else
you
may
like
to
provide
*punct* ,
it
is
to
be
all
out
of
doors
*punct* ,
a
table
spread
in
the
shade
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
every
thing
as
natural
and
simple
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
is
not
that
your
idea
*punct* ?
*break*
my
idea
of
the
simple
and
the
natural
will
be
to
have
the
table
spread
in
the
dining-room
*punct* .
*break*
the
nature
and
the
simplicity
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
*punct* ,
with
their
servants
and
furniture
*punct* ,
i
think
is
best
observed
by
meals
within
doors
*punct* .
*break*
when
you
are
tired
of
eating
strawberries
in
the
garden
*punct* ,
there
shall
be
cold
meat
in
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
as
you
please
*punct* ;
only
don't
have
a
great
set
out
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
by
the
bye
*punct* ,
can
i
or
my
housekeeper
be
of
any
use
to
you
with
our
opinion?
*punct* ,
pray
be
sincere
*punct* ,
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
wish
me
to
talk
to
mrs.
hodges
*punct* ,
or
to
inspect
anything
*punct* ,
i
have
not
the
least
wish
for
it
*punct* ,
i
thank
you
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
but
if
any
difficulties
should
arise
*punct* ,
my
housekeeper
is
extremely
clever
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
answer
for
it
*punct* ,
that
mine
thinks
herself
full
as
clever
*punct* ,
and
would
spurn
any
body's
assistance
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
we
had
a
donkey
*punct* .
*break*
the
thing
would
be
for
us
all
to
come
on
donkeys
*punct* ,
jane
*punct* ,
miss
bates
*punct* ,
and
me
*punct* ,
and
my
caro
sposo
walking
by
*punct* .
*break*
i
really
must
talk
to
him
about
purchasing
a
donkey
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
country
life
i
conceive
it
to
be
a
sort
of
necessary
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
let
a
woman
have
ever
so
many
resources
*punct* ,
it
is
not
possible
for
her
to
be
always
shut
up
at
home;
*punct* ,
and
very
long
walks
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
in
summer
there
is
dust
*punct* ,
and
in
winter
there
is
dirt
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
not
find
either
*punct* ,
between
donwell
and
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
donwell
lane
is
never
dusty
*punct* ,
and
now
it
is
perfectly
dry
*punct* .
*break*
come
on
a
donkey
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
if
you
prefer
it
*punct* .
*break*
you
can
borrow
mrs.
cole's
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
wish
every
thing
to
be
as
much
to
your
taste
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
that
i
am
sure
you
would
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
i
do
you
justice
*punct* ,
my
good
friend
*punct* .
*break*
under
that
peculiar
sort
of
dry
*punct* ,
blunt
manner
*punct* ,
i
know
you
have
the
warmest
heart
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
tell
mr.
e.
*punct* ,
you
are
a
thorough
humourist.
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
believe
me
*punct* ,
knightley
*punct* ,
i
am
fully
sensible
of
your
attention
to
me
in
the
whole
of
this
scheme
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
hit
upon
the
very
thing
to
please
me
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
had
another
reason
for
avoiding
a
table
in
the
shade
*punct* .
*break*
he
wished
to
persuade
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
as
well
as
emma
*punct* ,
to
join
the
party
*punct* ;
and
he
knew
that
to
have
any
of
them
sitting
down
out
of
doors
to
eat
would
inevitably
make
him
ill
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
must
not
*punct* ,
under
the
specious
pretence
of
a
morning
drive
*punct* ,
and
an
hour
or
two
spent
at
donwell
*punct* ,
be
tempted
away
to
his
misery
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
invited
on
good
faith
*punct* .
*break*
no
lurking
horrors
were
to
upbraid
him
for
his
easy
credulity
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
consent
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
not
been
at
donwell
for
two
years
*punct* .
*break*
some
very
fine
morning
*punct* ,
he
*punct* ,
and
emma
*punct* ,
and
harriet
*punct* ,
could
go
very
well
*punct* ;
and
he
could
sit
still
with
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
while
the
dear
girls
walked
about
the
gardens
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
suppose
they
could
be
damp
now
*punct* ,
in
the
middle
of
the
day
*punct* .
*break*
he
should
like
to
see
the
old
house
again
exceedingly
*punct* ,
and
should
be
very
happy
to
meet
mr.
and
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
and
any
other
of
his
neighbours.
*punct* ,
he
could
not
see
any
objection
at
all
to
his
*punct* ,
and
emma's
*punct* ,
and
harriet's
going
there
some
very
fine
morning
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
it
very
well
done
of
mr.
knightley
to
invite
them
*punct* ,
very
kind
and
sensible
*punct* ,
much
cleverer
than
dining
out.
*punct* ,
he
was
not
fond
of
dining
out
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
was
fortunate
in
every
body's
most
ready
concurrence
*punct* .
*break*
the
invitation
was
everywhere
so
well
received
*punct* ,
that
it
seemed
as
if
*punct* ,
like
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
they
were
all
taking
the
scheme
as
a
particular
compliment
to
themselves.
*punct* ,
emma
and
harriet
professed
very
high
expectations
of
pleasure
from
it
*punct* ;
and
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
unasked
*punct* ,
promised
to
get
frank
over
to
join
them
*punct* ,
if
possible
*punct* ;
a
proof
of
approbation
and
gratitude
which
could
have
been
dispensed
with.
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
was
then
obliged
to
say
that
he
should
be
glad
to
see
him
*punct* ;
and
mr.
weston
engaged
to
lose
no
time
in
writing
*punct* ,
and
spare
no
arguments
to
induce
him
to
come
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
meanwhile
the
lame
horse
recovered
so
fast
*punct* ,
that
the
party
to
box
hill
was
again
under
happy
consideration
*punct* ;
and
at
last
donwell
was
settled
for
one
day
*punct* ,
and
box
hill
for
the
next,
*punct* ,
the
weather
appearing
exactly
right
*punct* .
*break*
under
a
bright
mid-day
sun
*punct* ,
at
almost
midsummer
*punct* ,
mr.
woodhouse
was
safely
conveyed
in
his
carriage
*punct* ,
with
one
window
down
*punct* ,
to
partake
of
this
al-fresco
party
*punct* ;
and
in
one
of
the
most
comfortable
rooms
in
the
abbey
*punct* ,
especially
prepared
for
him
by
a
fire
all
the
morning
*punct* ,
he
was
happily
placed
*punct* ,
quite
at
his
ease
*punct* ,
ready
to
talk
with
pleasure
of
what
had
been
achieved
*punct* ,
and
advise
every
body
to
come
and
sit
down
*punct* ,
and
not
to
heat
themselves.
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
who
seemed
to
have
walked
there
on
purpose
to
be
tired
*punct* ,
and
sit
all
the
time
with
him
*punct* ,
remained
*punct* ,
when
all
the
others
were
invited
or
persuaded
out
*punct* ,
his
patient
listener
and
sympathiser
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
so
long
since
emma
had
been
at
the
abbey
*punct* ,
that
as
soon
as
she
was
satisfied
of
her
father's
comfort
*punct* ,
she
was
glad
to
leave
him
*punct* ,
and
look
around
her
*punct* ;
eager
to
refresh
and
correct
her
memory
with
more
particular
observation
*punct* ,
more
exact
understanding
of
a
house
and
grounds
which
must
ever
be
so
interesting
to
her
and
all
her
family
*punct* .
*break*
she
felt
all
the
honest
pride
and
complacency
which
her
alliance
with
the
present
and
future
proprietor
could
fairly
warrant
*punct* ,
as
she
viewed
the
respectable
size
and
style
of
the
building
*punct* ,
its
suitable
*punct* ,
becoming
*punct* ,
characteristic
situation
*punct* ,
low
and
sheltered
*punct* ,
its
ample
gardens
stretching
down
to
meadows
washed
by
a
stream
*punct* ,
of
which
the
abbey
*punct* ,
with
all
the
old
neglect
of
prospect
*punct* ,
had
scarcely
a
sight
*punct* ,
and
its
abundance
of
timber
in
rows
and
avenues
*punct* ,
which
neither
fashion
nor
extravagance
had
rooted
up.
*punct* ,
the
house
was
larger
than
hartfield
*punct* ,
and
totally
unlike
it
*punct* ,
covering
a
good
deal
of
ground
*punct* ,
rambling
and
irregular
*punct* ,
with
many
comfortable
*punct* ,
and
one
or
two
handsome
rooms.
*punct* ,
it
was
just
what
it
ought
to
be
*punct* ,
and
it
looked
what
it
was
*punct* ,
and
emma
felt
an
increasing
respect
for
it
*punct* ,
as
the
residence
of
a
family
of
such
true
gentility
*punct* ,
untainted
in
blood
and
understanding.
*punct* ,
some
faults
of
temper
john
knightley
had
*punct* ;
but
isabella
had
connected
herself
unexceptionably
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
given
them
neither
men
*punct* ,
nor
names
*punct* ,
nor
places
*punct* ,
that
could
raise
a
blush
*punct* .
*break*
these
were
pleasant
feelings
*punct* ,
and
she
walked
about
and
indulged
them
till
it
was
necessary
to
do
as
the
others
did
*punct* ,
and
collect
round
the
strawberry-beds.
*punct* ,
the
whole
party
were
assembled
*punct* ,
excepting
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
who
was
expected
every
moment
from
richmond
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
in
all
her
apparatus
of
happiness
*punct* ,
her
large
bonnet
and
her
basket
*punct* ,
was
very
ready
to
lead
the
way
in
gathering
*punct* ,
accepting
*punct* ,
or
talking
*punct* ,
strawberries
*punct* ,
and
only
strawberries
*punct* ,
could
now
be
thought
or
spoken
of.
*punct* ,
the
best
fruit
in
england
*punct* ,
every
body's
favourite
*punct* ,
always
wholesome.
*punct* ,
these
the
finest
beds
and
finest
sorts.
*punct* ,
delightful
to
gather
for
one's
self
*punct* ,
the
only
way
of
really
enjoying
them.

go
and

in
the
shade
*punct* .
*break*
such
*punct* ,
for
half
an
hour
*punct* ,
was
the
conversation
*punct* ,
interrupted
only
once
by
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
who
came
out
*punct* ,
in
her
solicitude
after
her
son-in-law
*punct* ,
to
inquire
if
he
were
come
*punct* ,
and
she
was
a
little
uneasy.
*punct* ,
she
had
some
fears
of
his
horse
*punct* .
*break*
seats
tolerably
in
the
shade
were
found
*punct* ;
and
now
emma
was
obliged
to
overhear
what
mrs.
elton
and
jane
fairfax
were
talking
of.
*punct* ,
a
situation
*punct* ,
a
most
desirable
situation
*punct* ,
was
in
question
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
had
received
notice
of
it
that
morning
*punct* ,
and
was
in
raptures
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
with
mrs.
suckling
*punct* ,
it
was
not
with
mrs.
bragge
*punct* ,
but
in
felicity
and
splendour
it
fell
short
only
of
them
*punct* :
it
was
with
a
cousin
of
mrs.
bragge
*punct* ,
an
acquaintance
of
mrs.
suckling
*punct* ,
a
lady
known
at
maple
grove
*punct* .
*break*
delightful
*punct* ,
charming
*punct* ,
superior
*punct* ,
first
circles
*punct* ,
spheres
*punct* ,
lines
*punct* ,
ranks
*punct* ,
every
thing
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
elton
was
wild
to
have
the
offer
closed
with
immediately.
*punct* ,
on
her
side
*punct* ,
all
was
warmth
*punct* ,
energy
*punct* ,
and
triumph
*punct* ,
and
she
positively
refused
to
take
her
friend's
negative
*punct* ,
though
miss
fairfax
continued
to
assure
her
that
she
would
not
at
present
engage
in
any
thing
*punct* ,
repeating
the
same
motives
which
she
had
been
heard
to
urge
before.
*punct* ,
still
mrs.
elton
insisted
on
being
authorised
to
write
an
acquiescence
by
the
morrow's
post.
*punct* ,
how
jane
could
bear
it
at
all
*punct* ,
was
astonishing
to
emma.
*punct* ,
she
did
look
vexed
*punct* ,
she
did
speak
pointedly
*punct* ,
and
at
last
*punct* ,
with
a
decision
of
action
unusual
to
her
*punct* ,
proposed
a
removal.
*punct* ,
should
not
they
walk
*punct* ?
*break*
would
not
mr.
knightley
shew
them
the
gardens
*punct* ,
all
the
gardens?
*punct* ,
she
wished
to
see
the
whole
extent.
*punct* ,
the
pertinacity
of
her
friend
seemed
more
than
she
could
bear
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
hot
*punct* ;
and
after
walking
some
time
over
the
gardens
in
a
scattered
*punct* ,
dispersed
way
*punct* ,
scarcely
any
three
together
*punct* ,
they
insensibly
followed
one
another
to
the
delicious
shade
of
a
broad
short
avenue
of
limes
*punct* ,
which
stretching
beyond
the
garden
at
an
equal
distance
from
the
river
*punct* ,
seemed
the
finish
of
the
pleasure
grounds.
*punct* ,
it
led
to
nothing
*punct* ;
nothing
but
a
view
at
the
end
over
a
low
stone
wall
with
high
pillars
*punct* ,
which
seemed
intended
*punct* ,
in
their
erection
*punct* ,
to
give
the
appearance
of
an
approach
to
the
house
*punct* ,
which
never
had
been
there
*punct* .
*break*
disputable
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
as
might
be
the
taste
of
such
a
termination
*punct* ,
it
was
in
itself
a
charming
walk
*punct* ,
and
the
view
which
closed
it
extremely
pretty.
*punct* ,
the
considerable
slope
*punct* ,
at
nearly
the
foot
of
which
the
abbey
stood
*punct* ,
gradually
acquired
a
steeper
form
beyond
its
grounds
*punct* ;
and
at
half
a
mile
distant
was
a
bank
of
considerable
abruptness
and
grandeur
*punct* ,
well
clothed
with
wood;
*punct* ,
and
at
the
bottom
of
this
bank
*punct* ,
favourably
placed
and
sheltered
*punct* ,
rose
the
abbey
mill
farm
*punct* ,
with
meadows
in
front
*punct* ,
and
the
river
making
a
close
and
handsome
curve
around
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
sweet
view
*punct* ,
sweet
to
the
eye
and
the
mind
*punct* .
*break*
english
verdure
*punct* ,
english
culture
*punct* ,
english
comfort
*punct* ,
seen
under
a
sun
bright
*punct* ,
without
being
oppressive
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
walk
emma
and
mr.
weston
found
all
the
others
assembled
*punct* ;
and
towards
this
view
she
immediately
perceived
mr.
knightley
and
harriet
distinct
from
the
rest
*punct* ,
quietly
leading
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
and
harriet!
*punct* ,
it
was
an
odd
tete-a-tete
*punct* ;
but
she
was
glad
to
see
it.
*punct* ,
there
had
been
a
time
when
he
would
have
scorned
her
as
a
companion
*punct* ,
and
turned
from
her
with
little
ceremony
*punct* .
*break*
now
they
seemed
in
pleasant
conversation
*punct* .
*break*
there
had
been
a
time
also
when
emma
would
have
been
sorry
to
see
harriet
in
a
spot
so
favourable
for
the
abbey
mill
farm
*punct* ;
but
now
she
feared
it
not
*punct* .
*break*
it
might
be
safely
viewed
with
all
its
appendages
of
prosperity
and
beauty
*punct* ,
its
rich
pastures
*punct* ,
spreading
flocks
*punct* ,
orchard
in
blossom
*punct* ,
and
light
column
of
smoke
ascending.
*punct* ,
she
joined
them
at
the
wall
*punct* ,
and
found
them
more
engaged
in
talking
than
in
looking
around
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
giving
harriet
information
as
to
modes
of
agriculture
*punct* ,
etc
*punct* .
*break*
and
emma
received
a
smile
which
seemed
to
say
*punct* ,
these
are
my
own
concerns
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
a
right
to
talk
on
such
subjects
*punct* ,
without
being
suspected
of
introducing
robert
martin.
*punct* ,
she
did
not
suspect
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
too
old
a
story.
*punct* ,
robert
martin
had
probably
ceased
to
think
of
harriet.
*punct* ,
they
took
a
few
turns
together
along
the
walk.
*punct* ,
the
shade
was
most
refreshing
*punct* ,
and
emma
found
it
the
pleasantest
part
of
the
day
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
remove
was
to
the
house
*punct* ;
they
must
all
go
in
and
eat;
*punct* ,
and
they
were
all
seated
and
busy
*punct* ,
and
still
frank
churchill
did
not
come
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
looked
*punct* ,
and
looked
in
vain
*punct* .
*break*
his
father
would
not
own
himself
uneasy
*punct* ,
and
laughed
at
her
fears
*punct* ;
but
she
could
not
be
cured
of
wishing
that
he
would
part
with
his
black
mare
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
expressed
himself
as
to
coming
*punct* ,
with
more
than
common
certainty
*punct* .
*break*
his
aunt
was
so
much
better
*punct* ,
that
he
had
not
a
doubt
of
getting
over
to
them.
*punct* ,
mrs.
churchill's
state
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
as
many
were
ready
to
remind
her
*punct* ,
was
liable
to
such
sudden
variation
as
might
disappoint
her
nephew
in
the
most
reasonable
dependence
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
weston
was
at
last
persuaded
to
believe
*punct* ,
or
to
say
*punct* ,
that
it
must
be
by
some
attack
of
mrs.
churchill
that
he
was
prevented
coming.
*punct* ,
emma
looked
at
harriet
while
the
point
was
under
consideration
*punct* ;
she
behaved
very
well
*punct* ,
and
betrayed
no
emotion
*punct* .
*break*
the
cold
repast
was
over
*punct* ,
and
the
party
were
to
go
out
once
more
to
see
what
had
not
yet
been
seen
*punct* ,
the
old
abbey
fish-ponds
*punct* ;
perhaps
get
as
far
as
the
clover
*punct* ,
which
was
to
be
begun
cutting
on
the
morrow
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
have
the
pleasure
of
being
hot
*punct* ,
and
growing
cool
again.
*punct* ,
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
who
had
already
taken
his
little
round
in
the
highest
part
of
the
gardens
*punct* ,
where
no
damps
from
the
river
were
imagined
even
by
him
*punct* ,
stirred
no
more
*punct* ;
and
his
daughter
resolved
to
remain
with
him
*punct* ,
that
mrs.
weston
might
be
persuaded
away
by
her
husband
to
the
exercise
and
variety
which
her
spirits
seemed
to
need
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
had
done
all
in
his
power
for
mr.
woodhouse's
entertainment
*punct* .
*break*
books
of
engravings
*punct* ,
drawers
of
medals
*punct* ,
cameos
*punct* ,
corals
*punct* ,
shells
*punct* ,
and
every
other
family
collection
within
his
cabinets
*punct* ,
had
been
prepared
for
his
old
friend
*punct* ,
to
while
away
the
morning
*punct* ;
and
the
kindness
had
perfectly
answered
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
had
been
exceedingly
well
amused
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
had
been
shewing
them
all
to
him
*punct* ,
and
now
he
would
shew
them
all
to
emma;
*punct* ,
fortunate
in
having
no
other
resemblance
to
a
child
*punct* ,
than
in
a
total
want
of
taste
for
what
he
saw
*punct* ,
for
he
was
slow
*punct* ,
constant
*punct* ,
and
methodical.
*punct* ,
before
this
second
looking
over
was
begun
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
emma
walked
into
the
hall
for
the
sake
of
a
few
moments
free
observation
of
the
entrance
and
ground-plot
of
the
house
*punct* ,
and
was
hardly
there
*punct* ,
when
jane
fairfax
appeared
*punct* ,
coming
quickly
in
from
the
garden
*punct* ,
and
with
a
look
of
escape.
*punct* ,
little
expecting
to
meet
miss
woodhouse
so
soon
*punct* ,
there
was
a
start
at
first
*punct* ;
but
miss
woodhouse
was
the
very
person
she
was
in
quest
of
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
be
so
kind
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
when
i
am
missed
*punct* ,
as
to
say
that
i
am
gone
home?
*punct* ,
i
am
going
this
moment.
*punct* ,
my
aunt
is
not
aware
how
late
it
is
*punct* ,
nor
how
long
we
have
been
absent
*punct* ,
but
i
am
sure
we
shall
be
wanted
*punct* ,
and
i
am
determined
to
go
directly.
*punct* ,
i
have
said
nothing
about
it
to
any
body
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
only
be
giving
trouble
and
distress
*punct* .
*break*
some
are
gone
to
the
ponds
*punct* ,
and
some
to
the
lime
walk
*punct* .
*break*
till
they
all
come
in
i
shall
not
be
missed
*punct* ;
and
when
they
do
*punct* ,
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
say
that
i
am
gone
*punct* ?
*break*
certainly
*punct* ,
if
you
wish
it;
*punct* ,
but
you
are
not
going
to
walk
to
highbury
alone
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
what
should
hurt
me?
*punct* ,
i
walk
fast
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
be
at
home
in
twenty
minutes
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
too
far
*punct* ,
indeed
it
is
*punct* ,
to
be
walking
quite
alone
*punct* .
*break*
let
my
father's
servant
go
with
you.
*punct* ,
let
me
order
the
carriage
*punct* .
*break*
it
can
be
round
in
five
minutes
*punct* .
*break*
thank
you
*punct* ,
thank
you
*punct* ,
but
on
no
account.
*punct* ,
i
would
rather
walk.
*punct* ,
and
for
me
to
be
afraid
of
walking
alone!
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
who
may
so
soon
have
to
guard
others
*punct* !
*break*
she
spoke
with
great
agitation
*punct* ;
and
emma
very
feelingly
replied
*punct* ,
that
can
be
no
reason
for
your
being
exposed
to
danger
now
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
order
the
carriage
*punct* .
*break*
the
heat
even
would
be
danger.
*punct* ,
you
are
fatigued
already
*punct* .
*break*
i
am,
*punct* ,
she
answered
*punct* ,
i
am
fatigued
*punct* ;
but
it
is
not
the
sort
of
fatigue
*punct* ,
quick
walking
will
refresh
me.
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
we
all
know
at
times
what
it
is
to
be
wearied
in
spirits
*punct* .
*break*
mine
*punct* ,
i
confess
*punct* ,
are
exhausted
*punct* .
*break*
the
greatest
kindness
you
can
shew
me
*punct* ,
will
be
to
let
me
have
my
own
way
*punct* ,
and
only
say
that
i
am
gone
when
it
is
necessary
*punct* .
*break*
emma
had
not
another
word
to
oppose
*punct* .
*break*
she
saw
it
all
*punct* ;
and
entering
into
her
feelings
*punct* ,
promoted
her
quitting
the
house
immediately
*punct* ,
and
watched
her
safely
off
with
the
zeal
of
a
friend
*punct* .
*break*
her
parting
look
was
grateful
*punct* ,
and
her
parting
words
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
the
comfort
of
being
sometimes
alone!
*punct* ,
seemed
to
burst
from
an
overcharged
heart
*punct* ,
and
to
describe
somewhat
of
the
continual
endurance
to
be
practised
by
her
*punct* ,
even
towards
some
of
those
who
loved
her
best
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
home
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
such
an
aunt
*punct* !
*break*
said
emma
*punct* ,
as
she
turned
back
into
the
hall
again
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
pity
you
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
more
sensibility
you
betray
of
their
just
horrors
*punct* ,
the
more
i
shall
like
you
*punct* .
*break*
jane
had
not
been
gone
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*punct* ,
and
they
had
only
accomplished
some
views
of
st
*punct* .
*break*
mark's
place
*punct* ,
venice
*punct* ,
when
frank
churchill
entered
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
emma
had
not
been
thinking
of
him
*punct* ,
she
had
forgotten
to
think
of
him
*punct* ,
but
she
was
very
glad
to
see
him
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
would
be
at
ease
*punct* .
*break*
the
black
mare
was
blameless
*punct* ;
they
were
right
who
had
named
mrs.
churchill
as
the
cause
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
detained
by
a
temporary
increase
of
illness
in
her
*punct* ;
a
nervous
seizure
*punct* ,
which
had
lasted
some
hours
*punct* ,
and
he
had
quite
given
up
every
thought
of
coming
*punct* ,
till
very
late;
*punct* ,
and
had
he
known
how
hot
a
ride
he
should
have
*punct* ,
and
how
late
*punct* ,
with
all
his
hurry
*punct* ,
he
must
be
*punct* ,
he
believed
he
should
not
have
come
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
the
heat
was
excessive
*punct* ;
he
had
never
suffered
any
thing
like
it
*punct* ,
almost
wished
he
had
staid
at
home
*punct* ,
nothing
killed
him
like
heat
*punct* ,
he
could
bear
any
degree
of
cold
*punct* ,
etc.
*punct* ,
but
heat
was
intolerable
*punct* ,
and
he
sat
down
*punct* ,
at
the
greatest
possible
distance
from
the
slight
remains
of
mr.
woodhouse's
fire
*punct* ,
looking
very
deplorable
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
soon
be
cooler
*punct* ,
if
you
sit
still
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* .
*break*
as
soon
as
i
am
cooler
i
shall
go
back
again
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
very
ill
be
spared
*punct* ,
but
such
a
point
had
been
made
of
my
coming
*punct* !
*break*
you
will
all
be
going
soon
i
suppose
*punct* ;
the
whole
party
breaking
up
*punct* .
*break*
i
met
one
as
i
came
*punct* ,
madness
in
such
weather!
*punct* ,
absolute
madness
*punct* !
*break*
emma
listened
*punct* ,
and
looked
*punct* ,
and
soon
perceived
that
frank
churchill's
state
might
be
best
defined
by
the
expressive
phrase
of
being
out
of
humour
*punct* .
*break*
some
people
were
always
cross
when
they
were
hot
*punct* .
*break*
such
might
be
his
constitution
*punct* ;
and
as
she
knew
that
eating
and
drinking
were
often
the
cure
of
such
incidental
complaints
*punct* ,
she
recommended
his
taking
some
refreshment
*punct* ;
he
would
find
abundance
of
every
thing
in
the
dining-room
*punct* ,
and
she
humanely
pointed
out
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
he
should
not
eat
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
not
hungry
*punct* ;
it
would
only
make
him
hotter
*punct* .
*break*
in
two
minutes
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
relented
in
his
own
favour
*punct* ;
and
muttering
something
about
spruce-beer
*punct* ,
walked
off
*punct* .
*break*
emma
returned
all
her
attention
to
her
father
*punct* ,
saying
in
secret
*punct* ,
i
am
glad
i
have
done
being
in
love
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
not
like
a
man
who
is
so
soon
discomposed
by
a
hot
morning
*punct* .
*break*
harriet's
sweet
easy
temper
will
not
mind
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
gone
long
enough
to
have
had
a
very
comfortable
meal
*punct* ,
and
came
back
all
the
better
*punct* ,
grown
quite
cool
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
with
good
manners
*punct* ,
like
himself
*punct* ,
able
to
draw
a
chair
close
to
them
*punct* ,
take
an
interest
in
their
employment
*punct* ;
and
regret
*punct* ,
in
a
reasonable
way
*punct* ,
that
he
should
be
so
late
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
not
in
his
best
spirits
*punct* ,
but
seemed
trying
to
improve
them
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
at
last
*punct* ,
made
himself
talk
nonsense
very
agreeably
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
looking
over
views
in
swisserland
*punct* .
*break*
as
soon
as
my
aunt
gets
well
*punct* ,
i
shall
go
abroad
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
never
be
easy
till
i
have
seen
some
of
these
places
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
have
my
sketches
*punct* ,
some
time
or
other
*punct* ,
to
look
at
*punct* ,
or
my
tour
to
read
*punct* ,
or
my
poem
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
do
something
to
expose
myself
*punct* .
*break*
that
may
be
*punct* ,
but
not
by
sketches
in
swisserland
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
never
go
to
swisserland
*punct* .
*break*
your
uncle
and
aunt
will
never
allow
you
to
leave
england
*punct* .
*break*
they
may
be
induced
to
go
too
*punct* .
*break*
a
warm
climate
may
be
prescribed
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
more
than
half
an
expectation
of
our
all
going
abroad
*punct* .
*break*
i
assure
you
i
have
*punct* .
*break*
i
feel
a
strong
persuasion
*punct* ,
this
morning
*punct* ,
that
i
shall
soon
be
abroad
*punct* .
*break*
i
ought
to
travel
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
tired
of
doing
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
i
want
a
change
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
serious
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
whatever
your
penetrating
eyes
may
fancy
*punct* ,
i
am
sick
of
england
*punct* ,
and
would
leave
it
to-morrow
*punct* ,
if
i
could
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
sick
of
prosperity
and
indulgence
*punct* .
*break*
cannot
you
invent
a
few
hardships
for
yourself
*punct* ,
and
be
contented
to
stay
*punct* ?
*break*
i
sick
of
prosperity
and
indulgence
*punct* !
*break*
you
are
quite
mistaken
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
look
upon
myself
as
either
prosperous
or
indulged
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
thwarted
in
every
thing
material
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
consider
myself
at
all
a
fortunate
person
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
not
quite
so
miserable
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
as
when
you
first
came
*punct* .
*break*
go
and
eat
and
drink
a
little
more
*punct* ,
and
you
will
do
very
well
*punct* .
*break*
another
slice
of
cold
meat
*punct* ,
another
draught
of
madeira
and
water
*punct* ,
will
make
you
nearly
on
a
par
with
the
rest
of
us
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
shall
not
stir
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
sit
by
you
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
my
best
cure
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
going
to
box
hill
to-morrow;
*punct* ,
you
will
join
us
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
swisserland
*punct* ,
but
it
will
be
something
for
a
young
man
so
much
in
want
of
a
change
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
stay
*punct* ,
and
go
with
us
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
certainly
not
*punct* ;
i
shall
go
home
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
may
come
again
in
the
cool
of
to-morrow
morning
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
it
will
not
be
worth
while
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
come
*punct* ,
i
shall
be
cross
*punct* .
*break*
then
pray
stay
at
richmond
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
i
do
*punct* ,
i
shall
be
crosser
still
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
never
bear
to
think
of
you
all
there
without
me
*punct* .
*break*
these
are
difficulties
which
you
must
settle
for
yourself
*punct* .
*break*
chuse
your
own
degree
of
crossness
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
press
you
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
the
rest
of
the
party
were
now
returning
*punct* ,
and
all
were
soon
collected
*punct* .
*break*
with
some
there
was
great
joy
at
the
sight
of
frank
churchill
*punct* ;
others
took
it
very
composedly
*punct* ;
but
there
was
a
very
general
distress
and
disturbance
on
miss
fairfax's
disappearance
being
explained
*punct* .
*break*
that
it
was
time
for
every
body
to
go
*punct* ,
concluded
the
subject
*punct* ;
and
with
a
short
final
arrangement
for
the
next
day's
scheme
*punct* ,
they
parted
*punct* .
*break*
frank
churchill's
little
inclination
to
exclude
himself
increased
so
much
*punct* ,
that
his
last
words
to
emma
were
*punct* ,
well;
*punct* ,
if
you
wish
me
to
stay
and
join
the
party
*punct* ,
i
will
*punct* .
*break*
she
smiled
her
acceptance
*punct* ;
and
nothing
less
than
a
summons
from
richmond
was
to
take
him
back
before
the
following
evening
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
a
very
fine
day
for
box
hill
*punct* ;
and
all
the
other
outward
circumstances
of
arrangement
*punct* ,
accommodation
*punct* ,
and
punctuality
*punct* ,
were
in
favour
of
a
pleasant
party
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
directed
the
whole
*punct* ,
officiating
safely
between
hartfield
and
the
vicarage
*punct* ,
and
every
body
was
in
good
time
*punct* .
*break*
emma
and
harriet
went
together
*punct* ;
miss
bates
and
her
niece
*punct* ,
with
the
eltons
*punct* ;
the
gentlemen
on
horseback
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
remained
with
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
was
wanting
but
to
be
happy
when
they
got
there
*punct* .
*break*
seven
miles
were
travelled
in
expectation
of
enjoyment
*punct* ,
and
every
body
had
a
burst
of
admiration
on
first
arriving
*punct* ;
but
in
the
general
amount
of
the
day
there
was
deficiency
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
languor
*punct* ,
a
want
of
spirits
*punct* ,
a
want
of
union
*punct* ,
which
could
not
be
got
over
*punct* .
*break*
they
separated
too
much
into
parties
*punct* .
*break*
the
eltons
walked
together
*punct* ;
mr.
knightley
took
charge
of
miss
bates
and
jane
*punct* ;
and
emma
and
harriet
belonged
to
frank
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
and
mr.
weston
tried
*punct* ,
in
vain
*punct* ,
to
make
them
harmonise
better
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
at
first
an
accidental
division
*punct* ,
but
it
never
materially
varied
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
and
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
shewed
no
unwillingness
to
mix
*punct* ,
and
be
as
agreeable
as
they
could
*punct* ;
but
during
the
two
whole
hours
that
were
spent
on
the
hill
*punct* ,
there
seemed
a
principle
of
separation
*punct* ,
between
the
other
parties
*punct* ,
too
strong
for
any
fine
prospects
*punct* ,
or
any
cold
collation
*punct* ,
or
any
cheerful
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
to
remove
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
it
was
downright
dulness
to
emma
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
never
seen
frank
churchill
so
silent
and
stupid
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
nothing
worth
hearing
*punct* ,
looked
without
seeing
*punct* ,
admired
without
intelligence
*punct* ,
listened
without
knowing
what
she
said
*punct* .
*break*
while
he
was
so
dull
*punct* ,
it
was
no
wonder
that
harriet
should
be
dull
likewise
*punct* ;
and
they
were
both
insufferable
*punct* .
*break*
when
they
all
sat
down
it
was
better
*punct* ;
to
her
taste
a
great
deal
better
*punct* ,
for
frank
churchill
grew
talkative
and
gay
*punct* ,
making
her
his
first
object
*punct* .
*break*
every
distinguishing
attention
that
could
be
paid
*punct* ,
was
paid
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
to
amuse
her
*punct* ,
and
be
agreeable
in
her
eyes
*punct* ,
seemed
all
that
he
cared
for
*punct* ,
and
emma
*punct* ,
glad
to
be
enlivened
*punct* ,
not
sorry
to
be
flattered
*punct* ,
was
gay
and
easy
too
*punct* ,
and
gave
him
all
the
friendly
encouragement
*punct* ,
the
admission
to
be
gallant
*punct* ,
which
she
had
ever
given
in
the
first
and
most
animating
period
of
their
acquaintance
*punct* ;
but
which
now
*punct* ,
in
her
own
estimation
*punct* ,
meant
nothing
*punct* ,
though
in
the
judgment
of
most
people
looking
on
it
must
have
had
such
an
appearance
as
no
english
word
but
flirtation
could
very
well
describe
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
frank
churchill
and
miss
woodhouse
flirted
together
excessively
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
laying
themselves
open
to
that
very
phrase
*punct* ,
and
to
having
it
sent
off
in
a
letter
to
maple
grove
by
one
lady
*punct* ,
to
ireland
by
another
*punct* .
*break*
not
that
emma
was
gay
and
thoughtless
from
any
real
felicity
*punct* ;
it
was
rather
because
she
felt
less
happy
than
she
had
expected
*punct* .
*break*
she
laughed
because
she
was
disappointed
*punct* ;
and
though
she
liked
him
for
his
attentions
*punct* ,
and
thought
them
all
*punct* ,
whether
in
friendship
*punct* ,
admiration
*punct* ,
or
playfulness
*punct* ,
extremely
judicious
*punct* ,
they
were
not
winning
back
her
heart
*punct* .
*break*
she
still
intended
him
for
her
friend
*punct* .
*break*
how
much
i
am
obliged
to
you
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
for
telling
me
to
come
to-day!
*punct* ,
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
*punct* ,
i
should
certainly
have
lost
all
the
happiness
of
this
party
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
quite
determined
to
go
away
again
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
you
were
very
cross
*punct* ;
and
i
do
not
know
what
about
*punct* ,
except
that
you
were
too
late
for
the
best
strawberries
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
a
kinder
friend
than
you
deserved
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
were
humble
*punct* .
*break*
you
begged
hard
to
be
commanded
to
come
*punct* .
*break*
don't
say
i
was
cross
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
fatigued
*punct* .
*break*
the
heat
overcame
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
hotter
to-day
*punct* .
*break*
not
to
my
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
perfectly
comfortable
to-day
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
comfortable
because
you
are
under
command
*punct* .
*break*
your
command?
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
i
intended
you
to
say
so
*punct* ,
but
i
meant
self-command
*punct* .
*break*
you
had
*punct* ,
somehow
or
other
*punct* ,
broken
bounds
yesterday
*punct* ,
and
run
away
from
your
own
management
*punct* ;
but
to-day
you
are
got
back
again
*punct* ,
and
as
i
cannot
be
always
with
you
*punct* ,
it
is
best
to
believe
your
temper
under
your
own
command
rather
than
mine
*punct* .
*break*
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
have
no
self-command
without
a
motive
*punct* .
*break*
you
order
me
*punct* ,
whether
you
speak
or
not
*punct* .
*break*
and
you
can
be
always
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
always
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
dating
from
three
o'clock
yesterday
*punct* .
*break*
my
perpetual
influence
could
not
begin
earlier
*punct* ,
or
you
would
not
have
been
so
much
out
of
humour
before
*punct* .
*break*
three
o'clock
yesterday
*punct* !
*break*
that
is
your
date
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
i
had
seen
you
first
in
february
*punct* .
*break*
your
gallantry
is
really
unanswerable
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
lowering
her
voice
*punct* ,
nobody
speaks
except
ourselves
*punct* ,
and
it
is
rather
too
much
to
be
talking
nonsense
for
the
entertainment
of
seven
silent
people
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
nothing
of
which
i
am
ashamed
*punct* ,
replied
he
*punct* ,
with
lively
impudence
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
you
first
in
february
*punct* .
*break*
let
every
body
on
the
hill
hear
me
if
they
can
*punct* .
*break*
let
my
accents
swell
to
mickleham
on
one
side
*punct* ,
and
dorking
on
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
you
first
in
february
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
whispering
*punct* ,
our
companions
are
excessively
stupid
*punct* .
*break*
what
shall
we
do
to
rouse
them
*punct* ?
*break*
any
nonsense
will
serve
*punct* .
*break*
they
shall
talk
*punct* .
*break*
ladies
and
gentlemen
*punct* ,
i
am
ordered
by
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
wherever
she
is
*punct* ,
presides
*punct* ,
to
say
*punct* ,
that
she
desires
to
know
what
you
are
all
thinking
of
*punct* ?
*break*
some
laughed
*punct* ,
and
answered
good-humouredly
*punct* .
*break*
miss
bates
said
a
great
deal
*punct* ;
mrs.
elton
swelled
at
the
idea
of
miss
woodhouse's
presiding
*punct* ;
mr.
knightley's
answer
was
the
most
distinct
*punct* .
*break*
is
miss
woodhouse
sure
that
she
would
like
to
hear
what
we
are
all
thinking
of
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* ,
laughing
as
carelessly
as
she
could
*punct* ,
upon
no
account
in
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
the
very
last
thing
i
would
stand
the
brunt
of
just
now
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
hear
any
thing
rather
than
what
you
are
all
thinking
of
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
not
say
quite
all
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
one
or
two
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
glancing
at
mr.
weston
and
harriet,
*punct* ,
whose
thoughts
i
might
not
be
afraid
of
knowing
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
sort
of
thing
*punct* ,
cried
mrs.
elton
emphatically
*punct* ,
which
i
should
not
have
thought
myself
privileged
to
inquire
into
*punct* .
*break*
though
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
as
the
chaperon
of
the
party
*punct* ,
i
never
was
in
any
circle
*punct* ,
exploring
parties
*punct* ,
young
ladies
*punct* ,
married
women
*punct* ,
her
mutterings
were
chiefly
to
her
husband
*punct* ;
and
he
murmured
*punct* ,
in
reply
*punct* ,
very
true
*punct* ,
my
love
*punct* ,
very
true
*punct* .
*break*
exactly
so
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
quite
unheard
of
*punct* ,
but
some
ladies
say
any
thing
*punct* .
*break*
better
pass
it
off
as
a
joke
*punct* .
*break*
every
body
knows
what
is
due
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
not
do
*punct* ,
whispered
frank
to
emma
*punct* ;
they
are
most
of
them
affronted
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
attack
them
with
more
address
*punct* .
*break*
ladies
and
gentlemen
*punct* ,
i
am
ordered
by
miss
woodhouse
to
say
*punct* ,
that
she
waives
her
right
of
knowing
exactly
what
you
may
all
be
thinking
of
*punct* ,
and
only
requires
something
very
entertaining
from
each
of
you
*punct* ,
in
a
general
way
*punct* .
*break*
here
are
seven
of
you
*punct* ,
besides
myself
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
she
is
pleased
to
say
*punct* ,
am
very
entertaining
already,
*punct* ,
and
she
only
demands
from
each
of
you
either
one
thing
very
clever
*punct* ,
be
it
prose
or
verse
*punct* ,
original
or
repeated
*punct* ,
or
two
things
moderately
clever
*punct* ,
or
three
things
very
dull
indeed
*punct* ,
and
she
engages
to
laugh
heartily
at
them
all
*punct* .
*break*
very
well
*punct* ,
exclaimed
miss
bates
*punct* ,
then
i
need
not
be
uneasy
*punct* .
*break*
three
things
very
dull
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
that
will
just
do
for
me
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
be
sure
to
say
three
dull
things
as
soon
as
ever
i
open
my
mouth
*punct* ,
shan't
i
*punct* ?
*break*
*punct* ,
looking
round
with
the
most
good-humoured
dependence
on
every
body's
assent
*punct* ,
do
not
you
all
think
i
shall
*punct* ?
*break*
emma
could
not
resist
*punct* .
*break*
ma'am
*punct* ,
but
there
may
be
a
difficulty
*punct* .
*break*
pardon
me
*punct* ,
but
you
will
be
limited
as
to
number
*punct* ,
only
three
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
miss
bates
*punct* ,
deceived
by
the
mock
ceremony
of
her
manner
*punct* ,
did
not
immediately
catch
her
meaning
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
when
it
burst
on
her
*punct* ,
it
could
not
anger
*punct* ,
though
a
slight
blush
shewed
that
it
could
pain
her
*punct* .
*break*
ah!
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
to
be
sure
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
see
what
she
means
*punct* ,
turning
to
mr.
knightley,
*punct* ,
and
i
will
try
to
hold
my
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
make
myself
very
disagreeable
*punct* ,
or
she
would
not
have
said
such
a
thing
to
an
old
friend
*punct* .
*break*
i
like
your
plan
*punct* ,
cried
mr.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
agreed
*punct* ,
agreed
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
do
my
best
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
making
a
conundrum
*punct* .
*break*
how
will
a
conundrum
reckon
*punct* ?
*break*
low
*punct* ,
i
am
afraid
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
very
low
*punct* ,
answered
his
son;
*punct* ,
but
we
shall
be
indulgent
*punct* ,
especially
to
any
one
who
leads
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
it
will
not
reckon
low
*punct* .
*break*
a
conundrum
of
mr.
weston's
shall
clear
him
and
his
next
neighbour
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
pray
let
me
hear
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
doubt
its
being
very
clever
myself
*punct* ,
said
mr.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
too
much
a
matter
of
fact
*punct* ,
but
here
it
is.
*punct* ,
what
two
letters
of
the
alphabet
are
there
*punct* ,
that
express
perfection
*punct* ?
*break*
what
two
letters!
*punct* ,
express
perfection
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
never
guess
*punct* .
*break*
you
*punct* ,
to
emma
*punct* ,
i
am
certain
*punct* ,
will
never
guess.
*punct* ,
i
will
tell
you.
*punct* ,
m.
and
a.
*punct* ,
em-ma.
*punct* ,
do
you
understand
*punct* ?
*break*
understanding
and
gratification
came
together
*punct* .
*break*
it
might
be
a
very
indifferent
piece
of
wit
*punct* ,
but
emma
found
a
great
deal
to
laugh
at
and
enjoy
in
it
*punct* ,
and
so
did
frank
and
harriet.
*punct* ,
it
did
not
seem
to
touch
the
rest
of
the
party
equally
*punct* ;
some
looked
very
stupid
about
it
*punct* ,
and
mr.
knightley
gravely
said
*punct* ,
this
explains
the
sort
of
clever
thing
that
is
wanted
*punct* ,
and
mr.
weston
has
done
very
well
for
himself
*punct* ;
but
he
must
have
knocked
up
every
body
else
*punct* .
*break*
perfection
should
not
have
come
quite
so
soon
*punct* .
*break*
for
myself
*punct* ,
i
protest
i
must
be
excused
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
elton
*punct* ;
i
really
cannot
attempt
*punct* ,
i
am
not
at
all
fond
of
the
sort
of
thing
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
an
acrostic
once
sent
to
me
upon
my
own
name
*punct* ,
which
i
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
who
it
came
from
*punct* .
*break*
these
kind
of
things
are
very
well
at
christmas
*punct* ,
when
one
is
sitting
round
the
fire
*punct* ;
but
quite
out
of
place
*punct* ,
in
my
opinion
*punct* ,
when
one
is
exploring
about
the
country
in
summer
*punct* .
*break*
miss
woodhouse
must
excuse
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
one
of
those
who
have
witty
things
at
every
body's
service
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
wit
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
a
great
deal
of
vivacity
in
my
own
way
*punct* ,
but
i
really
must
be
allowed
to
judge
when
to
speak
and
when
to
hold
my
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
pass
us
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* ,
mr.
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
pass
mr.
e.
*punct* ,
knightley
*punct* ,
jane
*punct* ,
and
myself
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
nothing
clever
to
say
*punct* ,
not
one
of
us
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
pray
pass
me
*punct* ,
added
her
husband
*punct* ,
with
a
sort
of
sneering
consciousness
*punct* ;
i
have
nothing
to
say
that
can
entertain
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
or
any
other
young
lady
*punct* .
*break*
an
old
married
man
*punct* ,
quite
good
for
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
shall
we
walk
*punct* ,
augusta
*punct* ?
*break*
with
all
my
heart
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
really
tired
of
exploring
so
long
on
one
spot
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
jane
*punct* ,
take
my
other
arm
*punct* .
*break*
jane
declined
it
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
and
the
husband
and
wife
walked
off
*punct* .
*break*
said
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
hearing:
*punct* ,
how
well
they
suit
one
another!
*punct* ,
very
lucky
*punct* ,
marrying
as
they
did
*punct* ,
upon
an
acquaintance
formed
only
in
a
public
place!
*punct* ,
they
only
knew
each
other
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
a
few
weeks
in
bath
*punct* !
*break*
peculiarly
lucky!
*punct* ,
for
as
to
any
real
knowledge
of
a
person's
disposition
that
bath
*punct* ,
or
any
public
place
*punct* ,
can
give
*punct* ,
it
is
all
nothing
*punct* ;
there
can
be
no
knowledge
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
only
by
seeing
women
in
their
own
homes
*punct* ,
among
their
own
set
*punct* ,
just
as
they
always
are
*punct* ,
that
you
can
form
any
just
judgment
*punct* .
*break*
short
of
that
*punct* ,
it
is
all
guess
and
luck
*punct* ,
and
will
generally
be
ill-luck
*punct* .
*break*
how
many
a
man
has
committed
himself
on
a
short
acquaintance
*punct* ,
and
rued
it
all
the
rest
of
his
life
*punct* !
*break*
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
who
had
seldom
spoken
before
*punct* ,
except
among
her
own
confederates
*punct* ,
spoke
now
*punct* .
*break*
such
things
do
occur
*punct* ,
undoubtedly.
*punct* ,
she
was
stopped
by
a
cough
*punct* .
*break*
frank
churchill
turned
towards
her
to
listen
*punct* .
*break*
you
were
speaking
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
gravely
*punct* .
*break*
she
recovered
her
voice
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
only
going
to
observe
*punct* ,
that
though
such
unfortunate
circumstances
do
sometimes
occur
both
to
men
and
women
*punct* ,
i
cannot
imagine
them
to
be
very
frequent
*punct* .
*break*
a
hasty
and
imprudent
attachment
may
arise
*punct* ,
but
there
is
generally
time
to
recover
from
it
afterwards
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
be
understood
to
mean
*punct* ,
that
it
can
be
only
weak
*punct* ,
irresolute
characters
*punct* ,
whose
happiness
must
be
always
at
the
mercy
of
chance,
*punct* ,
who
will
suffer
an
unfortunate
acquaintance
to
be
an
inconvenience
*punct* ,
an
oppression
for
ever
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
no
answer
*punct* ;
merely
looked
*punct* ,
and
bowed
in
submission
*punct* ;
and
soon
afterwards
said
*punct* ,
in
a
lively
tone
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
i
have
so
little
confidence
in
my
own
judgment
*punct* ,
that
whenever
i
marry
*punct* ,
i
hope
some
body
will
chuse
my
wife
for
me
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
turning
to
emma.
*punct* ,
will
you
chuse
a
wife
for
me?
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
i
should
like
any
body
fixed
on
by
you
*punct* .
*break*
find
some
body
for
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
in
no
hurry
*punct* .
*break*
adopt
her
*punct* ,
educate
her
*punct* .
*break*
and
make
her
like
myself
*punct* .
*break*
by
all
means
*punct* ,
if
you
can
*punct* .
*break*
i
undertake
the
commission
*punct* .
*break*
you
shall
have
a
charming
wife
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
be
very
lively
*punct* ,
and
have
hazle
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
i
care
for
nothing
else
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
go
abroad
for
a
couple
of
years
*punct* ,
and
when
i
return
*punct* ,
i
shall
come
to
you
for
my
wife
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
in
no
danger
of
forgetting
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
commission
to
touch
every
favourite
feeling
*punct* .
*break*
would
not
harriet
be
the
very
creature
described
*punct* ?
*break*
hazle
eyes
excepted
*punct* ,
two
years
more
might
make
her
all
that
he
wished
*punct* .
*break*
he
might
even
have
harriet
in
his
thoughts
at
the
moment
*punct* ;
who
could
say
*punct* ?
*break*
referring
the
education
to
her
seemed
to
imply
it
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ,
said
jane
to
her
aunt
*punct* ,
shall
we
join
mrs.
elton
*punct* ?
*break*
if
you
please
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* .
*break*
with
all
my
heart
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
quite
ready
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
ready
to
have
gone
with
her
*punct* ,
but
this
will
do
just
as
well
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
soon
overtake
her
*punct* .
*break*
there
she
is
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
that's
somebody
else
*punct* .
*break*
that's
one
of
the
ladies
in
the
irish
car
party
*punct* ,
not
at
all
like
her.
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
i
declare
*punct* ,
they
walked
off
*punct* ,
followed
in
half
a
minute
by
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
his
son
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
and
harriet
*punct* ,
only
remained
*punct* ;
and
the
young
man's
spirits
now
rose
to
a
pitch
almost
unpleasant
*punct* .
*break*
even
emma
grew
tired
at
last
of
flattery
and
merriment
*punct* ,
and
wished
herself
rather
walking
quietly
about
with
any
of
the
others
*punct* ,
or
sitting
almost
alone
*punct* ,
and
quite
unattended
to
*punct* ,
in
tranquil
observation
of
the
beautiful
views
beneath
her
*punct* .
*break*
the
appearance
of
the
servants
looking
out
for
them
to
give
notice
of
the
carriages
was
a
joyful
sight
*punct* ;
and
even
the
bustle
of
collecting
and
preparing
to
depart
*punct* ,
and
the
solicitude
of
mrs.
elton
to
have
her
carriage
first
*punct* ,
were
gladly
endured
*punct* ,
in
the
prospect
of
the
quiet
drive
home
which
was
to
close
the
very
questionable
enjoyments
of
this
day
of
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
such
another
scheme
*punct* ,
composed
of
so
many
ill-assorted
people
*punct* ,
she
hoped
never
to
be
betrayed
into
again
*punct* .
*break*
while
waiting
for
the
carriage
*punct* ,
she
found
mr.
knightley
by
her
side
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
around
*punct* ,
as
if
to
see
that
no
one
were
near
*punct* ,
and
then
said
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
i
must
once
more
speak
to
you
as
i
have
been
used
to
do
*punct* :
a
privilege
rather
endured
than
allowed
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
but
i
must
still
use
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
see
you
acting
wrong
*punct* ,
without
a
remonstrance
*punct* .
*break*
how
could
you
be
so
unfeeling
to
miss
bates
*punct* ?
*break*
how
could
you
be
so
insolent
in
your
wit
to
a
woman
of
her
character
*punct* ,
age
*punct* ,
and
situation?
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
i
had
not
thought
it
possible
*punct* .
*break*
emma
recollected
*punct* ,
blushed
*punct* ,
was
sorry
*punct* ,
but
tried
to
laugh
it
off
*punct* .
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
how
could
i
help
saying
what
i
did?
*punct* ,
nobody
could
have
helped
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
so
very
bad
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
she
did
not
understand
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
assure
you
she
did
*punct* .
*break*
she
felt
your
full
meaning
*punct* .
*break*
she
has
talked
of
it
since
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
how
she
talked
of
it
*punct* ,
with
what
candour
and
generosity
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
her
honouring
your
forbearance
*punct* ,
in
being
able
to
pay
her
such
attentions
*punct* ,
as
she
was
for
ever
receiving
from
yourself
and
your
father
*punct* ,
when
her
society
must
be
so
irksome
*punct* .
*break*
cried
emma
*punct* ,
i
know
there
is
not
a
better
creature
in
the
world
*punct* :
but
you
must
allow
*punct* ,
that
what
is
good
and
what
is
ridiculous
are
most
unfortunately
blended
in
her
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
blended
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
i
acknowledge
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
were
she
prosperous
*punct* ,
i
could
allow
much
for
the
occasional
prevalence
of
the
ridiculous
over
the
good
*punct* .
*break*
were
she
a
woman
of
fortune
*punct* ,
i
would
leave
every
harmless
absurdity
to
take
its
chance
*punct* ,
i
would
not
quarrel
with
you
for
any
liberties
of
manner
*punct* .
*break*
were
she
your
equal
in
situation
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
consider
how
far
this
is
from
being
the
case
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
poor
*punct* ;
she
has
sunk
from
the
comforts
she
was
born
to
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
if
she
live
to
old
age
*punct* ,
must
probably
sink
more
*punct* .
*break*
her
situation
should
secure
your
compassion
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
badly
done
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
you
*punct* ,
whom
she
had
known
from
an
infant
*punct* ,
whom
she
had
seen
grow
up
from
a
period
when
her
notice
was
an
honour
*punct* ,
to
have
you
now
*punct* ,
in
thoughtless
spirits
*punct* ,
and
the
pride
of
the
moment
*punct* ,
laugh
at
her
*punct* ,
humble
her
*punct* ,
and
before
her
niece
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
and
before
others
*punct* ,
many
of
whom
*punct* ,
certainly
some,
*punct* ,
would
be
entirely
guided
by
your
treatment
of
her.
*punct* ,
this
is
not
pleasant
to
you
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
and
it
is
very
far
from
pleasant
to
me
*punct* ;
but
i
must
*punct* ,
i
will,
*punct* ,
i
will
tell
you
truths
while
i
can
*punct* ;
satisfied
with
proving
myself
your
friend
by
very
faithful
counsel
*punct* ,
and
trusting
that
you
will
some
time
or
other
do
me
greater
justice
than
you
can
do
now
*punct* .
*break*
while
they
talked
*punct* ,
they
were
advancing
towards
the
carriage
*punct* ;
it
was
ready
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
before
she
could
speak
again
*punct* ,
he
had
handed
her
in
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
misinterpreted
the
feelings
which
had
kept
her
face
averted
*punct* ,
and
her
tongue
motionless
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
combined
only
of
anger
against
herself
*punct* ,
mortification
*punct* ,
and
deep
concern
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
not
been
able
to
speak
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
on
entering
the
carriage
*punct* ,
sunk
back
for
a
moment
overcome
*punct* ,
then
reproaching
herself
for
having
taken
no
leave
*punct* ,
making
no
acknowledgment
*punct* ,
parting
in
apparent
sullenness
*punct* ,
she
looked
out
with
voice
and
hand
eager
to
shew
a
difference
*punct* ;
but
it
was
just
too
late
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
turned
away
*punct* ,
and
the
horses
were
in
motion
*punct* .
*break*
she
continued
to
look
back
*punct* ,
but
in
vain
*punct* ;
and
soon
*punct* ,
with
what
appeared
unusual
speed
*punct* ,
they
were
half
way
down
the
hill
*punct* ,
and
every
thing
left
far
behind
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
vexed
beyond
what
could
have
been
expressed
*punct* ,
almost
beyond
what
she
could
conceal
*punct* .
*break*
never
had
she
felt
so
agitated
*punct* ,
mortified
*punct* ,
grieved
*punct* ,
at
any
circumstance
in
her
life
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
most
forcibly
struck
*punct* .
*break*
the
truth
of
this
representation
there
was
no
denying
*punct* .
*break*
she
felt
it
at
her
heart
*punct* .
*break*
how
could
she
have
been
so
brutal
*punct* ,
so
cruel
to
miss
bates
*punct* !
*break*
how
could
she
have
exposed
herself
to
such
ill
opinion
in
any
one
she
valued
*punct* !
*break*
and
how
suffer
him
to
leave
her
without
saying
one
word
of
gratitude
*punct* ,
of
concurrence
*punct* ,
of
common
kindness
*punct* !
*break*
time
did
not
compose
her
*punct* .
*break*
as
she
reflected
more
*punct* ,
she
seemed
but
to
feel
it
more
*punct* .
*break*
she
never
had
been
so
depressed
*punct* .
*break*
happily
it
was
not
necessary
to
speak
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
only
harriet
*punct* ,
who
seemed
not
in
spirits
herself
*punct* ,
fagged
*punct* ,
and
very
willing
to
be
silent
*punct* ;
and
emma
felt
the
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
almost
all
the
way
home
*punct* ,
without
being
at
any
trouble
to
check
them
*punct* ,
extraordinary
as
they
were
*punct* .
*break*
the
wretchedness
of
a
scheme
to
box
hill
was
in
emma's
thoughts
all
the
evening
*punct* .
*break*
how
it
might
be
considered
by
the
rest
of
the
party
*punct* ,
she
could
not
tell
*punct* .
*break*
they
*punct* ,
in
their
different
homes
*punct* ,
and
their
different
ways
*punct* ,
might
be
looking
back
on
it
with
pleasure
*punct* ;
but
in
her
view
it
was
a
morning
more
completely
misspent
*punct* ,
more
totally
bare
of
rational
satisfaction
at
the
time
*punct* ,
and
more
to
be
abhorred
in
recollection
*punct* ,
than
any
she
had
ever
passed
*punct* .
*break*
a
whole
evening
of
back-gammon
with
her
father
*punct* ,
was
felicity
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
lay
real
pleasure
*punct* ,
for
there
she
was
giving
up
the
sweetest
hours
of
the
twenty-four
to
his
comfort
*punct* ;
and
feeling
that
*punct* ,
unmerited
as
might
be
the
degree
of
his
fond
affection
and
confiding
esteem
*punct* ,
she
could
not
*punct* ,
in
her
general
conduct
*punct* ,
be
open
to
any
severe
reproach
*punct* .
*break*
as
a
daughter
*punct* ,
she
hoped
she
was
not
without
a
heart
*punct* .
*break*
she
hoped
no
one
could
have
said
to
her
*punct* ,
how
could
you
be
so
unfeeling
to
your
father?
*punct* ,
i
must
*punct* ,
i
will
tell
you
truths
while
i
can
*punct* .
*break*
miss
bates
should
never
again
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
never
*punct* !
*break*
if
attention
*punct* ,
in
future
*punct* ,
could
do
away
the
past
*punct* ,
she
might
hope
to
be
forgiven
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
been
often
remiss
*punct* ,
her
conscience
told
her
so
*punct* ;
remiss
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
more
in
thought
than
fact
*punct* ;
scornful
*punct* ,
ungracious
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
should
be
so
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
warmth
of
true
contrition
*punct* ,
she
would
call
upon
her
the
very
next
morning
*punct* ,
and
it
should
be
the
beginning
*punct* ,
on
her
side
*punct* ,
of
a
regular
*punct* ,
equal
*punct* ,
kindly
intercourse
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
just
as
determined
when
the
morrow
came
*punct* ,
and
went
early
*punct* ,
that
nothing
might
prevent
her
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
unlikely
*punct* ,
she
thought
*punct* ,
that
she
might
see
mr.
knightley
in
her
way
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
he
might
come
in
while
she
were
paying
her
visit
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
no
objection
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
not
be
ashamed
of
the
appearance
of
the
penitence
*punct* ,
so
justly
and
truly
hers
*punct* .
*break*
her
eyes
were
towards
donwell
as
she
walked
*punct* ,
but
she
saw
him
not
*punct* .
*break*
the
ladies
were
all
at
home
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
never
rejoiced
at
the
sound
before
*punct* ,
nor
ever
before
entered
the
passage
*punct* ,
nor
walked
up
the
stairs
*punct* ,
with
any
wish
of
giving
pleasure
*punct* ,
but
in
conferring
obligation
*punct* ,
or
of
deriving
it
*punct* ,
except
in
subsequent
ridicule
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
bustle
on
her
approach
*punct* ;
a
good
deal
of
moving
and
talking
*punct* .
*break*
she
heard
miss
bates's
voice
*punct* ,
something
was
to
be
done
in
a
hurry
*punct* ;
the
maid
looked
frightened
and
awkward
*punct* ;
hoped
she
would
be
pleased
to
wait
a
moment
*punct* ,
and
then
ushered
her
in
too
soon
*punct* .
*break*
the
aunt
and
niece
seemed
both
escaping
into
the
adjoining
room
*punct* .
*break*
jane
she
had
a
distinct
glimpse
of
*punct* ,
looking
extremely
ill
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
before
the
door
had
shut
them
out
*punct* ,
she
heard
miss
bates
saying
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
i
shall
say
you
are
laid
down
upon
the
bed
*punct* ,
and
i
am
sure
you
are
ill
enough
*punct* .
*break*
poor
old
mrs.
bates
*punct* ,
civil
and
humble
as
usual
*punct* ,
looked
as
if
she
did
not
quite
understand
what
was
going
on
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
afraid
jane
is
not
very
well
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
but
i
do
not
know
*punct* ;
they
tell
me
she
is
well
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
my
daughter
will
be
here
presently
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
you
find
a
chair
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
hetty
had
not
gone
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
very
little
able
*punct* ,
have
you
a
chair
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ?
*break*
do
you
sit
where
you
like
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
sure
she
will
be
here
presently
*punct* .
*break*
emma
seriously
hoped
she
would
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
a
moment's
fear
of
miss
bates
keeping
away
from
her
*punct* .
*break*
but
miss
bates
soon
came
*punct* ,
very
happy
and
obliged
*punct* ,
but
emma's
conscience
told
her
that
there
was
not
the
same
cheerful
volubility
as
before
*punct* ,
less
ease
of
look
and
manner
*punct* .
*break*
a
very
friendly
inquiry
after
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
she
hoped
*punct* ,
might
lead
the
way
to
a
return
of
old
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
the
touch
seemed
immediate
*punct* .
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
how
kind
you
are!
*punct* ,
i
suppose
you
have
heard
*punct* ,
and
are
come
to
give
us
joy
*punct* .
*break*
this
does
not
seem
much
like
joy
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
in
me
*punct* ,
twinkling
away
a
tear
or
two
*punct* ,
but
it
will
be
very
trying
for
us
to
part
with
her
*punct* ,
after
having
had
her
so
long
*punct* ,
and
she
has
a
dreadful
headach
just
now
*punct* ,
writing
all
the
morning:
*punct* ,
such
long
letters
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
to
be
written
to
colonel
campbell
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
dixon
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
you
will
blind
yourself'
*punct* ,
for
tears
were
in
her
eyes
perpetually
*punct* .
*break*
one
cannot
wonder
*punct* ,
one
cannot
wonder
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
great
change
*punct* ;
and
though
she
is
amazingly
fortunate
*punct* ,
such
a
situation
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
as
no
young
woman
before
ever
met
with
on
first
going
out
*punct* ,
do
not
think
us
ungrateful
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
for
such
surprising
good
fortune
*punct* ,
again
dispersing
her
tears
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
poor
dear
soul
*punct* !
*break*
if
you
were
to
see
what
a
headache
she
has
*punct* .
*break*
when
one
is
in
great
pain
*punct* ,
you
know
one
cannot
feel
any
blessing
quite
as
it
may
deserve
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
as
low
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
to
look
at
her
*punct* ,
nobody
would
think
how
delighted
and
happy
she
is
to
have
secured
such
a
situation
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
excuse
her
not
coming
to
you
*punct* ,
she
is
not
able
*punct* ,
she
is
gone
into
her
own
room
*punct* ,
i
want
her
to
lie
down
upon
the
bed
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
i
shall
say
you
are
laid
down
upon
the
bed
*punct* :
but
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
she
is
not
*punct* ;
she
is
walking
about
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
now
that
she
has
written
her
letters
*punct* ,
she
says
she
shall
soon
be
well
*punct* .
*break*
she
will
be
extremely
sorry
to
miss
seeing
you
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
but
your
kindness
will
excuse
her
*punct* .
*break*
you
were
kept
waiting
at
the
door
*punct* ,
i
was
quite
ashamed
*punct* ,
but
somehow
there
was
a
little
bustle
*punct* ,
for
it
so
happened
that
we
had
not
heard
the
knock
*punct* ,
and
till
you
were
on
the
stairs
*punct* ,
we
did
not
know
any
body
was
coming
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
only
mrs.
cole
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
depend
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
else
would
come
so
early
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
it
must
be
borne
some
time
or
other
*punct* ,
and
it
may
as
well
be
now
*punct* .
*break*
but
then
patty
came
in
*punct* ,
and
said
it
was
you
*punct* .
*break*
said
i
*punct* ,
it
is
miss
woodhouse
*punct* :
i
am
sure
you
will
like
to
see
her.'
*punct* ,
i
can
see
nobody
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ;
and
up
she
got
*punct* ,
and
would
go
away
*punct* ;
and
that
was
what
made
us
keep
you
waiting
*punct* ,
and
extremely
sorry
and
ashamed
we
were
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
must
go
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
you
must
*punct* ,
and
i
will
say
you
are
laid
down
upon
the
bed
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
most
sincerely
interested
*punct* .
*break*
her
heart
had
been
long
growing
kinder
towards
jane
*punct* ;
and
this
picture
of
her
present
sufferings
acted
as
a
cure
of
every
former
ungenerous
suspicion
*punct* ,
and
left
her
nothing
but
pity
*punct* ;
and
the
remembrance
of
the
less
just
and
less
gentle
sensations
of
the
past
*punct* ,
obliged
her
to
admit
that
jane
might
very
naturally
resolve
on
seeing
mrs.
cole
or
any
other
steady
friend
*punct* ,
when
she
might
not
bear
to
see
herself
*punct* .
*break*
she
spoke
as
she
felt
*punct* ,
with
earnest
regret
and
solicitude
*punct* ,
sincerely
wishing
that
the
circumstances
which
she
collected
from
miss
bates
to
be
now
actually
determined
on
*punct* ,
might
be
as
much
for
miss
fairfax's
advantage
and
comfort
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
be
a
severe
trial
to
them
all
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
understood
it
was
to
be
delayed
till
colonel
campbell's
return
*punct* .
*break*
so
very
kind
*punct* !
*break*
replied
miss
bates
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
are
always
kind
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
bearing
such
an
always
*punct* ;
and
to
break
through
her
dreadful
gratitude
*punct* ,
emma
made
the
direct
inquiry
of
*punct* ,
where
*punct* ,
may
i
ask?
*punct* ,
is
miss
fairfax
going
*punct* ?
*break*
to
a
mrs.
smallridge
*punct* ,
charming
woman
*punct* ,
most
superior
*punct* ,
to
have
the
charge
of
her
three
little
girls
*punct* ,
delightful
children
*punct* .
*break*
impossible
that
any
situation
could
be
more
replete
with
comfort
*punct* ;
if
we
except
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
mrs.
suckling's
own
family
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
bragge's
*punct* ;
but
mrs.
smallridge
is
intimate
with
both
*punct* ,
and
in
the
very
same
neighbourhood:
*punct* ,
lives
only
four
miles
from
maple
grove
*punct* .
*break*
jane
will
be
only
four
miles
from
maple
grove
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
has
been
the
person
to
whom
miss
fairfax
owes
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
our
good
mrs.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
the
most
indefatigable
*punct* ,
true
friend
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
not
take
a
denial
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
not
let
jane
say
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ;
for
when
jane
first
heard
of
it
*punct* ,
it
was
the
day
before
yesterday
*punct* ,
the
very
morning
we
were
at
donwell,
*punct* ,
when
jane
first
heard
of
it
*punct* ,
she
was
quite
decided
against
accepting
the
offer
*punct* ,
and
for
the
reasons
you
mention
*punct* ;
exactly
as
you
say
*punct* ,
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
close
with
nothing
till
colonel
campbell's
return
*punct* ,
and
nothing
should
induce
her
to
enter
into
any
engagement
at
present
*punct* ,
and
so
she
told
mrs.
elton
over
and
over
again
*punct* ,
and
i
am
sure
i
had
no
more
idea
that
she
would
change
her
mind!
*punct* ,
but
that
good
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
whose
judgment
never
fails
her
*punct* ,
saw
farther
than
i
did
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
every
body
that
would
have
stood
out
in
such
a
kind
way
as
she
did
*punct* ,
and
refuse
to
take
jane's
answer
*punct* ;
but
she
positively
declared
she
would
not
write
any
such
denial
yesterday
*punct* ,
as
jane
wished
her
*punct* ;
she
would
wait
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
sure
enough
*punct* ,
yesterday
evening
it
was
all
settled
that
jane
should
go
*punct* .
*break*
quite
a
surprize
to
me
*punct* !
*break*
i
had
not
the
least
idea!
*punct* ,
jane
took
mrs.
elton
aside
*punct* ,
and
told
her
at
once
*punct* ,
that
upon
thinking
over
the
advantages
of
mrs.
smallridge's
situation
*punct* ,
she
had
come
to
the
resolution
of
accepting
it.
*punct* ,
i
did
not
know
a
word
of
it
till
it
was
all
settled
*punct* .
*break*
you
spent
the
evening
with
mrs.
elton
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
all
of
us
*punct* ;
mrs.
elton
would
have
us
come
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
settled
so
*punct* ,
upon
the
hill
*punct* ,
while
we
were
walking
about
with
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
all
spend
your
evening
with
us
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
i
positively
must
have
you
all
come
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
was
there
too
*punct* ,
was
he
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
not
mr.
knightley
*punct* ;
he
declined
it
from
the
first
*punct* ;
and
though
i
thought
he
would
come
*punct* ,
because
mrs.
elton
declared
she
would
not
let
him
off
*punct* ,
he
did
not;
*punct* ,
but
my
mother
*punct* ,
and
jane
*punct* ,
and
i
*punct* ,
were
all
there
*punct* ,
and
a
very
agreeable
evening
we
had
*punct* .
*break*
such
kind
friends
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
one
must
always
find
agreeable
*punct* ,
though
every
body
seemed
rather
fagged
after
the
morning's
party
*punct* .
*break*
even
pleasure
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
is
fatiguing
*punct* ,
and
i
cannot
say
that
any
of
them
seemed
very
much
to
have
enjoyed
it
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
i
shall
always
think
it
a
very
pleasant
party
*punct* ,
and
feel
extremely
obliged
to
the
kind
friends
who
included
me
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
though
you
were
not
aware
of
it
*punct* ,
had
been
making
up
her
mind
the
whole
day
*punct* ?
*break*
i
dare
say
she
had
*punct* .
*break*
whenever
the
time
may
come
*punct* ,
it
must
be
unwelcome
to
her
and
all
her
friends
*punct* ,
but
i
hope
her
engagement
will
have
every
alleviation
that
is
possible
*punct* ,
i
mean
*punct* ,
as
to
the
character
and
manners
of
the
family
*punct* .
*break*
thank
you
*punct* ,
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
there
is
every
thing
in
the
world
that
can
make
her
happy
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
except
the
sucklings
and
bragges
*punct* ,
there
is
not
such
another
nursery
establishment
*punct* ,
so
liberal
and
elegant
*punct* ,
in
all
mrs.
elton's
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
smallridge
*punct* ,
a
most
delightful
woman!
*punct* ,
a
style
of
living
almost
equal
to
maple
grove
*punct* ,
and
as
to
the
children
*punct* ,
except
the
little
sucklings
and
little
bragges
*punct* ,
there
are
not
such
elegant
sweet
children
anywhere
*punct* .
*break*
jane
will
be
treated
with
such
regard
and
kindness!
*punct* ,
it
will
be
nothing
but
pleasure
*punct* ,
a
life
of
pleasure.
*punct* ,
and
her
salary!
*punct* ,
i
really
cannot
venture
to
name
her
salary
to
you
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* .
*break*
even
you
*punct* ,
used
as
you
are
to
great
sums
*punct* ,
would
hardly
believe
that
so
much
could
be
given
to
a
young
person
like
jane
*punct* .
*break*
madam
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* ,
if
other
children
are
at
all
like
what
i
remember
to
have
been
myself
*punct* ,
i
should
think
five
times
the
amount
of
what
i
have
ever
yet
heard
named
as
a
salary
on
such
occasions
*punct* ,
dearly
earned
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
so
noble
in
your
ideas
*punct* !
*break*
and
when
is
miss
fairfax
to
leave
you
*punct* ?
*break*
very
soon
*punct* ,
very
soon
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ;
that's
the
worst
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
within
a
fortnight
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
smallridge
is
in
a
great
hurry
*punct* .
*break*
my
poor
mother
does
not
know
how
to
bear
it
*punct* .
*break*
so
then
*punct* ,
i
try
to
put
it
out
of
her
thoughts
*punct* ,
and
say
*punct* ,
come
ma'am
*punct* ,
do
not
let
us
think
about
it
any
more
*punct* .
*break*
her
friends
must
all
be
sorry
to
lose
her
*punct* ;
and
will
not
colonel
and
mrs.
campbell
be
sorry
to
find
that
she
has
engaged
herself
before
their
return
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ;
jane
says
she
is
sure
they
will
*punct* ;
but
yet
*punct* ,
this
is
such
a
situation
as
she
cannot
feel
herself
justified
in
declining
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
so
astonished
when
she
first
told
me
what
she
had
been
saying
to
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
and
when
mrs.
elton
at
the
same
moment
came
congratulating
me
upon
it
*punct* !
*break*
it
was
before
tea
*punct* ,
stay
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
it
could
not
be
before
tea
*punct* ,
because
we
were
just
going
to
cards
*punct* ,
and
yet
it
was
before
tea
*punct* ,
because
i
remember
thinking
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
now
i
recollect
*punct* ,
now
i
have
it
*punct* ;
something
happened
before
tea
*punct* ,
but
not
that
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
was
called
out
of
the
room
before
tea
*punct* ,
old
john
abdy's
son
wanted
to
speak
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
poor
old
john
*punct* ,
i
have
a
great
regard
for
him
*punct* ;
he
was
clerk
to
my
poor
father
twenty-seven
years
*punct* ;
and
now
*punct* ,
poor
old
man
*punct* ,
he
is
bed-ridden
*punct* ,
and
very
poorly
with
the
rheumatic
gout
in
his
joints
*punct* ,
i
must
go
and
see
him
to-day
*punct* ;
and
so
will
jane
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* ,
if
she
gets
out
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
and
poor
john's
son
came
to
talk
to
mr.
elton
about
relief
from
the
parish
*punct* ;
he
is
very
well
to
do
himself
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
being
head
man
at
the
crown
*punct* ,
ostler
*punct* ,
and
every
thing
of
that
sort
*punct* ,
but
still
he
cannot
keep
his
father
without
some
help
*punct* ;
and
so
*punct* ,
when
mr.
elton
came
back
*punct* ,
he
told
us
what
john
ostler
had
been
telling
him
*punct* ,
and
then
it
came
out
about
the
chaise
having
been
sent
to
randalls
to
take
mr.
frank
churchill
to
richmond
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
what
happened
before
tea
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
after
tea
that
jane
spoke
to
mrs.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
miss
bates
would
hardly
give
emma
time
to
say
how
perfectly
new
this
circumstance
was
to
her
*punct* ;
but
as
without
supposing
it
possible
that
she
could
be
ignorant
of
any
of
the
particulars
of
mr.
frank
churchill's
going
*punct* ,
she
proceeded
to
give
them
all
*punct* ,
it
was
of
no
consequence
*punct* .
*break*
what
mr.
elton
had
learned
from
the
ostler
on
the
subject
*punct* ,
being
the
accumulation
of
the
ostler's
own
knowledge
*punct* ,
and
the
knowledge
of
the
servants
at
randalls
*punct* ,
was
*punct* ,
that
a
messenger
had
come
over
from
richmond
soon
after
the
return
of
the
party
from
box
hill
*punct* ,
which
messenger
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
had
been
no
more
than
was
expected
*punct* ;
and
that
mr.
churchill
had
sent
his
nephew
a
few
lines
*punct* ,
containing
*punct* ,
upon
the
whole
*punct* ,
a
tolerable
account
of
mrs.
churchill
*punct* ,
and
only
wishing
him
not
to
delay
coming
back
beyond
the
next
morning
early
*punct* ;
but
that
mr.
frank
churchill
having
resolved
to
go
home
directly
*punct* ,
without
waiting
at
all
*punct* ,
and
his
horse
seeming
to
have
got
a
cold
*punct* ,
tom
had
been
sent
off
immediately
for
the
crown
chaise
*punct* ,
and
the
ostler
had
stood
out
and
seen
it
pass
by
*punct* ,
the
boy
going
a
good
pace
*punct* ,
and
driving
very
steady
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
nothing
in
all
this
either
to
astonish
or
interest
*punct* ,
and
it
caught
emma's
attention
only
as
it
united
with
the
subject
which
already
engaged
her
mind
*punct* .
*break*
the
contrast
between
mrs.
churchill's
importance
in
the
world
*punct* ,
and
jane
fairfax's
*punct* ,
struck
her
*punct* ;
one
was
every
thing
*punct* ,
the
other
nothing
*punct* ,
and
she
sat
musing
on
the
difference
of
woman's
destiny
*punct* ,
and
quite
unconscious
on
what
her
eyes
were
fixed
*punct* ,
till
roused
by
miss
bates's
saying
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
i
see
what
you
are
thinking
of
*punct* ,
the
pianoforte
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
to
become
of
that?
*punct* ,
very
true
*punct* .
*break*
poor
dear
jane
was
talking
of
it
just
now.
*punct* ,
you
must
go
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* .
*break*
you
and
i
must
part
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
have
no
business
here.
*punct* ,
let
it
stay
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ;
give
it
houseroom
till
colonel
campbell
comes
back
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
talk
about
it
to
him
*punct* ;
he
will
settle
for
me
*punct* ;
he
will
help
me
out
of
all
my
difficulties.'
*punct* ,
and
to
this
day
*punct* ,
i
do
believe
*punct* ,
she
knows
not
whether
it
was
his
present
or
his
daughter's
*punct* .
*break*
now
emma
was
obliged
to
think
of
the
pianoforte
*punct* ;
and
the
remembrance
of
all
her
former
fanciful
and
unfair
conjectures
was
so
little
pleasing
*punct* ,
that
she
soon
allowed
herself
to
believe
her
visit
had
been
long
enough
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
with
a
repetition
of
every
thing
that
she
could
venture
to
say
of
the
good
wishes
which
she
really
felt
*punct* ,
took
leave
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
pensive
meditations
*punct* ,
as
she
walked
home
*punct* ,
were
not
interrupted
*punct* ;
but
on
entering
the
parlour
*punct* ,
she
found
those
who
must
rouse
her
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
and
harriet
had
arrived
during
her
absence
*punct* ,
and
were
sitting
with
her
father.
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
immediately
got
up
*punct* ,
and
in
a
manner
decidedly
graver
than
usual
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
i
would
not
go
away
without
seeing
you
*punct* ,
but
i
have
no
time
to
spare
*punct* ,
and
therefore
must
now
be
gone
directly
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
going
to
london
*punct* ,
to
spend
a
few
days
with
john
and
isabella
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
any
thing
to
send
or
say
*punct* ,
besides
the
love
*punct* ,
which
nobody
carries
*punct* ?
*break*
nothing
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
but
is
not
this
a
sudden
scheme
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
rather
*punct* ,
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
some
little
time
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
sure
he
had
not
forgiven
her
*punct* ;
he
looked
unlike
himself
*punct* .
*break*
time
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
she
thought
*punct* ,
would
tell
him
that
they
ought
to
be
friends
again
*punct* .
*break*
while
he
stood
*punct* ,
as
if
meaning
to
go
*punct* ,
but
not
going
*punct* ,
her
father
began
his
inquiries
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
and
did
you
get
there
safely?
*punct* ,
and
how
did
you
find
my
worthy
old
friend
and
her
daughter?
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
they
must
have
been
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
coming
*punct* .
*break*
dear
emma
has
been
to
call
on
mrs.
and
miss
bates
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
as
i
told
you
before
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
always
so
attentive
to
them
*punct* !
*break*
emma's
colour
was
heightened
by
this
unjust
praise
*punct* ;
and
with
a
smile
*punct* ,
and
shake
of
the
head
*punct* ,
which
spoke
much
*punct* ,
she
looked
at
mr.
knightley.
*punct* ,
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
an
instantaneous
impression
in
her
favour
*punct* ,
as
if
his
eyes
received
the
truth
from
her's
*punct* ,
and
all
that
had
passed
of
good
in
her
feelings
were
at
once
caught
and
honoured.
*punct* ,
he
looked
at
her
with
a
glow
of
regard
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
warmly
gratified
*punct* ,
and
in
another
moment
still
more
so
*punct* ,
by
a
little
movement
of
more
than
common
friendliness
on
his
part.
*punct* ,
he
took
her
hand;
*punct* ,
whether
she
had
not
herself
made
the
first
motion
*punct* ,
she
could
not
say
*punct* ,
she
might
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
have
rather
offered
it
*punct* ,
but
he
took
her
hand
*punct* ,
pressed
it
*punct* ,
and
certainly
was
on
the
point
of
carrying
it
to
his
lips
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
from
some
fancy
or
other
*punct* ,
he
suddenly
let
it
go.
*punct* ,
why
he
should
feel
such
a
scruple
*punct* ,
why
he
should
change
his
mind
when
it
was
all
but
done
*punct* ,
she
could
not
perceive.
*punct* ,
he
would
have
judged
better
*punct* ,
she
thought
*punct* ,
if
he
had
not
stopped.
*punct* ,
the
intention
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
was
indubitable
*punct* ;
and
whether
it
was
that
his
manners
had
in
general
so
little
gallantry
*punct* ,
or
however
else
it
happened
*punct* ,
but
she
thought
nothing
became
him
more.
*punct* ,
it
was
with
him
*punct* ,
of
so
simple
*punct* ,
yet
so
dignified
a
nature.
*punct* ,
she
could
not
but
recall
the
attempt
with
great
satisfaction
*punct* .
*break*
it
spoke
such
perfect
amity.
*punct* ,
he
left
them
immediately
afterwards
*punct* ,
gone
in
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
he
always
moved
with
the
alertness
of
a
mind
which
could
neither
be
undecided
nor
dilatory
*punct* ,
but
now
he
seemed
more
sudden
than
usual
in
his
disappearance
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
regret
her
having
gone
to
miss
bates
*punct* ,
but
she
wished
she
had
left
her
ten
minutes
earlier;
*punct* ,
it
would
have
been
a
great
pleasure
to
talk
over
jane
fairfax's
situation
with
mr.
knightley.
*punct* ,
neither
would
she
regret
that
he
should
be
going
to
brunswick
square
*punct* ,
for
she
knew
how
much
his
visit
would
be
enjoyed
*punct* ,
but
it
might
have
happened
at
a
better
time
*punct* ,
and
to
have
had
longer
notice
of
it
*punct* ,
would
have
been
pleasanter.
*punct* ,
they
parted
thorough
friends
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ;
she
could
not
be
deceived
as
to
the
meaning
of
his
countenance
*punct* ,
and
his
unfinished
gallantry;
*punct* ,
it
was
all
done
to
assure
her
that
she
had
fully
recovered
his
good
opinion.
*punct* ,
he
had
been
sitting
with
them
half
an
hour
*punct* ,
she
found
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
pity
that
she
had
not
come
back
earlier
*punct* !
*break*
in
the
hope
of
diverting
her
father's
thoughts
from
the
disagreeableness
of
mr.
knightley's
going
to
london
*punct* ;
and
going
so
suddenly
*punct* ;
and
going
on
horseback
*punct* ,
which
she
knew
would
be
all
very
bad
*punct* ;
emma
communicated
her
news
of
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
and
her
dependence
on
the
effect
was
justified
*punct* ;
it
supplied
a
very
useful
check,
*punct* ,
interested
*punct* ,
without
disturbing
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
long
made
up
his
mind
to
jane
fairfax's
going
out
as
governess
*punct* ,
and
could
talk
of
it
cheerfully
*punct* ,
but
mr.
knightley's
going
to
london
had
been
an
unexpected
blow
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
very
glad
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
to
hear
she
is
to
be
so
comfortably
settled
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
elton
is
very
good-natured
and
agreeable
*punct* ,
and
i
dare
say
her
acquaintance
are
just
what
they
ought
to
be
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
it
is
a
dry
situation
*punct* ,
and
that
her
health
will
be
taken
good
care
of
*punct* .
*break*
it
ought
to
be
a
first
object
*punct* ,
as
i
am
sure
poor
miss
taylor's
always
was
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
she
is
going
to
be
to
this
new
lady
what
miss
taylor
was
to
us
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
hope
she
will
be
better
off
in
one
respect
*punct* ,
and
not
be
induced
to
go
away
after
it
has
been
her
home
so
long
*punct* .
*break*
the
following
day
brought
news
from
richmond
to
throw
every
thing
else
into
the
background
*punct* .
*break*
an
express
arrived
at
randalls
to
announce
the
death
of
mrs.
churchill
*punct* !
*break*
though
her
nephew
had
had
no
particular
reason
to
hasten
back
on
her
account
*punct* ,
she
had
not
lived
above
six-and-thirty
hours
after
his
return
*punct* .
*break*
a
sudden
seizure
of
a
different
nature
from
any
thing
foreboded
by
her
general
state
*punct* ,
had
carried
her
off
after
a
short
struggle
*punct* .
*break*
the
great
mrs.
churchill
was
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
felt
as
such
things
must
be
felt
*punct* .
*break*
every
body
had
a
degree
of
gravity
and
sorrow
*punct* ;
tenderness
towards
the
departed
*punct* ,
solicitude
for
the
surviving
friends
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
in
a
reasonable
time
*punct* ,
curiosity
to
know
where
she
would
be
buried
*punct* .
*break*
goldsmith
tells
us
*punct* ,
that
when
lovely
woman
stoops
to
folly
*punct* ,
she
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
die
*punct* ;
and
when
she
stoops
to
be
disagreeable
*punct* ,
it
is
equally
to
be
recommended
as
a
clearer
of
ill-fame
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
churchill
*punct* ,
after
being
disliked
at
least
twenty-five
years
*punct* ,
was
now
spoken
of
with
compassionate
allowances
*punct* .
*break*
in
one
point
she
was
fully
justified
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
never
been
admitted
before
to
be
seriously
ill
*punct* .
*break*
the
event
acquitted
her
of
all
the
fancifulness
*punct* ,
and
all
the
selfishness
of
imaginary
complaints
*punct* .
*break*
poor
mrs.
churchill
*punct* !
*break*
no
doubt
she
had
been
suffering
a
great
deal
*punct* :
more
than
any
body
had
ever
supposed
*punct* ,
and
continual
pain
would
try
the
temper
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
sad
event
*punct* ,
a
great
shock
*punct* ,
with
all
her
faults
*punct* ,
what
would
mr.
churchill
do
without
her
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
churchill's
loss
would
be
dreadful
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
churchill
would
never
get
over
it.
*punct* ,
even
mr.
weston
shook
his
head
*punct* ,
and
looked
solemn
*punct* ,
and
said
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* !
*break*
poor
woman
*punct* ,
who
would
have
thought
it
*punct* !
*break*
and
resolved
*punct* ,
that
his
mourning
should
be
as
handsome
as
possible
*punct* ;
and
his
wife
sat
sighing
and
moralising
over
her
broad
hems
with
a
commiseration
and
good
sense
*punct* ,
true
and
steady
*punct* .
*break*
how
it
would
affect
frank
was
among
the
earliest
thoughts
of
both
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
also
a
very
early
speculation
with
emma
*punct* .
*break*
the
character
of
mrs.
churchill
*punct* ,
the
grief
of
her
husband
*punct* ,
her
mind
glanced
over
them
both
with
awe
and
compassion
*punct* ,
and
then
rested
with
lightened
feelings
on
how
frank
might
be
affected
by
the
event
*punct* ,
how
benefited
*punct* ,
how
freed
*punct* .
*break*
she
saw
in
a
moment
all
the
possible
good
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
an
attachment
to
harriet
smith
would
have
nothing
to
encounter
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
churchill
*punct* ,
independent
of
his
wife
*punct* ,
was
feared
by
nobody
*punct* ;
an
easy
*punct* ,
guidable
man
*punct* ,
to
be
persuaded
into
any
thing
by
his
nephew
*punct* .
*break*
all
that
remained
to
be
wished
was
*punct* ,
that
the
nephew
should
form
the
attachment
*punct* ,
as
*punct* ,
with
all
her
goodwill
in
the
cause
*punct* ,
emma
could
feel
no
certainty
of
its
being
already
formed
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
behaved
extremely
well
on
the
occasion
*punct* ,
with
great
self-command
*punct* .
*break*
what
ever
she
might
feel
of
brighter
hope
*punct* ,
she
betrayed
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
gratified
*punct* ,
to
observe
such
a
proof
in
her
of
strengthened
character
*punct* ,
and
refrained
from
any
allusion
that
might
endanger
its
maintenance
*punct* .
*break*
they
spoke
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
of
mrs.
churchill's
death
with
mutual
forbearance
*punct* .
*break*
short
letters
from
frank
were
received
at
randalls
*punct* ,
communicating
all
that
was
immediately
important
of
their
state
and
plans
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
churchill
was
better
than
could
be
expected
*punct* ;
and
their
first
removal
*punct* ,
on
the
departure
of
the
funeral
for
yorkshire
*punct* ,
was
to
be
to
the
house
of
a
very
old
friend
in
windsor
*punct* ,
to
whom
mr.
churchill
had
been
promising
a
visit
the
last
ten
years
*punct* .
*break*
at
present
*punct* ,
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
harriet
*punct* ;
good
wishes
for
the
future
were
all
that
could
yet
be
possible
on
emma's
side
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
more
pressing
concern
to
shew
attention
to
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
whose
prospects
were
closing
*punct* ,
while
harriet's
opened
*punct* ,
and
whose
engagements
now
allowed
of
no
delay
in
any
one
at
highbury
*punct* ,
who
wished
to
shew
her
kindness
*punct* ,
and
with
emma
it
was
grown
into
a
first
wish
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
scarcely
a
stronger
regret
than
for
her
past
coldness
*punct* ;
and
the
person
*punct* ,
whom
she
had
been
so
many
months
neglecting
*punct* ,
was
now
the
very
one
on
whom
she
would
have
lavished
every
distinction
of
regard
or
sympathy
*punct* .
*break*
she
wanted
to
be
of
use
to
her
*punct* ;
wanted
to
shew
a
value
for
her
society
*punct* ,
and
testify
respect
and
consideration
*punct* .
*break*
she
resolved
to
prevail
on
her
to
spend
a
day
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
a
note
was
written
to
urge
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
invitation
was
refused
*punct* ,
and
by
a
verbal
message
*punct* .
*break*
miss
fairfax
was
not
well
enough
to
write
*punct* ;
and
when
mr.
perry
called
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
the
same
morning
*punct* ,
it
appeared
that
she
was
so
much
indisposed
as
to
have
been
visited
*punct* ,
though
against
her
own
consent
*punct* ,
by
himself
*punct* ,
and
that
she
was
suffering
under
severe
headaches
*punct* ,
and
a
nervous
fever
to
a
degree
*punct* ,
which
made
him
doubt
the
possibility
of
her
going
to
mrs.
smallridge's
at
the
time
proposed
*punct* .
*break*
her
health
seemed
for
the
moment
completely
deranged
*punct* ,
appetite
quite
gone
*punct* ,
and
though
there
were
no
absolutely
alarming
symptoms
*punct* ,
nothing
touching
the
pulmonary
complaint
*punct* ,
which
was
the
standing
apprehension
of
the
family
*punct* ,
mr.
perry
was
uneasy
about
her
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
she
had
undertaken
more
than
she
was
equal
to
*punct* ,
and
that
she
felt
it
so
herself
*punct* ,
though
she
would
not
own
it
*punct* .
*break*
her
spirits
seemed
overcome
*punct* .
*break*
her
present
home
*punct* ,
he
could
not
but
observe
*punct* ,
was
unfavourable
to
a
nervous
disorder:
*punct* ,
confined
always
to
one
room;
*punct* ,
he
could
have
wished
it
otherwise
*punct* ,
and
her
good
aunt
*punct* ,
though
his
very
old
friend
*punct* ,
he
must
acknowledge
to
be
not
the
best
companion
for
an
invalid
of
that
description
*punct* .
*break*
her
care
and
attention
could
not
be
questioned
*punct* ;
they
were
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
only
too
great
*punct* .
*break*
he
very
much
feared
that
miss
fairfax
derived
more
evil
than
good
from
them
*punct* .
*break*
emma
listened
with
the
warmest
concern
*punct* ;
grieved
for
her
more
and
more
*punct* ,
and
looked
around
eager
to
discover
some
way
of
being
useful
*punct* .
*break*
to
take
her
*punct* ,
be
it
only
an
hour
or
two
*punct* ,
from
her
aunt
*punct* ,
to
give
her
change
of
air
and
scene
*punct* ,
and
quiet
rational
conversation
*punct* ,
even
for
an
hour
or
two
*punct* ,
might
do
her
good
*punct* ;
and
the
following
morning
she
wrote
again
to
say
*punct* ,
in
the
most
feeling
language
she
could
command
*punct* ,
that
she
would
call
for
her
in
the
carriage
at
any
hour
that
jane
would
name
*punct* ,
mentioning
that
she
had
mr.
perry's
decided
opinion
*punct* ,
in
favour
of
such
exercise
for
his
patient
*punct* .
*break*
the
answer
was
only
in
this
short
note
*punct* :
miss
fairfax's
compliments
and
thanks
*punct* ,
but
is
quite
unequal
to
any
exercise
*punct* .
*break*
emma
felt
that
her
own
note
had
deserved
something
better
*punct* ;
but
it
was
impossible
to
quarrel
with
words
*punct* ,
whose
tremulous
inequality
shewed
indisposition
so
plainly
*punct* ,
and
she
thought
only
of
how
she
might
best
counteract
this
unwillingness
to
be
seen
or
assisted
*punct* .
*break*
in
spite
of
the
answer
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
she
ordered
the
carriage
*punct* ,
and
drove
to
mrs.
bates's
*punct* ,
in
the
hope
that
jane
would
be
induced
to
join
her
*punct* ,
but
it
would
not
do;
*punct* ,
miss
bates
came
to
the
carriage
door
*punct* ,
all
gratitude
*punct* ,
and
agreeing
with
her
most
earnestly
in
thinking
an
airing
might
be
of
the
greatest
service
*punct* ,
and
every
thing
that
message
could
do
was
tried
*punct* ,
but
all
in
vain
*punct* .
*break*
miss
bates
was
obliged
to
return
without
success
*punct* ;
jane
was
quite
unpersuadable
*punct* ;
the
mere
proposal
of
going
out
seemed
to
make
her
worse.
*punct* ,
emma
wished
she
could
have
seen
her
*punct* ,
and
tried
her
own
powers
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
almost
before
she
could
hint
the
wish
*punct* ,
miss
bates
made
it
appear
that
she
had
promised
her
niece
on
no
account
to
let
miss
woodhouse
in
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
the
truth
was
*punct* ,
that
poor
dear
jane
could
not
bear
to
see
any
body
*punct* ,
any
body
at
all
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
could
not
be
denied
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
cole
had
made
such
a
point
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
perry
had
said
so
much
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
except
them
*punct* ,
jane
would
really
see
nobody
*punct* .
*break*
emma
did
not
want
to
be
classed
with
the
mrs.
eltons
*punct* ,
the
mrs.
perrys
*punct* ,
and
the
mrs.
coles
*punct* ,
who
would
force
themselves
anywhere
*punct* ;
neither
could
she
feel
any
right
of
preference
herself
*punct* ,
she
submitted
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
and
only
questioned
miss
bates
farther
as
to
her
niece's
appetite
and
diet
*punct* ,
which
she
longed
to
be
able
to
assist
*punct* .
*break*
on
that
subject
poor
miss
bates
was
very
unhappy
*punct* ,
and
very
communicative
*punct* ;
jane
would
hardly
eat
any
thing:
*punct* ,
mr.
perry
recommended
nourishing
food
*punct* ;
but
every
thing
they
could
command
*punct* ,
and
never
had
any
body
such
good
neighbours
*punct* ,
was
distasteful
*punct* .
*break*
emma
*punct* ,
on
reaching
home
*punct* ,
called
the
housekeeper
directly
*punct* ,
to
an
examination
of
her
stores
*punct* ;
and
some
arrowroot
of
very
superior
quality
was
speedily
despatched
to
miss
bates
with
a
most
friendly
note
*punct* .
*break*
in
half
an
hour
the
arrowroot
was
returned
*punct* ,
with
a
thousand
thanks
from
miss
bates
*punct* ,
but
dear
jane
would
not
be
satisfied
without
its
being
sent
back
*punct* ;
it
was
a
thing
she
could
not
take
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
she
insisted
on
her
saying
*punct* ,
that
she
was
not
at
all
in
want
of
any
thing
*punct* .
*break*
when
emma
afterwards
heard
that
jane
fairfax
had
been
seen
wandering
about
the
meadows
*punct* ,
at
some
distance
from
highbury
*punct* ,
on
the
afternoon
of
the
very
day
on
which
she
had
*punct* ,
under
the
plea
of
being
unequal
to
any
exercise
*punct* ,
so
peremptorily
refused
to
go
out
with
her
in
the
carriage
*punct* ,
she
could
have
no
doubt
*punct* ,
putting
every
thing
together
*punct* ,
that
jane
was
resolved
to
receive
no
kindness
from
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
sorry
*punct* ,
very
sorry
*punct* .
*break*
her
heart
was
grieved
for
a
state
which
seemed
but
the
more
pitiable
from
this
sort
of
irritation
of
spirits
*punct* ,
inconsistency
of
action
*punct* ,
and
inequality
of
powers
*punct* ;
and
it
mortified
her
that
she
was
given
so
little
credit
for
proper
feeling
*punct* ,
or
esteemed
so
little
worthy
as
a
friend
*punct* :
but
she
had
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
her
intentions
were
good
*punct* ,
and
of
being
able
to
say
to
herself
*punct* ,
that
could
mr.
knightley
have
been
privy
to
all
her
attempts
of
assisting
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
could
he
even
have
seen
into
her
heart
*punct* ,
he
would
not
*punct* ,
on
this
occasion
*punct* ,
have
found
any
thing
to
reprove
*punct* .
*break*
one
morning
*punct* ,
about
ten
days
after
mrs.
churchill's
decease
*punct* ,
emma
was
called
downstairs
to
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
who
could
not
stay
five
minutes
*punct* ,
and
wanted
particularly
to
speak
with
her.
*punct* ,
he
met
her
at
the
parlour-door
*punct* ,
and
hardly
asking
her
how
she
did
*punct* ,
in
the
natural
key
of
his
voice
*punct* ,
sunk
it
immediately
*punct* ,
to
say
*punct* ,
unheard
by
her
father
*punct* ,
can
you
come
to
randalls
at
any
time
this
morning?
*punct* ,
do
*punct* ,
if
it
be
possible
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
wants
to
see
you
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
see
you
*punct* .
*break*
is
she
unwell
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
not
at
all
*punct* ,
only
a
little
agitated
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
have
ordered
the
carriage
*punct* ,
and
come
to
you
*punct* ,
but
she
must
see
you
alone
*punct* ,
and
that
you
know
*punct* ,
nodding
towards
her
father
*punct* ,
humph!
*punct* ,
can
you
come
*punct* ?
*break*
this
moment
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
impossible
to
refuse
what
you
ask
in
such
a
way
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
can
be
the
matter?
*punct* ,
is
she
really
not
ill
*punct* ?
*break*
depend
upon
me
*punct* ,
but
ask
no
more
questions
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
know
it
all
in
time
*punct* .
*break*
the
most
unaccountable
business
*punct* !
*break*
but
hush
*punct* ,
hush
*punct* !
*break*
to
guess
what
all
this
meant
*punct* ,
was
impossible
even
for
emma
*punct* .
*break*
something
really
important
seemed
announced
by
his
looks
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
her
friend
was
well
*punct* ,
she
endeavoured
not
to
be
uneasy
*punct* ,
and
settling
it
with
her
father
*punct* ,
that
she
would
take
her
walk
now
*punct* ,
she
and
mr.
weston
were
soon
out
of
the
house
together
and
on
their
way
at
a
quick
pace
for
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
now,
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
when
they
were
fairly
beyond
the
sweep
gates,
*punct* ,
now
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
do
let
me
know
what
has
happened
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no,
*punct* ,
he
gravely
replied.
*punct* ,
don't
ask
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
promised
my
wife
to
leave
it
all
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
will
break
it
to
you
better
than
i
can
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
be
impatient
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ;
it
will
all
come
out
too
soon
*punct* .
*break*
break
it
to
me
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* ,
standing
still
with
terror.
*punct* ,
good
god!
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
tell
me
at
once.
*punct* ,
something
has
happened
in
brunswick
square
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
it
has
*punct* .
*break*
tell
me
*punct* ,
i
charge
you
tell
me
this
moment
what
it
is
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
indeed
you
are
mistaken.
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
do
not
trifle
with
me.
*punct* ,
consider
how
many
of
my
dearest
friends
are
now
in
brunswick
square
*punct* .
*break*
which
of
them
is
it?
*punct* ,
i
charge
you
by
all
that
is
sacred
*punct* ,
not
to
attempt
concealment
*punct* .
*break*
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
emma.
*punct* ,
your
word!
*punct* ,
why
not
your
honour!
*punct* ,
why
not
say
upon
your
honour
*punct* ,
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
them
*punct* ?
*break*
good
heavens!
*punct* ,
what
can
be
to
be
broke
to
me
*punct* ,
that
does
not
relate
to
one
of
that
family
*punct* ?
*break*
upon
my
honour
*punct* ,
said
he
very
seriously
*punct* ,
it
does
not
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
in
the
smallest
degree
connected
with
any
human
being
of
the
name
of
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
courage
returned
*punct* ,
and
she
walked
on
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
wrong
*punct* ,
he
continued
*punct* ,
in
talking
of
its
being
broke
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
not
have
used
the
expression
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
it
does
not
concern
you
*punct* ,
it
concerns
only
myself,
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
we
hope.
*punct* ,
humph!
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
there
is
no
occasion
to
be
so
uneasy
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
say
that
it
is
not
a
disagreeable
business
*punct* ,
but
things
might
be
much
worse.
*punct* ,
if
we
walk
fast
*punct* ,
we
shall
soon
be
at
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
emma
found
that
she
must
wait
*punct* ;
and
now
it
required
little
effort
*punct* .
*break*
she
asked
no
more
questions
therefore
*punct* ,
merely
employed
her
own
fancy
*punct* ,
and
that
soon
pointed
out
to
her
the
probability
of
its
being
some
money
concern
*punct* ,
something
just
come
to
light
*punct* ,
of
a
disagreeable
nature
in
the
circumstances
of
the
family,
*punct* ,
something
which
the
late
event
at
richmond
had
brought
forward
*punct* .
*break*
her
fancy
was
very
active
*punct* .
*break*
half
a
dozen
natural
children
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
and
poor
frank
cut
off!
*punct* ,
this
*punct* ,
though
very
undesirable
*punct* ,
would
be
no
matter
of
agony
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
it
inspired
little
more
than
an
animating
curiosity
*punct* .
*break*
who
is
that
gentleman
on
horseback
*punct* ?
*break*
said
she
*punct* ,
as
they
proceeded
*punct* ,
speaking
more
to
assist
mr.
weston
in
keeping
his
secret
*punct* ,
than
with
any
other
view
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know.
*punct* ,
one
of
the
otways.
*punct* ,
not
frank;
*punct* ,
it
is
not
frank
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
not
see
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
half
way
to
windsor
by
this
time
*punct* .
*break*
has
your
son
been
with
you
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
did
not
you
know?
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
never
mind
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
he
was
silent
*punct* ;
and
then
added
*punct* ,
in
a
tone
much
more
guarded
and
demure
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
frank
came
over
this
morning
*punct* ,
just
to
ask
us
how
we
did
*punct* .
*break*
they
hurried
on
*punct* ,
and
were
speedily
at
randalls.
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
as
they
entered
the
room
*punct* ,
i
have
brought
her
*punct* ,
and
now
i
hope
you
will
soon
be
better
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
leave
you
together
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
use
in
delay
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
not
be
far
off
*punct* ,
if
you
want
me.
*punct* ,
and
emma
distinctly
heard
him
add
*punct* ,
in
a
lower
tone
*punct* ,
before
he
quitted
the
room,
*punct* ,
i
have
been
as
good
as
my
word
*punct* .
*break*
she
has
not
the
least
idea
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
was
looking
so
ill
*punct* ,
and
had
an
air
of
so
much
perturbation
*punct* ,
that
emma's
uneasiness
increased
*punct* ;
and
the
moment
they
were
alone
*punct* ,
she
eagerly
said
*punct* ,
what
is
it
my
dear
friend
*punct* ?
*break*
something
of
a
very
unpleasant
nature
*punct* ,
i
find
*punct* ,
has
occurred;
*punct* ,
do
let
me
know
directly
what
it
is
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
been
walking
all
this
way
in
complete
suspense
*punct* .
*break*
we
both
abhor
suspense
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
let
mine
continue
longer
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
do
you
good
to
speak
of
your
distress
*punct* ,
whatever
it
may
be
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
indeed
no
idea
*punct* ?
*break*
said
mrs.
weston
in
a
trembling
voice
*punct* .
*break*
cannot
you
*punct* ,
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
cannot
you
form
a
guess
as
to
what
you
are
to
hear
*punct* ?
*break*
so
far
as
that
it
relates
to
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
i
do
guess
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
right
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
impossible
to
express
our
surprize
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
to
speak
to
his
father
on
a
subject,
*punct* ,
to
announce
an
attachment
*punct* ,
she
stopped
to
breathe
*punct* .
*break*
emma
thought
first
of
herself
*punct* ,
and
then
of
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
more
than
an
attachment
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
resumed
mrs.
weston
*punct* ;
an
engagement
*punct* ,
a
positive
engagement.
*punct* ,
what
will
you
say
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
what
will
any
body
say
*punct* ,
when
it
is
known
that
frank
churchill
and
miss
fairfax
are
engaged;
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
that
they
have
been
long
engaged
*punct* !
*break*
emma
even
jumped
with
surprize;
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
horror-struck
*punct* ,
exclaimed
*punct* ,
jane
fairfax!
*punct* ,
good
god
*punct* !
*break*
you
are
not
serious
*punct* ?
*break*
you
do
not
mean
it
*punct* ?
*break*
you
may
well
be
amazed
*punct* ,
returned
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
still
averting
her
eyes
*punct* ,
and
talking
on
with
eagerness
*punct* ,
that
emma
might
have
time
to
recover
*punct* ,
you
may
well
be
amazed
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
even
so
*punct* .
*break*
there
has
been
a
solemn
engagement
between
them
ever
since
october
*punct* ,
formed
at
weymouth
*punct* ,
and
kept
a
secret
from
every
body
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
creature
knowing
it
but
themselves
*punct* ,
neither
the
campbells
*punct* ,
nor
her
family
*punct* ,
nor
his.
*punct* ,
it
is
so
wonderful
*punct* ,
that
though
perfectly
convinced
of
the
fact
*punct* ,
it
is
yet
almost
incredible
to
myself
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
hardly
believe
it.
*punct* ,
i
thought
i
knew
him
*punct* .
*break*
emma
scarcely
heard
what
was
said.
*punct* ,
her
mind
was
divided
between
two
ideas
*punct* ,
her
own
former
conversations
with
him
about
miss
fairfax
*punct* ;
and
poor
harriet;
*punct* ,
and
for
some
time
she
could
only
exclaim
*punct* ,
and
require
confirmation
*punct* ,
repeated
confirmation
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
she
at
last
*punct* ,
trying
to
recover
herself
*punct* ;
this
is
a
circumstance
which
i
must
think
of
at
least
half
a
day
*punct* ,
before
i
can
at
all
comprehend
it
*punct* .
*break*
what!
*punct* ,
engaged
to
her
all
the
winter
*punct* ,
before
either
of
them
came
to
highbury
*punct* ?
*break*
engaged
since
october,
*punct* ,
secretly
engaged.
*punct* ,
it
has
hurt
me
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
very
much
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
hurt
his
father
equally
*punct* .
*break*
some
part
of
his
conduct
we
cannot
excuse
*punct* .
*break*
emma
pondered
a
moment
*punct* ,
and
then
replied
*punct* ,
i
will
not
pretend
not
to
understand
you
*punct* ;
and
to
give
you
all
the
relief
in
my
power
*punct* ,
be
assured
that
no
such
effect
has
followed
his
attentions
to
me
*punct* ,
as
you
are
apprehensive
of
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
looked
up
*punct* ,
afraid
to
believe
*punct* ;
but
emma's
countenance
was
as
steady
as
her
words
*punct* .
*break*
that
you
may
have
less
difficulty
in
believing
this
boast
*punct* ,
of
my
present
perfect
indifference
*punct* ,
she
continued
*punct* ,
i
will
farther
tell
you
*punct* ,
that
there
was
a
period
in
the
early
part
of
our
acquaintance
*punct* ,
when
i
did
like
him
*punct* ,
when
i
was
very
much
disposed
to
be
attached
to
him
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
was
attached
*punct* ,
and
how
it
came
to
cease
*punct* ,
is
perhaps
the
wonder
*punct* .
*break*
fortunately
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
it
did
cease
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
really
for
some
time
past
*punct* ,
for
at
least
these
three
months
*punct* ,
cared
nothing
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
believe
me
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
the
simple
truth
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
kissed
her
with
tears
of
joy
*punct* ;
and
when
she
could
find
utterance
*punct* ,
assured
her
*punct* ,
that
this
protestation
had
done
her
more
good
than
any
thing
else
in
the
world
could
do
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
will
be
almost
as
much
relieved
as
myself
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
point
we
have
been
wretched
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
our
darling
wish
that
you
might
be
attached
to
each
other
*punct* ,
and
we
were
persuaded
that
it
was
so.
*punct* ,
imagine
what
we
have
been
feeling
on
your
account
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
escaped
*punct* ;
and
that
i
should
escape
*punct* ,
may
be
a
matter
of
grateful
wonder
to
you
and
myself
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
does
not
acquit
him
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ;
and
i
must
say
*punct* ,
that
i
think
him
greatly
to
blame
*punct* .
*break*
what
right
had
he
to
come
among
us
with
affection
and
faith
engaged
*punct* ,
and
with
manners
so
very
disengaged
*punct* ?
*break*
what
right
had
he
to
endeavour
to
please
*punct* ,
as
he
certainly
did
*punct* ,
to
distinguish
any
one
young
woman
with
persevering
attention
*punct* ,
as
he
certainly
did
*punct* ,
while
he
really
belonged
to
another?
*punct* ,
how
could
he
tell
what
mischief
he
might
be
doing?
*punct* ,
how
could
he
tell
that
he
might
not
be
making
me
in
love
with
him?
*punct* ,
very
wrong
*punct* ,
very
wrong
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
from
something
that
he
said
*punct* ,
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
i
rather
imagine
*punct* ,
and
how
could
she
bear
such
behaviour
*punct* !
*break*
composure
with
a
witness
*punct* !
*break*
to
look
on
*punct* ,
while
repeated
attentions
were
offering
to
another
woman
*punct* ,
before
her
face
*punct* ,
and
not
resent
it.
*punct* ,
that
is
a
degree
of
placidity
*punct* ,
which
i
can
neither
comprehend
nor
respect
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
misunderstandings
between
them
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ;
he
said
so
expressly
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
not
time
to
enter
into
much
explanation
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
here
only
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*punct* ,
and
in
a
state
of
agitation
which
did
not
allow
the
full
use
even
of
the
time
he
could
stay
*punct* ,
but
that
there
had
been
misunderstandings
he
decidedly
said
*punct* .
*break*
the
present
crisis
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
seemed
to
be
brought
on
by
them
*punct* ;
and
those
misunderstandings
might
very
possibly
arise
from
the
impropriety
of
his
conduct
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
it
is
too
calm
a
censure
*punct* .
*break*
much
*punct* ,
much
beyond
impropriety!
*punct* ,
it
has
sunk
him
*punct* ,
i
cannot
say
how
it
has
sunk
him
in
my
opinion
*punct* .
*break*
so
unlike
what
a
man
should
be!
*punct* ,
none
of
that
upright
integrity
*punct* ,
that
strict
adherence
to
truth
and
principle
*punct* ,
that
disdain
of
trick
and
littleness
*punct* ,
which
a
man
should
display
in
every
transaction
of
his
life
*punct* .
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
dear
emma
*punct* ,
now
i
must
take
his
part
*punct* ;
for
though
he
has
been
wrong
in
this
instance
*punct* ,
i
have
known
him
long
enough
to
answer
for
his
having
many
*punct* ,
very
many
*punct* ,
good
qualities
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
good
god
*punct* !
*break*
cried
emma
*punct* ,
not
attending
to
her.
*punct* ,
mrs.
smallridge
*punct* ,
too
*punct* !
*break*
jane
actually
on
the
point
of
going
as
governess
*punct* !
*break*
what
could
he
mean
by
such
horrible
indelicacy
*punct* ?
*break*
to
suffer
her
to
engage
herself
*punct* ,
to
suffer
her
even
to
think
of
such
a
measure
*punct* !
*break*
he
knew
nothing
about
it
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
article
i
can
fully
acquit
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
private
resolution
of
hers
*punct* ,
not
communicated
to
him
*punct* ,
or
at
least
not
communicated
in
a
way
to
carry
conviction.
*punct* ,
till
yesterday
*punct* ,
i
know
he
said
he
was
in
the
dark
as
to
her
plans
*punct* .
*break*
they
burst
on
him
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
how
*punct* ,
but
by
some
letter
or
message
*punct* ,
and
it
was
the
discovery
of
what
she
was
doing
*punct* ,
of
this
very
project
of
hers
*punct* ,
which
determined
him
to
come
forward
at
once
*punct* ,
own
it
all
to
his
uncle
*punct* ,
throw
himself
on
his
kindness
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
put
an
end
to
the
miserable
state
of
concealment
that
had
been
carrying
on
so
long
*punct* .
*break*
emma
began
to
listen
better
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
to
hear
from
him
soon
*punct* ,
continued
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
he
told
me
at
parting
*punct* ,
that
he
should
soon
write
*punct* ;
and
he
spoke
in
a
manner
which
seemed
to
promise
me
many
particulars
that
could
not
be
given
now
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
wait
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
for
this
letter
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
bring
many
extenuations
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
make
many
things
intelligible
and
excusable
which
now
are
not
to
be
understood
*punct* .
*break*
don't
let
us
be
severe
*punct* ,
don't
let
us
be
in
a
hurry
to
condemn
him
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
have
patience
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
love
him
*punct* ;
and
now
that
i
am
satisfied
on
one
point
*punct* ,
the
one
material
point
*punct* ,
i
am
sin
cerely
anxious
for
its
all
turning
out
well
*punct* ,
and
ready
to
hope
that
it
may
*punct* .
*break*
they
must
both
have
suffered
a
great
deal
under
such
a
system
of
secresy
and
concealment
*punct* .
*break*
his
sufferings
*punct* ,
replied
emma
dryly
*punct* ,
do
not
appear
to
have
done
him
much
harm
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
and
how
did
mr.
churchill
take
it
*punct* ?
*break*
most
favourably
for
his
nephew
*punct* ,
gave
his
consent
with
scarcely
a
difficulty
*punct* .
*break*
conceive
what
the
events
of
a
week
have
done
in
that
family
*punct* !
*break*
while
poor
mrs.
churchill
lived
*punct* ,
i
suppose
there
could
not
have
been
a
hope
*punct* ,
a
chance
*punct* ,
a
possibility;
*punct* ,
but
scarcely
are
her
remains
at
rest
in
the
family
vault
*punct* ,
than
her
husband
is
persuaded
to
act
exactly
opposite
to
what
she
would
have
required
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
blessing
it
is
*punct* ,
when
undue
influence
does
not
survive
the
grave!
*punct* ,
he
gave
his
consent
with
very
little
persuasion
*punct* .
*break*
thought
emma
*punct* ,
he
would
have
done
as
much
for
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
settled
last
night
*punct* ,
and
frank
was
off
with
the
light
this
morning
*punct* .
*break*
he
stopped
at
highbury
*punct* ,
at
the
bates's
*punct* ,
i
fancy
*punct* ,
some
time
*punct* ,
and
then
came
on
hither
*punct* ;
but
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
back
to
his
uncle
*punct* ,
to
whom
he
is
just
now
more
necessary
than
ever
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
as
i
tell
you
*punct* ,
he
could
stay
with
us
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour.
*punct* ,
he
was
very
much
agitated
*punct* ,
very
much
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
to
a
degree
that
made
him
appear
quite
a
different
creature
from
any
thing
i
had
ever
seen
him
before.
*punct* ,
in
addition
to
all
the
rest
*punct* ,
there
had
been
the
shock
of
finding
her
so
very
unwell
*punct* ,
which
he
had
had
no
previous
suspicion
of
*punct* ,
and
there
was
every
appearance
of
his
having
been
feeling
a
great
deal
*punct* .
*break*
and
do
you
really
believe
the
affair
to
have
been
carrying
on
with
such
perfect
secresy?
*punct* ,
the
campbells
*punct* ,
the
dixons
*punct* ,
did
none
of
them
know
of
the
engagement
*punct* ?
*break*
emma
could
not
speak
the
name
of
dixon
without
a
little
blush
*punct* .
*break*
none
*punct* ;
not
one
*punct* .
*break*
he
positively
said
that
it
had
been
known
to
no
being
in
the
world
but
their
two
selves
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
i
suppose
we
shall
gradually
grow
reconciled
to
the
idea
*punct* ,
and
i
wish
them
very
happy
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
shall
always
think
it
a
very
abominable
sort
of
proceeding
*punct* .
*break*
what
has
it
been
but
a
system
of
hypocrisy
and
deceit,
*punct* ,
espionage
*punct* ,
and
treachery?
*punct* ,
to
come
among
us
with
professions
of
openness
and
simplicity
*punct* ;
and
such
a
league
in
secret
to
judge
us
all!
*punct* ,
here
have
we
been
*punct* ,
the
whole
winter
and
spring
*punct* ,
completely
duped
*punct* ,
fancying
ourselves
all
on
an
equal
footing
of
truth
and
honour
*punct* ,
with
two
people
in
the
midst
of
us
who
may
have
been
carrying
round
*punct* ,
comparing
and
sitting
in
judgment
on
sentiments
and
words
that
were
never
meant
for
both
to
hear.
*punct* ,
they
must
take
the
consequence
*punct* ,
if
they
have
heard
each
other
spoken
of
in
a
way
not
perfectly
agreeable
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
quite
easy
on
that
head
*punct* ,
replied
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
very
sure
that
i
never
said
any
thing
of
either
to
the
other
*punct* ,
which
both
might
not
have
heard
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
in
luck.
*punct* ,
your
only
blunder
was
confined
to
my
ear
*punct* ,
when
you
imagined
a
certain
friend
of
ours
in
love
with
the
lady
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
i
have
always
had
a
thoroughly
good
opinion
of
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
i
never
could
*punct* ,
under
any
blunder
*punct* ,
have
spoken
ill
of
her
*punct* ;
and
as
to
speaking
ill
of
him
*punct* ,
there
i
must
have
been
safe
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
moment
mr.
weston
appeared
at
a
little
distance
from
the
window
*punct* ,
evidently
on
the
watch
*punct* .
*break*
his
wife
gave
him
a
look
which
invited
him
in
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
while
he
was
coming
round
*punct* ,
added
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
dearest
emma
*punct* ,
let
me
intreat
you
to
say
and
look
every
thing
that
may
set
his
heart
at
ease
*punct* ,
and
incline
him
to
be
satisfied
with
the
match
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
make
the
best
of
it
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
almost
every
thing
may
be
fairly
said
in
her
favour
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
a
connexion
to
gratify
*punct* ;
but
if
mr.
churchill
does
not
feel
that
*punct* ,
why
should
we
*punct* ?
*break*
and
it
may
be
a
very
fortunate
circumstance
for
him
*punct* ,
for
frank
*punct* ,
i
mean
*punct* ,
that
he
should
have
attached
himself
to
a
girl
of
such
steadiness
of
character
and
good
judgment
as
i
have
always
given
her
credit
for
*punct* ,
and
still
am
disposed
to
give
her
credit
for
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
this
one
great
deviation
from
the
strict
rule
of
right
*punct* .
*break*
and
how
much
may
be
said
in
her
situation
for
even
that
error
*punct* !
*break*
much
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
cried
emma
feelingly
*punct* .
*break*
if
a
woman
can
ever
be
excused
for
thinking
only
of
herself
*punct* ,
it
is
in
a
situation
like
jane
fairfax's.
*punct* ,
of
such
*punct* ,
one
may
almost
say
*punct* ,
that
the
world
is
not
their's
*punct* ,
nor
the
world's
law
*punct* .
*break*
she
met
mr.
weston
on
his
entrance
*punct* ,
with
a
smiling
countenance
*punct* ,
exclaiming
*punct* ,
a
very
pretty
trick
you
have
been
playing
me
*punct* ,
upon
my
word
*punct* !
*break*
this
was
a
device
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
to
sport
with
my
curiosity
*punct* ,
and
exercise
my
talent
of
guessing
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
really
frightened
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
you
had
lost
half
your
property
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* .
*break*
and
here
*punct* ,
instead
of
its
being
a
matter
of
condolence
*punct* ,
it
turns
out
to
be
one
of
congratulation.
*punct* ,
i
congratulate
you
*punct* ,
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
with
all
my
heart
*punct* ,
on
the
prospect
of
having
one
of
the
most
lovely
and
accomplished
young
women
in
england
for
your
daughter
*punct* .
*break*
a
glance
or
two
between
him
and
his
wife
*punct* ,
convinced
him
that
all
was
as
right
as
this
speech
proclaimed
*punct* ;
and
its
happy
effect
on
his
spirits
was
immediate
*punct* .
*break*
his
air
and
voice
recovered
their
usual
briskness
*punct* :
he
shook
her
heartily
and
gratefully
by
the
hand
*punct* ,
and
entered
on
the
subject
in
a
manner
to
prove
*punct* ,
that
he
now
only
wanted
time
and
persuasion
to
think
the
engagement
no
very
bad
thing
*punct* .
*break*
his
companions
suggested
only
what
could
palliate
imprudence
*punct* ,
or
smooth
objections
*punct* ;
and
by
the
time
they
had
talked
it
all
over
together
*punct* ,
and
he
had
talked
it
all
over
again
with
emma
*punct* ,
in
their
walk
back
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
he
was
become
perfectly
reconciled
*punct* ,
and
not
far
from
thinking
it
the
very
best
thing
that
frank
could
possibly
have
done
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
*punct* ,
poor
harriet!
*punct* ,
those
were
the
words
*punct* ;
in
them
lay
the
tormenting
ideas
which
emma
could
not
get
rid
of
*punct* ,
and
which
constituted
the
real
misery
of
the
business
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
frank
churchill
had
behaved
very
ill
by
herself
*punct* ,
very
ill
in
many
ways,
*punct* ,
but
it
was
not
so
much
his
behaviour
as
her
own
*punct* ,
which
made
her
so
angry
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
scrape
which
he
had
drawn
her
into
on
harriet's
account
*punct* ,
that
gave
the
deepest
hue
to
his
offence.
*punct* ,
poor
harriet
*punct* !
*break*
to
be
a
second
time
the
dupe
of
her
misconceptions
and
flattery
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
had
spoken
prophetically
*punct* ,
when
he
once
said
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
you
have
been
no
friend
to
harriet
smith.
*punct* ,
she
was
afraid
she
had
done
her
nothing
but
disservice.
*punct* ,
it
was
true
that
she
had
not
to
charge
herself
*punct* ,
in
this
instance
as
in
the
former
*punct* ,
with
being
the
sole
and
original
author
of
the
mischief
*punct* ;
with
having
suggested
such
feelings
as
might
otherwise
never
have
entered
harriet's
imagination
*punct* ;
for
harriet
had
acknowledged
her
admiration
and
preference
of
frank
churchill
before
she
had
ever
given
her
a
hint
on
the
subject
*punct* ;
but
she
felt
completely
guilty
of
having
encouraged
what
she
might
have
repressed
*punct* .
*break*
she
might
have
prevented
the
indulgence
and
increase
of
such
sentiments
*punct* .
*break*
her
influence
would
have
been
enough
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
she
was
very
conscious
that
she
ought
to
have
prevented
them.
*punct* ,
she
felt
that
she
had
been
risking
her
friend's
happiness
on
most
insufficient
grounds
*punct* .
*break*
common
sense
would
have
directed
her
to
tell
harriet
*punct* ,
that
she
must
not
allow
herself
to
think
of
him
*punct* ,
and
that
there
were
five
hundred
chances
to
one
against
his
ever
caring
for
her.
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
with
common
sense
*punct* ,
she
added
*punct* ,
i
am
afraid
i
have
had
little
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
extremely
angry
with
herself
*punct* .
*break*
if
she
could
not
have
been
angry
with
frank
churchill
too
*punct* ,
it
would
have
been
dreadful.
*punct* ,
as
for
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
she
might
at
least
relieve
her
feelings
from
any
present
solicitude
on
her
account
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
would
be
anxiety
enough
*punct* ;
she
need
no
longer
be
unhappy
about
jane
*punct* ,
whose
troubles
and
whose
ill-health
having
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
the
same
origin
*punct* ,
must
be
equally
under
cure.
*punct* ,
her
days
of
insignificance
and
evil
were
over.
*punct* ,
she
would
soon
be
well
*punct* ,
and
happy
*punct* ,
and
prosperous.
*punct* ,
emma
could
now
imagine
why
her
own
attentions
had
been
slighted
*punct* .
*break*
this
discovery
laid
many
smaller
matters
open
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
it
had
been
from
jealousy.
*punct* ,
in
jane's
eyes
she
had
been
a
rival
*punct* ;
and
well
might
any
thing
she
could
offer
of
assistance
or
regard
be
repulsed
*punct* .
*break*
an
airing
in
the
hartfield
carriage
would
have
been
the
rack
*punct* ,
and
arrowroot
from
the
hartfield
storeroom
must
have
been
poison
*punct* .
*break*
she
understood
it
all
*punct* ;
and
as
far
as
her
mind
could
disengage
itself
from
the
injustice
and
selfishness
of
angry
feelings
*punct* ,
she
acknowledged
that
jane
fairfax
would
have
neither
elevation
nor
happiness
beyond
her
desert
*punct* .
*break*
but
poor
harriet
was
such
an
engrossing
charge
*punct* !
*break*
there
was
little
sympathy
to
be
spared
for
any
body
else
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
sadly
fearful
that
this
second
disappointment
would
be
more
severe
than
the
first
*punct* .
*break*
considering
the
very
superior
claims
of
the
object
*punct* ,
it
ought
*punct* ;
and
judging
by
its
apparently
stronger
effect
on
harriet's
mind
*punct* ,
producing
reserve
and
self-command
*punct* ,
it
would.
*punct* ,
she
must
communicate
the
painful
truth
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
and
as
soon
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
an
injunction
of
secresy
had
been
among
mr.
weston's
parting
words
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
present
*punct* ,
the
whole
affair
was
to
be
completely
a
secret
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
churchill
had
made
a
point
of
it
*punct* ,
as
a
token
of
respect
to
the
wife
he
had
so
very
recently
lost
*punct* ;
and
every
body
admitted
it
to
be
no
more
than
due
decorum.
*punct* ,
emma
had
promised
*punct* ;
but
still
harriet
must
be
excepted
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
her
superior
duty
*punct* .
*break*
in
spite
of
her
vexation
*punct* ,
she
could
not
help
feeling
it
almost
ridiculous
*punct* ,
that
she
should
have
the
very
same
distressing
and
delicate
office
to
perform
by
harriet
*punct* ,
which
mrs.
weston
had
just
gone
through
by
herself
*punct* .
*break*
the
intelligence
*punct* ,
which
had
been
so
anxiously
announced
to
her
*punct* ,
she
was
now
to
be
anxiously
announcing
to
another
*punct* .
*break*
her
heart
beat
quick
on
hearing
harriet's
footstep
and
voice
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
she
supposed
*punct* ,
had
poor
mrs.
weston
felt
when
she
was
approaching
randalls
*punct* .
*break*
could
the
event
of
the
disclosure
bear
an
equal
resemblance!
*punct* ,
but
of
that
*punct* ,
unfortunately
*punct* ,
there
could
be
no
chance
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* !
*break*
cried
harriet
*punct* ,
coming
eagerly
into
the
room
*punct* ,
is
not
this
the
oddest
news
that
ever
was
*punct* ?
*break*
what
news
do
you
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
replied
emma
*punct* ,
unable
to
guess
*punct* ,
by
look
or
voice
*punct* ,
whether
harriet
could
indeed
have
received
any
hint
*punct* .
*break*
about
jane
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
ever
hear
any
thing
so
strange
*punct* ?
*break*
oh!
*punct* ,
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
owning
it
to
me
*punct* ,
for
mr.
weston
has
told
me
himself
*punct* .
*break*
i
met
him
just
now
*punct* .
*break*
he
told
me
it
was
to
be
a
great
secret
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
i
should
not
think
of
mentioning
it
to
any
body
but
you
*punct* ,
but
he
said
you
knew
it
*punct* .
*break*
what
did
mr.
weston
tell
you?
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
still
perplexed
*punct* .
*break*
he
told
me
all
about
it
*punct* ;
that
jane
fairfax
and
mr.
frank
churchill
are
to
be
married
*punct* ,
and
that
they
have
been
privately
engaged
to
one
another
this
long
while
*punct* .
*break*
how
very
odd
*punct* !
*break*
it
was
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
so
odd
*punct* ;
harriet's
behaviour
was
so
extremely
odd
*punct* ,
that
emma
did
not
know
how
to
understand
it
*punct* .
*break*
her
character
appeared
absolutely
changed
*punct* .
*break*
she
seemed
to
propose
shewing
no
agitation
*punct* ,
or
disappointment
*punct* ,
or
peculiar
concern
in
the
discovery
*punct* .
*break*
emma
looked
at
her
*punct* ,
quite
unable
to
speak
*punct* .
*break*
had
you
any
idea
*punct* ,
cried
harriet
*punct* ,
of
his
being
in
love
with
her?
*punct* ,
you
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
might.
*punct* ,
you
*punct* ,
blushing
as
she
spoke
*punct* ,
who
can
see
into
every
body's
heart
*punct* ;
but
nobody
else
*punct* ,
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
i
begin
to
doubt
my
having
any
such
talent
*punct* .
*break*
can
you
seriously
ask
me
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
whether
i
imagined
him
attached
to
another
woman
at
the
very
time
that
i
was
*punct* ,
tacitly
*punct* ,
if
not
openly
*punct* ,
encouraging
you
to
give
way
to
your
own
feelings?
*punct* ,
i
never
had
the
slightest
suspicion
*punct* ,
till
within
the
last
hour
*punct* ,
of
mr.
frank
churchill's
having
the
least
regard
for
jane
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
be
very
sure
that
if
i
had
*punct* ,
i
should
have
cautioned
you
accordingly
*punct* .
*break*
cried
harriet
*punct* ,
colouring
*punct* ,
and
astonished
*punct* .
*break*
why
should
you
caution
me?
*punct* ,
you
do
not
think
i
care
about
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
delighted
to
hear
you
speak
so
stoutly
on
the
subject
*punct* ,
replied
emma
*punct* ,
smiling
*punct* ;
but
you
do
not
mean
to
deny
that
there
was
a
time
*punct* ,
and
not
very
distant
either
*punct* ,
when
you
gave
me
reason
to
understand
that
you
did
care
about
him
*punct* ?
*break*
him!
*punct* ,
never
*punct* ,
never
*punct* .
*break*
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
how
could
you
so
mistake
me
*punct* ?
*break*
turning
away
distressed
*punct* .
*break*
cried
emma
*punct* ,
after
a
moment's
pause
*punct* ,
what
do
you
mean?
*punct* ,
good
heaven
*punct* !
*break*
what
do
you
mean?
*punct* ,
mistake
you!
*punct* ,
am
i
to
suppose
then?
*punct* ,
she
could
not
speak
another
word.
*punct* ,
her
voice
was
lost
*punct* ;
and
she
sat
down
*punct* ,
waiting
in
great
terror
till
harriet
should
answer
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
*punct* ,
who
was
standing
at
some
distance
*punct* ,
and
with
face
turned
from
her
*punct* ,
did
not
immediately
say
any
thing
*punct* ;
and
when
she
did
speak
*punct* ,
it
was
in
a
voice
nearly
as
agitated
as
emma's
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
*punct* ,
she
began
*punct* ,
that
you
could
have
misunderstood
me
*punct* !
*break*
i
know
we
agreed
never
to
name
him
*punct* ,
but
considering
how
infinitely
superior
he
is
to
every
body
else
*punct* ,
i
should
not
have
thought
it
possible
that
i
could
be
supposed
to
mean
any
other
person
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
i
do
not
know
who
would
ever
look
at
him
in
the
company
of
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
i
have
a
better
taste
than
to
think
of
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
who
is
like
nobody
by
his
side
*punct* .
*break*
and
that
you
should
have
been
so
mistaken
*punct* ,
is
amazing!
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* ,
but
for
believing
that
you
entirely
approved
and
meant
to
encourage
me
in
my
attachment
*punct* ,
i
should
have
considered
it
at
first
too
great
a
presumption
almost
*punct* ,
to
dare
to
think
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
cried
emma
*punct* ,
collecting
herself
resolutely
*punct* ,
let
us
understand
each
other
now
*punct* ,
without
the
possibility
of
farther
mistake
*punct* .
*break*
are
you
speaking
of
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ?
*break*
to
be
sure
i
am
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
could
have
an
idea
of
any
body
else
*punct* ,
and
so
i
thought
you
knew
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
talked
about
him
*punct* ,
it
was
as
clear
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
not
quite
*punct* ,
returned
emma
*punct* ,
with
forced
calmness
*punct* ,
for
all
that
you
then
said
*punct* ,
appeared
to
me
to
relate
to
a
different
person
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
almost
assert
that
you
had
named
mr.
frank
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
the
service
mr.
frank
churchill
had
rendered
you
*punct* ,
in
protecting
you
from
the
gipsies
*punct* ,
was
spoken
of
*punct* .
*break*
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
how
you
do
forget
*punct* !
*break*
my
dear
harriet
*punct* ,
i
perfectly
remember
the
substance
of
what
i
said
on
the
occasion
*punct* .
*break*
i
told
you
that
i
did
not
wonder
at
your
attachment
*punct* ;
that
considering
the
service
he
had
rendered
you
*punct* ,
it
was
extremely
natural:
*punct* ,
and
you
agreed
to
it
*punct* ,
expressing
yourself
very
warmly
as
to
your
sense
of
that
service
*punct* ,
and
mentioning
even
what
your
sensations
had
been
in
seeing
him
come
forward
to
your
rescue.
*punct* ,
the
impression
of
it
is
strong
on
my
memory
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
dear
*punct* ,
cried
harriet
*punct* ,
now
i
recollect
what
you
mean
*punct* ;
but
i
was
thinking
of
something
very
different
at
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
the
gipsies
*punct* ,
it
was
not
mr.
frank
churchill
that
i
meant
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
with
some
elevation
*punct* ,
i
was
thinking
of
a
much
more
precious
circumstance
*punct* ,
of
mr.
knightley's
coming
and
asking
me
to
dance
*punct* ,
when
mr.
elton
would
not
stand
up
with
me
*punct* ;
and
when
there
was
no
other
partner
in
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
the
kind
action
*punct* ;
that
was
the
noble
benevolence
and
generosity
*punct* ;
that
was
the
service
which
made
me
begin
to
feel
how
superior
he
was
to
every
other
being
upon
earth
*punct* .
*break*
cried
emma
*punct* ,
this
has
been
a
most
unfortunate
*punct* ,
most
deplorable
mistake!
*punct* ,
what
is
to
be
done
*punct* ?
*break*
you
would
not
have
encouraged
me
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
if
you
had
understood
me
*punct* ?
*break*
at
least
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
i
cannot
be
worse
off
than
i
should
have
been
*punct* ,
if
the
other
had
been
the
person
*punct* ;
and
now
*punct* ,
it
is
possible
*punct* ,
she
paused
a
few
moments
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
speak
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
wonder
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
she
resumed
*punct* ,
that
you
should
feel
a
great
difference
between
the
two
*punct* ,
as
to
me
or
as
to
any
body
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
think
one
five
hundred
million
times
more
above
me
than
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
know
they
were
your
own
words
*punct* ,
that
more
wonderful
things
had
happened
*punct* ,
matches
of
greater
disparity
had
taken
place
than
between
mr.
frank
churchill
and
me
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
it
seems
as
if
such
a
thing
even
as
this
*punct* ,
may
have
occurred
before
*punct* ,
and
if
i
should
be
so
fortunate
*punct* ,
beyond
expression
*punct* ,
as
to
*punct* ,
if
mr.
knightley
should
really
*punct* ,
if
he
does
not
mind
the
disparity
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ,
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
you
will
not
set
yourself
against
it
*punct* ,
and
try
to
put
difficulties
in
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
are
too
good
for
that
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
was
standing
at
one
of
the
windows
*punct* .
*break*
emma
turned
round
to
look
at
her
in
consternation
*punct* ,
and
hastily
said
*punct* ,
have
you
any
idea
of
mr.
knightley's
returning
your
affection
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
replied
harriet
modestly
*punct* ,
but
not
fearfully
*punct* ,
i
must
say
that
i
have
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
eyes
were
instantly
withdrawn
*punct* ;
and
she
sat
silently
meditating
*punct* ,
in
a
fixed
attitude
*punct* ,
for
a
few
minutes
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
minutes
were
sufficient
for
making
her
acquainted
with
her
own
heart
*punct* .
*break*
a
mind
like
hers
*punct* ,
once
opening
to
suspicion
*punct* ,
made
rapid
progress
*punct* .
*break*
she
touched
*punct* ,
she
admitted
*punct* ,
she
acknowledged
the
whole
truth
*punct* .
*break*
why
was
it
so
much
worse
that
harriet
should
be
in
love
with
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
than
with
frank
churchill
*punct* ?
*break*
why
was
the
evil
so
dreadfully
increased
by
harriet's
having
some
hope
of
a
return
*punct* ?
*break*
it
darted
through
her
*punct* ,
with
the
speed
of
an
arrow
*punct* ,
that
mr.
knightley
must
marry
no
one
but
herself
*punct* !
*break*
her
own
conduct
*punct* ,
as
well
as
her
own
heart
*punct* ,
was
before
her
in
the
same
few
minutes
*punct* .
*break*
she
saw
it
all
with
a
clearness
which
had
never
blessed
her
before
*punct* .
*break*
how
improperly
had
she
been
acting
by
harriet
*punct* !
*break*
how
inconsiderate
*punct* ,
how
indelicate
*punct* ,
how
irrational
*punct* ,
how
unfeeling
had
been
her
conduct
*punct* !
*break*
what
blindness
*punct* ,
what
madness
*punct* ,
had
led
her
on
*punct* !
*break*
it
struck
her
with
dreadful
force
*punct* ,
and
she
was
ready
to
give
it
every
bad
name
in
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
some
portion
of
respect
for
herself
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
all
these
demerits
*punct* ,
some
concern
for
her
own
appearance
*punct* ,
and
a
strong
sense
of
justice
by
harriet
*punct* ,
there
would
be
no
need
of
compassion
to
the
girl
who
believed
herself
loved
by
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
but
justice
required
that
she
should
not
be
made
unhappy
by
any
coldness
now,
*punct* ,
gave
emma
the
resolution
to
sit
and
endure
farther
with
calmness
*punct* ,
with
even
apparent
kindness.
*punct* ,
for
her
own
advantage
indeed
*punct* ,
it
was
fit
that
the
utmost
extent
of
harriet's
hopes
should
be
enquired
into
*punct* ;
and
harriet
had
done
nothing
to
forfeit
the
regard
and
interest
which
had
been
so
voluntarily
formed
and
maintained
*punct* ,
or
to
deserve
to
be
slighted
by
the
person
*punct* ,
whose
counsels
had
never
led
her
right.
*punct* ,
rousing
from
reflection
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
and
subduing
her
emotion
*punct* ,
she
turned
to
harriet
again
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
a
more
inviting
accent
*punct* ,
renewed
the
conversation
*punct* ;
for
as
to
the
subject
which
had
first
introduced
it
*punct* ,
the
wonderful
story
of
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
that
was
quite
sunk
and
lost.
*punct* ,
neither
of
them
thought
but
of
mr.
knightley
and
themselves
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
*punct* ,
who
had
been
standing
in
no
unhappy
reverie
*punct* ,
was
yet
very
glad
to
be
called
from
it
*punct* ,
by
the
now
encouraging
manner
of
such
a
judge
*punct* ,
and
such
a
friend
as
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
and
only
wanted
invitation
*punct* ,
to
give
the
history
of
her
hopes
with
great
*punct* ,
though
trembling
delight.
*punct* ,
emma's
tremblings
as
she
asked
*punct* ,
and
as
she
listened
*punct* ,
were
better
concealed
than
harriet's
*punct* ,
but
they
were
not
less
*punct* .
*break*
her
voice
was
not
unsteady
*punct* ;
but
her
mind
was
in
all
the
perturbation
that
such
a
development
of
self
*punct* ,
such
a
burst
of
threatening
evil
*punct* ,
such
a
confusion
of
sudden
and
perplexing
emotions
*punct* ,
must
create.
*punct* ,
she
listened
with
much
inward
suffering
*punct* ,
but
with
great
outward
patience
*punct* ,
to
harriet's
detail.
*punct* ,
methodical
*punct* ,
or
well
arranged
*punct* ,
or
very
well
delivered
*punct* ,
it
could
not
be
expected
to
be
*punct* ;
but
it
contained
*punct* ,
when
separated
from
all
the
feebleness
and
tautology
of
the
narration
*punct* ,
a
substance
to
sink
her
spirit
*punct* ,
especially
with
the
corroborating
circumstances
*punct* ,
which
her
own
memory
brought
in
favour
of
mr.
knightley's
most
improved
opinion
of
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
had
been
conscious
of
a
difference
in
his
behaviour
ever
since
those
two
decisive
dances.
*punct* ,
emma
knew
that
he
had
*punct* ,
on
that
occasion
*punct* ,
found
her
much
superior
to
his
expectation
*punct* .
*break*
from
that
evening
*punct* ,
or
at
least
from
the
time
of
miss
woodhouse's
encouraging
her
to
think
of
him
*punct* ,
harriet
had
begun
to
be
sensible
of
his
talking
to
her
much
more
than
he
had
been
used
to
do
*punct* ,
and
of
his
having
indeed
quite
a
different
manner
towards
her
*punct* ;
a
manner
of
kindness
and
sweetness!
*punct* ,
latterly
she
had
been
more
and
more
aware
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
when
they
had
been
all
walking
together
*punct* ,
he
had
so
often
come
and
walked
by
her
*punct* ,
and
talked
so
very
delightfully!
*punct* ,
he
seemed
to
want
to
be
acquainted
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
emma
knew
it
to
have
been
very
much
the
case
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
often
observed
the
change
*punct* ,
to
almost
the
same
extent.
*punct* ,
harriet
repeated
expressions
of
approbation
and
praise
from
him
*punct* ,
and
emma
felt
them
to
be
in
the
closest
agreement
with
what
she
had
known
of
his
opinion
of
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
he
praised
her
for
being
without
art
or
affectation
*punct* ,
for
having
simple
*punct* ,
honest
*punct* ,
generous
*punct* ,
feelings.
*punct* ,
she
knew
that
he
saw
such
recommendations
in
harriet
*punct* ;
he
had
dwelt
on
them
to
her
more
than
once.
*punct* ,
much
that
lived
in
harriet's
memory
*punct* ,
many
little
particulars
of
the
notice
she
had
received
from
him
*punct* ,
a
look
*punct* ,
a
speech
*punct* ,
a
removal
from
one
chair
to
another
*punct* ,
a
compliment
implied
*punct* ,
a
preference
inferred
*punct* ,
had
been
unnoticed
*punct* ,
because
unsuspected
*punct* ,
by
emma
*punct* .
*break*
circumstances
that
might
swell
to
half
an
hour's
relation
*punct* ,
and
contained
multiplied
proofs
to
her
who
had
seen
them
*punct* ,
had
passed
undiscerned
by
her
who
now
heard
them
*punct* ;
but
the
two
latest
occurrences
to
be
mentioned
*punct* ,
the
two
of
strongest
promise
to
harriet
*punct* ,
were
not
without
some
degree
of
witness
from
emma
herself.
*punct* ,
the
first
*punct* ,
was
his
walking
with
her
apart
from
the
others
*punct* ,
in
the
lime-walk
at
donwell
*punct* ,
where
they
had
been
walking
some
time
before
emma
came
*punct* ,
and
he
had
taken
pains
*punct* ,
as
she
was
convinced
*punct* ,
to
draw
her
from
the
rest
to
himself
*punct* ,
and
at
first
*punct* ,
he
had
talked
to
her
in
a
more
particular
way
than
he
had
ever
done
before
*punct* ,
in
a
very
particular
way
indeed!
*punct* ,
harriet
could
not
recall
it
without
a
blush.
*punct* ,
he
seemed
to
be
almost
asking
her
*punct* ,
whether
her
affections
were
engaged.
*punct* ,
but
as
soon
as
she
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
appeared
likely
to
join
them
*punct* ,
he
changed
the
subject
*punct* ,
and
began
talking
about
farming:
*punct* ,
the
second
*punct* ,
was
his
having
sat
talking
with
her
nearly
half
an
hour
before
emma
came
back
from
her
visit
*punct* ,
the
very
last
morning
of
his
being
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
when
he
first
came
in
*punct* ,
he
had
said
that
he
could
not
stay
five
minutes
*punct* ,
and
his
having
told
her
*punct* ,
during
their
conversation
*punct* ,
that
though
he
must
go
to
london
*punct* ,
it
was
very
much
against
his
inclination
that
he
left
home
at
all
*punct* ,
which
was
much
more
*punct* ,
as
emma
felt
*punct* ,
than
he
had
acknowledged
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
the
superior
degree
of
confidence
towards
harriet
*punct* ,
which
this
one
article
marked
*punct* ,
gave
her
severe
pain
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
subject
of
the
first
of
the
two
circumstances
*punct* ,
she
did
*punct* ,
after
a
little
reflection
*punct* ,
venture
the
following
question
*punct* .
*break*
might
he
not?
*punct* ,
is
not
it
possible
*punct* ,
that
when
enquiring
*punct* ,
as
you
thought
*punct* ,
into
the
state
of
your
affections
*punct* ,
he
might
be
alluding
to
mr.
martin
*punct* ,
he
might
have
mr.
martin's
interest
in
view
*punct* ?
*break*
but
harriet
rejected
the
suspicion
with
spirit
*punct* .
*break*
no
indeed!
*punct* ,
there
was
not
a
hint
of
mr.
martin
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
i
know
better
now
*punct* ,
than
to
care
for
mr.
martin
*punct* ,
or
to
be
suspected
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
when
harriet
had
closed
her
evidence
*punct* ,
she
appealed
to
her
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
to
say
whether
she
had
not
good
ground
for
hope
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
should
have
presumed
to
think
of
it
at
first
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
but
for
you
*punct* .
*break*
you
told
me
to
observe
him
carefully
*punct* ,
and
let
his
behaviour
be
the
rule
of
mine
*punct* ,
and
so
i
have
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
i
seem
to
feel
that
i
may
deserve
him
*punct* ;
and
that
if
he
does
chuse
me
*punct* ,
it
will
not
be
any
thing
so
very
wonderful
*punct* .
*break*
the
bitter
feelings
occasioned
by
this
speech
*punct* ,
the
many
bitter
feelings
*punct* ,
made
the
utmost
exertion
necessary
on
emma's
side
*punct* ,
to
enable
her
to
say
on
reply
*punct* ,
harriet
*punct* ,
i
will
only
venture
to
declare
*punct* ,
that
mr.
knightley
is
the
last
man
in
the
world
*punct* ,
who
would
intentionally
give
any
woman
the
idea
of
his
feeling
for
her
more
than
he
really
does
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
seemed
ready
to
worship
her
friend
for
a
sentence
so
satisfactory
*punct* ;
and
emma
was
only
saved
from
raptures
and
fondness
*punct* ,
which
at
that
moment
would
have
been
dreadful
penance
*punct* ,
by
the
sound
of
her
father's
footsteps
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
coming
through
the
hall
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
was
too
much
agitated
to
encounter
him
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
not
compose
herself
*punct* ,
mr.
woodhouse
would
be
alarmed
*punct* ,
she
had
better
go;
*punct* ,
with
most
ready
encouragement
from
her
friend
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
she
passed
off
through
another
door
*punct* ,
and
the
moment
she
was
gone
*punct* ,
this
was
the
spontaneous
burst
of
emma's
feelings
*punct* :
oh
god
*punct* !
*break*
that
i
had
never
seen
her
*punct* !
*break*
the
rest
of
the
day
*punct* ,
the
following
night
*punct* ,
were
hardly
enough
for
her
thoughts.
*punct* ,
she
was
bewildered
amidst
the
confusion
of
all
that
had
rushed
on
her
within
the
last
few
hours
*punct* .
*break*
every
moment
had
brought
a
fresh
surprize
*punct* ;
and
every
surprize
must
be
matter
of
humiliation
to
her.
*punct* ,
how
to
understand
it
all
*punct* !
*break*
how
to
understand
the
deceptions
she
had
been
thus
practising
on
herself
*punct* ,
and
living
under!
*punct* ,
the
blunders
*punct* ,
the
blindness
of
her
own
head
and
heart!
*punct* ,
she
sat
still
*punct* ,
she
walked
about
*punct* ,
she
tried
her
own
room
*punct* ,
she
tried
the
shrubbery
*punct* ,
in
every
place
*punct* ,
every
posture
*punct* ,
she
perceived
that
she
had
acted
most
weakly
*punct* ;
that
she
had
been
imposed
on
by
others
in
a
most
mortifying
degree
*punct* ;
that
she
had
been
imposing
on
herself
in
a
degree
yet
more
mortifying
*punct* ;
that
she
was
wretched
*punct* ,
and
should
probably
find
this
day
but
the
beginning
of
wretchedness
*punct* .
*break*
to
understand
*punct* ,
thoroughly
understand
her
own
heart
*punct* ,
was
the
first
endeavour
*punct* .
*break*
to
that
point
went
every
leisure
moment
which
her
father's
claims
on
her
allowed
*punct* ,
and
every
moment
of
involuntary
absence
of
mind
*punct* .
*break*
how
long
had
mr.
knightley
been
so
dear
to
her
*punct* ,
as
every
feeling
declared
him
now
to
be
*punct* ?
*break*
when
had
his
influence
*punct* ,
such
influence
begun?
*punct* ,
when
had
he
succeeded
to
that
place
in
her
affection
*punct* ,
which
frank
churchill
had
once
*punct* ,
for
a
short
period
*punct* ,
occupied?
*punct* ,
she
looked
back
*punct* ;
she
compared
the
two
*punct* ,
compared
them
*punct* ,
as
they
had
always
stood
in
her
estimation
*punct* ,
from
the
time
of
the
latter's
becoming
known
to
her
*punct* ,
and
as
they
must
at
any
time
have
been
compared
by
her
*punct* ,
had
it
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
had
it
*punct* ,
by
any
blessed
felicity
*punct* ,
occurred
to
her
*punct* ,
to
institute
the
comparison.
*punct* ,
she
saw
that
there
never
had
been
a
time
when
she
did
not
consider
mr.
knightley
as
infinitely
the
superior
*punct* ,
or
when
his
regard
for
her
had
not
been
infinitely
the
most
dear
*punct* .
*break*
she
saw
*punct* ,
that
in
persuading
herself
*punct* ,
in
fancying
*punct* ,
in
acting
to
the
contrary
*punct* ,
she
had
been
entirely
under
a
delusion
*punct* ,
totally
ignorant
of
her
own
heart
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
that
she
had
never
really
cared
for
frank
churchill
at
all
*punct* !
*break*
this
was
the
conclusion
of
the
first
series
of
reflection
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
the
knowledge
of
herself
*punct* ,
on
the
first
question
of
inquiry
*punct* ,
which
she
reached
*punct* ;
and
without
being
long
in
reaching
it.
*punct* ,
she
was
most
sorrowfully
indignant
*punct* ;
ashamed
of
every
sensation
but
the
one
revealed
to
her
*punct* ,
her
affection
for
mr.
knightley.
*punct* ,
every
other
part
of
her
mind
was
disgusting
*punct* .
*break*
with
insufferable
vanity
had
she
believed
herself
in
the
secret
of
every
body's
feelings
*punct* ;
with
unpardonable
arrogance
proposed
to
arrange
every
body's
destiny
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
proved
to
have
been
universally
mistaken
*punct* ;
and
she
had
not
quite
done
nothing
*punct* ,
for
she
had
done
mischief
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
brought
evil
on
harriet
*punct* ,
on
herself
*punct* ,
and
she
too
much
feared
*punct* ,
on
mr.
knightley.
*punct* ,
were
this
most
unequal
of
all
connexions
to
take
place
*punct* ,
on
her
must
rest
all
the
reproach
of
having
given
it
a
beginning
*punct* ;
for
his
attachment
*punct* ,
she
must
believe
to
be
produced
only
by
a
consciousness
of
harriet's;
*punct* ,
and
even
were
this
not
the
case
*punct* ,
he
would
never
have
known
harriet
at
all
but
for
her
folly
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
and
harriet
smith!
*punct* ,
it
was
a
union
to
distance
every
wonder
of
the
kind.
*punct* ,
the
attachment
of
frank
churchill
and
jane
fairfax
became
commonplace
*punct* ,
threadbare
*punct* ,
stale
in
the
comparison
*punct* ,
exciting
no
surprize
*punct* ,
presenting
no
disparity
*punct* ,
affording
nothing
to
be
said
or
thought.
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
and
harriet
smith!
*punct* ,
such
an
elevation
on
her
side
*punct* !
*break*
such
a
debasement
on
his
*punct* !
*break*
it
was
horrible
to
emma
to
think
how
it
must
sink
him
in
the
general
opinion
*punct* ,
to
foresee
the
smiles
*punct* ,
the
sneers
*punct* ,
the
merriment
it
would
prompt
at
his
expense
*punct* ;
the
mortification
and
disdain
of
his
brother
*punct* ,
the
thousand
inconveniences
to
himself.
*punct* ,
could
it
be?
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ;
it
was
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
and
yet
it
was
far
*punct* ,
very
far
*punct* ,
from
impossible.
*punct* ,
was
it
a
new
circumstance
for
a
man
of
first-rate
abilities
to
be
captivated
by
very
inferior
powers
*punct* ?
*break*
was
it
new
for
one
*punct* ,
perhaps
too
busy
to
seek
*punct* ,
to
be
the
prize
of
a
girl
who
would
seek
him?
*punct* ,
was
it
new
for
any
thing
in
this
world
to
be
unequal
*punct* ,
inconsistent
*punct* ,
incongruous
*punct* ,
or
for
chance
and
circumstance
*punct* ,
as
second
causes
*punct* ,
to
direct
the
human
fate
*punct* ?
*break*
had
she
never
brought
harriet
forward
*punct* !
*break*
had
she
left
her
where
she
ought
*punct* ,
and
where
he
had
told
her
she
ought!
*punct* ,
had
she
not
*punct* ,
with
a
folly
which
no
tongue
could
express
*punct* ,
prevented
her
marrying
the
unexceptionable
young
man
who
would
have
made
her
happy
and
respectable
in
the
line
of
life
to
which
she
ought
to
belong
*punct* ,
all
would
have
been
safe
*punct* ;
none
of
this
dreadful
sequel
would
have
been
*punct* .
*break*
how
harriet
could
ever
have
had
the
presumption
to
raise
her
thoughts
to
mr.
knightley!
*punct* ,
how
she
could
dare
to
fancy
herself
the
chosen
of
such
a
man
till
actually
assured
of
it!
*punct* ,
but
harriet
was
less
humble
*punct* ,
had
fewer
scruples
than
formerly.
*punct* ,
her
inferiority
*punct* ,
whether
of
mind
or
situation
*punct* ,
seemed
little
felt.
*punct* ,
she
had
seemed
more
sensible
of
mr.
elton's
being
to
stoop
in
marrying
her
*punct* ,
than
she
now
seemed
of
mr.
knightley's.
*punct* ,
alas
*punct* !
*break*
was
not
that
her
own
doing
too
*punct* ?
*break*
who
had
been
at
pains
to
give
harriet
notions
of
self-consequence
but
herself?
*punct* ,
who
but
herself
had
taught
her
*punct* ,
that
she
was
to
elevate
herself
if
possible
*punct* ,
and
that
her
claims
were
great
to
a
high
worldly
establishment?
*punct* ,
if
harriet
*punct* ,
from
being
humble
*punct* ,
were
grown
vain
*punct* ,
it
was
her
doing
too
*punct* .
*break*
till
now
that
she
was
threatened
with
its
loss
*punct* ,
emma
had
never
known
how
much
of
her
happiness
depended
on
being
first
with
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
first
in
interest
and
affection.
*punct* ,
satisfied
that
it
was
so
*punct* ,
and
feeling
it
her
due
*punct* ,
she
had
enjoyed
it
without
reflection
*punct* ;
and
only
in
the
dread
of
being
supplanted
*punct* ,
found
how
inexpressibly
important
it
had
been.
*punct* ,
long
*punct* ,
very
long
*punct* ,
she
felt
she
had
been
first
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
having
no
female
connexions
of
his
own
*punct* ,
there
had
been
only
isabella
whose
claims
could
be
compared
with
hers
*punct* ,
and
she
had
always
known
exactly
how
far
he
loved
and
esteemed
isabella
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
herself
been
first
with
him
for
many
years
past
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
not
deserved
it
*punct* ;
she
had
often
been
negligent
or
perverse
*punct* ,
slighting
his
advice
*punct* ,
or
even
wilfully
opposing
him
*punct* ,
insensible
of
half
his
merits
*punct* ,
and
quarrelling
with
him
because
he
would
not
acknowledge
her
false
and
insolent
estimate
of
her
own
*punct* ,
but
still
*punct* ,
from
family
attachment
and
habit
*punct* ,
and
thorough
excellence
of
mind
*punct* ,
he
had
loved
her
*punct* ,
and
watched
over
her
from
a
girl
*punct* ,
with
an
endeavour
to
improve
her
*punct* ,
and
an
anxiety
for
her
doing
right
*punct* ,
which
no
other
creature
had
at
all
shared
*punct* .
*break*
in
spite
of
all
her
faults
*punct* ,
she
knew
she
was
dear
to
him
*punct* ;
might
she
not
say
*punct* ,
very
dear?
*punct* ,
when
the
suggestions
of
hope
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
which
must
follow
here
*punct* ,
presented
themselves
*punct* ,
she
could
not
presume
to
indulge
them
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
smith
might
think
herself
not
unworthy
of
being
peculiarly
*punct* ,
exclusively
*punct* ,
passionately
loved
by
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
not
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
not
flatter
herself
with
any
idea
of
blindness
in
his
attachment
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
received
a
very
recent
proof
of
its
impartiality.
*punct* ,
how
shocked
had
he
been
by
her
behaviour
to
miss
bates
*punct* !
*break*
how
directly
*punct* ,
how
strongly
had
he
expressed
himself
to
her
on
the
subject!
*punct* ,
not
too
strongly
for
the
offence
*punct* ,
but
far
*punct* ,
far
too
strongly
to
issue
from
any
feeling
softer
than
upright
justice
and
clear-sighted
goodwill.
*punct* ,
she
had
no
hope
*punct* ,
nothing
to
deserve
the
name
of
hope
*punct* ,
that
he
could
have
that
sort
of
affection
for
herself
which
was
now
in
question
*punct* ;
but
there
was
a
hope
*punct* ,
at
times
a
slight
one
*punct* ,
at
times
much
stronger,
*punct* ,
that
harriet
might
have
deceived
herself
*punct* ,
and
be
overrating
his
regard
for
her.
*punct* ,
wish
it
she
must
*punct* ,
for
his
sake
*punct* ,
be
the
consequence
nothing
to
herself
*punct* ,
but
his
remaining
single
all
his
life
*punct* .
*break*
could
she
be
secure
of
that
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
of
his
never
marrying
at
all
*punct* ,
she
believed
she
should
be
perfectly
satisfied.
*punct* ,
let
him
but
continue
the
same
mr.
knightley
to
her
and
her
father
*punct* ,
the
same
mr.
knightley
to
all
the
world
*punct* ;
let
donwell
and
hartfield
lose
none
of
their
precious
intercourse
of
friendship
and
confidence
*punct* ,
and
her
peace
would
be
fully
secured.
*punct* ,
marriage
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
would
not
do
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
incompatible
with
what
she
owed
to
her
father
*punct* ,
and
with
what
she
felt
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
should
separate
her
from
her
father
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
not
marry
*punct* ,
even
if
she
were
asked
by
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
be
her
ardent
wish
that
harriet
might
be
disappointed
*punct* ;
and
she
hoped
*punct* ,
that
when
able
to
see
them
together
again
*punct* ,
she
might
at
least
be
able
to
ascertain
what
the
chances
for
it
were.
*punct* ,
she
should
see
them
henceforward
with
the
closest
observance
*punct* ;
and
wretchedly
as
she
had
hitherto
misunderstood
even
those
she
was
watching
*punct* ,
she
did
not
know
how
to
admit
that
she
could
be
blinded
here.
*punct* ,
he
was
expected
back
every
day
*punct* .
*break*
the
power
of
observation
would
be
soon
given
*punct* ,
frightfully
soon
it
appeared
when
her
thoughts
were
in
one
course
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
meanwhile
*punct* ,
she
resolved
against
seeing
harriet.
*punct* ,
it
would
do
neither
of
them
good
*punct* ,
it
would
do
the
subject
no
good
*punct* ,
to
be
talking
of
it
farther.
*punct* ,
she
was
resolved
not
to
be
convinced
*punct* ,
as
long
as
she
could
doubt
*punct* ,
and
yet
had
no
authority
for
opposing
harriet's
confidence
*punct* .
*break*
to
talk
would
be
only
to
irritate.
*punct* ,
she
wrote
to
her
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
kindly
*punct* ,
but
decisively
*punct* ,
to
beg
that
she
would
not
*punct* ,
at
present
*punct* ,
come
to
hartfield
*punct* ;
acknowledging
it
to
be
her
conviction
*punct* ,
that
all
farther
confidential
discussion
of
one
topic
had
better
be
avoided
*punct* ;
and
hoping
*punct* ,
that
if
a
few
days
were
allowed
to
pass
before
they
met
again
*punct* ,
except
in
the
company
of
others
*punct* ,
she
objected
only
to
a
tete-a-tete
*punct* ,
they
might
be
able
to
act
as
if
they
had
forgotten
the
conversation
of
yesterday.
*punct* ,
harriet
submitted
*punct* ,
and
approved
*punct* ,
and
was
grateful
*punct* .
*break*
this
point
was
just
arranged
*punct* ,
when
a
visitor
arrived
to
tear
emma's
thoughts
a
little
from
the
one
subject
which
had
engrossed
them
*punct* ,
sleeping
or
waking
*punct* ,
the
last
twenty-four
hours
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
who
had
been
calling
on
her
daughter-in-law
elect
*punct* ,
and
took
hartfield
in
her
way
home
*punct* ,
almost
as
much
in
duty
to
emma
as
in
pleasure
to
herself
*punct* ,
to
relate
all
the
particulars
of
so
interesting
an
interview
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
had
accompanied
her
to
mrs.
bates's
*punct* ,
and
gone
through
his
share
of
this
essential
attention
most
handsomely
*punct* ;
but
she
having
then
induced
miss
fairfax
to
join
her
in
an
airing
*punct* ,
was
now
returned
with
much
more
to
say
*punct* ,
and
much
more
to
say
with
satisfaction
*punct* ,
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
spent
in
mrs.
bates's
parlour
*punct* ,
with
all
the
encumbrance
of
awkward
feelings
*punct* ,
could
have
afforded
*punct* .
*break*
a
little
curiosity
emma
had
*punct* ;
and
she
made
the
most
of
it
while
her
friend
related
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
had
set
off
to
pay
the
visit
in
a
good
deal
of
agitation
herself
*punct* ;
and
in
the
first
place
had
wished
not
to
go
at
all
at
present
*punct* ,
to
be
allowed
merely
to
write
to
miss
fairfax
instead
*punct* ,
and
to
defer
this
ceremonious
call
till
a
little
time
had
passed
*punct* ,
and
mr.
churchill
could
be
reconciled
to
the
engagement's
becoming
known
*punct* ;
as
*punct* ,
considering
every
thing
*punct* ,
she
thought
such
a
visit
could
not
be
paid
without
leading
to
reports:
*punct* ,
but
mr.
weston
had
thought
differently
*punct* ;
he
was
extremely
anxious
to
shew
his
approbation
to
miss
fairfax
and
her
family
*punct* ,
and
did
not
conceive
that
any
suspicion
could
be
excited
by
it
*punct* ;
or
if
it
were
*punct* ,
that
it
would
be
of
any
consequence
*punct* ;
for
such
things
*punct* ,
he
observed
*punct* ,
always
got
about
*punct* .
*break*
emma
smiled
*punct* ,
and
felt
that
mr.
weston
had
very
good
reason
for
saying
so
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
gone
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
and
very
great
had
been
the
evident
distress
and
confusion
of
the
lady
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
hardly
been
able
to
speak
a
word
*punct* ,
and
every
look
and
action
had
shewn
how
deeply
she
was
suffering
from
consciousness
*punct* .
*break*
the
quiet
*punct* ,
heart-felt
satisfaction
of
the
old
lady
*punct* ,
and
the
rapturous
delight
of
her
daughter
*punct* ,
who
proved
even
too
joyous
to
talk
as
usual
*punct* ,
had
been
a
gratifying
*punct* ,
yet
almost
an
affecting
*punct* ,
scene
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
both
so
truly
respectable
in
their
happiness
*punct* ,
so
disinterested
in
every
sensation
*punct* ;
thought
so
much
of
jane
*punct* ;
so
much
of
every
body
*punct* ,
and
so
little
of
themselves
*punct* ,
that
every
kindly
feeling
was
at
work
for
them
*punct* .
*break*
miss
fairfax's
recent
illness
had
offered
a
fair
plea
for
mrs.
weston
to
invite
her
to
an
airing
*punct* ;
she
had
drawn
back
and
declined
at
first
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
on
being
pressed
had
yielded
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
in
the
course
of
their
drive
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
had
*punct* ,
by
gentle
encouragement
*punct* ,
overcome
so
much
of
her
embarrassment
*punct* ,
as
to
bring
her
to
converse
on
the
important
subject
*punct* .
*break*
apologies
for
her
seemingly
ungracious
silence
in
their
first
reception
*punct* ,
and
the
warmest
expressions
of
the
gratitude
she
was
always
feeling
towards
herself
and
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
must
necessarily
open
the
cause
*punct* ;
but
when
these
effusions
were
put
by
*punct* ,
they
had
talked
a
good
deal
of
the
present
and
of
the
future
state
of
the
engagement
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
was
convinced
that
such
conversation
must
be
the
greatest
relief
to
her
companion
*punct* ,
pent
up
within
her
own
mind
as
every
thing
had
so
long
been
*punct* ,
and
was
very
much
pleased
with
all
that
she
had
said
on
the
subject
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
misery
of
what
she
had
suffered
*punct* ,
during
the
concealment
of
so
many
months
*punct* ,
continued
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
she
was
energetic
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
one
of
her
expressions
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
not
say
*punct* ,
that
since
i
entered
into
the
engagement
i
have
not
had
some
happy
moments
*punct* ;
but
i
can
say
*punct* ,
that
i
have
never
known
the
blessing
of
one
tranquil
hour:'
*punct* ,
and
the
quivering
lip
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
which
uttered
it
*punct* ,
was
an
attestation
that
i
felt
at
my
heart
*punct* .
*break*
she
thinks
herself
wrong
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
for
having
consented
to
a
private
engagement
*punct* ?
*break*
no
one
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
can
blame
her
more
than
she
is
disposed
to
blame
herself
*punct* .
*break*
the
consequence
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
has
been
a
state
of
perpetual
suffering
to
me
*punct* ;
and
so
it
ought
*punct* .
*break*
but
after
all
the
punishment
that
misconduct
can
bring
*punct* ,
it
is
still
not
less
misconduct
*punct* .
*break*
pain
is
no
expiation
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
can
be
blameless
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
been
acting
contrary
to
all
my
sense
of
right
*punct* ;
and
the
fortunate
turn
that
every
thing
has
taken
*punct* ,
and
the
kindness
i
am
now
receiving
*punct* ,
is
what
my
conscience
tells
me
ought
not
to
be
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
imagine
*punct* ,
madam
*punct* ,
she
continued
*punct* ,
that
i
was
taught
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
let
any
reflection
fall
on
the
principles
or
the
care
of
the
friends
who
brought
me
up
*punct* .
*break*
the
error
has
been
all
my
own
*punct* ;
and
i
do
assure
you
that
*punct* ,
with
all
the
excuse
that
present
circumstances
may
appear
to
give
*punct* ,
i
shall
yet
dread
making
the
story
known
to
colonel
campbell
*punct* .
*break*
said
emma
again
*punct* .
*break*
she
loves
him
then
excessively
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
have
been
from
attachment
only
*punct* ,
that
she
could
be
led
to
form
the
engagement
*punct* .
*break*
her
affection
must
have
overpowered
her
judgment
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
have
no
doubt
of
her
being
extremely
attached
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
afraid
*punct* ,
returned
emma
*punct* ,
sighing
*punct* ,
that
i
must
often
have
contributed
to
make
her
unhappy
*punct* .
*break*
on
your
side
*punct* ,
my
love
*punct* ,
it
was
very
innocently
done
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
probably
had
something
of
that
in
her
thoughts
*punct* ,
when
alluding
to
the
misunderstandings
which
he
had
given
us
hints
of
before
*punct* .
*break*
one
natural
consequence
of
the
evil
she
had
involved
herself
in
*punct* ,
she
said
*punct* ,
was
that
of
making
her
unreasonable
*punct* .
*break*
the
consciousness
of
having
done
amiss
*punct* ,
had
exposed
her
to
a
thousand
inquietudes
*punct* ,
and
made
her
captious
and
irritable
to
a
degree
that
must
have
been
*punct* ,
that
had
been
*punct* ,
hard
for
him
to
bear
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
not
make
the
allowances
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* ,
which
i
ought
to
have
done
*punct* ,
for
his
temper
and
spirits
*punct* ,
his
delightful
spirits
*punct* ,
and
that
gaiety
*punct* ,
that
playfulness
of
disposition
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
under
any
other
circumstances
*punct* ,
would
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* ,
have
been
as
constantly
bewitching
to
me
*punct* ,
as
they
were
at
first
*punct* .
*break*
she
then
began
to
speak
of
you
*punct* ,
and
of
the
great
kindness
you
had
shewn
her
during
her
illness
*punct* ;
and
with
a
blush
which
shewed
me
how
it
was
all
connected
*punct* ,
desired
me
*punct* ,
whenever
i
had
an
opportunity
*punct* ,
to
thank
you
*punct* ,
i
could
not
thank
you
too
much
*punct* ,
for
every
wish
and
every
endeavour
to
do
her
good
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
sensible
that
you
had
never
received
any
proper
acknowledgment
from
herself
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
did
not
know
her
to
be
happy
now
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
seriously
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
every
little
drawback
from
her
scrupulous
conscience
*punct* ,
she
must
be
*punct* ,
i
could
not
bear
these
thanks;
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
if
there
were
an
account
drawn
up
of
the
evil
and
the
good
i
have
done
miss
fairfax!
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
checking
herself
*punct* ,
and
trying
to
be
more
lively
*punct* ,
this
is
all
to
be
forgotten
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
very
kind
to
bring
me
these
interesting
particulars
*punct* .
*break*
they
shew
her
to
the
greatest
advantage
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
she
is
very
good
*punct* ,
i
hope
she
will
be
very
happy
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
fit
that
the
fortune
should
be
on
his
side
*punct* ,
for
i
think
the
merit
will
be
all
on
hers
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
conclusion
could
not
pass
unanswered
by
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
she
thought
well
of
frank
in
almost
every
respect
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
what
was
more
*punct* ,
she
loved
him
very
much
*punct* ,
and
her
defence
was
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
earnest
*punct* .
*break*
she
talked
with
a
great
deal
of
reason
*punct* ,
and
at
least
equal
affection
*punct* ,
but
she
had
too
much
to
urge
for
emma's
attention
*punct* ;
it
was
soon
gone
to
brunswick
square
or
to
donwell
*punct* ;
she
forgot
to
attempt
to
listen
*punct* ;
and
when
mrs.
weston
ended
with
*punct* ,
we
have
not
yet
had
the
letter
we
are
so
anxious
for
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
but
i
hope
it
will
soon
come
*punct* ,
she
was
obliged
to
pause
before
she
answered
*punct* ,
and
at
last
obliged
to
answer
at
random
*punct* ,
before
she
could
at
all
recollect
what
letter
it
was
which
they
were
so
anxious
for
*punct* .
*break*
are
you
well
*punct* ,
my
emma
*punct* ?
*break*
was
mrs.
weston's
parting
question
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
always
well
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
be
sure
to
give
me
intelligence
of
the
letter
as
soon
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston's
communications
furnished
emma
with
more
food
for
unpleasant
reflection
*punct* ,
by
increasing
her
esteem
and
compassion
*punct* ,
and
her
sense
of
past
injustice
towards
miss
fairfax
*punct* .
*break*
she
bitterly
regretted
not
having
sought
a
closer
acquaintance
with
her
*punct* ,
and
blushed
for
the
envious
feelings
which
had
certainly
been
*punct* ,
in
some
measure
*punct* ,
the
cause
*punct* .
*break*
had
she
followed
mr.
knightley's
known
wishes
*punct* ,
in
paying
that
attention
to
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
which
was
every
way
her
due
*punct* ;
had
she
tried
to
know
her
better
*punct* ;
had
she
done
her
part
towards
intimacy
*punct* ;
had
she
endeavoured
to
find
a
friend
there
instead
of
in
harriet
smith
*punct* ;
she
must
*punct* ,
in
all
probability
*punct* ,
have
been
spared
from
every
pain
which
pressed
on
her
now.
*punct* ,
birth
*punct* ,
abilities
*punct* ,
and
education
*punct* ,
had
been
equally
marking
one
as
an
associate
for
her
*punct* ,
to
be
received
with
gratitude
*punct* ;
and
the
other
*punct* ,
what
was
she?
*punct* ,
supposing
even
that
they
had
never
become
intimate
friends
*punct* ;
that
she
had
never
been
admitted
into
miss
fairfax's
confidence
on
this
important
matter
*punct* ,
which
was
most
probable
*punct* ,
still
*punct* ,
in
knowing
her
as
she
ought
*punct* ,
and
as
she
might
*punct* ,
she
must
have
been
preserved
from
the
abominable
suspicions
of
an
improper
attachment
to
mr.
dixon
*punct* ,
which
she
had
not
only
so
foolishly
fashioned
and
harboured
herself
*punct* ,
but
had
so
unpardonably
imparted
*punct* ;
an
idea
which
she
greatly
feared
had
been
made
a
subject
of
material
distress
to
the
delicacy
of
jane's
feelings
*punct* ,
by
the
levity
or
carelessness
of
frank
churchill's
*punct* .
*break*
of
all
the
sources
of
evil
surrounding
the
former
*punct* ,
since
her
coming
to
highbury
*punct* ,
she
was
persuaded
that
she
must
herself
have
been
the
worst
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
have
been
a
perpetual
enemy
*punct* .
*break*
they
never
could
have
been
all
three
together
*punct* ,
without
her
having
stabbed
jane
fairfax's
peace
in
a
thousand
instances
*punct* ;
and
on
box
hill
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
it
had
been
the
agony
of
a
mind
that
would
bear
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
the
evening
of
this
day
was
very
long
*punct* ,
and
melancholy
*punct* ,
at
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
the
weather
added
what
it
could
of
gloom
*punct* .
*break*
a
cold
stormy
rain
set
in
*punct* ,
and
nothing
of
july
appeared
but
in
the
trees
and
shrubs
*punct* ,
which
the
wind
was
despoiling
*punct* ,
and
the
length
of
the
day
*punct* ,
which
only
made
such
cruel
sights
the
longer
visible
*punct* .
*break*
the
weather
affected
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
and
he
could
only
be
kept
tolerably
comfortable
by
almost
ceaseless
attention
on
his
daughter's
side
*punct* ,
and
by
exertions
which
had
never
cost
her
half
so
much
before
*punct* .
*break*
it
reminded
her
of
their
first
forlorn
tete-a-tete
*punct* ,
on
the
evening
of
mrs.
weston's
wedding-day
*punct* ;
but
mr.
knightley
had
walked
in
then
*punct* ,
soon
after
tea
*punct* ,
and
dissipated
every
melancholy
fancy
*punct* .
*break*
such
delightful
proofs
of
hartfield's
attraction
*punct* ,
as
those
sort
of
visits
conveyed
*punct* ,
might
shortly
be
over
*punct* .
*break*
the
picture
which
she
had
then
drawn
of
the
privations
of
the
approaching
winter
*punct* ,
had
proved
erroneous
*punct* ;
no
friends
had
deserted
them
*punct* ,
no
pleasures
had
been
lost.
*punct* ,
but
her
present
forebodings
she
feared
would
experience
no
similar
contradiction
*punct* .
*break*
the
prospect
before
her
now
*punct* ,
was
threatening
to
a
degree
that
could
not
be
entirely
dispelled
*punct* ,
that
might
not
be
even
partially
brightened
*punct* .
*break*
if
all
took
place
that
might
take
place
among
the
circle
of
her
friends
*punct* ,
hartfield
must
be
comparatively
deserted
*punct* ;
and
she
left
to
cheer
her
father
with
the
spirits
only
of
ruined
happiness
*punct* .
*break*
the
child
to
be
born
at
randalls
must
be
a
tie
there
even
dearer
than
herself
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
weston's
heart
and
time
would
be
occupied
by
it
*punct* .
*break*
they
should
lose
her
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
probably
*punct* ,
in
great
measure
*punct* ,
her
husband
also.
*punct* ,
frank
churchill
would
return
among
them
no
more
*punct* ;
and
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
*punct* ,
would
soon
cease
to
belong
to
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
they
would
be
married
*punct* ,
and
settled
either
at
or
near
enscombe
*punct* .
*break*
all
that
were
good
would
be
withdrawn
*punct* ;
and
if
to
these
losses
*punct* ,
the
loss
of
donwell
were
to
be
added
*punct* ,
what
would
remain
of
cheerful
or
of
rational
society
within
their
reach
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
knightley
to
be
no
longer
coming
there
for
his
evening
comfort!
*punct* ,
no
longer
walking
in
at
all
hours
*punct* ,
as
if
ever
willing
to
change
his
own
home
for
their's!
*punct* ,
how
was
it
to
be
endured
*punct* ?
*break*
and
if
he
were
to
be
lost
to
them
for
harriet's
sake
*punct* ;
if
he
were
to
be
thought
of
hereafter
*punct* ,
as
finding
in
harriet's
society
all
that
he
wanted
*punct* ;
if
harriet
were
to
be
the
chosen
*punct* ,
the
first
*punct* ,
the
dearest
*punct* ,
the
friend
*punct* ,
the
wife
to
whom
he
looked
for
all
the
best
blessings
of
existence
*punct* ;
what
could
be
increasing
emma's
wretchedness
but
the
reflection
never
far
distant
from
her
mind
*punct* ,
that
it
had
been
all
her
own
work
*punct* ?
*break*
when
it
came
to
such
a
pitch
as
this
*punct* ,
she
was
not
able
to
refrain
from
a
start
*punct* ,
or
a
heavy
sigh
*punct* ,
or
even
from
walking
about
the
room
for
a
few
seconds
*punct* ,
and
the
only
source
whence
any
thing
like
consolation
or
composure
could
be
drawn
*punct* ,
was
in
the
resolution
of
her
own
better
conduct
*punct* ,
and
the
hope
that
*punct* ,
however
inferior
in
spirit
and
gaiety
might
be
the
following
and
every
future
winter
of
her
life
to
the
past
*punct* ,
it
would
yet
find
her
more
rational
*punct* ,
more
acquainted
with
herself
*punct* ,
and
leave
her
less
to
regret
when
it
were
gone
*punct* .
*break*
the
weather
continued
much
the
same
all
the
following
morning
*punct* ;
and
the
same
loneliness
*punct* ,
and
the
same
melancholy
*punct* ,
seemed
to
reign
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
but
in
the
afternoon
it
cleared
*punct* ;
the
wind
changed
into
a
softer
quarter
*punct* ;
the
clouds
were
carried
off
*punct* ;
the
sun
appeared
*punct* ;
it
was
summer
again
*punct* .
*break*
with
all
the
eagerness
which
such
a
transition
gives
*punct* ,
emma
resolved
to
be
out
of
doors
as
soon
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
never
had
the
exquisite
sight
*punct* ,
smell
*punct* ,
sensation
of
nature
*punct* ,
tranquil
*punct* ,
warm
*punct* ,
and
brilliant
after
a
storm
*punct* ,
been
more
attractive
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
longed
for
the
serenity
they
might
gradually
introduce
*punct* ;
and
on
mr.
perry's
coming
in
soon
after
dinner
*punct* ,
with
a
disengaged
hour
to
give
her
father
*punct* ,
she
lost
no
time
ill
hurrying
into
the
shrubbery.
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ,
with
spirits
freshened
*punct* ,
and
thoughts
a
little
relieved
*punct* ,
she
had
taken
a
few
turns
*punct* ,
when
she
saw
mr.
knightley
passing
through
the
garden
door
*punct* ,
and
coming
towards
her.
*punct* ,
it
was
the
first
intimation
of
his
being
returned
from
london
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
been
thinking
of
him
the
moment
before
*punct* ,
as
unquestionably
sixteen
miles
distant.
*punct* ,
there
was
time
only
for
the
quickest
arrangement
of
mind
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
be
collected
and
calm
*punct* .
*break*
in
half
a
minute
they
were
together
*punct* .
*break*
the
how
d'ye
do's
were
quiet
and
constrained
on
each
side
*punct* .
*break*
she
asked
after
their
mutual
friends
*punct* ;
they
were
all
well.
*punct* ,
when
had
he
left
them?
*punct* ,
only
that
morning
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
have
had
a
wet
ride.
*punct* ,
yes.
*punct* ,
he
meant
to
walk
with
her
*punct* ,
she
found
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
just
looked
into
the
dining-room
*punct* ,
and
as
he
was
not
wanted
there
*punct* ,
preferred
being
out
of
doors.
*punct* ,
she
thought
he
neither
looked
nor
spoke
cheerfully
*punct* ;
and
the
first
possible
cause
for
it
*punct* ,
suggested
by
her
fears
*punct* ,
was
*punct* ,
that
he
had
perhaps
been
communicating
his
plans
to
his
brother
*punct* ,
and
was
pained
by
the
manner
in
which
they
had
been
received
*punct* .
*break*
they
walked
together
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
silent
*punct* .
*break*
she
thought
he
was
often
looking
at
her
*punct* ,
and
trying
for
a
fuller
view
of
her
face
than
it
suited
her
to
give
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
belief
produced
another
dread
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
he
wanted
to
speak
to
her
*punct* ,
of
his
attachment
to
harriet
*punct* ;
he
might
be
watching
for
encouragement
to
begin.
*punct* ,
she
did
not
*punct* ,
could
not
*punct* ,
feel
equal
to
lead
the
way
to
any
such
subject
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
do
it
all
himself
*punct* .
*break*
yet
she
could
not
bear
this
silence
*punct* .
*break*
with
him
it
was
most
unnatural
*punct* .
*break*
she
considered
*punct* ,
resolved
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
trying
to
smile
*punct* ,
began
*punct* ,
you
have
some
news
to
hear
*punct* ,
now
you
are
come
back
*punct* ,
that
will
rather
surprize
you
*punct* .
*break*
said
he
quietly
*punct* ,
and
looking
at
her
*punct* ;
of
what
nature
*punct* ?
*break*
the
best
nature
in
the
world
*punct* ,
a
wedding
*punct* .
*break*
after
waiting
a
moment
*punct* ,
as
if
to
be
sure
she
intended
to
say
no
more
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
if
you
mean
miss
fairfax
and
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
i
have
heard
that
already
*punct* .
*break*
how
is
it
possible
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
emma
*punct* ,
turning
her
glowing
cheeks
towards
him
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
while
she
spoke
*punct* ,
it
occurred
to
her
that
he
might
have
called
at
mrs.
goddard's
in
his
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
a
few
lines
on
parish
business
from
mr.
weston
this
morning
*punct* ,
and
at
the
end
of
them
he
gave
me
a
brief
account
of
what
had
happened
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
quite
relieved
*punct* ,
and
could
presently
say
*punct* ,
with
a
little
more
composure
*punct* ,
you
probably
have
been
less
surprized
than
any
of
us
*punct* ,
for
you
have
had
your
suspicions.
*punct* ,
i
have
not
forgotten
that
you
once
tried
to
give
me
a
caution.
*punct* ,
i
wish
i
had
attended
to
it
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
with
a
sinking
voice
and
a
heavy
sigh
*punct* ,
i
seem
to
have
been
doomed
to
blindness
*punct* .
*break*
her
arm
was
pressed
again
*punct* ,
as
he
added
*punct* ,
in
a
more
broken
and
subdued
accent
*punct* ,
the
feelings
of
the
warmest
friendship
*punct* ,
indignation
*punct* ,
abominable
scoundrel!
*punct* ,
and
in
a
louder
*punct* ,
steadier
tone
*punct* ,
he
concluded
with
*punct* ,
he
will
soon
be
gone
*punct* .
*break*
they
will
soon
be
in
yorkshire
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sorry
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
deserves
a
better
fate
*punct* .
*break*
emma
understood
him
*punct* ;
and
as
soon
as
she
could
recover
from
the
flutter
of
pleasure
*punct* ,
excited
by
such
tender
consideration
*punct* ,
replied
*punct* ,
you
are
very
kind
*punct* ,
but
you
are
mistaken
*punct* ,
and
i
must
set
you
right.
*punct* ,
i
am
not
in
want
of
that
sort
of
compassion
*punct* .
*break*
my
blindness
to
what
was
going
on
*punct* ,
led
me
to
act
by
them
in
a
way
that
i
must
always
be
ashamed
of
*punct* ,
and
i
was
very
foolishly
tempted
to
say
and
do
many
things
which
may
well
lay
me
open
to
unpleasant
conjectures
*punct* ,
but
i
have
no
other
reason
to
regret
that
i
was
not
in
the
secret
earlier
*punct* .
*break*
cried
he
*punct* ,
looking
eagerly
at
her
*punct* ,
are
you
*punct* ,
indeed?
*punct* ,
but
checking
himself
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
i
understand
you
*punct* ,
forgive
me
*punct* ,
i
am
pleased
that
you
can
say
even
so
much.
*punct* ,
he
is
no
object
of
regret
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
and
it
will
not
be
very
long
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ,
before
that
becomes
the
acknowledgment
of
more
than
your
reason.
*punct* ,
fortunate
that
your
affections
were
not
farther
entangled!
*punct* ,
i
could
never
*punct* ,
i
confess
*punct* ,
from
your
manners
*punct* ,
assure
myself
as
to
the
degree
of
what
you
felt
*punct* ,
i
could
only
be
certain
that
there
was
a
preference
*punct* ,
and
a
preference
which
i
never
believed
him
to
deserve.
*punct* ,
he
is
a
disgrace
to
the
name
of
man.
*punct* ,
and
is
he
to
be
rewarded
with
that
sweet
young
woman?
*punct* ,
jane
*punct* ,
jane
*punct* ,
you
will
be
a
miserable
creature
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
trying
to
be
lively
*punct* ,
but
really
confused
*punct* ,
i
am
in
a
very
extraordinary
situation
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
let
you
continue
in
your
error
*punct* ;
and
yet
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
since
my
manners
gave
such
an
impression
*punct* ,
i
have
as
much
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
confessing
that
i
never
have
been
at
all
attached
to
the
person
we
are
speaking
of
*punct* ,
as
it
might
be
natural
for
a
woman
to
feel
in
confessing
exactly
the
reverse.
*punct* ,
but
i
never
have
*punct* .
*break*
he
listened
in
perfect
silence
*punct* .
*break*
she
wished
him
to
speak
*punct* ,
but
he
would
not
*punct* .
*break*
she
supposed
she
must
say
more
before
she
were
entitled
to
his
clemency
*punct* ;
but
it
was
a
hard
case
to
be
obliged
still
to
lower
herself
in
his
opinion
*punct* .
*break*
she
went
on
*punct* ,
however
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
very
little
to
say
for
my
own
conduct.
*punct* ,
i
was
tempted
by
his
attentions
*punct* ,
and
allowed
myself
to
appear
pleased.
*punct* ,
an
old
story
*punct* ,
probably
*punct* ,
a
common
case
*punct* ,
and
no
more
than
has
happened
to
hundreds
of
my
sex
before
*punct* ;
and
yet
it
may
not
be
the
more
excusable
in
one
who
sets
up
as
i
do
for
understanding
*punct* .
*break*
many
circumstances
assisted
the
temptation
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
the
son
of
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
he
was
continually
here
*punct* ,
i
always
found
him
very
pleasant
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
with
a
sigh
*punct* ,
let
me
swell
out
the
causes
ever
so
ingeniously
*punct* ,
they
all
centre
in
this
at
last
*punct* ,
my
vanity
was
flattered
*punct* ,
and
i
allowed
his
attentions
*punct* .
*break*
latterly
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
for
some
time
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
i
have
had
no
idea
of
their
meaning
any
thing.
*punct* ,
i
thought
them
a
habit
*punct* ,
a
trick
*punct* ,
nothing
that
called
for
seriousness
on
my
side
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
imposed
on
me
*punct* ,
but
he
has
not
injured
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
never
been
attached
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
i
can
tolerably
comprehend
his
behaviour
*punct* .
*break*
he
never
wished
to
attach
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
merely
a
blind
to
conceal
his
real
situation
with
another.
*punct* ,
it
was
his
object
to
blind
all
about
him
*punct* ;
and
no
one
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
*punct* ,
could
be
more
effectually
blinded
than
myself
*punct* ,
except
that
i
was
not
blinded
*punct* ,
that
it
was
my
good
fortune
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
i
was
somehow
or
other
safe
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
hoped
for
an
answer
here
*punct* ,
for
a
few
words
to
say
that
her
conduct
was
at
least
intelligible
*punct* ;
but
he
was
silent
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
as
far
as
she
could
judge
*punct* ,
deep
in
thought
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
and
tolerably
in
his
usual
tone
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
i
have
never
had
a
high
opinion
of
frank
churchill.
*punct* ,
i
can
suppose
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
that
i
may
have
underrated
him
*punct* .
*break*
my
acquaintance
with
him
has
been
but
trifling.
*punct* ,
and
even
if
i
have
not
underrated
him
hitherto
*punct* ,
he
may
yet
turn
out
well.
*punct* ,
with
such
a
woman
he
has
a
chance.
*punct* ,
i
have
no
motive
for
wishing
him
ill
*punct* ,
and
for
her
sake
*punct* ,
whose
happiness
will
be
involved
in
his
good
character
and
conduct
*punct* ,
i
shall
certainly
wish
him
well
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
doubt
of
their
being
happy
together
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ;
i
believe
them
to
be
very
mutually
and
very
sincerely
attached
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
a
most
fortunate
man
*punct* !
*break*
returned
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
with
energy
*punct* .
*break*
so
early
in
life
*punct* ,
at
three-and-twenty
*punct* ,
a
period
when
*punct* ,
if
a
man
chuses
a
wife
*punct* ,
he
generally
chuses
ill
*punct* .
*break*
at
three-and-twenty
to
have
drawn
such
a
prize
*punct* !
*break*
what
years
of
felicity
that
man
*punct* ,
in
all
human
calculation
*punct* ,
has
before
him!
*punct* ,
assured
of
the
love
of
such
a
woman
*punct* ,
the
disinterested
love
*punct* ,
for
jane
fairfax's
character
vouches
for
her
disinterestedness
*punct* ;
every
thing
in
his
favour,
*punct* ,
equality
of
situation
*punct* ,
i
mean
*punct* ,
as
far
as
regards
society
*punct* ,
and
all
the
habits
and
manners
that
are
important
*punct* ;
equality
in
every
point
but
one
*punct* ,
and
that
one
*punct* ,
since
the
purity
of
her
heart
is
not
to
be
doubted
*punct* ,
such
as
must
increase
his
felicity
*punct* ,
for
it
will
be
his
to
bestow
the
only
advantages
she
wants.
*punct* ,
a
man
would
always
wish
to
give
a
woman
a
better
home
than
the
one
he
takes
her
from
*punct* ;
and
he
who
can
do
it
*punct* ,
where
there
is
no
doubt
of
her
regard
*punct* ,
must
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
be
the
happiest
of
mortals.
*punct* ,
frank
churchill
is
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
the
favourite
of
fortune
*punct* .
*break*
every
thing
turns
out
for
his
good.
*punct* ,
he
meets
with
a
young
woman
at
a
watering-place
*punct* ,
gains
her
affection
*punct* ,
cannot
even
weary
her
by
negligent
treatment
*punct* ,
and
had
he
and
all
his
family
sought
round
the
world
for
a
perfect
wife
for
him
*punct* ,
they
could
not
have
found
her
superior.
*punct* ,
his
aunt
is
in
the
way.
*punct* ,
his
aunt
dies.
*punct* ,
he
has
only
to
speak.
*punct* ,
his
friends
are
eager
to
promote
his
happiness.
*punct* ,
he
had
used
every
body
ill
*punct* ,
and
they
are
all
delighted
to
forgive
him.
*punct* ,
he
is
a
fortunate
man
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
you
speak
as
if
you
envied
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
do
envy
him
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* .
*break*
in
one
respect
he
is
the
object
of
my
envy
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
say
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
to
be
within
half
a
sentence
of
harriet
*punct* ,
and
her
immediate
feeling
was
to
avert
the
subject
*punct* ,
if
possible
*punct* .
*break*
she
made
her
plan
*punct* ;
she
would
speak
of
something
totally
different
*punct* ,
the
children
in
brunswick
square
*punct* ;
and
she
only
waited
for
breath
to
begin
*punct* ,
when
mr.
knightley
startled
her
*punct* ,
by
saying
*punct* ,
you
will
not
ask
me
what
is
the
point
of
envy.
*punct* ,
you
are
determined
*punct* ,
i
see
*punct* ,
to
have
no
curiosity.
*punct* ,
you
are
wise
*punct* ,
but
i
cannot
be
wise
*punct* .
*break*
emma
*punct* ,
i
must
tell
you
what
you
will
not
ask
*punct* ,
though
i
may
wish
it
unsaid
the
next
moment
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
don't
speak
it
*punct* ,
don't
speak
it
*punct* ,
she
eagerly
cried
*punct* .
*break*
take
a
little
time
*punct* ,
consider
*punct* ,
do
not
commit
yourself
*punct* .
*break*
thank
you
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
in
an
accent
of
deep
mortification
*punct* ,
and
not
another
syllable
followed
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
bear
to
give
him
pain
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
wishing
to
confide
in
her
*punct* ,
perhaps
to
consult
her;
*punct* ,
cost
her
what
it
would
*punct* ,
she
would
listen
*punct* .
*break*
she
might
assist
his
resolution
*punct* ,
or
reconcile
him
to
it
*punct* ;
she
might
give
just
praise
to
harriet
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
by
representing
to
him
his
own
independence
*punct* ,
relieve
him
from
that
state
of
indecision
*punct* ,
which
must
be
more
intolerable
than
any
alternative
to
such
a
mind
as
his.
*punct* ,
they
had
reached
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
going
in
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ?
*break*
no,
*punct* ,
replied
emma
*punct* ,
quite
confirmed
by
the
depressed
manner
in
which
he
still
spoke
*punct* ,
i
should
like
to
take
another
turn
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
perry
is
not
gone
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
after
proceeding
a
few
steps
*punct* ,
she
added
*punct* ,
i
stopped
you
ungraciously
*punct* ,
just
now
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
i
am
afraid
*punct* ,
gave
you
pain.
*punct* ,
but
if
you
have
any
wish
to
speak
openly
to
me
as
a
friend
*punct* ,
or
to
ask
my
opinion
of
any
thing
that
you
may
have
in
contemplation
*punct* ,
as
a
friend
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
you
may
command
me.
*punct* ,
i
will
hear
whatever
you
like
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
tell
you
exactly
what
i
think
*punct* .
*break*
as
a
friend!
*punct* ,
repeated
mr.
knightley.
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
that
i
fear
is
a
word
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
i
have
no
wish
*punct* ,
stay
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
why
should
i
hesitate?
*punct* ,
i
have
gone
too
far
already
for
concealment.
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
i
accept
your
offer
*punct* ,
extraordinary
as
it
may
seem
*punct* ,
i
accept
it
*punct* ,
and
refer
myself
to
you
as
a
friend.
*punct* ,
tell
me
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
have
i
no
chance
of
ever
succeeding
*punct* ?
*break*
he
stopped
in
his
earnestness
to
look
the
question
*punct* ,
and
the
expression
of
his
eyes
overpowered
her
*punct* .
*break*
my
dearest
emma
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
for
dearest
you
will
always
be
*punct* ,
whatever
the
event
of
this
hour's
conversation
*punct* ,
my
dearest
*punct* ,
most
beloved
emma
*punct* ,
tell
me
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
say
no
*punct* ,
if
it
is
to
be
said.
*punct* ,
she
could
really
say
nothing.
*punct* ,
you
are
silent
*punct* ,
he
cried
*punct* ,
with
great
animation
*punct* ;
absolutely
silent
*punct* !
*break*
at
present
i
ask
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
almost
ready
to
sink
under
the
agitation
of
this
moment
*punct* .
*break*
the
dread
of
being
awakened
from
the
happiest
dream
*punct* ,
was
perhaps
the
most
prominent
feeling
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
make
speeches
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* :
he
soon
resumed
*punct* ;
and
in
a
tone
of
such
sincere
*punct* ,
decided
*punct* ,
intelligible
tenderness
as
was
tolerably
convincing.
*punct* ,
if
i
loved
you
less
*punct* ,
i
might
be
able
to
talk
about
it
more
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
know
what
i
am.
*punct* ,
you
hear
nothing
but
truth
from
me.
*punct* ,
i
have
blamed
you
*punct* ,
and
lectured
you
*punct* ,
and
you
have
borne
it
as
no
other
woman
in
england
would
have
borne
it.
*punct* ,
bear
with
the
truths
i
would
tell
you
now
*punct* ,
dearest
emma
*punct* ,
as
well
as
you
have
borne
with
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
manner
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
may
have
as
little
to
recommend
them
*punct* .
*break*
god
knows
*punct* ,
i
have
been
a
very
indifferent
lover.
*punct* ,
but
you
understand
me.
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* ,
you
understand
my
feelings
*punct* ,
and
will
return
them
if
you
can
*punct* .
*break*
at
present
*punct* ,
i
ask
only
to
hear
*punct* ,
once
to
hear
your
voice
*punct* .
*break*
while
he
spoke
*punct* ,
emma's
mind
was
most
busy
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
with
all
the
wonderful
velocity
of
thought
*punct* ,
had
been
able
*punct* ,
and
yet
without
losing
a
word
*punct* ,
to
catch
and
comprehend
the
exact
truth
of
the
whole
*punct* ;
to
see
that
harriet's
hopes
had
been
entirely
groundless
*punct* ,
a
mistake
*punct* ,
a
delusion
*punct* ,
as
complete
a
delusion
as
any
of
her
own
*punct* ,
that
harriet
was
nothing
*punct* ;
that
she
was
every
thing
herself
*punct* ;
that
what
she
had
been
saying
relative
to
harriet
had
been
all
taken
as
the
language
of
her
own
feelings
*punct* ;
and
that
her
agitation
*punct* ,
her
doubts
*punct* ,
her
reluctance
*punct* ,
her
discouragement
*punct* ,
had
been
all
received
as
discouragement
from
herself.
*punct* ,
and
not
only
was
there
time
for
these
convictions
*punct* ,
with
all
their
glow
of
attendant
happiness
*punct* ;
there
was
time
also
to
rejoice
that
harriet's
secret
had
not
escaped
her
*punct* ,
and
to
resolve
that
it
need
not
*punct* ,
and
should
not.
*punct* ,
it
was
all
the
service
she
could
now
render
her
poor
friend
*punct* ;
for
as
to
any
of
that
heroism
of
sentiment
which
might
have
prompted
her
to
entreat
him
to
transfer
his
affection
from
herself
to
harriet
*punct* ,
as
infinitely
the
most
worthy
of
the
two
*punct* ,
or
even
the
more
simple
sublimity
of
resolving
to
refuse
him
at
once
and
for
ever
*punct* ,
without
vouchsafing
any
motive
*punct* ,
because
he
could
not
marry
them
both
*punct* ,
emma
had
it
not
*punct* .
*break*
she
felt
for
harriet
*punct* ,
with
pain
and
with
contrition
*punct* ;
but
no
flight
of
generosity
run
mad
*punct* ,
opposing
all
that
could
be
probable
or
reasonable
*punct* ,
entered
her
brain
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
led
her
friend
astray
*punct* ,
and
it
would
be
a
reproach
to
her
for
ever
*punct* ;
but
her
judgment
was
as
strong
as
her
feelings
*punct* ,
and
as
strong
as
it
had
ever
been
before
*punct* ,
in
reprobating
any
such
alliance
for
him
*punct* ,
as
most
unequal
and
degrading
*punct* .
*break*
her
way
was
clear
*punct* ,
though
not
quite
smooth.
*punct* ,
she
spoke
then
*punct* ,
on
being
so
entreated.
*punct* ,
what
did
she
say?
*punct* ,
just
what
she
ought
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* .
*break*
a
lady
always
does.
*punct* ,
she
said
enough
to
shew
there
need
not
be
despair
*punct* ,
and
to
invite
him
to
say
more
himself
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
despaired
at
one
period
*punct* ;
he
had
received
such
an
injunction
to
caution
and
silence
*punct* ,
as
for
the
time
crushed
every
hope;
*punct* ,
she
had
begun
by
refusing
to
hear
him.
*punct* ,
the
change
had
perhaps
been
somewhat
sudden;
*punct* ,
her
proposal
of
taking
another
turn
*punct* ,
her
renewing
the
conversation
which
she
had
just
put
an
end
to
*punct* ,
might
be
a
little
extraordinary!
*punct* ,
she
felt
its
inconsistency
*punct* ;
but
mr.
knightley
was
so
obliging
as
to
put
up
with
it
*punct* ,
and
seek
no
farther
explanation
*punct* .
*break*
seldom
*punct* ,
very
seldom
*punct* ,
does
complete
truth
belong
to
any
human
disclosure
*punct* ;
seldom
can
it
happen
that
something
is
not
a
little
disguised
*punct* ,
or
a
little
mistaken
*punct* ;
but
where
*punct* ,
as
in
this
case
*punct* ,
though
the
conduct
is
mistaken
*punct* ,
the
feelings
are
not
*punct* ,
it
may
not
be
very
material.
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
could
not
impute
to
emma
a
more
relenting
heart
than
she
possessed
*punct* ,
or
a
heart
more
disposed
to
accept
of
his
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
been
wholly
unsuspicious
of
his
own
influence
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
followed
her
into
the
shrubbery
with
no
idea
of
trying
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
come
*punct* ,
in
his
anxiety
to
see
how
she
bore
frank
churchill's
engagement
*punct* ,
with
no
selfish
view
*punct* ,
no
view
at
all
*punct* ,
but
of
endeavouring
*punct* ,
if
she
allowed
him
an
opening
*punct* ,
to
soothe
or
to
counsel
her.
*punct* ,
the
rest
had
been
the
work
of
the
moment
*punct* ,
the
immediate
effect
of
what
he
heard
*punct* ,
on
his
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
the
delightful
assurance
of
her
total
indifference
towards
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
of
her
having
a
heart
completely
disengaged
from
him
*punct* ,
had
given
birth
to
the
hope
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
in
time
*punct* ,
he
might
gain
her
affection
himself;
*punct* ,
but
it
had
been
no
present
hope
*punct* ,
he
had
only
*punct* ,
in
the
momentary
conquest
of
eagerness
over
judgment
*punct* ,
aspired
to
be
told
that
she
did
not
forbid
his
attempt
to
attach
her.
*punct* ,
the
superior
hopes
which
gradually
opened
were
so
much
the
more
enchanting.
*punct* ,
the
affection
*punct* ,
which
he
had
been
asking
to
be
allowed
to
create
*punct* ,
if
he
could
*punct* ,
was
already
his!
*punct* ,
within
half
an
hour
*punct* ,
he
had
passed
from
a
thoroughly
distressed
state
of
mind
*punct* ,
to
something
so
like
perfect
happiness
*punct* ,
that
it
could
bear
no
other
name
*punct* .
*break*
her
change
was
equal.
*punct* ,
this
one
half-hour
had
given
to
each
the
same
precious
certainty
of
being
beloved
*punct* ,
had
cleared
from
each
the
same
degree
of
ignorance
*punct* ,
jealousy
*punct* ,
or
distrust.
*punct* ,
on
his
side
*punct* ,
there
had
been
a
long-standing
jealousy
*punct* ,
old
as
the
arrival
*punct* ,
or
even
the
expectation
*punct* ,
of
frank
churchill.
*punct* ,
he
had
been
in
love
with
emma
*punct* ,
and
jealous
of
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
from
about
the
same
period
*punct* ,
one
sentiment
having
probably
enlightened
him
as
to
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
his
jealousy
of
frank
churchill
that
had
taken
him
from
the
country.
*punct* ,
the
box
hill
party
had
decided
him
on
going
away
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
save
himself
from
witnessing
again
such
permitted
*punct* ,
encouraged
attentions.
*punct* ,
he
had
gone
to
learn
to
be
indifferent.
*punct* ,
but
he
had
gone
to
a
wrong
place
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
too
much
domestic
happiness
in
his
brother's
house
*punct* ;
woman
wore
too
amiable
a
form
in
it
*punct* ;
isabella
was
too
much
like
emma
*punct* ,
differing
only
in
those
striking
inferiorities
*punct* ,
which
always
brought
the
other
in
brilliancy
before
him
*punct* ,
for
much
to
have
been
done
*punct* ,
even
had
his
time
been
longer.
*punct* ,
he
had
stayed
on
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
vigorously
*punct* ,
day
after
day
*punct* ,
till
this
very
morning's
post
had
conveyed
the
history
of
jane
fairfax.
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
with
the
gladness
which
must
be
felt
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
which
he
did
not
scruple
to
feel
*punct* ,
having
never
believed
frank
churchill
to
be
at
all
deserving
emma
*punct* ,
was
there
so
much
fond
solicitude
*punct* ,
so
much
keen
anxiety
for
her
*punct* ,
that
he
could
stay
no
longer
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
ridden
home
through
the
rain
*punct* ;
and
had
walked
up
directly
after
dinner
*punct* ,
to
see
how
this
sweetest
and
best
of
all
creatures
*punct* ,
faultless
in
spite
of
all
her
faults
*punct* ,
bore
the
discovery
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
found
her
agitated
and
low.
*punct* ,
frank
churchill
was
a
villain.
*punct* ,
he
heard
her
declare
that
she
had
never
loved
him
*punct* .
*break*
frank
churchill's
character
was
not
desperate.
*punct* ,
she
was
his
own
emma
*punct* ,
by
hand
and
word
*punct* ,
when
they
returned
into
the
house
*punct* ;
and
if
he
could
have
thought
of
frank
churchill
then
*punct* ,
he
might
have
deemed
him
a
very
good
sort
of
fellow
*punct* .
*break*
what
totally
different
feelings
did
emma
take
back
into
the
house
from
what
she
had
brought
out!
*punct* ,
she
had
then
been
only
daring
to
hope
for
a
little
respite
of
suffering;
*punct* ,
she
was
now
in
an
exquisite
flutter
of
happiness
*punct* ,
and
such
happiness
moreover
as
she
believed
must
still
be
greater
when
the
flutter
should
have
passed
away
*punct* .
*break*
they
sat
down
to
tea
*punct* ,
the
same
party
round
the
same
table
*punct* ,
how
often
it
had
been
collected!
*punct* ,
and
how
often
had
her
eyes
fallen
on
the
same
shrubs
in
the
lawn
*punct* ,
and
observed
the
same
beautiful
effect
of
the
western
sun!
*punct* ,
but
never
in
such
a
state
of
spirits
*punct* ,
never
in
any
thing
like
it
*punct* ;
and
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
could
summon
enough
of
her
usual
self
to
be
the
attentive
lady
of
the
house
*punct* ,
or
even
the
attentive
daughter
*punct* .
*break*
poor
mr.
woodhouse
little
suspected
what
was
plotting
against
him
in
the
breast
of
that
man
whom
he
was
so
cordially
welcoming
*punct* ,
and
so
anxiously
hoping
might
not
have
taken
cold
from
his
ride.
*punct* ,
could
he
have
seen
the
heart
*punct* ,
he
would
have
cared
very
little
for
the
lungs
*punct* ;
but
without
the
most
distant
imagination
of
the
impending
evil
*punct* ,
without
the
slightest
perception
of
any
thing
extraordinary
in
the
looks
or
ways
of
either
*punct* ,
he
repeated
to
them
very
comfortably
all
the
articles
of
news
he
had
received
from
mr.
perry
*punct* ,
and
talked
on
with
much
self-contentment
*punct* ,
totally
unsuspicious
of
what
they
could
have
told
him
in
return
*punct* .
*break*
as
long
as
mr.
knightley
remained
with
them
*punct* ,
emma's
fever
continued
*punct* ;
but
when
he
was
gone
*punct* ,
she
began
to
be
a
little
tranquillised
and
subdued
*punct* ,
and
in
the
course
of
the
sleepless
night
*punct* ,
which
was
the
tax
for
such
an
evening
*punct* ,
she
found
one
or
two
such
very
serious
points
to
consider
*punct* ,
as
made
her
feel
*punct* ,
that
even
her
happiness
must
have
some
alloy
*punct* .
*break*
her
father
*punct* ,
and
harriet
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
not
be
alone
without
feeling
the
full
weight
of
their
separate
claims
*punct* ;
and
how
to
guard
the
comfort
of
both
to
the
utmost
*punct* ,
was
the
question
*punct* .
*break*
with
respect
to
her
father
*punct* ,
it
was
a
question
soon
answered
*punct* .
*break*
she
hardly
knew
yet
what
mr.
knightley
would
ask
*punct* ;
but
a
very
short
parley
with
her
own
heart
produced
the
most
solemn
resolution
of
never
quitting
her
father.
*punct* ,
she
even
wept
over
the
idea
of
it
*punct* ,
as
a
sin
of
thought
*punct* .
*break*
while
he
lived
*punct* ,
it
must
be
only
an
engagement
*punct* ;
but
she
flattered
herself
*punct* ,
that
if
divested
of
the
danger
of
drawing
her
away
*punct* ,
it
might
become
an
increase
of
comfort
to
him.
*punct* ,
how
to
do
her
best
by
harriet
*punct* ,
was
of
more
difficult
decision;
*punct* ,
how
to
spare
her
from
any
unnecessary
pain
*punct* ;
how
to
make
her
any
possible
atonement
*punct* ;
how
to
appear
least
her
enemy?
*punct* ,
on
these
subjects
*punct* ,
her
perplexity
and
distress
were
very
great
*punct* ,
and
her
mind
had
to
pass
again
and
again
through
every
bitter
reproach
and
sorrowful
regret
that
had
ever
surrounded
it.
*punct* ,
she
could
only
resolve
at
last
*punct* ,
that
she
would
still
avoid
a
meeting
with
her
*punct* ,
and
communicate
all
that
need
be
told
by
letter
*punct* ;
that
it
would
be
inexpressibly
desirable
to
have
her
removed
just
now
for
a
time
from
highbury
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
indulging
in
one
scheme
more
*punct* ,
nearly
resolve
*punct* ,
that
it
might
be
practicable
to
get
an
invitation
for
her
to
brunswick
square.
*punct* ,
isabella
had
been
pleased
with
harriet
*punct* ;
and
a
few
weeks
spent
in
london
must
give
her
some
amusement.
*punct* ,
she
did
not
think
it
in
harriet's
nature
to
escape
being
benefited
by
novelty
and
variety
*punct* ,
by
the
streets
*punct* ,
the
shops
*punct* ,
and
the
children.
*punct* ,
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
it
would
be
a
proof
of
attention
and
kindness
in
herself
*punct* ,
from
whom
every
thing
was
due
*punct* ;
a
separation
for
the
present
*punct* ;
an
averting
of
the
evil
day
*punct* ,
when
they
must
all
be
together
again
*punct* .
*break*
she
rose
early
*punct* ,
and
wrote
her
letter
to
harriet
*punct* ;
an
employment
which
left
her
so
very
serious
*punct* ,
so
nearly
sad
*punct* ,
that
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
in
walking
up
to
hartfield
to
breakfast
*punct* ,
did
not
arrive
at
all
too
soon
*punct* ;
and
half
an
hour
stolen
afterwards
to
go
over
the
same
ground
again
with
him
*punct* ,
literally
and
figuratively
*punct* ,
was
quite
necessary
to
reinstate
her
in
a
proper
share
of
the
happiness
of
the
evening
before
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
not
left
her
long
*punct* ,
by
no
means
long
enough
for
her
to
have
the
slightest
inclination
for
thinking
of
any
body
else
*punct* ,
when
a
letter
was
brought
her
from
randalls
*punct* ,
a
very
thick
letter;
*punct* ,
she
guessed
what
it
must
contain
*punct* ,
and
deprecated
the
necessity
of
reading
it.
*punct* ,
she
was
now
in
perfect
charity
with
frank
churchill
*punct* ;
she
wanted
no
explanations
*punct* ,
she
wanted
only
to
have
her
thoughts
to
herself
*punct* ,
and
as
for
understanding
any
thing
he
wrote
*punct* ,
she
was
sure
she
was
incapable
of
it.
*punct* ,
it
must
be
waded
through
*punct* ,
however
*punct* .
*break*
she
opened
the
packet
*punct* ;
it
was
too
surely
so;
*punct* ,
a
note
from
mrs.
weston
to
herself
*punct* ,
ushered
in
the
letter
from
frank
to
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
the
greatest
pleasure
*punct* ,
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
in
forwarding
to
you
the
enclosed
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
what
thorough
justice
you
will
do
it
*punct* ,
and
have
scarcely
a
doubt
of
its
happy
effect.
*punct* ,
i
think
we
shall
never
materially
disagree
about
the
writer
again
*punct* ;
but
i
will
not
delay
you
by
a
long
preface.
*punct* ,
we
are
quite
well.
*punct* ,
this
letter
has
been
the
cure
of
all
the
little
nervousness
i
have
been
feeling
lately.
*punct* ,
i
did
not
quite
like
your
looks
on
tuesday
*punct* ,
but
it
was
an
ungenial
morning
*punct* ;
and
though
you
will
never
own
being
affected
by
weather
*punct* ,
i
think
every
body
feels
a
north-east
wind.
*punct* ,
i
felt
for
your
dear
father
very
much
in
the
storm
of
tuesday
afternoon
and
yesterday
morning
*punct* ,
but
had
the
comfort
of
hearing
last
night
*punct* ,
by
mr.
perry
*punct* ,
that
it
had
not
made
him
ill
*punct* .
*break*
yours
ever
*punct* ,
a
*punct* .
*break*
[to
mrs.
weston.]
windsor-july
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
madam
*punct* ,
if
i
made
myself
intelligible
yesterday
*punct* ,
this
letter
will
be
expected
*punct* ;
but
expected
or
not
*punct* ,
i
know
it
will
be
read
with
candour
and
indulgence.
*punct* ,
you
are
all
goodness
*punct* ,
and
i
believe
there
will
be
need
of
even
all
your
goodness
to
allow
for
some
parts
of
my
past
conduct.
*punct* ,
but
i
have
been
forgiven
by
one
who
had
still
more
to
resent
*punct* .
*break*
my
courage
rises
while
i
write
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
very
difficult
for
the
prosperous
to
be
humble
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
already
met
with
such
success
in
two
applications
for
pardon
*punct* ,
that
i
may
be
in
danger
of
thinking
myself
too
sure
of
yours
*punct* ,
and
of
those
among
your
friends
who
have
had
any
ground
of
offence.
*punct* ,
you
must
all
endeavour
to
comprehend
the
exact
nature
of
my
situation
when
i
first
arrived
at
randalls
*punct* ;
you
must
consider
me
as
having
a
secret
which
was
to
be
kept
at
all
hazards
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
the
fact
*punct* .
*break*
my
right
to
place
myself
in
a
situation
requiring
such
concealment
*punct* ,
is
another
question
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
not
discuss
it
here
*punct* .
*break*
for
my
temptation
to
think
it
a
right
*punct* ,
i
refer
every
caviller
to
a
brick
house
*punct* ,
sashed
windows
below
*punct* ,
and
casements
above
*punct* ,
in
highbury
*punct* .
*break*
i
dared
not
address
her
openly
*punct* ;
my
difficulties
in
the
then
state
of
enscombe
must
be
too
well
known
to
require
definition
*punct* ;
and
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
prevail
*punct* ,
before
we
parted
at
weymouth
*punct* ,
and
to
induce
the
most
upright
female
mind
in
the
creation
to
stoop
in
charity
to
a
secret
engagement.
*punct* ,
had
she
refused
*punct* ,
i
should
have
gone
mad.
*punct* ,
but
you
will
be
ready
to
say
*punct* ,
what
was
your
hope
in
doing
this?
*punct* ,
what
did
you
look
forward
to?
*punct* ,
to
any
thing
*punct* ,
every
thing
*punct* ,
to
time
*punct* ,
chance
*punct* ,
circumstance
*punct* ,
slow
effects
*punct* ,
sudden
bursts
*punct* ,
perseverance
and
weariness
*punct* ,
health
and
sickness
*punct* .
*break*
every
possibility
of
good
was
before
me
*punct* ,
and
the
first
of
blessings
secured
*punct* ,
in
obtaining
her
promises
of
faith
and
correspondence
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
need
farther
explanation
*punct* ,
i
have
the
honour
*punct* ,
my
dear
madam
*punct* ,
of
being
your
husband's
son
*punct* ,
and
the
advantage
of
inheriting
a
disposition
to
hope
for
good
*punct* ,
which
no
inheritance
of
houses
or
lands
can
ever
equal
the
value
of.
*punct* ,
see
me
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
under
these
circumstances
*punct* ,
arriving
on
my
first
visit
to
randalls;
*punct* ,
and
here
i
am
conscious
of
wrong
*punct* ,
for
that
visit
might
have
been
sooner
paid
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
look
back
and
see
that
i
did
not
come
till
miss
fairfax
was
in
highbury
*punct* ;
and
as
you
were
the
person
slighted
*punct* ,
you
will
forgive
me
instantly
*punct* ;
but
i
must
work
on
my
father's
compassion
*punct* ,
by
reminding
him
*punct* ,
that
so
long
as
i
absented
myself
from
his
house
*punct* ,
so
long
i
lost
the
blessing
of
knowing
you
*punct* .
*break*
my
behaviour
*punct* ,
during
the
very
happy
fortnight
which
i
spent
with
you
*punct* ,
did
not
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ,
lay
me
open
to
reprehension
*punct* ,
excepting
on
one
point
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
i
come
to
the
principal
*punct* ,
the
only
important
part
of
my
conduct
while
belonging
to
you
*punct* ,
which
excites
my
own
anxiety
*punct* ,
or
requires
very
solicitous
explanation
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
greatest
respect
*punct* ,
and
the
warmest
friendship
*punct* ,
do
i
mention
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ;
my
father
perhaps
will
think
i
ought
to
add
*punct* ,
with
the
deepest
humiliation.
*punct* ,
a
few
words
which
dropped
from
him
yesterday
spoke
his
opinion
*punct* ,
and
some
censure
i
acknowledge
myself
liable
to.
*punct* ,
my
behaviour
to
miss
woodhouse
indicated
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
more
than
it
ought.
*punct* ,
in
order
to
assist
a
concealment
so
essential
to
me
*punct* ,
i
was
led
on
to
make
more
than
an
allowable
use
of
the
sort
of
intimacy
into
which
we
were
immediately
thrown.
*punct* ,
i
cannot
deny
that
miss
woodhouse
was
my
ostensible
object
*punct* ,
but
i
am
sure
you
will
believe
the
declaration
*punct* ,
that
had
i
not
been
convinced
of
her
indifference
*punct* ,
i
would
not
have
been
induced
by
any
selfish
views
to
go
on.
*punct* ,
amiable
and
delightful
as
miss
woodhouse
is
*punct* ,
she
never
gave
me
the
idea
of
a
young
woman
likely
to
be
attached
*punct* ;
and
that
she
was
perfectly
free
from
any
tendency
to
being
attached
to
me
*punct* ,
was
as
much
my
conviction
as
my
wish.
*punct* ,
she
received
my
attentions
with
an
easy
*punct* ,
friendly
*punct* ,
goodhumoured
playfulness
*punct* ,
which
exactly
suited
me
*punct* .
*break*
we
seemed
to
understand
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
from
our
relative
situation
*punct* ,
those
attentions
were
her
due
*punct* ,
and
were
felt
to
be
so.
*punct* ,
whether
miss
woodhouse
began
really
to
understand
me
before
the
expiration
of
that
fortnight
*punct* ,
i
cannot
say;
*punct* ,
when
i
called
to
take
leave
of
her
*punct* ,
i
remember
that
i
was
within
a
moment
of
confessing
the
truth
*punct* ,
and
i
then
fancied
she
was
not
without
suspicion
*punct* ;
but
i
have
no
doubt
of
her
having
since
detected
me
*punct* ,
at
least
in
some
degree.
*punct* ,
she
may
not
have
surmised
the
whole
*punct* ,
but
her
quickness
must
have
penetrated
a
part
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
doubt
it
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
find
*punct* ,
whenever
the
subject
becomes
freed
from
its
present
restraints
*punct* ,
that
it
did
not
take
her
wholly
by
surprize
*punct* .
*break*
she
frequently
gave
me
hints
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
her
telling
me
at
the
ball
*punct* ,
that
i
owed
mrs.
elton
gratitude
for
her
attentions
to
miss
fairfax.
*punct* ,
i
hope
this
history
of
my
conduct
towards
her
will
be
admitted
by
you
and
my
father
as
great
extenuation
of
what
you
saw
amiss
*punct* .
*break*
while
you
considered
me
as
having
sinned
against
emma
woodhouse
*punct* ,
i
could
deserve
nothing
from
either
*punct* .
*break*
acquit
me
here
*punct* ,
and
procure
for
me
*punct* ,
when
it
is
allowable
*punct* ,
the
acquittal
and
good
wishes
of
that
said
emma
woodhouse
*punct* ,
whom
i
regard
with
so
much
brotherly
affection
*punct* ,
as
to
long
to
have
her
as
deeply
and
as
happily
in
love
as
myself.
*punct* ,
whatever
strange
things
i
said
or
did
during
that
fortnight
*punct* ,
you
have
now
a
key
to
*punct* .
*break*
my
heart
was
in
highbury
*punct* ,
and
my
business
was
to
get
my
body
thither
as
often
as
might
be
*punct* ,
and
with
the
least
suspicion
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
soon
*punct* ,
i
earnestly
hope
*punct* ,
know
her
thoroughly
yourself.
*punct* ,
no
description
can
describe
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
tell
you
herself
what
she
is
*punct* ,
yet
not
by
word
*punct* ,
for
never
was
there
a
human
creature
who
would
so
designedly
suppress
her
own
merit.
*punct* ,
since
i
began
this
letter
*punct* ,
which
will
be
longer
than
i
foresaw
*punct* ,
i
have
heard
from
her.
*punct* ,
she
gives
a
good
account
of
her
own
health
*punct* ;
but
as
she
never
complains
*punct* ,
i
dare
not
depend
*punct* .
*break*
i
want
to
have
your
opinion
of
her
looks
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
you
will
soon
call
on
her
*punct* ;
she
is
living
in
dread
of
the
visit
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
it
is
paid
already
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
hear
from
you
without
delay
*punct* ;
i
am
impatient
for
a
thousand
particulars
*punct* .
*break*
remember
how
few
minutes
i
was
at
randalls
*punct* ,
and
in
how
bewildered
*punct* ,
how
mad
a
state
*punct* :
and
i
am
not
much
better
yet
*punct* ;
still
insane
either
from
happiness
or
misery
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
think
of
the
kindness
and
favour
i
have
met
with
*punct* ,
of
her
excellence
and
patience
*punct* ,
and
my
uncle's
generosity
*punct* ,
i
am
mad
with
joy
*punct* :
but
when
i
recollect
all
the
uneasiness
i
occasioned
her
*punct* ,
and
how
little
i
deserve
to
be
forgiven
*punct* ,
i
am
mad
with
anger
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
could
but
see
her
again!
*punct* ,
but
i
must
not
propose
it
yet
*punct* .
*break*
my
uncle
has
been
too
good
for
me
to
encroach.
*punct* ,
i
must
still
add
to
this
long
letter
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
not
heard
all
that
you
ought
to
hear
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
give
any
connected
detail
yesterday
*punct* ;
but
the
suddenness
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
one
light
*punct* ,
the
unseasonableness
with
which
the
affair
burst
out
*punct* ,
needs
explanation
*punct* ;
for
though
the
event
of
the
26th
ult.
*punct* ,
as
you
will
conclude
*punct* ,
immediately
opened
to
me
the
happiest
prospects
*punct* ,
i
should
not
have
presumed
on
such
early
measures
*punct* ,
but
from
the
very
particular
circumstances
*punct* ,
which
left
me
not
an
hour
to
lose
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
myself
have
shrunk
from
any
thing
so
hasty
*punct* ,
and
she
would
have
felt
every
scruple
of
mine
with
multiplied
strength
and
refinement.
*punct* ,
but
i
had
no
choice
*punct* .
*break*
the
hasty
engagement
she
had
entered
into
with
that
woman
*punct* ,
here
*punct* ,
my
dear
madam
*punct* ,
i
was
obliged
to
leave
off
abruptly
*punct* ,
to
recollect
and
compose
myself.
*punct* ,
i
have
been
walking
over
the
country
*punct* ,
and
am
now
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ,
rational
enough
to
make
the
rest
of
my
letter
what
it
ought
to
be.
*punct* ,
it
is
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
a
most
mortifying
retrospect
for
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
behaved
shamefully
*punct* .
*break*
and
here
i
can
admit
*punct* ,
that
my
manners
to
miss
w.
*punct* ,
in
being
unpleasant
to
miss
f.
*punct* ,
were
highly
blameable
*punct* .
*break*
she
disapproved
them
*punct* ,
which
ought
to
have
been
enough.
*punct* ,
my
plea
of
concealing
the
truth
she
did
not
think
sufficient.
*punct* ,
she
was
displeased
*punct* ;
i
thought
unreasonably
so
*punct* :
i
thought
her
*punct* ,
on
a
thousand
occasions
*punct* ,
unnecessarily
scrupulous
and
cautious
*punct* :
i
thought
her
even
cold
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
was
always
right
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
had
followed
her
judgment
*punct* ,
and
subdued
my
spirits
to
the
level
of
what
she
deemed
proper
*punct* ,
i
should
have
escaped
the
greatest
unhappiness
i
have
ever
known.
*punct* ,
we
quarrelled.
*punct* ,
do
you
remember
the
morning
spent
at
donwell?
*punct* ,
there
every
little
dissatisfaction
that
had
occurred
before
came
to
a
crisis
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
late
*punct* ;
i
met
her
walking
home
by
herself
*punct* ,
and
wanted
to
walk
with
her
*punct* ,
but
she
would
not
suffer
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
absolutely
refused
to
allow
me
*punct* ,
which
i
then
thought
most
unreasonable
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
i
see
nothing
in
it
but
a
very
natural
and
consistent
degree
of
discretion
*punct* .
*break*
while
i
*punct* ,
to
blind
the
world
to
our
engagement
*punct* ,
was
behaving
one
hour
with
objectionable
particularity
to
another
woman
*punct* ,
was
she
to
be
consenting
the
next
to
a
proposal
which
might
have
made
every
previous
caution
useless?
*punct* ,
had
we
been
met
walking
together
between
donwell
and
highbury
*punct* ,
the
truth
must
have
been
suspected.
*punct* ,
i
was
mad
enough
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
to
resent.
*punct* ,
i
doubted
her
affection
*punct* .
*break*
i
doubted
it
more
the
next
day
on
box
hill
*punct* ;
when
*punct* ,
provoked
by
such
conduct
on
my
side
*punct* ,
such
shameful
*punct* ,
insolent
neglect
of
her
*punct* ,
and
such
apparent
devotion
to
miss
w.
*punct* ,
as
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
any
woman
of
sense
to
endure
*punct* ,
she
spoke
her
resentment
in
a
form
of
words
perfectly
intelligible
to
me.
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
my
dear
madam
*punct* ,
it
was
a
quarrel
blameless
on
her
side
*punct* ,
abominable
on
mine
*punct* ;
and
i
returned
the
same
evening
to
richmond
*punct* ,
though
i
might
have
staid
with
you
till
the
next
morning
*punct* ,
merely
because
i
would
be
as
angry
with
her
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
even
then
*punct* ,
i
was
not
such
a
fool
as
not
to
mean
to
be
reconciled
in
time
*punct* ;
but
i
was
the
injured
person
*punct* ,
injured
by
her
coldness
*punct* ,
and
i
went
away
determined
that
she
should
make
the
first
advances.
*punct* ,
i
shall
always
congratulate
myself
that
you
were
not
of
the
box
hill
party
*punct* .
*break*
had
you
witnessed
my
behaviour
there
*punct* ,
i
can
hardly
suppose
you
would
ever
have
thought
well
of
me
again
*punct* .
*break*
its
effect
upon
her
appears
in
the
immediate
resolution
it
produced
*punct* :
as
soon
as
she
found
i
was
really
gone
from
randalls
*punct* ,
she
closed
with
the
offer
of
that
officious
mrs.
elton
*punct* ;
the
whole
system
of
whose
treatment
of
her
*punct* ,
by
the
bye
*punct* ,
has
ever
filled
me
with
indignation
and
hatred
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
not
quarrel
with
a
spirit
of
forbearance
which
has
been
so
richly
extended
towards
myself
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
otherwise
*punct* ,
i
should
loudly
protest
against
the
share
of
it
which
that
woman
has
known.
*punct* ,
jane
*punct* ,
indeed!
*punct* ,
you
will
observe
that
i
have
not
yet
indulged
myself
in
calling
her
by
that
name
*punct* ,
even
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
think
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
what
i
must
have
endured
in
hearing
it
bandied
between
the
eltons
with
all
the
vulgarity
of
needless
repetition
*punct* ,
and
all
the
insolence
of
imaginary
superiority
*punct* .
*break*
have
patience
with
me
*punct* ,
i
shall
soon
have
done.
*punct* ,
she
closed
with
this
offer
*punct* ,
resolving
to
break
with
me
entirely
*punct* ,
and
wrote
the
next
day
to
tell
me
that
we
never
were
to
meet
again.
*punct* ,
she
felt
the
engagement
to
be
a
source
of
repentance
and
misery
to
each
*punct* :
she
dissolved
it.
*punct* ,
this
letter
reached
me
on
the
very
morning
of
my
poor
aunt's
death
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
the
name
*punct* ,
the
place
*punct* ,
i
knew
all
about
it
*punct* ,
and
instantly
saw
what
she
had
been
doing
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
perfectly
accordant
with
that
resolution
of
character
which
i
knew
her
to
possess
*punct* ;
and
the
secrecy
she
had
maintained
*punct* ,
as
to
any
such
design
in
her
former
letter
*punct* ,
was
equally
descriptive
of
its
anxious
delicacy
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
world
would
not
she
have
seemed
to
threaten
me.
*punct* ,
imagine
the
shock
*punct* ;
imagine
how
*punct* ,
till
i
had
actually
detected
my
own
blunder
*punct* ,
i
raved
at
the
blunders
of
the
post.
*punct* ,
what
was
to
be
done?
*punct* ,
one
thing
only.
*punct* ,
i
must
speak
to
my
uncle
*punct* .
*break*
without
his
sanction
i
could
not
hope
to
be
listened
to
again.
*punct* ,
i
spoke
*punct* ;
circumstances
were
in
my
favour
*punct* ;
the
late
event
had
softened
away
his
pride
*punct* ,
and
he
was
*punct* ,
earlier
than
i
could
have
anticipated
*punct* ,
wholly
reconciled
and
complying
*punct* ;
and
could
say
at
last
*punct* ,
poor
man
*punct* !
*break*
with
a
deep
sigh
*punct* ,
that
he
wished
i
might
find
as
much
happiness
in
the
marriage
state
as
he
had
done.
*punct* ,
i
felt
that
it
would
be
of
a
different
sort.
*punct* ,
are
you
disposed
to
pity
me
for
what
i
must
have
suffered
in
opening
the
cause
to
him
*punct* ,
for
my
suspense
while
all
was
at
stake?
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ;
do
not
pity
me
till
i
reached
highbury
*punct* ,
and
saw
how
ill
i
had
made
her
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
pity
me
till
i
saw
her
wan
*punct* ,
sick
looks.
*punct* ,
i
reached
highbury
at
the
time
of
day
when
*punct* ,
from
my
knowledge
of
their
late
breakfast
hour
*punct* ,
i
was
certain
of
a
good
chance
of
finding
her
alone.
*punct* ,
i
was
not
disappointed
*punct* ;
and
at
last
i
was
not
disappointed
either
in
the
object
of
my
journey
*punct* .
*break*
a
great
deal
of
very
reasonable
*punct* ,
very
just
displeasure
i
had
to
persuade
away
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
done
*punct* ;
we
are
reconciled
*punct* ,
dearer
*punct* ,
much
dearer
*punct* ,
than
ever
*punct* ,
and
no
moment's
uneasiness
can
ever
occur
between
us
again
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
my
dear
madam
*punct* ,
i
will
release
you
*punct* ;
but
i
could
not
conclude
before
*punct* .
*break*
calls
me
the
child
of
good
fortune
*punct* .
*break*
this
letter
must
make
its
way
to
emma's
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
obliged
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
her
previous
determination
to
the
contrary
*punct* ,
to
do
it
all
the
justice
that
mrs.
weston
foretold
*punct* .
*break*
as
soon
as
she
came
to
her
own
name
*punct* ,
it
was
irresistible
*punct* ;
every
line
relating
to
herself
was
interesting
*punct* ,
and
almost
every
line
agreeable
*punct* ;
and
when
this
charm
ceased
*punct* ,
the
subject
could
still
maintain
itself
*punct* ,
by
the
natural
return
of
her
former
regard
for
the
writer
*punct* ,
and
the
very
strong
attraction
which
any
picture
of
love
must
have
for
her
at
that
moment
*punct* .
*break*
she
never
stopt
till
she
had
gone
through
the
whole
*punct* ;
and
though
it
was
impossible
not
to
feel
that
he
had
been
wrong
*punct* ,
yet
he
had
been
less
wrong
than
she
had
supposed
*punct* ,
and
he
had
suffered
*punct* ,
and
was
very
sorry
*punct* ,
and
he
was
so
grateful
to
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
and
so
much
in
love
with
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
and
she
was
so
happy
herself
*punct* ,
that
there
was
no
being
severe
*punct* ;
and
could
he
have
entered
the
room
*punct* ,
she
must
have
shaken
hands
with
him
as
heartily
as
ever
*punct* .
*break*
she
thought
so
well
of
the
letter
*punct* ,
that
when
mr.
knightley
came
again
*punct* ,
she
desired
him
to
read
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
sure
of
mrs.
weston's
wishing
it
to
be
communicated
*punct* ;
especially
to
one
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
like
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
had
seen
so
much
to
blame
in
his
conduct
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
look
it
over
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ;
but
it
seems
long
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
take
it
home
with
me
at
night
*punct* .
*break*
but
that
would
not
do
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston
was
to
call
in
the
evening
*punct* ,
and
she
must
return
it
by
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
rather
be
talking
to
you
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ;
but
as
it
seems
a
matter
of
justice
*punct* ,
it
shall
be
done
*punct* .
*break*
he
began
*punct* ,
stopping
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
almost
directly
to
say
*punct* ,
had
i
been
offered
the
sight
of
one
of
this
gentleman's
letters
to
his
mother-in-law
a
few
months
ago
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
it
would
not
have
been
taken
with
such
indifference
*punct* .
*break*
he
proceeded
a
little
farther
*punct* ,
reading
to
himself
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
with
a
smile
*punct* ,
observed
*punct* ,
humph
*punct* !
*break*
a
fine
complimentary
opening
*punct* :
but
it
is
his
way
*punct* .
*break*
one
man's
style
must
not
be
the
rule
of
another's
*punct* .
*break*
we
will
not
be
severe
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
be
natural
for
me
*punct* ,
he
added
shortly
afterwards
*punct* ,
to
speak
my
opinion
aloud
as
i
read
*punct* .
*break*
by
doing
it
*punct* ,
i
shall
feel
that
i
am
near
you
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
not
be
so
great
a
loss
of
time
*punct* :
but
if
you
dislike
it
*punct* ,
not
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
wish
it
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
returned
to
his
reading
with
greater
alacrity
*punct* .
*break*
he
trifles
here
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
as
to
the
temptation
*punct* .
*break*
he
knows
he
is
wrong
*punct* ,
and
has
nothing
rational
to
urge.
*punct* ,
bad.
*punct* ,
he
ought
not
to
have
formed
the
engagement.
*punct* ,
his
father's
disposition:'
*punct* ,
he
is
unjust
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
to
his
father
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
weston's
sanguine
temper
was
a
blessing
on
all
his
upright
and
honourable
exertions
*punct* ;
but
mr.
weston
earned
every
present
comfort
before
he
endeavoured
to
gain
it.
*punct* ,
very
true
*punct* ;
he
did
not
come
till
miss
fairfax
was
here
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
have
not
forgotten
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* ,
how
sure
you
were
that
he
might
have
come
sooner
if
he
would
*punct* .
*break*
you
pass
it
over
very
handsomely
*punct* ,
but
you
were
perfectly
right
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
not
quite
impartial
in
my
judgment
*punct* ,
emma:
*punct* ,
but
yet
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
had
you
not
been
in
the
case
*punct* ,
i
should
still
have
distrusted
him
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
came
to
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
he
was
obliged
to
read
the
whole
of
it
aloud
*punct* ,
all
that
related
to
her
*punct* ,
with
a
smile
*punct* ;
a
look
*punct* ;
a
shake
of
the
head
*punct* ;
a
word
or
two
of
assent
*punct* ,
or
disapprobation
*punct* ;
or
merely
of
love
*punct* ,
as
the
subject
required
*punct* ;
concluding
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
seriously
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
after
steady
reflection
*punct* ,
thus
*punct* ,
very
bad
*punct* ,
though
it
might
have
been
worse.
*punct* ,
playing
a
most
dangerous
game
*punct* .
*break*
too
much
indebted
to
the
event
for
his
acquittal.
*punct* ,
no
judge
of
his
own
manners
by
you.
*punct* ,
always
deceived
in
fact
by
his
own
wishes
*punct* ,
and
regardless
of
little
besides
his
own
convenience.
*punct* ,
fancying
you
to
have
fathomed
his
secret
*punct* .
*break*
natural
enough!
*punct* ,
his
own
mind
full
of
intrigue
*punct* ,
that
he
should
suspect
it
in
others.
*punct* ,
mystery
*punct* ;
finesse
*punct* ,
how
they
pervert
the
understanding
*punct* !
*break*
my
emma
*punct* ,
does
not
every
thing
serve
to
prove
more
and
more
the
beauty
of
truth
and
sincerity
in
all
our
dealings
with
each
other
*punct* ?
*break*
emma
agreed
to
it
*punct* ,
and
with
a
blush
of
sensibility
on
harriet's
account
*punct* ,
which
she
could
not
give
any
sincere
explanation
of
*punct* .
*break*
you
had
better
go
on
*punct* ,
said
she
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
so
*punct* ,
but
very
soon
stopt
again
to
say
*punct* ,
the
pianoforte
*punct* !
*break*
that
was
the
act
of
a
very
*punct* ,
very
young
man
*punct* ,
one
too
young
to
consider
whether
the
inconvenience
of
it
might
not
very
much
exceed
the
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
a
boyish
scheme
*punct* ,
indeed!
*punct* ,
i
cannot
comprehend
a
man's
wishing
to
give
a
woman
any
proof
of
affection
which
he
knows
she
would
rather
dispense
with
*punct* ;
and
he
did
know
that
she
would
have
prevented
the
instrument's
coming
if
she
could
*punct* .
*break*
after
this
*punct* ,
he
made
some
progress
without
any
pause
*punct* .
*break*
frank
churchill's
confession
of
having
behaved
shamefully
was
the
first
thing
to
call
for
more
than
a
word
in
passing
*punct* .
*break*
i
perfectly
agree
with
you
*punct* ,
sir,
*punct* ,
was
then
his
remark
*punct* .
*break*
you
did
behave
very
shamefully
*punct* .
*break*
you
never
wrote
a
truer
line
*punct* .
*break*
and
having
gone
through
what
immediately
followed
of
the
basis
of
their
disagreement
*punct* ,
and
his
persisting
to
act
in
direct
opposition
to
jane
fairfax's
sense
of
right
*punct* ,
he
made
a
fuller
pause
to
say
*punct* ,
this
is
very
bad.
*punct* ,
he
had
induced
her
to
place
herself
*punct* ,
for
his
sake
*punct* ,
in
a
situation
of
extreme
difficulty
and
uneasiness
*punct* ,
and
it
should
have
been
his
first
object
to
prevent
her
from
suffering
unnecessarily.
*punct* ,
she
must
have
had
much
more
to
contend
with
*punct* ,
in
carrying
on
the
correspondence
*punct* ,
than
he
could
*punct* .
*break*
he
should
have
respected
even
unreasonable
scruples
*punct* ,
had
there
been
such
*punct* ;
but
hers
were
all
reasonable
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
look
to
her
one
fault
*punct* ,
and
remember
that
she
had
done
a
wrong
thing
in
consenting
to
the
engagement
*punct* ,
to
bear
that
she
should
have
been
in
such
a
state
of
punishment
*punct* .
*break*
emma
knew
that
he
was
now
getting
to
the
box
hill
party
*punct* ,
and
grew
uncomfortable
*punct* .
*break*
her
own
behaviour
had
been
so
very
improper
*punct* !
*break*
she
was
deeply
ashamed
*punct* ,
and
a
little
afraid
of
his
next
look
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
all
read
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
steadily
*punct* ,
attentively
*punct* ,
and
without
the
smallest
remark
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
excepting
one
momentary
glance
at
her
*punct* ,
instantly
withdrawn
*punct* ,
in
the
fear
of
giving
pain
*punct* ,
no
remembrance
of
box
hill
seemed
to
exist
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
saying
much
for
the
delicacy
of
our
good
friends
*punct* ,
the
eltons
*punct* ,
was
his
next
observation.
*punct* ,
his
feelings
are
natural.
*punct* ,
what
*punct* !
*break*
actually
resolve
to
break
with
him
entirely!
*punct* ,
she
felt
the
engagement
to
be
a
source
of
repentance
and
misery
to
each
*punct* ,
she
dissolved
it.
*punct* ,
what
a
view
this
gives
of
her
sense
of
his
behaviour!
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
he
must
be
a
most
extraordinary
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
read
on.
*punct* ,
you
will
find
how
very
much
he
suffers
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
he
does
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
knightley
coolly
*punct* ,
and
resuming
the
letter
*punct* .
*break*
smallridge!'
*punct* ,
what
does
this
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
what
is
all
this
*punct* ?
*break*
she
had
engaged
to
go
as
governess
to
mrs.
smallridge's
children
*punct* ,
a
dear
friend
of
mrs.
elton's
*punct* ,
a
neighbour
of
maple
grove
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
by
the
bye
*punct* ,
i
wonder
how
mrs.
elton
bears
the
disappointment
*punct* ?
*break*
say
nothing
*punct* ,
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
while
you
oblige
me
to
read
*punct* ,
not
even
of
mrs.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
only
one
page
more
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
soon
have
done
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
letter
the
man
writes
*punct* !
*break*
i
wish
you
would
read
it
with
a
kinder
spirit
towards
him
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
there
is
feeling
here.
*punct* ,
he
does
seem
to
have
suffered
in
finding
her
ill.
*punct* ,
certainly
*punct* ,
i
can
have
no
doubt
of
his
being
fond
of
her
*punct* .
*break*
dearer
*punct* ,
much
dearer
than
ever
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
he
may
long
continue
to
feel
all
the
value
of
such
a
reconciliation.
*punct* ,
he
is
a
very
liberal
thanker
*punct* ,
with
his
thousands
and
tens
of
thousands.
*punct* ,
happier
than
i
deserve
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
he
knows
himself
there
*punct* .
*break*
miss
woodhouse
calls
me
the
child
of
good
fortune.'
*punct* ,
those
were
miss
woodhouse's
words
*punct* ,
were
they?
*punct* ,
and
a
fine
ending
*punct* ,
and
there
is
the
letter
*punct* .
*break*
the
child
of
good
fortune
*punct* !
*break*
that
was
your
name
for
him
*punct* ,
was
it
*punct* ?
*break*
you
do
not
appear
so
well
satisfied
with
his
letter
as
i
am
*punct* ;
but
still
you
must
*punct* ,
at
least
i
hope
you
must
*punct* ,
think
the
better
of
him
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
it
does
him
some
service
with
you
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
certainly
it
does
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
had
great
faults
*punct* ,
faults
of
inconsideration
and
thoughtlessness
*punct* ;
and
i
am
very
much
of
his
opinion
in
thinking
him
likely
to
be
happier
than
he
deserves
*punct* :
but
still
as
he
is
*punct* ,
beyond
a
doubt
*punct* ,
really
attached
to
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
and
will
soon
*punct* ,
it
may
be
hoped
*punct* ,
have
the
advantage
of
being
constantly
with
her
*punct* ,
i
am
very
ready
to
believe
his
character
will
improve
*punct* ,
and
acquire
from
hers
the
steadiness
and
delicacy
of
principle
that
it
wants
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
*punct* ,
let
me
talk
to
you
of
something
else
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
another
person's
interest
at
present
so
much
at
heart
*punct* ,
that
i
cannot
think
any
longer
about
frank
churchill
*punct* .
*break*
ever
since
i
left
you
this
morning
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
my
mind
has
been
hard
at
work
on
one
subject
*punct* .
*break*
the
subject
followed
*punct* ;
it
was
in
plain
*punct* ,
unaffected
*punct* ,
gentlemanlike
english
*punct* ,
such
as
mr.
knightley
used
even
to
the
woman
he
was
in
love
with
*punct* ,
how
to
be
able
to
ask
her
to
marry
him
*punct* ,
without
attacking
the
happiness
of
her
father
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
answer
was
ready
at
the
first
word
*punct* .
*break*
while
her
dear
father
lived
*punct* ,
any
change
of
condition
must
be
impossible
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
never
quit
him
*punct* .
*break*
part
only
of
this
answer
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
was
admitted
*punct* .
*break*
the
impossibility
of
her
quitting
her
father
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
felt
as
strongly
as
herself
*punct* ;
but
the
inadmissibility
of
any
other
change
*punct* ,
he
could
not
agree
to
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
thinking
it
over
most
deeply
*punct* ,
most
intently
*punct* ;
he
had
at
first
hoped
to
induce
mr.
woodhouse
to
remove
with
her
to
donwell
*punct* ;
he
had
wanted
to
believe
it
feasible
*punct* ,
but
his
knowledge
of
mr.
woodhouse
would
not
suffer
him
to
deceive
himself
long
*punct* ;
and
now
he
confessed
his
persuasion
*punct* ,
that
such
a
transplantation
would
be
a
risk
of
her
father's
comfort
*punct* ,
perhaps
even
of
his
life
*punct* ,
which
must
not
be
hazarded
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
taken
from
hartfield!
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
he
felt
that
it
ought
not
to
be
attempted
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
plan
which
had
arisen
on
the
sacrifice
of
this
*punct* ,
he
trusted
his
dearest
emma
would
not
find
in
any
respect
objectionable
*punct* ;
it
was
*punct* ,
that
he
should
be
received
at
hartfield
*punct* ;
that
so
long
as
her
father's
happiness
in
other
words
his
life
*punct* ,
required
hartfield
to
continue
her
home
*punct* ,
it
should
be
his
likewise
*punct* .
*break*
of
their
all
removing
to
donwell
*punct* ,
emma
had
already
had
her
own
passing
thoughts
*punct* .
*break*
like
him
*punct* ,
she
had
tried
the
scheme
and
rejected
it
*punct* ;
but
such
an
alternative
as
this
had
not
occurred
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
sensible
of
all
the
affection
it
evinced
*punct* .
*break*
she
felt
that
*punct* ,
in
quitting
donwell
*punct* ,
he
must
be
sacrificing
a
great
deal
of
independence
of
hours
and
habits
*punct* ;
that
in
living
constantly
with
her
father
*punct* ,
and
in
no
house
of
his
own
*punct* ,
there
would
be
much
*punct* ,
very
much
*punct* ,
to
be
borne
with
*punct* .
*break*
she
promised
to
think
of
it
*punct* ,
and
advised
him
to
think
of
it
more
*punct* ;
but
he
was
fully
convinced
*punct* ,
that
no
reflection
could
alter
his
wishes
or
his
opinion
on
the
subject
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
given
it
*punct* ,
he
could
assure
her
*punct* ,
very
long
and
calm
consideration
*punct* ;
he
had
been
walking
away
from
william
larkins
the
whole
morning
*punct* ,
to
have
his
thoughts
to
himself
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
one
difficulty
unprovided
for
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
william
larkins
will
not
like
it
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
get
his
consent
before
you
ask
mine
*punct* .
*break*
she
promised
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
to
think
of
it
*punct* ;
and
pretty
nearly
promised
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
to
think
of
it
*punct* ,
with
the
intention
of
finding
it
a
very
good
scheme
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
remarkable
*punct* ,
that
emma
*punct* ,
in
the
many
*punct* ,
very
many
*punct* ,
points
of
view
in
which
she
was
now
beginning
to
consider
donwell
abbey
*punct* ,
was
never
struck
with
any
sense
of
injury
to
her
nephew
henry
*punct* ,
whose
rights
as
heir-expectant
had
formerly
been
so
tenaciously
regarded
*punct* .
*break*
think
she
must
of
the
possible
difference
to
the
poor
little
boy
*punct* ;
and
yet
she
only
gave
herself
a
saucy
conscious
smile
about
it
*punct* ,
and
found
amusement
in
detecting
the
real
cause
of
that
violent
dislike
of
mr.
knightley's
marrying
jane
fairfax
*punct* ,
or
any
body
else
*punct* ,
which
at
the
time
she
had
wholly
imputed
to
the
amiable
solicitude
of
the
sister
and
the
aunt
*punct* .
*break*
this
proposal
of
his
*punct* ,
this
plan
of
marrying
and
continuing
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
the
more
she
contemplated
it
*punct* ,
the
more
pleasing
it
became
*punct* .
*break*
his
evils
seemed
to
lessen
*punct* ,
her
own
advantages
to
increase
*punct* ,
their
mutual
good
to
outweigh
every
drawback
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
companion
for
herself
in
the
periods
of
anxiety
and
cheerlessness
before
her!
*punct* ,
such
a
partner
in
all
those
duties
and
cares
to
which
time
must
be
giving
increase
of
melancholy
*punct* !
*break*
she
would
have
been
too
happy
but
for
poor
harriet
*punct* ;
but
every
blessing
of
her
own
seemed
to
involve
and
advance
the
sufferings
of
her
friend
*punct* ,
who
must
now
be
even
excluded
from
hartfield
*punct* .
*break*
the
delightful
family
party
which
emma
was
securing
for
herself
*punct* ,
poor
harriet
must
*punct* ,
in
mere
charitable
caution
*punct* ,
be
kept
at
a
distance
from
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
be
a
loser
in
every
way
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
deplore
her
future
absence
as
any
deduction
from
her
own
enjoyment
*punct* .
*break*
in
such
a
party
*punct* ,
harriet
would
be
rather
a
dead
weight
than
otherwise
*punct* ;
but
for
the
poor
girl
herself
*punct* ,
it
seemed
a
peculiarly
cruel
necessity
that
was
to
be
placing
her
in
such
a
state
of
unmerited
punishment
*punct* .
*break*
in
time
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
would
be
forgotten
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
supplanted
*punct* ;
but
this
could
not
be
expected
to
happen
very
early
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
himself
would
be
doing
nothing
to
assist
the
cure;
*punct* ,
not
like
mr.
elton
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
always
so
kind
*punct* ,
so
feeling
*punct* ,
so
truly
considerate
for
every
body
*punct* ,
would
never
deserve
to
be
less
worshipped
than
now
*punct* ;
and
it
really
was
too
much
to
hope
even
of
harriet
*punct* ,
that
she
could
be
in
love
with
more
than
three
men
in
one
year
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
very
great
relief
to
emma
to
find
harriet
as
desirous
as
herself
to
avoid
a
meeting
*punct* .
*break*
their
intercourse
was
painful
enough
by
letter
*punct* .
*break*
how
much
worse
*punct* ,
had
they
been
obliged
to
meet
*punct* !
*break*
harriet
expressed
herself
very
much
as
might
be
supposed
*punct* ,
without
reproaches
*punct* ,
or
apparent
sense
of
ill-usage
*punct* ;
and
yet
emma
fancied
there
was
a
something
of
resentment
*punct* ,
a
something
bordering
on
it
in
her
style
*punct* ,
which
increased
the
desirableness
of
their
being
separate.
*punct* ,
it
might
be
only
her
own
consciousness
*punct* ;
but
it
seemed
as
if
an
angel
only
could
have
been
quite
without
resentment
under
such
a
stroke
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
no
difficulty
in
procuring
isabella's
invitation
*punct* ;
and
she
was
fortunate
in
having
a
sufficient
reason
for
asking
it
*punct* ,
without
resorting
to
invention.
*punct* ,
there
was
a
tooth
amiss
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
really
wished
*punct* ,
and
had
wished
some
time
*punct* ,
to
consult
a
dentist
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
john
knightley
was
delighted
to
be
of
use
*punct* ;
any
thing
of
ill
health
was
a
recommendation
to
her
*punct* ,
and
though
not
so
fond
of
a
dentist
as
of
a
mr.
wingfield
*punct* ,
she
was
quite
eager
to
have
harriet
under
her
care.
*punct* ,
when
it
was
thus
settled
on
her
sister's
side
*punct* ,
emma
proposed
it
to
her
friend
*punct* ,
and
found
her
very
persuadable.
*punct* ,
harriet
was
to
go
*punct* ;
she
was
invited
for
at
least
a
fortnight
*punct* ;
she
was
to
be
conveyed
in
mr.
woodhouse's
carriage.
*punct* ,
it
was
all
arranged
*punct* ,
it
was
all
completed
*punct* ,
and
harriet
was
safe
in
brunswick
square
*punct* .
*break*
now
emma
could
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
enjoy
mr.
knightley's
visits
*punct* ;
now
she
could
talk
*punct* ,
and
she
could
listen
with
true
happiness
*punct* ,
unchecked
by
that
sense
of
injustice
*punct* ,
of
guilt
*punct* ,
of
something
most
painful
*punct* ,
which
had
haunted
her
when
remembering
how
disappointed
a
heart
was
near
her
*punct* ,
how
much
might
at
that
moment
*punct* ,
and
at
a
little
distance
*punct* ,
be
enduring
by
the
feelings
which
she
had
led
astray
herself
*punct* .
*break*
the
difference
of
harriet
at
mrs.
goddard's
*punct* ,
or
in
london
*punct* ,
made
perhaps
an
unreasonable
difference
in
emma's
sensations
*punct* ;
but
she
could
not
think
of
her
in
london
without
objects
of
curiosity
and
employment
*punct* ,
which
must
be
averting
the
past
*punct* ,
and
carrying
her
out
of
herself
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
not
allow
any
other
anxiety
to
succeed
directly
to
the
place
in
her
mind
which
harriet
had
occupied
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
communication
before
her
*punct* ,
one
which
she
only
could
be
competent
to
make
*punct* ,
the
confession
of
her
engagement
to
her
father
*punct* ;
but
she
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
at
present.
*punct* ,
she
had
resolved
to
defer
the
disclosure
till
mrs.
weston
were
safe
and
well
*punct* .
*break*
no
additional
agitation
should
be
thrown
at
this
period
among
those
she
loved
*punct* ,
and
the
evil
should
not
act
on
herself
by
anticipation
before
the
appointed
time.
*punct* ,
a
fortnight
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
of
leisure
and
peace
of
mind
*punct* ,
to
crown
every
warmer
*punct* ,
but
more
agitating
*punct* ,
delight
*punct* ,
should
be
hers
*punct* .
*break*
she
soon
resolved
*punct* ,
equally
as
a
duty
and
a
pleasure
*punct* ,
to
employ
half
an
hour
of
this
holiday
of
spirits
in
calling
on
miss
fairfax.
*punct* ,
she
ought
to
go
*punct* ,
and
she
was
longing
to
see
her
*punct* ;
the
resemblance
of
their
present
situations
increasing
every
other
motive
of
goodwill
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
a
secret
satisfaction
*punct* ;
but
the
consciousness
of
a
similarity
of
prospect
would
certainly
add
to
the
interest
with
which
she
should
attend
to
any
thing
jane
might
communicate
*punct* .
*break*
she
went
*punct* ,
she
had
driven
once
unsuccessfully
to
the
door
*punct* ,
but
had
not
been
into
the
house
since
the
morning
after
box
hill
*punct* ,
when
poor
jane
had
been
in
such
distress
as
had
filled
her
with
compassion
*punct* ,
though
all
the
worst
of
her
sufferings
had
been
unsuspected.
*punct* ,
the
fear
of
being
still
unwelcome
*punct* ,
determined
her
*punct* ,
though
assured
of
their
being
at
home
*punct* ,
to
wait
in
the
passage
*punct* ,
and
send
up
her
name.
*punct* ,
she
heard
patty
announcing
it
*punct* ;
but
no
such
bustle
succeeded
as
poor
miss
bates
had
before
made
so
happily
intelligible.
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ;
she
heard
nothing
but
the
instant
reply
of
*punct* ,
beg
her
to
walk
up;
*punct* ,
and
a
moment
afterwards
she
was
met
on
the
stairs
by
jane
herself
*punct* ,
coming
eagerly
forward
*punct* ,
as
if
no
other
reception
of
her
were
felt
sufficient.
*punct* ,
emma
had
never
seen
her
look
so
well
*punct* ,
so
lovely
*punct* ,
so
engaging
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
consciousness
*punct* ,
animation
*punct* ,
and
warmth
*punct* ;
there
was
every
thing
which
her
countenance
or
manner
could
ever
have
wanted.
*punct* ,
she
came
forward
with
an
offered
hand
*punct* ;
and
said
*punct* ,
in
a
low
*punct* ,
but
very
feeling
tone
*punct* ,
this
is
most
kind
*punct* ,
indeed!
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
express
*punct* ,
i
hope
you
will
believe
*punct* ,
excuse
me
for
being
so
entirely
without
words
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
gratified
*punct* ,
and
would
soon
have
shewn
no
want
of
words
*punct* ,
if
the
sound
of
mrs.
elton's
voice
from
the
sitting-room
had
not
checked
her
*punct* ,
and
made
it
expedient
to
compress
all
her
friendly
and
all
her
congratulatory
sensations
into
a
very
*punct* ,
very
earnest
shake
of
the
hand
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
bates
and
mrs.
elton
were
together
*punct* .
*break*
miss
bates
was
out
*punct* ,
which
accounted
for
the
previous
tranquillity
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
have
wished
mrs.
elton
elsewhere
*punct* ;
but
she
was
in
a
humour
to
have
patience
with
every
body
*punct* ;
and
as
mrs.
elton
met
her
with
unusual
graciousness
*punct* ,
she
hoped
the
rencontre
would
do
them
no
harm
*punct* .
*break*
she
soon
believed
herself
to
penetrate
mrs.
elton's
thoughts
*punct* ,
and
understand
why
she
was
*punct* ,
like
herself
*punct* ,
in
happy
spirits
*punct* ;
it
was
being
in
miss
fairfax's
confidence
*punct* ,
and
fancying
herself
acquainted
with
what
was
still
a
secret
to
other
people
*punct* .
*break*
emma
saw
symptoms
of
it
immediately
in
the
expression
of
her
face
*punct* ;
and
while
paying
her
own
compliments
to
mrs.
bates
*punct* ,
and
appearing
to
attend
to
the
good
old
lady's
replies
*punct* ,
she
saw
her
with
a
sort
of
anxious
parade
of
mystery
fold
up
a
letter
which
she
had
apparently
been
reading
aloud
to
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
and
return
it
into
the
purple
and
gold
reticule
by
her
side
*punct* ,
saying
*punct* ,
with
significant
nods
*punct* ,
we
can
finish
this
some
other
time
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
you
and
i
shall
not
want
opportunities
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
you
have
heard
all
the
essential
already
*punct* .
*break*
admits
our
apology
*punct* ,
and
is
not
offended
*punct* .
*break*
you
see
how
delightfully
she
writes
*punct* .
*break*
she
is
a
sweet
creature
*punct* !
*break*
you
would
have
doated
on
her
*punct* ,
had
you
gone.
*punct* ,
but
not
a
word
more
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
be
discreet
*punct* ,
quite
on
our
good
behaviour.
*punct* ,
hush!
*punct* ,
you
remember
those
lines
*punct* ,
i
forget
the
poem
at
this
moment
*punct* :
for
when
a
lady's
in
the
case
*punct* ,
you
know
all
other
things
give
place
*punct* .
*break*
now
i
say
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
in
our
case
*punct* ,
for
lady
*punct* ,
read
*punct* ,
mum
*punct* !
*break*
a
word
to
the
wise.
*punct* ,
i
am
in
a
fine
flow
of
spirits
*punct* ,
an't
i
*punct* ?
*break*
but
i
want
to
set
your
heart
at
ease
as
to
mrs.
s.
*punct* ,
my
representation
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* ,
has
quite
appeased
her
*punct* .
*break*
and
again
*punct* ,
on
emma's
merely
turning
her
head
to
look
at
mrs.
bates's
knitting
*punct* ,
she
added
*punct* ,
in
a
half
whisper
*punct* ,
i
mentioned
no
names
*punct* ,
you
will
observe.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ;
cautious
as
a
minister
of
state
*punct* .
*break*
i
managed
it
extremely
well
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
palpable
display
*punct* ,
repeated
on
every
possible
occasion
*punct* .
*break*
when
they
had
all
talked
a
little
while
in
harmony
of
the
weather
and
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
she
found
herself
abruptly
addressed
with
*punct* ,
do
not
you
think
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
our
saucy
little
friend
here
is
charmingly
recovered?
*punct* ,
do
not
you
think
her
cure
does
perry
the
highest
credit?
*punct* ,
here
was
a
side-glance
of
great
meaning
at
jane.
*punct* ,
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
perry
has
restored
her
in
a
wonderful
short
time!
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
if
you
had
seen
her
*punct* ,
as
i
did
*punct* ,
when
she
was
at
the
worst!
*punct* ,
and
when
mrs.
bates
was
saying
something
to
emma
*punct* ,
whispered
farther
*punct* ,
we
do
not
say
a
word
of
any
assistance
that
perry
might
have
*punct* ;
not
a
word
of
a
certain
young
physician
from
windsor.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ;
perry
shall
have
all
the
credit
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
scarce
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
she
shortly
afterwards
began
*punct* ,
since
the
party
to
box
hill
*punct* .
*break*
very
pleasant
party
*punct* .
*break*
but
yet
i
think
there
was
something
wanting
*punct* .
*break*
things
did
not
seem
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
there
seemed
a
little
cloud
upon
the
spirits
of
some.
*punct* ,
so
it
appeared
to
me
at
least
*punct* ,
but
i
might
be
mistaken
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
i
think
it
answered
so
far
as
to
tempt
one
to
go
again
*punct* .
*break*
what
say
you
both
to
our
collecting
the
same
party
*punct* ,
and
exploring
to
box
hill
again
*punct* ,
while
the
fine
weather
lasts?
*punct* ,
it
must
be
the
same
party
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
quite
the
same
party
*punct* ,
not
one
exception
*punct* .
*break*
soon
after
this
miss
bates
came
in
*punct* ,
and
emma
could
not
help
being
diverted
by
the
perplexity
of
her
first
answer
to
herself
*punct* ,
resulting
*punct* ,
she
supposed
*punct* ,
from
doubt
of
what
might
be
said
*punct* ,
and
impatience
to
say
every
thing
*punct* .
*break*
thank
you
*punct* ,
dear
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
you
are
all
kindness.
*punct* ,
it
is
impossible
to
say
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
i
quite
understand
*punct* ,
dearest
jane's
prospects
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
i
do
not
mean.
*punct* ,
but
she
is
charmingly
recovered.
*punct* ,
how
is
mr.
woodhouse?
*punct* ,
i
am
so
glad.
*punct* ,
quite
out
of
my
power.
*punct* ,
such
a
happy
little
circle
as
you
find
us
here.
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
indeed.
*punct* ,
charming
young
man!
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
so
very
friendly
*punct* ;
i
mean
good
mr.
perry!
*punct* ,
such
attention
to
jane!
*punct* ,
and
from
her
great
*punct* ,
her
more
than
commonly
thankful
delight
towards
mrs.
elton
for
being
there
*punct* ,
emma
guessed
that
there
had
been
a
little
show
of
resentment
towards
jane
*punct* ,
from
the
vicarage
quarter
*punct* ,
which
was
now
graciously
overcome.
*punct* ,
after
a
few
whispers
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
which
placed
it
beyond
a
guess
*punct* ,
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
speaking
louder
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
here
i
am
*punct* ,
my
good
friend
*punct* ;
and
here
i
have
been
so
long
*punct* ,
that
anywhere
else
i
should
think
it
necessary
to
apologise
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
the
truth
is
*punct* ,
that
i
am
waiting
for
my
lord
and
master
*punct* .
*break*
he
promised
to
join
me
here
*punct* ,
and
pay
his
respects
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
are
we
to
have
the
pleasure
of
a
call
from
mr.
elton?
*punct* ,
that
will
be
a
favour
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
for
i
know
gentlemen
do
not
like
morning
visits
*punct* ,
and
mr.
elton's
time
is
so
engaged
*punct* .
*break*
upon
my
word
it
is
*punct* ,
miss
bates.
*punct* ,
he
really
is
engaged
from
morning
to
night.
*punct* ,
there
is
no
end
of
people's
coming
to
him
*punct* ,
on
some
pretence
or
other.
*punct* ,
the
magistrates
*punct* ,
and
overseers
*punct* ,
and
churchwardens
*punct* ,
are
always
wanting
his
opinion
*punct* .
*break*
they
seem
not
able
to
do
any
thing
without
him.
*punct* ,
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
mr.
e.
*punct* ,
i
often
say
*punct* ,
rather
you
than
i.
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
what
would
become
of
my
crayons
and
my
instrument
*punct* ,
if
i
had
half
so
many
applicants.'
*punct* ,
bad
enough
as
it
is
*punct* ,
for
i
absolutely
neglect
them
both
to
an
unpardonable
degree.
*punct* ,
i
believe
i
have
not
played
a
bar
this
fortnight.
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
is
coming
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* :
yes
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
on
purpose
to
wait
on
you
all
*punct* .
*break*
and
putting
up
her
hand
to
screen
her
words
from
emma
*punct* ,
a
congratulatory
visit
*punct* ,
you
know.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
quite
indispensable
*punct* .
*break*
is
knightley's
right
hand
*punct* .
*break*
emma
would
not
have
smiled
for
the
world
*punct* ,
and
only
said
*punct* ,
is
mr.
elton
gone
on
foot
to
donwell?
*punct* ,
he
will
have
a
hot
walk
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
it
is
a
meeting
at
the
crown
*punct* ,
a
regular
meeting
*punct* .
*break*
and
knightley
have
every
thing
their
own
way
*punct* .
*break*
have
not
you
mistaken
the
day
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
almost
certain
that
the
meeting
at
the
crown
is
not
till
to-morrow.
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
was
at
hartfield
yesterday
*punct* ,
and
spoke
of
it
as
for
saturday
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
the
meeting
is
certainly
to-day
*punct* ,
was
the
abrupt
answer
*punct* ,
which
denoted
the
impossibility
of
any
blunder
on
mrs.
elton's
side.
*punct* ,
i
do
believe
*punct* ,
she
continued
*punct* ,
this
is
the
most
troublesome
parish
that
ever
was
*punct* .
*break*
we
never
heard
of
such
things
at
maple
grove
*punct* .
*break*
your
parish
there
was
small
*punct* ,
said
jane
*punct* .
*break*
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
my
dear
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
*punct* ,
for
i
never
heard
the
subject
talked
of
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
proved
by
the
smallness
of
the
school
*punct* ,
which
i
have
heard
you
speak
of
*punct* ,
as
under
the
patronage
of
your
sister
and
mrs.
bragge
*punct* ;
the
only
school
*punct* ,
and
not
more
than
five-and-twenty
children
*punct* .
*break*
you
clever
creature
*punct* ,
that's
very
true
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
thinking
brain
you
have
*punct* !
*break*
i
say
*punct* ,
jane
*punct* ,
what
a
perfect
character
you
and
i
should
make
*punct* ,
if
we
could
be
shaken
together
*punct* .
*break*
my
liveliness
and
your
solidity
would
produce
perfection.
*punct* ,
not
that
i
presume
to
insinuate
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
that
some
people
may
not
think
you
perfection
already.
*punct* ,
but
hush!
*punct* ,
not
a
word
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
an
unnecessary
caution
*punct* ;
jane
was
wanting
to
give
her
words
*punct* ,
not
to
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
but
to
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
as
the
latter
plainly
saw
*punct* .
*break*
the
wish
of
distinguishing
her
*punct* ,
as
far
as
civility
permitted
*punct* ,
was
very
evident
*punct* ,
though
it
could
not
often
proceed
beyond
a
look
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
made
his
appearance
*punct* .
*break*
his
lady
greeted
him
with
some
of
her
sparkling
vivacity
*punct* .
*break*
very
pretty
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
upon
my
word
*punct* ;
to
send
me
on
here
*punct* ,
to
be
an
encumbrance
to
my
friends
*punct* ,
so
long
before
you
vouchsafe
to
come!
*punct* ,
but
you
knew
what
a
dutiful
creature
you
had
to
deal
with
*punct* .
*break*
you
knew
i
should
not
stir
till
my
lord
and
master
appeared.
*punct* ,
here
have
i
been
sitting
this
hour
*punct* ,
giving
these
young
ladies
a
sample
of
true
conjugal
obedience
*punct* ,
for
who
can
say
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
how
soon
it
may
be
wanted
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
elton
was
so
hot
and
tired
*punct* ,
that
all
this
wit
seemed
thrown
away
*punct* .
*break*
his
civilities
to
the
other
ladies
must
be
paid
*punct* ;
but
his
subsequent
object
was
to
lament
over
himself
for
the
heat
he
was
suffering
*punct* ,
and
the
walk
he
had
had
for
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
got
to
donwell
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
knightley
could
not
be
found
*punct* .
*break*
after
the
note
i
sent
him
this
morning
*punct* ,
and
the
message
he
returned
*punct* ,
that
he
should
certainly
be
at
home
till
one
*punct* .
*break*
cried
his
wife.
*punct* ,
my
dear
mr.
e.
*punct* ,
you
have
not
been
to
donwell!
*punct* ,
you
mean
the
crown
*punct* ;
you
come
from
the
meeting
at
the
crown
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
that's
to-morrow
*punct* ;
and
i
particularly
wanted
to
see
knightley
to-day
on
that
very
account.
*punct* ,
such
a
dreadful
broiling
morning!
*punct* ,
i
went
over
the
fields
too
*punct* ,
speaking
in
a
tone
of
great
ill-usage,
*punct* ,
which
made
it
so
much
the
worse
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
not
to
find
him
at
home
*punct* !
*break*
i
assure
you
i
am
not
at
all
pleased
*punct* .
*break*
and
no
apology
left
*punct* ,
no
message
for
me
*punct* .
*break*
the
housekeeper
declared
she
knew
nothing
of
my
being
expected.
*punct* ,
very
extraordinary!
*punct* ,
and
nobody
knew
at
all
which
way
he
was
gone
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
to
hartfield
*punct* ,
perhaps
to
the
abbey
mill
*punct* ,
perhaps
into
his
woods.
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
this
is
not
like
our
friend
knightley!
*punct* ,
can
you
explain
it
*punct* ?
*break*
emma
amused
herself
by
protesting
that
it
was
very
extraordinary
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
and
that
she
had
not
a
syllable
to
say
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
imagine
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
feeling
the
indignity
as
a
wife
ought
to
do,
*punct* ,
i
cannot
imagine
how
he
could
do
such
a
thing
by
you
*punct* ,
of
all
people
in
the
world
*punct* !
*break*
the
very
last
person
whom
one
should
expect
to
be
forgotten!
*punct* ,
my
dear
mr.
e.
*punct* ,
he
must
have
left
a
message
for
you
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
he
must.
*punct* ,
not
even
knightley
could
be
so
very
eccentric;
*punct* ,
and
his
servants
forgot
it
*punct* .
*break*
depend
upon
it
*punct* ,
that
was
the
case
*punct* :
and
very
likely
to
happen
with
the
donwell
servants
*punct* ,
who
are
all
*punct* ,
i
have
often
observed
*punct* ,
extremely
awkward
and
remiss.
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
i
would
not
have
such
a
creature
as
his
harry
stand
at
our
sideboard
for
any
consideration
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
for
mrs.
hodges
*punct* ,
wright
holds
her
very
cheap
indeed.
*punct* ,
she
promised
wright
a
receipt
*punct* ,
and
never
sent
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
met
william
larkins
*punct* ,
continued
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
as
i
got
near
the
house
*punct* ,
and
he
told
me
i
should
not
find
his
master
at
home
*punct* ,
but
i
did
not
believe
him.
*punct* ,
william
seemed
rather
out
of
humour
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
know
what
was
come
to
his
master
lately
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
but
he
could
hardly
ever
get
the
speech
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
william's
wants
*punct* ,
but
it
really
is
of
very
great
importance
that
i
should
see
knightley
to-day
*punct* ;
and
it
becomes
a
matter
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
of
very
serious
inconvenience
that
i
should
have
had
this
hot
walk
to
no
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
emma
felt
that
she
could
not
do
better
than
go
home
directly
*punct* .
*break*
in
all
probability
she
was
at
this
very
time
waited
for
there
*punct* ;
and
mr.
knightley
might
be
preserved
from
sinking
deeper
in
aggression
towards
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
if
not
towards
william
larkins
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
pleased
*punct* ,
on
taking
leave
*punct* ,
to
find
miss
fairfax
determined
to
attend
her
out
of
the
room
*punct* ,
to
go
with
her
even
downstairs
*punct* ;
it
gave
her
an
opportunity
which
she
immediately
made
use
of
*punct* ,
to
say
*punct* ,
it
is
as
well
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
that
i
have
not
had
the
possibility
*punct* .
*break*
had
you
not
been
surrounded
by
other
friends
*punct* ,
i
might
have
been
tempted
to
introduce
a
subject
*punct* ,
to
ask
questions
*punct* ,
to
speak
more
openly
than
might
have
been
strictly
correct.
*punct* ,
i
feel
that
i
should
certainly
have
been
impertinent
*punct* .
*break*
cried
jane
*punct* ,
with
a
blush
and
an
hesitation
which
emma
thought
infinitely
more
becoming
to
her
than
all
the
elegance
of
all
her
usual
composure
*punct* ,
there
would
have
been
no
danger
*punct* .
*break*
the
danger
would
have
been
of
my
wearying
you
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
speaking
more
collectedly,
*punct* ,
with
the
consciousness
which
i
have
of
misconduct
*punct* ,
very
great
misconduct
*punct* ,
it
is
particularly
consoling
to
me
to
know
that
those
of
my
friends
*punct* ,
whose
good
opinion
is
most
worth
preserving
*punct* ,
are
not
disgusted
to
such
a
degree
as
to
*punct* ,
i
have
not
time
for
half
that
i
could
wish
to
say
*punct* .
*break*
i
long
to
make
apologies
*punct* ,
excuses
*punct* ,
to
urge
something
for
myself
*punct* .
*break*
i
feel
it
so
very
due
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
unfortunately
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
if
your
compassion
does
not
stand
my
friend
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
you
are
too
scrupulous
*punct* ,
indeed
you
are
*punct* ,
cried
emma
warmly
*punct* ,
and
taking
her
hand
*punct* .
*break*
you
owe
me
no
apologies
*punct* ;
and
every
body
to
whom
you
might
be
supposed
to
owe
them
*punct* ,
is
so
perfectly
satisfied
*punct* ,
so
delighted
even
*punct* ,
you
are
very
kind
*punct* ,
but
i
know
what
my
manners
were
to
you.
*punct* ,
so
cold
and
artificial!
*punct* ,
i
had
always
a
part
to
act.
*punct* ,
it
was
a
life
of
deceit!
*punct* ,
i
know
that
i
must
have
disgusted
you
*punct* .
*break*
pray
say
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
i
feel
that
all
the
apologies
should
be
on
my
side
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
forgive
each
other
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
do
whatever
is
to
be
done
quickest
*punct* ,
and
i
think
our
feelings
will
lose
no
time
there
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
you
have
pleasant
accounts
from
windsor
*punct* ?
*break*
and
the
next
news
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
will
be
*punct* ,
that
we
are
to
lose
you
*punct* ,
just
as
i
begin
to
know
you
*punct* .
*break*
as
to
all
that
*punct* ,
of
course
nothing
can
be
thought
of
yet
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
here
till
claimed
by
colonel
and
mrs.
campbell
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
can
be
actually
settled
yet
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
replied
emma
*punct* ,
smiling
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
excuse
me
*punct* ,
it
must
be
thought
of
*punct* .
*break*
the
smile
was
returned
as
jane
answered
*punct* ,
you
are
very
right
*punct* ;
it
has
been
thought
of
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
will
own
to
you
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
it
will
be
safe
*punct* ,
that
so
far
as
our
living
with
mr.
churchill
at
enscombe
*punct* ,
it
is
settled
*punct* .
*break*
there
must
be
three
months
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
of
deep
mourning
*punct* ;
but
when
they
are
over
*punct* ,
i
imagine
there
will
be
nothing
more
to
wait
for
*punct* .
*break*
thank
you
*punct* ,
thank
you.
*punct* ,
this
is
just
what
i
wanted
to
be
assured
of.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
if
you
knew
how
much
i
love
every
thing
that
is
decided
and
open!
*punct* ,
good-bye
*punct* ,
good-bye
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston's
friends
were
all
made
happy
by
her
safety
*punct* ;
and
if
the
satisfaction
of
her
well-doing
could
be
increased
to
emma
*punct* ,
it
was
by
knowing
her
to
be
the
mother
of
a
little
girl
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
been
decided
in
wishing
for
a
miss
weston
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
not
acknowledge
that
it
was
with
any
view
of
making
a
match
for
her
*punct* ,
hereafter
*punct* ,
with
either
of
isabella's
sons
*punct* ;
but
she
was
convinced
that
a
daughter
would
suit
both
father
and
mother
best
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
a
great
comfort
to
mr.
weston
*punct* ,
as
he
grew
older
*punct* ,
and
even
mr.
weston
might
be
growing
older
ten
years
hence
*punct* ,
to
have
his
fireside
enlivened
by
the
sports
and
the
nonsense
*punct* ,
the
freaks
and
the
fancies
of
a
child
never
banished
from
home
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
no
one
could
doubt
that
a
daughter
would
be
most
to
her
*punct* ;
and
it
would
be
quite
a
pity
that
any
one
who
so
well
knew
how
to
teach
*punct* ,
should
not
have
their
powers
in
exercise
again
*punct* .
*break*
she
has
had
the
advantage
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
of
practising
on
me
*punct* ,
she
continued
*punct* ,
like
la
baronne
d'almane
on
la
comtesse
d'ostalis
*punct* ,
in
madame
de
genlis
adelaide
and
theodore
*punct* ,
and
we
shall
now
see
her
own
little
adelaide
educated
on
a
more
perfect
plan
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
she
will
indulge
her
even
more
than
she
did
you
*punct* ,
and
believe
that
she
does
not
indulge
her
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
be
the
only
difference
*punct* .
*break*
cried
emma
*punct* ;
at
that
rate
*punct* ,
what
will
become
of
her
*punct* ?
*break*
nothing
very
bad.
*punct* ,
the
fate
of
thousands
*punct* .
*break*
she
will
be
disagreeable
in
infancy
*punct* ,
and
correct
herself
as
she
grows
older
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
losing
all
my
bitterness
against
spoilt
children
*punct* ,
my
dearest
emma
*punct* .
*break*
i
*punct* ,
who
am
owing
all
my
happiness
to
you
*punct* ,
would
not
it
be
horrible
ingratitude
in
me
to
be
severe
on
them
*punct* ?
*break*
emma
laughed
*punct* ,
and
replied
*punct* :
but
i
had
the
assistance
of
all
your
endeavours
to
counteract
the
indulgence
of
other
people
*punct* .
*break*
i
doubt
whether
my
own
sense
would
have
corrected
me
without
it
*punct* .
*break*
do
you?
*punct* ,
i
have
no
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
nature
gave
you
understanding:
*punct* ,
miss
taylor
gave
you
principles
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
have
done
well
*punct* .
*break*
my
interference
was
quite
as
likely
to
do
harm
as
good
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
very
natural
for
you
to
say
*punct* ,
what
right
has
he
to
lecture
me?
*punct* ,
and
i
am
afraid
very
natural
for
you
to
feel
that
it
was
done
in
a
disagreeable
manner
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
believe
i
did
you
any
good
*punct* .
*break*
the
good
was
all
to
myself
*punct* ,
by
making
you
an
object
of
the
tenderest
affection
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
think
about
you
so
much
without
doating
on
you
*punct* ,
faults
and
all
*punct* ;
and
by
dint
of
fancying
so
many
errors
*punct* ,
have
been
in
love
with
you
ever
since
you
were
thirteen
at
least
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
you
were
of
use
to
me
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
very
often
influenced
rightly
by
you
*punct* ,
oftener
than
i
would
own
at
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
very
sure
you
did
me
good
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
poor
little
anna
weston
is
to
be
spoiled
*punct* ,
it
will
be
the
greatest
humanity
in
you
to
do
as
much
for
her
as
you
have
done
for
me
*punct* ,
except
falling
in
love
with
her
when
she
is
thirteen
*punct* .
*break*
how
often
*punct* ,
when
you
were
a
girl
*punct* ,
have
you
said
to
me
*punct* ,
with
one
of
your
saucy
looks
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
i
am
going
to
do
so-and-so
*punct* ;
papa
says
i
may
*punct* ,
or
i
have
miss
taylor's
leave'
*punct* ,
something
which
*punct* ,
you
knew
*punct* ,
i
did
not
approve
*punct* .
*break*
in
such
cases
my
interference
was
giving
you
two
bad
feelings
instead
of
one
*punct* .
*break*
what
an
amiable
creature
i
was!
*punct* ,
no
wonder
you
should
hold
my
speeches
in
such
affectionate
remembrance
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley.'
*punct* ,
you
always
called
me
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
from
habit
*punct* ,
it
has
not
so
very
formal
a
sound.
*punct* ,
and
yet
it
is
formal
*punct* .
*break*
i
want
you
to
call
me
something
else
*punct* ,
but
i
do
not
know
what
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
once
calling
you
george
*punct* ,
in
one
of
my
amiable
fits
*punct* ,
about
ten
years
ago
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
it
because
i
thought
it
would
offend
you
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
you
made
no
objection
*punct* ,
i
never
did
it
again
*punct* .
*break*
and
cannot
you
call
me
george
now
*punct* ?
*break*
impossible!
*punct* ,
i
never
can
call
you
any
thing
but
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
not
promise
even
to
equal
the
elegant
terseness
of
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
by
calling
you
mr.
k.
*punct* ,
but
i
will
promise
*punct* ,
she
added
presently
*punct* ,
laughing
and
blushing
*punct* ,
i
will
promise
to
call
you
once
by
your
christian
name
*punct* .
*break*
takes
m.
for
better
*punct* ,
for
worse
*punct* .
*break*
emma
grieved
that
she
could
not
be
more
openly
just
to
one
important
service
which
his
better
sense
would
have
rendered
her
*punct* ,
to
the
advice
which
would
have
saved
her
from
the
worst
of
all
her
womanly
follies
*punct* ,
her
wilful
intimacy
with
harriet
smith
*punct* ;
but
it
was
too
tender
a
subject.
*punct* ,
she
could
not
enter
on
it.
*punct* ,
harriet
was
very
seldom
mentioned
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
this
*punct* ,
on
his
side
*punct* ,
might
merely
proceed
from
her
not
being
thought
of
*punct* ;
but
emma
was
rather
inclined
to
attribute
it
to
delicacy
*punct* ,
and
a
suspicion
*punct* ,
from
some
appearances
*punct* ,
that
their
friendship
were
declining
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
aware
herself
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
parting
under
any
other
circumstances
*punct* ,
they
certainly
should
have
corresponded
more
*punct* ,
and
that
her
intelligence
would
not
have
rested
*punct* ,
as
it
now
almost
wholly
did
*punct* ,
on
isabella's
letters
*punct* .
*break*
he
might
observe
that
it
was
so
*punct* .
*break*
the
pain
of
being
obliged
to
practise
concealment
towards
him
*punct* ,
was
very
little
inferior
to
the
pain
of
having
made
harriet
unhappy
*punct* .
*break*
isabella
sent
quite
as
good
an
account
of
her
visitor
as
could
be
expected
*punct* ;
on
her
first
arrival
she
had
thought
her
out
of
spirits
*punct* ,
which
appeared
perfectly
natural
*punct* ,
as
there
was
a
dentist
to
be
consulted
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
since
that
business
had
been
over
*punct* ,
she
did
not
appear
to
find
harriet
different
from
what
she
had
known
her
before.
*punct* ,
isabella
*punct* ,
to
be
sure
*punct* ,
was
no
very
quick
observer
*punct* ;
yet
if
harriet
had
not
been
equal
to
playing
with
the
children
*punct* ,
it
would
not
have
escaped
her
*punct* .
*break*
emma's
comforts
and
hopes
were
most
agreeably
carried
on
*punct* ,
by
harriet's
being
to
stay
longer
*punct* ;
her
fortnight
was
likely
to
be
a
month
at
least
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
and
mrs.
john
knightley
were
to
come
down
in
august
*punct* ,
and
she
was
invited
to
remain
till
they
could
bring
her
back
*punct* .
*break*
john
does
not
even
mention
your
friend
*punct* ,
said
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
here
is
his
answer
*punct* ,
if
you
like
to
see
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
answer
to
the
communication
of
his
intended
marriage
*punct* .
*break*
emma
accepted
it
with
a
very
eager
hand
*punct* ,
with
an
impatience
all
alive
to
know
what
he
would
say
about
it
*punct* ,
and
not
at
all
checked
by
hearing
that
her
friend
was
unmentioned
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
am
not
afraid
of
your
seeing
what
he
writes
*punct* .
*break*
he
writes
like
a
sensible
man
*punct* ,
replied
emma
*punct* ,
when
she
had
read
the
letter
*punct* .
*break*
i
honour
his
sincerity
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
very
plain
that
he
considers
the
good
fortune
of
the
engagement
as
all
on
my
side
*punct* ,
but
that
he
is
not
without
hope
of
my
growing
*punct* ,
in
time
*punct* ,
as
worthy
of
your
affection
*punct* ,
as
you
think
me
already
*punct* .
*break*
had
he
said
any
thing
to
bear
a
different
construction
*punct* ,
i
should
not
have
believed
him
*punct* .
*break*
my
emma
*punct* ,
he
means
no
such
thing
*punct* .
*break*
he
only
means
*punct* ,
he
and
i
should
differ
very
little
in
our
estimation
of
the
two
*punct* ,
interrupted
she
*punct* ,
with
a
sort
of
serious
smile
*punct* ,
much
less
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
than
he
is
aware
of
*punct* ,
if
we
could
enter
without
ceremony
or
reserve
on
the
subject
*punct* .
*break*
emma
*punct* ,
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
she
cried
with
more
thorough
gaiety
*punct* ,
if
you
fancy
your
brother
does
not
do
me
justice
*punct* ,
only
wait
till
my
dear
father
is
in
the
secret
*punct* ,
and
hear
his
opinion
*punct* .
*break*
depend
upon
it
*punct* ,
he
will
be
much
farther
from
doing
you
justice
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
think
all
the
happiness
*punct* ,
all
the
advantage
*punct* ,
on
your
side
of
the
question
*punct* ;
all
the
merit
on
mine
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
i
may
not
sink
into
poor
emma
with
him
at
once.
*punct* ,
his
tender
compassion
towards
oppressed
worth
can
go
no
farther
*punct* .
*break*
he
cried
*punct* ,
i
wish
your
father
might
be
half
as
easily
convinced
as
john
will
be
*punct* ,
of
our
having
every
right
that
equal
worth
can
give
*punct* ,
to
be
happy
together
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
amused
by
one
part
of
john's
letter
*punct* ,
did
you
notice
it?
*punct* ,
where
he
says
*punct* ,
that
my
information
did
not
take
him
wholly
by
surprize
*punct* ,
that
he
was
rather
in
expectation
of
hearing
something
of
the
kind
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
understand
your
brother
*punct* ,
he
only
means
so
far
as
your
having
some
thoughts
of
marrying
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
no
idea
of
me
*punct* .
*break*
he
seems
perfectly
unprepared
for
that
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
but
i
am
amused
that
he
should
have
seen
so
far
into
my
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
what
has
he
been
judging
by?
*punct* ,
i
am
not
conscious
of
any
difference
in
my
spirits
or
conversation
that
could
prepare
him
at
this
time
for
my
marrying
any
more
than
at
another.
*punct* ,
but
it
was
so
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
there
was
a
difference
when
i
was
staying
with
them
the
other
day
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
i
did
not
play
with
the
children
quite
so
much
as
usual
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
one
evening
the
poor
boys
saying
*punct* ,
uncle
seems
always
tired
now
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
was
coming
when
the
news
must
spread
farther
*punct* ,
and
other
persons
reception
of
it
tried
*punct* .
*break*
as
soon
as
mrs.
weston
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
admit
mr.
woodhouse's
visits
*punct* ,
emma
having
it
in
view
that
her
gentle
reasonings
should
be
employed
in
the
cause
*punct* ,
resolved
first
to
announce
it
at
home
*punct* ,
and
then
at
randalls.
*punct* ,
but
how
to
break
it
to
her
father
at
last!
*punct* ,
she
had
bound
herself
to
do
it
*punct* ,
in
such
an
hour
of
mr.
knightley's
absence
*punct* ,
or
when
it
came
to
the
point
her
heart
would
have
failed
her
*punct* ,
and
she
must
have
put
it
off
*punct* ;
but
mr.
knightley
was
to
come
at
such
a
time
*punct* ,
and
follow
up
the
beginning
she
was
to
make.
*punct* ,
she
was
forced
to
speak
*punct* ,
and
to
speak
cheerfully
too
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
not
make
it
a
more
decided
subject
of
misery
to
him
*punct* ,
by
a
melancholy
tone
herself
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
not
appear
to
think
it
a
misfortune.
*punct* ,
with
all
the
spirits
she
could
command
*punct* ,
she
prepared
him
first
for
something
strange
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
in
a
few
words
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
that
if
his
consent
and
approbation
could
be
obtained
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
she
trusted
*punct* ,
would
be
attended
with
no
difficulty
*punct* ,
since
it
was
a
plan
to
promote
the
happiness
of
all
*punct* ,
she
and
mr.
knightley
meant
to
marry
*punct* ;
by
which
means
hartfield
would
receive
the
constant
addition
of
that
person's
company
whom
she
knew
he
loved
*punct* ,
next
to
his
daughters
and
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
best
in
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
poor
man!
*punct* ,
it
was
at
first
a
considerable
shock
to
him
*punct* ,
and
he
tried
earnestly
to
dissuade
her
from
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
reminded
*punct* ,
more
than
once
*punct* ,
of
having
always
said
she
would
never
marry
*punct* ,
and
assured
that
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
for
her
to
remain
single
*punct* ;
and
told
of
poor
isabella
*punct* ,
and
poor
miss
taylor.
*punct* ,
but
it
would
not
do
*punct* .
*break*
emma
hung
about
him
affectionately
*punct* ,
and
smiled
*punct* ,
and
said
it
must
be
so
*punct* ;
and
that
he
must
not
class
her
with
isabella
and
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
whose
marriages
taking
them
from
hartfield
*punct* ,
had
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
made
a
melancholy
change
*punct* :
but
she
was
not
going
from
hartfield
*punct* ;
she
should
be
always
there
*punct* ;
she
was
introducing
no
change
in
their
numbers
or
their
comforts
but
for
the
better
*punct* ;
and
she
was
very
sure
that
he
would
be
a
great
deal
the
happier
for
having
mr.
knightley
always
at
hand
*punct* ,
when
he
were
once
got
used
to
the
idea.
*punct* ,
did
he
not
love
mr.
knightley
very
much?
*punct* ,
he
would
not
deny
that
he
did
*punct* ,
she
was
sure.
*punct* ,
whom
did
he
ever
want
to
consult
on
business
but
mr.
knightley?
*punct* ,
who
was
so
useful
to
him
*punct* ,
who
so
ready
to
write
his
letters
*punct* ,
who
so
glad
to
assist
him?
*punct* ,
who
so
cheerful
*punct* ,
so
attentive
*punct* ,
so
attached
to
him?
*punct* ,
would
not
he
like
to
have
him
always
on
the
spot?
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
all
very
true
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
knightley
could
not
be
there
too
often
*punct* ;
he
should
be
glad
to
see
him
every
day;
*punct* ,
but
they
did
see
him
every
day
as
it
was.
*punct* ,
why
could
not
they
go
on
as
they
had
done
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
woodhouse
could
not
be
soon
reconciled
*punct* ;
but
the
worst
was
overcome
*punct* ,
the
idea
was
given
*punct* ;
time
and
continual
repetition
must
do
the
rest.
*punct* ,
to
emma's
entreaties
and
assurances
succeeded
mr.
knightley's
*punct* ,
whose
fond
praise
of
her
gave
the
subject
even
a
kind
of
welcome
*punct* ;
and
he
was
soon
used
to
be
talked
to
by
each
*punct* ,
on
every
fair
occasion.
*punct* ,
they
had
all
the
assistance
which
isabella
could
give
*punct* ,
by
letters
of
the
strongest
approbation
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
weston
was
ready
*punct* ,
on
the
first
meeting
*punct* ,
to
consider
the
subject
in
the
most
serviceable
light
*punct* ,
first
*punct* ,
as
a
settled
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
secondly
*punct* ,
as
a
good
one
*punct* ,
well
aware
of
the
nearly
equal
importance
of
the
two
recommendations
to
mr.
woodhouse's
mind.
*punct* ,
it
was
agreed
upon
*punct* ,
as
what
was
to
be
*punct* ;
and
every
body
by
whom
he
was
used
to
be
guided
assuring
him
that
it
would
be
for
his
happiness
*punct* ;
and
having
some
feelings
himself
which
almost
admitted
it
*punct* ,
he
began
to
think
that
some
time
or
other
*punct* ,
in
another
year
or
two
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
it
might
not
be
so
very
bad
if
the
marriage
did
take
place
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
was
acting
no
part
*punct* ,
feigning
no
feelings
in
all
that
she
said
to
him
in
favour
of
the
event.
*punct* ,
she
had
been
extremely
surprized
*punct* ,
never
more
so
*punct* ,
than
when
emma
first
opened
the
affair
to
her
*punct* ;
but
she
saw
in
it
only
increase
of
happiness
to
all
*punct* ,
and
had
no
scruple
in
urging
him
to
the
utmost.
*punct* ,
she
had
such
a
regard
for
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
as
to
think
he
deserved
even
her
dearest
emma
*punct* ;
and
it
was
in
every
respect
so
proper
*punct* ,
suitable
*punct* ,
and
unexceptionable
a
connexion
*punct* ,
and
in
one
respect
*punct* ,
one
point
of
the
highest
importance
*punct* ,
so
peculiarly
eligible
*punct* ,
so
singularly
fortunate
*punct* ,
that
now
it
seemed
as
if
emma
could
not
safely
have
attached
herself
to
any
other
creature
*punct* ,
and
that
she
had
herself
been
the
stupidest
of
beings
in
not
having
thought
of
it
*punct* ,
and
wished
it
long
ago.
*punct* ,
how
very
few
of
those
men
in
a
rank
of
life
to
address
emma
would
have
renounced
their
own
home
for
hartfield
*punct* !
*break*
and
who
but
mr.
knightley
could
know
and
bear
with
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
so
as
to
make
such
an
arrangement
desirable!
*punct* ,
the
difficulty
of
disposing
of
poor
mr.
woodhouse
had
been
always
felt
in
her
husband's
plans
and
her
own
*punct* ,
for
a
marriage
between
frank
and

*punct* .
*break*
how
to
settle
the
claims
of
enscombe
and
hartfield
had
been
a
continual
impediment
*punct* ,
less
acknowledged
by
mr.
weston
than
by
herself
*punct* ,
but
even
he
had
never
been
able
to
finish
the
subject
better
than
by
saying
*punct* ,
those
matters
will
take
care
of
themselves
*punct* ;
the
young
people
will
find
a
way
*punct* .
*break*
but
here
there
was
nothing
to
be
shifted
off
in
a
wild
speculation
on
the
future
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
all
right
*punct* ,
all
open
*punct* ,
all
equal
*punct* .
*break*
no
sacrifice
on
any
side
worth
the
name
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
union
of
the
highest
promise
of
felicity
in
itself
*punct* ,
and
without
one
real
*punct* ,
rational
difficulty
to
oppose
or
delay
it
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
weston
*punct* ,
with
her
baby
on
her
knee
*punct* ,
indulging
in
such
reflections
as
these
*punct* ,
was
one
of
the
happiest
women
in
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
if
any
thing
could
increase
her
delight
*punct* ,
it
was
perceiving
that
the
baby
would
soon
have
outgrown
its
first
set
of
caps
*punct* .
*break*
the
news
was
universally
a
surprize
wherever
it
spread
*punct* ;
and
mr.
weston
had
his
five
minutes
share
of
it
*punct* ;
but
five
minutes
were
enough
to
familiarise
the
idea
to
his
quickness
of
mind.
*punct* ,
he
saw
the
advantages
of
the
match
*punct* ,
and
rejoiced
in
them
with
all
the
constancy
of
his
wife
*punct* ;
but
the
wonder
of
it
was
very
soon
nothing
*punct* ;
and
by
the
end
of
an
hour
he
was
not
far
from
believing
that
he
had
always
foreseen
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
to
be
a
secret
*punct* ,
i
conclude
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* .
*break*
these
matters
are
always
a
secret
*punct* ,
till
it
is
found
out
that
every
body
knows
them
*punct* .
*break*
only
let
me
be
told
when
i
may
speak
out.
*punct* ,
i
wonder
whether
jane
has
any
suspicion
*punct* .
*break*
he
went
to
highbury
the
next
morning
*punct* ,
and
satisfied
himself
on
that
point
*punct* .
*break*
he
told
her
the
news
*punct* .
*break*
was
not
she
like
a
daughter
*punct* ,
his
eldest
daughter?
*punct* ,
he
must
tell
her
*punct* ;
and
miss
bates
being
present
*punct* ,
it
passed
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
to
mrs.
cole
*punct* ,
mrs.
perry
*punct* ,
and
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
immediately
afterwards
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
no
more
than
the
principals
were
prepared
for
*punct* ;
they
had
calculated
from
the
time
of
its
being
known
at
randalls
*punct* ,
how
soon
it
would
be
over
highbury
*punct* ;
and
were
thinking
of
themselves
*punct* ,
as
the
evening
wonder
in
many
a
family
circle
*punct* ,
with
great
sagacity
*punct* .
*break*
in
general
*punct* ,
it
was
a
very
well
approved
match
*punct* .
*break*
some
might
think
him
*punct* ,
and
others
might
think
her
*punct* ,
the
most
in
luck
*punct* .
*break*
one
set
might
recommend
their
all
removing
to
donwell
*punct* ,
and
leaving
hartfield
for
the
john
knightleys
*punct* ;
and
another
might
predict
disagreements
among
their
servants
*punct* ;
but
yet
*punct* ,
upon
the
whole
*punct* ,
there
was
no
serious
objection
raised
*punct* ,
except
in
one
habitation
*punct* ,
the
vicarage.
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ,
the
surprize
was
not
softened
by
any
satisfaction
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
elton
cared
little
about
it
*punct* ,
compared
with
his
wife
*punct* ;
he
only
hoped
the
young
lady's
pride
would
now
be
contented
*punct* ;
and
supposed
she
had
always
meant
to
catch
knightley
if
she
could
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
on
the
point
of
living
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
could
daringly
exclaim
*punct* ,
rather
he
than
i!
*punct* ,
but
mrs.
elton
was
very
much
discomposed
indeed.
*punct* ,
poor
knightley
*punct* !
*break*
poor
fellow!
*punct* ,
sad
business
for
him.
*punct* ,
she
was
extremely
concerned
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
though
very
eccentric
*punct* ,
he
had
a
thousand
good
qualities.
*punct* ,
how
could
he
be
so
taken
in?
*punct* ,
did
not
think
him
at
all
in
love
*punct* ,
not
in
the
least.
*punct* ,
poor
knightley!
*punct* ,
there
would
be
an
end
of
all
pleasant
intercourse
with
him.
*punct* ,
how
happy
he
had
been
to
come
and
dine
with
them
whenever
they
asked
him
*punct* !
*break*
but
that
would
be
all
over
now.
*punct* ,
poor
fellow!
*punct* ,
no
more
exploring
parties
to
donwell
made
for
her
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ;
there
would
be
a
mrs.
knightley
to
throw
cold
water
on
every
thing.
*punct* ,
extremely
disagreeable
*punct* !
*break*
but
she
was
not
at
all
sorry
that
she
had
abused
the
housekeeper
the
other
day.
*punct* ,
shocking
plan
*punct* ,
living
together
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
never
do
*punct* .
*break*
she
knew
a
family
near
maple
grove
who
had
tried
it
*punct* ,
and
been
obliged
to
separate
before
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
*punct* .
*break*
time
passed
on
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
more
to-morrows
*punct* ,
and
the
party
from
london
would
be
arriving
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
an
alarming
change
*punct* ;
and
emma
was
thinking
of
it
one
morning
*punct* ,
as
what
must
bring
a
great
deal
to
agitate
and
grieve
her
*punct* ,
when
mr.
knightley
came
in
*punct* ,
and
distressing
thoughts
were
put
by
*punct* .
*break*
after
the
first
chat
of
pleasure
he
was
silent
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
in
a
graver
tone
*punct* ,
began
with
*punct* ,
i
have
something
to
tell
you
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ;
some
news
*punct* .
*break*
good
or
bad
*punct* ?
*break*
said
she
*punct* ,
quickly
*punct* ,
looking
up
in
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
which
it
ought
to
be
called
*punct* .
*break*
good
i
am
sure.
*punct* ,
i
see
it
in
your
countenance
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
trying
not
to
smile
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
afraid
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
composing
his
features
*punct* ,
i
am
very
much
afraid
*punct* ,
my
dear
emma
*punct* ,
that
you
will
not
smile
when
you
hear
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
why
so?
*punct* ,
i
can
hardly
imagine
that
any
thing
which
pleases
or
amuses
you
*punct* ,
should
not
please
and
amuse
me
too
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
one
subject
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
i
hope
but
one
*punct* ,
on
which
we
do
not
think
alike
*punct* .
*break*
he
paused
a
moment
*punct* ,
again
smiling
*punct* ,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
her
face
*punct* .
*break*
does
nothing
occur
to
you?
*punct* ,
do
not
you
recollect?
*punct* ,
harriet
smith
*punct* .
*break*
her
cheeks
flushed
at
the
name
*punct* ,
and
she
felt
afraid
of
something
*punct* ,
though
she
knew
not
what
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
heard
from
her
yourself
this
morning
*punct* ?
*break*
you
have
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
and
know
the
whole
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
have
not
*punct* ;
i
know
nothing
*punct* ;
pray
tell
me
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
prepared
for
the
worst
*punct* ,
i
see
*punct* ,
and
very
bad
it
is
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
smith
marries
robert
martin
*punct* .
*break*
emma
gave
a
start
*punct* ,
which
did
not
seem
like
being
prepared
*punct* ,
and
her
eyes
*punct* ,
in
eager
gaze
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
this
is
impossible
*punct* !
*break*
but
her
lips
were
closed
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
so
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
continued
mr.
knightley
*punct* ;
i
have
it
from
robert
martin
himself
*punct* .
*break*
he
left
me
not
half
an
hour
ago
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
still
looking
at
him
with
the
most
speaking
amazement
*punct* .
*break*
you
like
it
*punct* ,
my
emma
*punct* ,
as
little
as
i
feared.
*punct* ,
i
wish
our
opinions
were
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
time
they
will
*punct* .
*break*
time
*punct* ,
you
may
be
sure
*punct* ,
will
make
one
or
the
other
of
us
think
differently
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
in
the
meanwhile
*punct* ,
we
need
not
talk
much
on
the
subject
*punct* .
*break*
you
mistake
me
*punct* ,
you
quite
mistake
me
*punct* ,
she
replied
*punct* ,
exerting
herself
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
that
such
a
circumstance
would
now
make
me
unhappy
*punct* ,
but
i
cannot
believe
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
seems
an
impossibility!
*punct* ,
you
cannot
mean
to
say
*punct* ,
that
harriet
smith
has
accepted
robert
martin
*punct* .
*break*
you
cannot
mean
that
he
has
even
proposed
to
her
again
*punct* ,
yet
*punct* .
*break*
you
only
mean
*punct* ,
that
he
intends
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
mean
that
he
has
done
it
*punct* ,
answered
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
with
smiling
but
determined
decision
*punct* ,
and
been
accepted
*punct* .
*break*
she
cried.
*punct* ,
well!
*punct* ,
then
having
recourse
to
her
workbasket
*punct* ,
in
excuse
for
leaning
down
her
face
*punct* ,
and
concealing
all
the
exquisite
feelings
of
delight
and
entertainment
which
she
knew
she
must
be
expressing
*punct* ,
she
added
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
now
tell
me
every
thing
*punct* ;
make
this
intelligible
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
how
*punct* ,
where
*punct* ,
when?
*punct* ,
let
me
know
it
all
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
was
more
surprized
*punct* ,
but
it
does
not
make
me
unhappy
*punct* ,
i
assure
you.
*punct* ,
how
*punct* ,
how
has
it
been
possible
*punct* ?
*break*
it
is
a
very
simple
story
*punct* .
*break*
he
went
to
town
on
business
three
days
ago
*punct* ,
and
i
got
him
to
take
charge
of
some
papers
which
i
was
wanting
to
send
to
john.
*punct* ,
he
delivered
these
papers
to
john
*punct* ,
at
his
chambers
*punct* ,
and
was
asked
by
him
to
join
their
party
the
same
evening
to
astley's
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
going
to
take
the
two
eldest
boys
to
astley's
*punct* .
*break*
the
party
was
to
be
our
brother
and
sister
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ,
john
*punct* ,
and
miss
smith
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend
robert
could
not
resist
*punct* .
*break*
they
called
for
him
in
their
way
*punct* ;
were
all
extremely
amused
*punct* ;
and
my
brother
asked
him
to
dine
with
them
the
next
day
*punct* ,
which
he
did
*punct* ,
and
in
the
course
of
that
visit
*punct* ,
as
i
understand
*punct* ,
he
found
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
harriet
*punct* ;
and
certainly
did
not
speak
in
vain.
*punct* ,
she
made
him
*punct* ,
by
her
acceptance
*punct* ,
as
happy
even
as
he
is
deserving
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
down
by
yesterday's
coach
*punct* ,
and
was
with
me
this
morning
immediately
after
breakfast
*punct* ,
to
report
his
proceedings
*punct* ,
first
on
my
affairs
*punct* ,
and
then
on
his
own
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
all
that
i
can
relate
of
the
how
*punct* ,
where
*punct* ,
and
when
*punct* .
*break*
your
friend
harriet
will
make
a
much
longer
history
when
you
see
her.
*punct* ,
she
will
give
you
all
the
minute
particulars
*punct* ,
which
only
woman's
language
can
make
interesting.
*punct* ,
in
our
communications
we
deal
only
in
the
great.
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
i
must
say
*punct* ,
that
robert
martin's
heart
seemed
for
him
*punct* ,
and
to
me
*punct* ,
very
overflowing
*punct* ;
and
that
he
did
mention
*punct* ,
without
its
being
much
to
the
purpose
*punct* ,
that
on
quitting
their
box
at
astley's
*punct* ,
my
brother
took
charge
of
mrs.
john
knightley
and
little
john
*punct* ,
and
he
followed
with
miss
smith
and
henry
*punct* ;
and
that
at
one
time
they
were
in
such
a
crowd
*punct* ,
as
to
make
miss
smith
rather
uneasy
*punct* .
*break*
he
stopped.
*punct* ,
emma
dared
not
attempt
any
immediate
reply
*punct* .
*break*
to
speak
*punct* ,
she
was
sure
would
be
to
betray
a
most
unreasonable
degree
of
happiness
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
wait
a
moment
*punct* ,
or
he
would
think
her
mad
*punct* .
*break*
her
silence
disturbed
him
*punct* ;
and
after
observing
her
a
little
while
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* ,
emma
*punct* ,
my
love
*punct* ,
you
said
that
this
circumstance
would
not
now
make
you
unhappy
*punct* ;
but
i
am
afraid
it
gives
you
more
pain
than
you
expected
*punct* .
*break*
his
situation
is
an
evil
*punct* ,
but
you
must
consider
it
as
what
satisfies
your
friend
*punct* ;
and
i
will
answer
for
your
thinking
better
and
better
of
him
as
you
know
him
more
*punct* .
*break*
his
good
sense
and
good
principles
would
delight
you.
*punct* ,
as
far
as
the
man
is
concerned
*punct* ,
you
could
not
wish
your
friend
in
better
hands
*punct* .
*break*
his
rank
in
society
i
would
alter
if
i
could
*punct* ,
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
i
assure
you
*punct* ,
emma.
*punct* ,
you
laugh
at
me
about
william
larkins
*punct* ;
but
i
could
quite
as
ill
spare
robert
martin
*punct* .
*break*
he
wanted
her
to
look
up
and
smile
*punct* ;
and
having
now
brought
herself
not
to
smile
too
broadly
*punct* ,
she
did
*punct* ,
cheerfully
answering
*punct* ,
you
need
not
be
at
any
pains
to
reconcile
me
to
the
match
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
harriet
is
doing
extremely
well
*punct* .
*break*
her
connexions
may
be
worse
than
his
*punct* .
*break*
in
respectability
of
character
*punct* ,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
are
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
been
silent
from
surprize
merely
*punct* ,
excessive
surprize
*punct* .
*break*
you
cannot
imagine
how
suddenly
it
has
come
on
me
*punct* !
*break*
how
peculiarly
unprepared
i
was!
*punct* ,
for
i
had
reason
to
believe
her
very
lately
more
determined
against
him
*punct* ,
much
more
*punct* ,
than
she
was
before
*punct* .
*break*
you
ought
to
know
your
friend
best
*punct* ,
replied
mr.
knightley
*punct* ;
but
i
should
say
she
was
a
good-tempered
*punct* ,
soft-hearted
girl
*punct* ,
not
likely
to
be
very
*punct* ,
very
determined
against
any
young
man
who
told
her
he
loved
her
*punct* .
*break*
emma
could
not
help
laughing
as
she
answered
*punct* ,
upon
my
word
*punct* ,
i
believe
you
know
her
quite
as
well
as
i
do.
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
are
you
perfectly
sure
that
she
has
absolutely
and
downright
accepted
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
suppose
she
might
in
time
*punct* ,
but
can
she
already?
*punct* ,
did
not
you
misunderstand
him?
*punct* ,
you
were
both
talking
of
other
things
*punct* ;
of
business
*punct* ,
shows
of
cattle
*punct* ,
or
new
drills
*punct* ,
and
might
not
you
*punct* ,
in
the
confusion
of
so
many
subjects
*punct* ,
mistake
him?
*punct* ,
it
was
not
harriet's
hand
that
he
was
certain
of
*punct* ,
it
was
the
dimensions
of
some
famous
ox
*punct* .
*break*
the
contrast
between
the
countenance
and
air
of
mr.
knightley
and
robert
martin
was
*punct* ,
at
this
moment
*punct* ,
so
strong
to
emma's
feelings
*punct* ,
and
so
strong
was
the
recollection
of
all
that
had
so
recently
passed
on
harriet's
side
*punct* ,
so
fresh
the
sound
of
those
words
*punct* ,
spoken
with
such
emphasis
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
i
hope
i
know
better
than
to
think
of
robert
martin
*punct* ,
that
she
was
really
expecting
the
intelligence
to
prove
*punct* ,
in
some
measure
*punct* ,
premature
*punct* .
*break*
it
could
not
be
otherwise
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
dare
say
this
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
mr.
knightley
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
dare
to
suppose
me
so
great
a
blockhead
*punct* ,
as
not
to
know
what
a
man
is
talking
of?
*punct* ,
what
do
you
deserve
*punct* ?
*break*
i
always
deserve
the
best
treatment
*punct* ,
because
i
never
put
up
with
any
other
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
you
must
give
me
a
plain
*punct* ,
direct
answer
*punct* .
*break*
are
you
quite
sure
that
you
understand
the
terms
on
which
mr.
martin
and
harriet
now
are
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
quite
sure
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
speaking
very
distinctly
*punct* ,
that
he
told
me
she
had
accepted
him
*punct* ;
and
that
there
was
no
obscurity
*punct* ,
nothing
doubtful
*punct* ,
in
the
words
he
used
*punct* ;
and
i
think
i
can
give
you
a
proof
that
it
must
be
so
*punct* .
*break*
he
asked
my
opinion
as
to
what
he
was
now
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
he
knew
of
no
one
but
mrs.
goddard
to
whom
he
could
apply
for
information
of
her
relations
or
friends
*punct* .
*break*
could
i
mention
any
thing
more
fit
to
be
done
*punct* ,
than
to
go
to
mrs.
goddard
*punct* ?
*break*
i
assured
him
that
i
could
not
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
he
would
endeavour
to
see
her
in
the
course
of
this
day
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
*punct* ,
replied
emma
*punct* ,
with
the
brightest
smiles
*punct* ,
and
most
sincerely
wish
them
happy
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
materially
changed
since
we
talked
on
this
subject
before
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
so
*punct* ,
for
at
that
time
i
was
a
fool
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
am
changed
also
*punct* ;
for
i
am
now
very
willing
to
grant
you
all
harriet's
good
qualities
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
taken
some
pains
for
your
sake
*punct* ,
and
for
robert
martin's
sake
*punct* ,
whom
i
have
always
had
reason
to
believe
as
much
in
love
with
her
as
ever,
*punct* ,
to
get
acquainted
with
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
often
talked
to
her
a
good
deal
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
have
seen
that
i
did
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
i
have
thought
you
were
half
suspecting
me
of
pleading
poor
martin's
cause
*punct* ,
which
was
never
the
case
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
from
all
my
observations
*punct* ,
i
am
convinced
of
her
being
an
artless
*punct* ,
amiable
girl
*punct* ,
with
very
good
notions
*punct* ,
very
seriously
good
principles
*punct* ,
and
placing
her
happiness
in
the
affections
and
utility
of
domestic
life.
*punct* ,
much
of
this
*punct* ,
i
have
no
doubt
*punct* ,
she
may
thank
you
for
*punct* .
*break*
cried
emma
*punct* ,
shaking
her
head.
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* !
*break*
she
checked
herself
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
and
submitted
quietly
to
a
little
more
praise
than
she
deserved
*punct* .
*break*
their
conversation
was
soon
afterwards
closed
by
the
entrance
of
her
father
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
not
sorry
*punct* .
*break*
she
wanted
to
be
alone
*punct* .
*break*
her
mind
was
in
a
state
of
flutter
and
wonder
*punct* ,
which
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
be
collected
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
in
dancing
*punct* ,
singing
*punct* ,
exclaiming
spirits
*punct* ;
and
till
she
had
moved
about
*punct* ,
and
talked
to
herself
*punct* ,
and
laughed
and
reflected
*punct* ,
she
could
be
fit
for
nothing
rational
*punct* .
*break*
her
father's
business
was
to
announce
james's
being
gone
out
to
put
the
horses
to
*punct* ,
preparatory
to
their
now
daily
drive
to
randalls
*punct* ;
and
she
had
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
an
immediate
excuse
for
disappearing
*punct* .
*break*
the
joy
*punct* ,
the
gratitude
*punct* ,
the
exquisite
delight
of
her
sensations
may
be
imagined
*punct* .
*break*
the
sole
grievance
and
alloy
thus
removed
in
the
prospect
of
harriet's
welfare
*punct* ,
she
was
really
in
danger
of
becoming
too
happy
for
security.
*punct* ,
what
had
she
to
wish
for
*punct* ?
*break*
nothing
*punct* ,
but
to
grow
more
worthy
of
him
*punct* ,
whose
intentions
and
judgment
had
been
ever
so
superior
to
her
own
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
*punct* ,
but
that
the
lessons
of
her
past
folly
might
teach
her
humility
and
circumspection
in
future
*punct* .
*break*
serious
she
was
*punct* ,
very
serious
in
her
thankfulness
*punct* ,
and
in
her
resolutions
*punct* ;
and
yet
there
was
no
preventing
a
laugh
*punct* ,
sometimes
in
the
very
midst
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
she
must
laugh
at
such
a
close
*punct* !
*break*
such
an
end
of
the
doleful
disappointment
of
five
weeks
back
*punct* !
*break*
such
a
heart
*punct* ,
such
a
harriet
*punct* !
*break*
now
there
would
be
pleasure
in
her
returning
*punct* ,
every
thing
would
be
a
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
know
robert
martin
*punct* .
*break*
high
in
the
rank
of
her
most
serious
and
heartfelt
felicities
*punct* ,
was
the
reflection
that
all
necessity
of
concealment
from
mr.
knightley
would
soon
be
over
*punct* .
*break*
the
disguise
*punct* ,
equivocation
*punct* ,
mystery
*punct* ,
so
hateful
to
her
to
practise
*punct* ,
might
soon
be
over
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
now
look
forward
to
giving
him
that
full
and
perfect
confidence
which
her
disposition
was
most
ready
to
welcome
as
a
duty
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
gayest
and
happiest
spirits
she
set
forward
with
her
father
*punct* ;
not
always
listening
*punct* ,
but
always
agreeing
to
what
he
said
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
whether
in
speech
or
silence
*punct* ,
conniving
at
the
comfortable
persuasion
of
his
being
obliged
to
go
to
randalls
every
day
*punct* ,
or
poor
mrs.
weston
would
be
disappointed
*punct* .
*break*
they
arrived.
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
was
alone
in
the
drawing-room:
*punct* ,
but
hardly
had
they
been
told
of
the
baby
*punct* ,
and
mr.
woodhouse
received
the
thanks
for
coming
*punct* ,
which
he
asked
for
*punct* ,
when
a
glimpse
was
caught
through
the
blind
*punct* ,
of
two
figures
passing
near
the
window
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
frank
and
miss
fairfax
*punct* ,
said
mrs.
weston
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
just
going
to
tell
you
of
our
agreeable
surprize
in
seeing
him
arrive
this
morning
*punct* .
*break*
he
stays
till
to-morrow
*punct* ,
and
miss
fairfax
has
been
persuaded
to
spend
the
day
with
us.
*punct* ,
they
are
coming
in
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* .
*break*
in
half
a
minute
they
were
in
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
extremely
glad
to
see
him
*punct* ,
but
there
was
a
degree
of
confusion
*punct* ,
a
number
of
embarrassing
recollections
on
each
side
*punct* .
*break*
they
met
readily
and
smiling
*punct* ,
but
with
a
consciousness
which
at
first
allowed
little
to
be
said
*punct* ;
and
having
all
sat
down
again
*punct* ,
there
was
for
some
time
such
a
blank
in
the
circle
*punct* ,
that
emma
began
to
doubt
whether
the
wish
now
indulged
*punct* ,
which
she
had
long
felt
*punct* ,
of
seeing
frank
churchill
once
more
*punct* ,
and
of
seeing
him
with
jane
*punct* ,
would
yield
its
proportion
of
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
when
mr.
weston
joined
the
party
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
and
when
the
baby
was
fetched
*punct* ,
there
was
no
longer
a
want
of
subject
or
animation
*punct* ,
or
of
courage
and
opportunity
for
frank
churchill
to
draw
near
her
and
say
*punct* ,
i
have
to
thank
you
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* ,
for
a
very
kind
forgiving
message
in
one
of
mrs.
weston's
letters
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
time
has
not
made
you
less
willing
to
pardon
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
you
do
not
retract
what
you
then
said
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
cried
emma
*punct* ,
most
happy
to
begin
*punct* ,
not
in
the
least
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
particularly
glad
to
see
and
shake
hands
with
you
*punct* ,
and
to
give
you
joy
in
person
*punct* .
*break*
he
thanked
her
with
all
his
heart
*punct* ,
and
continued
some
time
to
speak
with
serious
feeling
of
his
gratitude
and
happiness
*punct* .
*break*
is
not
she
looking
well
*punct* ?
*break*
said
he
*punct* ,
turning
his
eyes
towards
jane
*punct* .
*break*
better
than
she
ever
used
to
do?
*punct* ,
you
see
how
my
father
and
mrs.
weston
doat
upon
her
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
spirits
were
soon
rising
again
*punct* ,
and
with
laughing
eyes
*punct* ,
after
mentioning
the
expected
return
of
the
campbells
*punct* ,
he
named
the
name
of
dixon.
*punct* ,
emma
blushed
*punct* ,
and
forbade
its
being
pronounced
in
her
hearing
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
never
think
of
it
*punct* ,
she
cried
*punct* ,
without
extreme
shame
*punct* .
*break*
the
shame
*punct* ,
he
answered
*punct* ,
is
all
mine
*punct* ,
or
ought
to
be
*punct* .
*break*
but
is
it
possible
that
you
had
no
suspicion?
*punct* ,
i
mean
of
late
*punct* .
*break*
early
*punct* ,
i
know
*punct* ,
you
had
none
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
had
the
smallest
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* .
*break*
that
appears
quite
wonderful
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
once
very
near
*punct* ,
and
i
wish
i
had
*punct* ,
it
would
have
been
better
*punct* .
*break*
but
though
i
was
always
doing
wrong
things
*punct* ,
they
were
very
bad
wrong
things
*punct* ,
and
such
as
did
me
no
service.
*punct* ,
it
would
have
been
a
much
better
transgression
had
i
broken
the
bond
of
secrecy
and
told
you
every
thing
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
now
worth
a
regret
*punct* ,
said
emma
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
some
hope
*punct* ,
resumed
he
*punct* ,
of
my
uncle's
being
persuaded
to
pay
a
visit
at
randalls
*punct* ;
he
wants
to
be
introduced
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
campbells
are
returned
*punct* ,
we
shall
meet
them
in
london
*punct* ,
and
continue
there
*punct* ,
i
trust
*punct* ,
till
we
may
carry
her
northward.
*punct* ,
but
now
*punct* ,
i
am
at
such
a
distance
from
her
*punct* ,
is
not
it
hard
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse?
*punct* ,
till
this
morning
*punct* ,
we
have
not
once
met
since
the
day
of
reconciliation
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
you
pity
me
*punct* ?
*break*
emma
spoke
her
pity
so
very
kindly
*punct* ,
that
with
a
sudden
accession
of
gay
thought
*punct* ,
he
cried
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* !
*break*
by
the
bye
*punct* ,
then
sinking
his
voice
*punct* ,
and
looking
demure
for
the
moment
*punct* ,
i
hope
mr.
knightley
is
well
*punct* ?
*break*
he
paused.
*punct* ,
she
coloured
and
laughed.
*punct* ,
i
know
you
saw
my
letter
*punct* ,
and
think
you
may
remember
my
wish
in
your
favour
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
return
your
congratulations.
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
that
i
have
heard
the
news
with
the
warmest
interest
and
satisfaction.
*punct* ,
he
is
a
man
whom
i
cannot
presume
to
praise
*punct* .
*break*
emma
was
delighted
*punct* ,
and
only
wanted
him
to
go
on
in
the
same
style
*punct* ;
but
his
mind
was
the
next
moment
in
his
own
concerns
and
with
his
own
jane
*punct* ,
and
his
next
words
were
*punct* ,
did
you
ever
see
such
a
skin?
*punct* ,
such
smoothness
*punct* !
*break*
such
delicacy!
*punct* ,
and
yet
without
being
actually
fair.
*punct* ,
one
cannot
call
her
fair
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
most
uncommon
complexion
*punct* ,
with
her
dark
eye-lashes
and
hair
*punct* ,
a
most
distinguishing
complexion
*punct* !
*break*
so
peculiarly
the
lady
in
it.
*punct* ,
just
colour
enough
for
beauty
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
always
admired
her
complexion
*punct* ,
replied
emma
*punct* ,
archly
*punct* ;
but
do
not
i
remember
the
time
when
you
found
fault
with
her
for
being
so
pale?
*punct* ,
when
we
first
began
to
talk
of
her.
*punct* ,
have
you
quite
forgotten
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
what
an
impudent
dog
i
was!
*punct* ,
how
could
i
dare
*punct* ,
but
he
laughed
so
heartily
at
the
recollection
*punct* ,
that
emma
could
not
help
saying
*punct* ,
i
do
suspect
that
in
the
midst
of
your
perplexities
at
that
time
*punct* ,
you
had
very
great
amusement
in
tricking
us
all.
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
you
had.
*punct* ,
i
am
sure
it
was
a
consolation
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
how
can
you
suspect
me
of
such
a
thing
*punct* ?
*break*
i
was
the
most
miserable
wretch
*punct* !
*break*
not
quite
so
miserable
as
to
be
insensible
to
mirth
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
it
was
a
source
of
high
entertainment
to
you
*punct* ,
to
feel
that
you
were
taking
us
all
in.
*punct* ,
perhaps
i
am
the
readier
to
suspect
*punct* ,
because
*punct* ,
to
tell
you
the
truth
*punct* ,
i
think
it
might
have
been
some
amusement
to
myself
in
the
same
situation
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
there
is
a
little
likeness
between
us
*punct* .
*break*
if
not
in
our
dispositions
*punct* ,
she
presently
added
*punct* ,
with
a
look
of
true
sensibility
*punct* ,
there
is
a
likeness
in
our
destiny
*punct* ;
the
destiny
which
bids
fair
to
connect
us
with
two
characters
so
much
superior
to
our
own
*punct* .
*break*
true
*punct* ,
true
*punct* ,
he
answered
*punct* ,
warmly
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
not
true
on
your
side
*punct* .
*break*
you
can
have
no
superior
*punct* ,
but
most
true
on
mine.
*punct* ,
she
is
a
complete
angel
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
her
*punct* .
*break*
is
not
she
an
angel
in
every
gesture
*punct* ?
*break*
observe
the
turn
of
her
throat
*punct* .
*break*
observe
her
eyes
*punct* ,
as
she
is
looking
up
at
my
father.
*punct* ,
you
will
be
glad
to
hear
*punct* ,
inclining
his
head
*punct* ,
and
whispering
seriously
*punct* ,
that
my
uncle
means
to
give
her
all
my
aunt's
jewels
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
to
be
new
set
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
resolved
to
have
some
in
an
ornament
for

head
*punct* .
*break*
will
not
it
be
beautiful
in
her
dark
hair
*punct* ?
*break*
very
beautiful
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
replied
emma
*punct* ;
and
she
spoke
so
kindly
*punct* ,
that
he
gratefully
burst
out
*punct* ,
how
delighted
i
am
to
see
you
again
*punct* !
*break*
and
to
see
you
in
such
excellent
looks!
*punct* ,
i
would
not
have
missed
this
meeting
for
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
certainly
have
called
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
had
you
failed
to
come
*punct* .
*break*
the
others
had
been
talking
of
the
child
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston
giving
an
account
of
a
little
alarm
she
had
been
under
*punct* ,
the
evening
before
*punct* ,
from
the
infant's
appearing
not
quite
well
*punct* .
*break*
she
believed
she
had
been
foolish
*punct* ,
but
it
had
alarmed
her
*punct* ,
and
she
had
been
within
half
a
minute
of
sending
for
mr.
perry
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
she
ought
to
be
ashamed
*punct* ,
but
mr.
weston
had
been
almost
as
uneasy
as
herself.
*punct* ,
in
ten
minutes
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
the
child
had
been
perfectly
well
again
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
her
history
*punct* ;
and
particularly
interesting
it
was
to
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
who
commended
her
very
much
for
thinking
of
sending
for
perry
*punct* ,
and
only
regretted
that
she
had
not
done
it
*punct* .
*break*
she
should
always
send
for
perry
*punct* ,
if
the
child
appeared
in
the
slightest
degree
disordered
*punct* ,
were
it
only
for
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
not
be
too
soon
alarmed
*punct* ,
nor
send
for
perry
too
often
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
pity
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
that
he
had
not
come
last
night
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
though
the
child
seemed
well
now
*punct* ,
very
well
considering
*punct* ,
it
would
probably
have
been
better
if
perry
had
seen
it
*punct* .
*break*
frank
churchill
caught
the
name
*punct* .
*break*
said
he
to
emma
*punct* ,
and
trying
*punct* ,
as
he
spoke
*punct* ,
to
catch
miss
fairfax's
eye
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend
mr.
perry
*punct* !
*break*
what
are
they
saying
about
mr.
perry?
*punct* ,
has
he
been
here
this
morning?
*punct* ,
and
how
does
he
travel
now?
*punct* ,
has
he
set
up
his
carriage
*punct* ?
*break*
emma
soon
recollected
*punct* ,
and
understood
him
*punct* ;
and
while
she
joined
in
the
laugh
*punct* ,
it
was
evident
from
jane's
countenance
that
she
too
was
really
hearing
him
*punct* ,
though
trying
to
seem
deaf
*punct* .
*break*
such
an
extraordinary
dream
of
mine
*punct* !
*break*
i
can
never
think
of
it
without
laughing.
*punct* ,
she
hears
us
*punct* ,
she
hears
us
*punct* ,
miss
woodhouse
*punct* .
*break*
i
see
it
in
her
cheek
*punct* ,
her
smile
*punct* ,
her
vain
attempt
to
frown
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
her
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
you
see
that
*punct* ,
at
this
instant
*punct* ,
the
very
passage
of
her
own
letter
*punct* ,
which
sent
me
the
report
*punct* ,
is
passing
under
her
eye
*punct* ,
that
the
whole
blunder
is
spread
before
her
*punct* ,
that
she
can
attend
to
nothing
else
*punct* ,
though
pretending
to
listen
to
the
others
*punct* ?
*break*
jane
was
forced
to
smile
completely
*punct* ,
for
a
moment
*punct* ;
and
the
smile
partly
remained
as
she
turned
towards
him
*punct* ,
and
said
in
a
conscious
*punct* ,
low
*punct* ,
yet
steady
voice
*punct* ,
how
you
can
bear
such
recollections
*punct* ,
is
astonishing
to
me!
*punct* ,
they
will
sometimes
obtrude
*punct* ,
but
how
you
can
court
them
*punct* !
*break*
he
had
a
great
deal
to
say
in
return
*punct* ,
and
very
entertainingly
*punct* ;
but
emma's
feelings
were
chiefly
with
jane
*punct* ,
in
the
argument
*punct* ;
and
on
leaving
randalls
*punct* ,
and
falling
naturally
into
a
comparison
of
the
two
men
*punct* ,
she
felt
*punct* ,
that
pleased
as
she
had
been
to
see
frank
churchill
*punct* ,
and
really
regarding
him
as
she
did
with
friendship
*punct* ,
she
had
never
been
more
sensible
of
mr.
knightley's
high
superiority
of
character
*punct* .
*break*
the
happiness
of
this
most
happy
day
*punct* ,
received
its
completion
*punct* ,
in
the
animated
contemplation
of
his
worth
which
this
comparison
produced
*punct* .
*break*
if
emma
had
still
*punct* ,
at
intervals
*punct* ,
an
anxious
feeling
for
harriet
*punct* ,
a
momentary
doubt
of
its
being
possible
for
her
to
be
really
cured
of
her
attachment
to
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
and
really
able
to
accept
another
man
from
unbiased
inclination
*punct* ,
it
was
not
long
that
she
had
to
suffer
from
the
recurrence
of
any
such
uncertainty
*punct* .
*break*
a
very
few
days
brought
the
party
from
london
*punct* ,
and
she
had
no
sooner
an
opportunity
of
being
one
hour
alone
with
harriet
*punct* ,
than
she
became
perfectly
satisfied
*punct* ,
unaccountable
as
it
was!
*punct* ,
that
robert
martin
had
thoroughly
supplanted
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
and
was
now
forming
all
her
views
of
happiness
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
was
a
little
distressed
*punct* ,
did
look
a
little
foolish
at
first
*punct* :
but
having
once
owned
that
she
had
been
presumptuous
and
silly
*punct* ,
and
self-deceived
*punct* ,
before
*punct* ,
her
pain
and
confusion
seemed
to
die
away
with
the
words
*punct* ,
and
leave
her
without
a
care
for
the
past
*punct* ,
and
with
the
fullest
exultation
in
the
present
and
future
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
as
to
her
friend's
approbation
*punct* ,
emma
had
instantly
removed
every
fear
of
that
nature
*punct* ,
by
meeting
her
with
the
most
unqualified
congratulations.
*punct* ,
harriet
was
most
happy
to
give
every
particular
of
the
evening
at
astley's
*punct* ,
and
the
dinner
the
next
day
*punct* ;
she
could
dwell
on
it
all
with
the
utmost
delight
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
did
such
particulars
explain?
*punct* ,
the
fact
was
*punct* ,
as
emma
could
now
acknowledge
*punct* ,
that
harriet
had
always
liked
robert
martin
*punct* ;
and
that
his
continuing
to
love
her
had
been
irresistible.
*punct* ,
beyond
this
*punct* ,
it
must
ever
be
unintelligible
to
emma
*punct* .
*break*
the
event
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
was
most
joyful
*punct* ;
and
every
day
was
giving
her
fresh
reason
for
thinking
so.
*punct* ,
harriet's
parentage
became
known
*punct* .
*break*
she
proved
to
be
the
daughter
of
a
tradesman
*punct* ,
rich
enough
to
afford
her
the
comfortable
maintenance
which
had
ever
been
hers
*punct* ,
and
decent
enough
to
have
always
wished
for
concealment.
*punct* ,
such
was
the
blood
of
gentility
which
emma
had
formerly
been
so
ready
to
vouch
for!
*punct* ,
it
was
likely
to
be
as
untainted
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
as
the
blood
of
many
a
gentleman
*punct* :
but
what
a
connexion
had
she
been
preparing
for
mr.
knightley
*punct* ,
or
for
the
churchills
*punct* ,
or
even
for
mr.
elton!
*punct* ,
the
stain
of
illegitimacy
*punct* ,
unbleached
by
nobility
or
wealth
*punct* ,
would
have
been
a
stain
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
no
objection
was
raised
on
the
father's
side
*punct* ;
the
young
man
was
treated
liberally
*punct* ;
it
was
all
as
it
should
be
*punct* :
and
as
emma
became
acquainted
with
robert
martin
*punct* ,
who
was
now
introduced
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
she
fully
acknowledged
in
him
all
the
appearance
of
sense
and
worth
which
could
bid
fairest
for
her
little
friend
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
no
doubt
of
harriet's
happiness
with
any
good-tempered
man
*punct* ;
but
with
him
*punct* ,
and
in
the
home
he
offered
*punct* ,
there
would
be
the
hope
of
more
*punct* ,
of
security
*punct* ,
stability
*punct* ,
and
improvement
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
be
placed
in
the
midst
of
those
who
loved
her
*punct* ,
and
who
had
better
sense
than
herself
*punct* ;
retired
enough
for
safety
*punct* ,
and
occupied
enough
for
cheerfulness
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
be
never
led
into
temptation
*punct* ,
nor
left
for
it
to
find
her
out
*punct* .
*break*
she
would
be
respectable
and
happy
*punct* ;
and
emma
admitted
her
to
be
the
luckiest
creature
in
the
world
*punct* ,
to
have
created
so
steady
and
persevering
an
affection
in
such
a
man;
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
if
not
quite
the
luckiest
*punct* ,
to
yield
only
to
herself
*punct* .
*break*
harriet
*punct* ,
necessarily
drawn
away
by
her
engagements
with
the
martins
*punct* ,
was
less
and
less
at
hartfield
*punct* ;
which
was
not
to
be
regretted.
*punct* ,
the
intimacy
between
her
and
emma
must
sink
*punct* ;
their
friendship
must
change
into
a
calmer
sort
of
goodwill
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
fortunately
*punct* ,
what
ought
to
be
*punct* ,
and
must
be
*punct* ,
seemed
already
beginning
*punct* ,
and
in
the
most
gradual
*punct* ,
natural
manner
*punct* .
*break*
before
the
end
of
september
*punct* ,
emma
attended
harriet
to
church
*punct* ,
and
saw
her
hand
bestowed
on
robert
martin
with
so
complete
a
satisfaction
*punct* ,
as
no
remembrances
*punct* ,
even
connected
with
mr.
elton
as
he
stood
before
them
*punct* ,
could
impair.
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
at
that
time
she
scarcely
saw
mr.
elton
*punct* ,
but
as
the
clergyman
whose
blessing
at
the
altar
might
next
fall
on
herself.
*punct* ,
robert
martin
and
harriet
smith
*punct* ,
the
latest
couple
engaged
of
the
three
*punct* ,
were
the
first
to
be
married
*punct* .
*break*
jane
fairfax
had
already
quitted
highbury
*punct* ,
and
was
restored
to
the
comforts
of
her
beloved
home
with
the
campbells.
*punct* ,
the
mr.
churchills
were
also
in
town
*punct* ;
and
they
were
only
waiting
for
november
*punct* .
*break*
the
intermediate
month
was
the
one
fixed
on
*punct* ,
as
far
as
they
dared
*punct* ,
by
emma
and
mr.
knightley.
*punct* ,
they
had
determined
that
their
marriage
ought
to
be
concluded
while
john
and
isabella
were
still
at
hartfield
*punct* ,
to
allow
them
the
fortnight's
absence
in
a
tour
to
the
seaside
*punct* ,
which
was
the
plan.
*punct* ,
john
and
isabella
*punct* ,
and
every
other
friend
*punct* ,
were
agreed
in
approving
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
mr.
woodhouse
*punct* ,
how
was
mr.
woodhouse
to
be
induced
to
consent?
*punct* ,
he
*punct* ,
who
had
never
yet
alluded
to
their
marriage
but
as
a
distant
event
*punct* .
*break*
when
first
sounded
on
the
subject
*punct* ,
he
was
so
miserable
*punct* ,
that
they
were
almost
hopeless.
*punct* ,
a
second
allusion
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
gave
less
pain.
*punct* ,
he
began
to
think
it
was
to
be
*punct* ,
and
that
he
could
not
prevent
it
*punct* ,
a
very
promising
step
of
the
mind
on
its
way
to
resignation
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
was
not
happy
*punct* .
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
he
appeared
so
much
otherwise
*punct* ,
that
his
daughter's
courage
failed
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
not
bear
to
see
him
suffering
*punct* ,
to
know
him
fancying
himself
neglected
*punct* ;
and
though
her
understanding
almost
acquiesced
in
the
assurance
of
both
the
mr.
knightleys
*punct* ,
that
when
once
the
event
were
over
*punct* ,
his
distress
would
be
soon
over
too
*punct* ,
she
hesitated
*punct* ,
she
could
not
proceed
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
state
of
suspense
they
were
befriended
*punct* ,
not
by
any
sudden
illumination
of
mr.
woodhouse's
mind
*punct* ,
or
any
wonderful
change
of
his
nervous
system
*punct* ,
but
by
the
operation
of
the
same
system
in
another
way.
*punct* ,
mrs.
weston's
poultry-house
was
robbed
one
night
of
all
her
turkeys
*punct* ,
evidently
by
the
ingenuity
of
man
*punct* .
*break*
other
poultry-yards
in
the
neighbourhood
also
suffered.
*punct* ,
pilfering
was
housebreaking
to
mr.
woodhouse's
fears.
*punct* ,
he
was
very
uneasy
*punct* ;
and
but
for
the
sense
of
his
son-in-law's
protection
*punct* ,
would
have
been
under
wretched
alarm
every
night
of
his
life
*punct* .
*break*
the
strength
*punct* ,
resolution
*punct* ,
and
presence
of
mind
of
the
mr.
knightleys
*punct* ,
commanded
his
fullest
dependence
*punct* .
*break*
while
either
of
them
protected
him
and
his
*punct* ,
hartfield
was
safe.
*punct* ,
but
mr.
john
knightley
must
be
in
london
again
by
the
end
of
the
first
week
in
november
*punct* .
*break*
the
result
of
this
distress
was
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
with
a
much
more
voluntary
*punct* ,
cheerful
consent
than
his
daughter
had
ever
presumed
to
hope
for
at
the
moment
*punct* ,
she
was
able
to
fix
her
wedding-day
*punct* ,
and
mr.
elton
was
called
on
*punct* ,
within
a
month
from
the
marriage
of
mr.
and
mrs.
robert
martin
*punct* ,
to
join
the
hands
of
mr.
knightley
and
miss
woodhouse
*punct* .
*break*
the
wedding
was
very
much
like
other
weddings
*punct* ,
where
the
parties
have
no
taste
for
finery
or
parade
*punct* ;
and
mrs.
elton
*punct* ,
from
the
particulars
detailed
by
her
husband
*punct* ,
thought
it
all
extremely
shabby
*punct* ,
and
very
inferior
to
her
own.
*punct* ,
very
little
white
satin
*punct* ,
very
few
lace
veils
*punct* ;
a
most
pitiful
business!
*punct* ,
selina
would
stare
when
she
heard
of
it.
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
these
deficiencies
*punct* ,
the
wishes
*punct* ,
the
hopes
*punct* ,
the
confidence
*punct* ,
the
predictions
of
the
small
band
of
true
friends
who
witnessed
the
ceremony
*punct* ,
were
fully
answered
in
the
perfect
happiness
of
the
union
*punct* .
*break*
