Title: The Red Badge of Courage
Author: Stephen Crane
the
cold
passed
reluctantly
from
the
earth
*punct* ,
and
the
retiring
fogs
revealed
an
army
stretched
out
on
the
hills
*punct* ,
resting
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
landscape
changed
from
brown
to
green
*punct* ,
the
army
awak
*punct* -
ened
*punct* ,
and
began
to
tremble
with
eagerness
at
the
noise
of
rumors
*punct* .
*break*
it
cast
its
eyes
upon
the
roads
*punct* ,
which
were
growing
from
long
troughs
of
liquid
mud
to
proper
thoroughfares
*punct* .
*break*
a
river
*punct* ,
amber
*punct* -
tinted
in
the
shadow
of
its
banks
*punct* ,
purled
at
the
army's
feet
*punct* ;
and
at
night
*punct* ,
when
the
stream
had
become
of
a
sorrowful
blackness
*punct* ,
one
could
see
across
it
the
red
*punct* ,
eyelike
gleam
of
hostile
camp
*punct* -
fires
set
in
the
low
brows
of
distant
hills
*punct* .
*break*
once
a
certain
tall
soldier
developed
virtues
and
went
resolutely
to
wash
a
shirt
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
flying
back
from
a
brook
waving
his
garment
bannerlike
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
swelled
with
a
tale
he
had
heard
from
a
reliable
friend
*punct* ,
who
had
heard
it
from
a
truthful
cavalryman
*punct* ,
who
had
heard
it
from
his
trustworthy
brother
*punct* ,
one
of
the
order
*punct* -
lies
at
division
headquarters
*punct* .
*break*
he
adopted
the
important
air
of
a
herald
in
red
and
gold
*punct* .
*break*
we're
goin
way
up
the
river
*punct* ,
cut
across
*punct* ,
an
come
around
in
behint
em
*punct* .
*break*
to
his
attentive
audience
he
drew
a
loud
and
elaborate
plan
of
a
very
brilliant
campaign
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
had
finished
*punct* ,
the
blue-clothed
men
scattered
into
small
arguing
groups
between
the
rows
of
squat
brown
huts
*punct* .
*break*
a
negro
teamster
who
had
been
dancing
upon
a
cracker
box
with
the
hilarious
encouragement
of
twoscore
soldiers
was
deserted
*punct* .
*break*
he
sat
mournfully
down
*punct* .
*break*
smoke
drifted
lazily
from
a
multitude
of
quaint
chim
*punct* -
neys
*punct* .
*break*
it's
a
lie
*punct* !
*break*
that's
all
it
is
*punct* ,
a
thunderin
lie
*punct* !
*break*
said
another
private
loudly
*punct* .
*break*
his
smooth
face
was
flushed
*punct* ,
and
his
hands
were
thrust
sulkily
into
his
trousers
pockets
*punct* .
*break*
he
took
the
matter
as
an
affront
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
believe
the
derned
old
army's
ever
going
to
move
*punct* .
*break*
i've
got
ready
to
move
eight
times
in
the
last
two
weeks
*punct* ,
and
we
ain't
moved
yet
*punct* .
*break*
the
tall
soldier
felt
called
upon
to
defend
the
truth
of
a
rumor
he
himself
had
intro
*punct* -
duced
*punct* .
*break*
he
and
the
loud
one
came
near
to
fight
*punct* -
ing
over
it
*punct* .
*break*
a
corporal
began
to
swear
before
the
assem
*punct* -
blage
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
just
put
a
costly
board
floor
in
his
house
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
during
the
early
spring
he
had
refrained
from
adding
extensively
to
the
comfort
of
his
environment
because
he
had
felt
that
the
army
might
start
on
the
march
at
any
moment
*punct* .
*break*
of
late
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
had
been
im
*punct* -
pressed
that
they
were
in
a
sort
of
eternal
camp
*punct* .
*break*
many
of
the
men
engaged
in
a
spirited
debate
*punct* .
*break*
one
outlined
in
a
peculiarly
lucid
manner
all
the
plans
of
the
commanding
general
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
op
*punct* -
posed
by
men
who
advocated
that
there
were
other
plans
of
campaign
*punct* .
*break*
they
clamored
at
each
other
*punct* ,
numbers
making
futile
bids
for
the
pop
*punct* -
ular
attention
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
*punct* ,
the
soldier
who
had
fetched
the
rumor
bustled
about
with
much
importance
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
continually
assailed
by
questions
*punct* .
*break*
what's
up
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ?
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
what
yeh
talkin
about
*punct* ?
*break*
how
yeh
know
it
is
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
yeh
kin
b'lieve
me
er
not
*punct* ,
jest
as
yeh
like
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
care
a
hang
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
much
food
for
thought
in
the
man
*punct* -
ner
in
which
he
replied
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
near
to
con
*punct* -
vincing
them
by
disdaining
to
produce
proofs
*punct* .
*break*
they
grew
excited
over
it
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
youthful
private
who
listened
with
eager
ears
to
the
words
of
the
tall
soldier
and
to
the
varied
comments
of
his
comrades
*punct* .
*break*
after
receiving
a
fill
of
discussions
concerning
marches
and
attacks
*punct* ,
he
went
to
his
hut
and
crawled
through
an
intricate
hole
that
served
it
as
a
door
*punct* .
*break*
he
wished
to
be
alone
with
some
new
thoughts
that
had
lately
come
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
lay
down
on
a
wide
bank
that
stretched
across
the
end
of
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
other
end
*punct* ,
cracker
boxes
were
made
to
serve
as
furniture
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
grouped
about
the
fireplace
*punct* .
*break*
a
pic
*punct* -
ture
from
an
illustrated
weekly
was
upon
the
log
walls
*punct* ,
and
three
rifles
were
paralleled
on
pegs
*punct* .
*break*
equipments
hunt
on
handy
projections
*punct* ,
and
some
tin
dishes
lay
upon
a
small
pile
of
firewood
*punct* .
*break*
a
folded
tent
was
serving
as
a
roof
*punct* .
*break*
the
sunlight
*punct* ,
without
*punct* ,
beating
upon
it
*punct* ,
made
it
glow
a
light
yellow
shade
*punct* .
*break*
a
small
window
shot
an
oblique
square
of
whiter
light
upon
the
cluttered
floor
*punct* .
*break*
the
smoke
from
the
fire
at
times
neglected
the
clay
chimney
and
wreathed
into
the
room
*punct* ,
and
this
flimsy
chimney
of
clay
and
sticks
made
end
*punct* -
less
threats
to
set
ablaze
the
whole
establishment
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
was
in
a
little
trance
of
astonish
*punct* -
ment
*punct* .
*break*
so
they
were
at
last
going
to
fight
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
morrow
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
there
would
be
a
battle
*punct* ,
and
he
would
be
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
time
he
was
obliged
to
labor
to
make
himself
believe
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
accept
with
assurance
an
omen
that
he
was
about
to
mingle
in
one
of
those
great
affairs
of
the
earth
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
dreamed
of
battles
all
his
life
*punct* ,
of
vague
and
bloody
conflicts
that
had
thrilled
him
with
their
sweep
and
fire
*punct* .
*break*
in
visions
he
had
seen
himself
in
many
struggles
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
imagined
peoples
secure
in
the
shadow
of
his
eagle-eyed
prowess
*punct* .
*break*
but
awake
he
had
regarded
battles
as
crimson
blotches
on
the
pages
of
the
past
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
put
them
as
things
of
the
bygone
with
his
thought-images
of
heavy
crowns
and
high
castles
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
portion
of
the
world's
history
which
he
had
regarded
as
the
time
of
wars
*punct* ,
but
it
*punct* ,
he
thought
*punct* ,
had
been
long
gone
over
the
horizon
and
had
disappeared
forever
*punct* .
*break*
from
his
home
his
youthful
eyes
had
looked
upon
the
war
in
his
own
country
with
distrust
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
be
some
sort
of
a
play
affair
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
long
despaired
of
witnessing
a
greeklike
struggle
*punct* .
*break*
such
would
be
no
more
*punct* ,
he
had
said
*punct* .
*break*
men
were
better
*punct* ,
or
more
timid
*punct* .
*break*
secular
and
religious
education
had
effaced
the
throat-grappling
in
*punct* -
stinct
*punct* ,
or
else
firm
finance
held
in
check
the
pas
*punct* -
sions
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
burned
several
times
to
enlist
*punct* .
*break*
tales
of
great
movements
shook
the
land
*punct* .
*break*
they
might
not
be
distinctly
homeric
*punct* ,
but
there
seemed
to
be
much
glory
in
them
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
read
of
marches
*punct* ,
sieges
*punct* ,
conflicts
*punct* ,
and
he
had
longed
to
see
it
all
*punct* .
*break*
his
busy
mind
had
drawn
for
him
large
pictures
extravagant
in
color
*punct* ,
lurid
with
breathless
deeds
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
mother
had
discouraged
him
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
affected
to
look
with
some
contempt
upon
the
quality
of
his
war
ardor
and
patriotism
*punct* .
*break*
she
could
calmly
seat
herself
and
with
no
apparent
difficulty
give
him
many
hundreds
of
reasons
why
he
was
of
vastly
more
importance
on
the
farm
than
on
the
field
of
battle
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
had
certain
ways
of
expression
that
told
him
that
her
statements
on
the
subject
came
from
a
deep
con
*punct* -
viction
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
on
her
side
*punct* ,
was
his
belief
that
her
ethical
motive
in
the
argument
was
impregnable
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
had
made
firm
rebellion
against
this
yellow
light
thrown
upon
the
color
of
his
ambitions
*punct* .
*break*
the
newspapers
*punct* ,
the
gossip
of
the
village
*punct* ,
his
own
picturings
had
aroused
him
to
an
uncheckable
degree
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
in
truth
fighting
finely
down
there
*punct* .
*break*
almost
every
day
the
newspapers
printed
accounts
of
a
decisive
victory
*punct* .
*break*
one
night
*punct* ,
as
he
lay
in
bed
*punct* ,
the
winds
had
carried
to
him
the
clangoring
of
the
church
bell
as
some
enthusiast
jerked
the
rope
frantically
to
tell
the
twisted
news
of
a
great
battle
*punct* .
*break*
this
voice
of
the
people
rejoicing
in
the
night
had
made
him
shiver
in
a
prolonged
ecstasy
of
ex
*punct* -
citement
*punct* .
*break*
later
*punct* ,
he
had
gone
down
to
his
mother's
room
and
had
spoken
thus
*punct* :
ma
*punct* ,
i'm
going
to
enlist
*punct* .
*break*
henry
*punct* ,
don't
you
be
a
fool
*punct* ,
his
mother
had
replied
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
then
covered
her
face
with
the
quilt
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
an
end
to
the
matter
for
that
night
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
the
next
morning
he
had
gone
to
a
town
that
was
near
his
mother's
farm
and
had
enlisted
in
a
company
that
was
forming
there
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
had
returned
home
his
mother
was
milking
the
brindle
cow
*punct* .
*break*
four
others
stood
waiting
*punct* .
*break*
ma
*punct* ,
i've
enlisted
*punct* ,
he
had
said
to
her
diffidently
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
short
silence
*punct* .
*break*
the
lord's
will
be
done
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ,
she
had
finally
replied
*punct* ,
and
had
then
continued
to
milk
the
brindle
cow
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
had
stood
in
the
doorway
with
his
soldier's
clothes
on
his
back
*punct* ,
and
with
the
light
of
excitement
and
expectancy
in
his
eyes
almost
defeating
the
glow
of
regret
for
the
home
bonds
*punct* ,
he
had
seen
two
tears
leaving
their
trails
on
his
mother's
scarred
cheeks
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
she
had
disappointed
him
by
saying
nothing
whatever
about
returning
with
his
shield
or
on
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
privately
primed
himself
for
a
beautiful
scene
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
prepared
certain
sen
*punct* -
tences
which
he
thought
could
be
used
with
touching
effect
*punct* .
*break*
but
her
words
destroyed
his
plans
*punct* .
*break*
she
had
doggedly
peeled
potatoes
and
addressed
him
as
follows
*punct* :
you
watch
out
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ,
an
take
good
care
of
yerself
in
this
here
fighting
business
*punct* ,

of
bad
men
in

henry
*punct* .
*break*
the
army
makes
em
wild
*punct* ,
and
they
like
nothing
better
than
the
job
of
leading
off
a
young
feller
like

*break*
good-by

henry
*punct* .
*break*
watch
out
*punct* ,
and
be
a
good
boy
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
been
impatient
under
the
ordeal
of
this
speech
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
not
been
quite
what
he
expected
*punct* ,
and
he
had
borne
it
with
an
air
of
irritation
*punct* .
*break*
he
departed
feeling
vague
relief
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
when
he
had
looked
back
from
the
gate
*punct* ,
he
had
seen
his
mother
kneeling
among
the
po
*punct* -
tato
parings
*punct* .
*break*
her
brown
face
*punct* ,
upraised
*punct* ,
was
stained
with
tears
*punct* ,
and
her
spare
form
was
quiver
*punct* -
10
red
badge
of
courage
*punct* .
*break*
he
bowed
his
head
and
went
on
*punct* ,
feeling
suddenly
ashamed
of
his
purposes
*punct* .
*break*
from
his
home
he
had
gone
to
the
seminary
to
bid
adieu
to
many
schoolmates
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
thronged
about
him
with
wonder
and
admiration
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
felt
the
gulf
now
between
them
and
had
swelled
with
calm
pride
*punct* .
*break*
he
and
some
of
his
fellows
who
had
donned
blue
were
quite
over
*punct* -
whelmed
with
privileges
for
all
of
one
afternoon
*punct* ,
and
it
had
been
a
very
delicious
thing
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
strutted
*punct* .
*break*
a
certain
light-haired
girl
had
made
vivacious
fun
at
his
martial
spirit
*punct* ,
but
there
was
another
and
darker
girl
whom
he
had
gazed
at
steadfastly
*punct* ,
and
he
thought
she
grew
demure
and
sad
at
sight
of
his
blue
and
brass
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
had
walked
down
the
path
between
the
rows
of
oaks
*punct* ,
he
had
turned
his
head
and
detected
her
at
a
window
watching
his
departure
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
perceived
her
*punct* ,
she
had
im
*punct* -
mediately
begun
to
stare
up
through
the
high
tree
branches
at
the
sky
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
flurry
and
haste
in
her
movement
as
she
changed
her
attitude
*punct* .
*break*
he
often
thought
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
way
to
washington
his
spirit
had
soared
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
was
fed
and
caressed
at
station
after
station
until
the
youth
had
believed
that
he
must
be
a
hero
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
lavish
ex
*punct* -
penditure
of
bread
and
cold
meats
*punct* ,
coffee
*punct* ,
and
pickles
and
cheese
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
basked
in
the
smiles
of
the
girls
and
was
patted
and
complimented
by
the
old
men
*punct* ,
he
had
felt
growing
within
him
the
strength
to
do
mighty
deeds
of
arms
*punct* .
*break*
after
complicated
journeyings
with
many
pauses
*punct* ,
there
had
come
months
of
monotonous
life
in
a
camp
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
had
the
belief
that
real
war
was
a
series
of
death
struggles
with
small
time
in
between
for
sleep
and
meals
*punct* ;
but
since
his
regiment
had
come
to
the
field
the
army
had
done
little
but
sit
still
and
try
to
keep
warm
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
brought
then
gradually
back
to
his
old
ideas
*punct* .
*break*
greeklike
struggles
would
be
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
men
were
better
*punct* ,
or
more
timid
*punct* .
*break*
secular
and
religious
education
had
effaced
the
throat-grap
*punct* -
pling
instinct
*punct* ,
or
else
firm
finance
held
in
check
the
passions
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
grown
to
regard
himself
merely
as
a
part
of
a
vast
blue
demonstration
*punct* .
*break*
his
province
was
to
look
out
*punct* ,
as
far
as
he
could
*punct* ,
for
his
per
*punct* -
sonal
comfort
*punct* .
*break*
for
recreation
he
could
twiddle
his
thumbs
and
speculate
on
the
thoughts
which
must
agitate
the
minds
of
the
generals
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
he
was
drilled
and
drilled
and
reviewed
*punct* ,
and
drilled
and
drilled
and
reviewed
*punct* .
*break*
the
only
foes
he
had
seen
were
some
pickets
along
the
river
bank
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
a
sun-tanned
*punct* ,
philosophical
lot
*punct* ,
who
sometimes
shot
reflectively
at
the
blue
pickets
*punct* .
*break*
when
reproached
for
this
afterward
*punct* ,
they
usually
expressed
sorrow
*punct* ,
and
swore
by
their
gods
that
the
guns
had
exploded
without
their
permission
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
on
guard
duty
one
night
*punct* ,
conversed
across
the
stream
with
one
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
slightly
ragged
man
*punct* ,
who
spat
skillfully
between
his
shoes
and
possessed
a
great
fund
of
bland
and
infantile
assurance
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
liked
him
personally
*punct* .
*break*
yank
*punct* ,
the
other
had
informed
him
*punct* ,
yer
a
right
dum
good
feller
*punct* .
*break*
this
sentiment
*punct* ,
floating
to
him
upon
the
still
air
*punct* ,
had
made
him
tempo
*punct* -
rarily
regret
war
*punct* .
*break*
various
veterans
had
told
him
tales
*punct* .
*break*
some
talked
of
gray
*punct* ,
bewhiskered
hordes
who
were
advancing
with
relentless
curses
and
chewing
tobacco
with
unspeakable
valor
*punct* ;
tremendous
bodies
of
fierce
soldiery
who
were
sweeping
along
like
the
huns
*punct* .
*break*
others
spoke
of
tattered
and
eternally
hungry
men
who
fired
despondent
powders
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
stories
*punct* ,
the
youth
imagined
the
red
*punct* ,
live
bones
sticking
out
through
slits
in
the
faded
uniforms
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
he
could
not
put
a
whole
faith
in
veter
*punct* -
ans
tales
*punct* ,
for
recruits
were
their
prey
*punct* .
*break*
they
talked
much
of
smoke
*punct* ,
fire
*punct* ,
and
blood
*punct* ,
but
he
could
not
tell
how
much
might
be
lies
*punct* .
*break*
they
persistently
yelled
fresh
fish
*punct* !
*break*
at
him
*punct* ,
and
were
in
no
wise
to
be
trusted
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
he
perceived
now
that
it
did
not
greatly
matter
what
kind
of
soldiers
he
was
going
to
fight
*punct* ,
so
long
as
they
fought
*punct* ,
which
fact
no
one
disputed
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
more
serious
problem
*punct* .
*break*
he
lay
in
his
bunk
pondering
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
tried
to
mathematically
prove
to
himself
that
he
would
not
run
from
a
battle
*punct* .
*break*
previously
he
had
never
felt
obliged
to
wrestle
too
seriously
with
this
question
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
life
he
had
taken
certain
things
for
granted
*punct* ,
never
challeng
*punct* -
ing
his
belief
in
ultimate
success
*punct* ,
and
bothering
little
about
means
and
roads
*punct* .
*break*
but
here
he
was
confronted
with
a
thing
of
moment
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
sud
*punct* -
denly
appeared
to
him
that
perhaps
in
a
battle
he
might
run
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
forced
to
admit
that
as
far
as
war
was
concerned
he
knew
nothing
of
himself
*punct* .
*break*
a
sufficient
time
before
he
would
have
allowed
the
problem
to
kick
its
heels
at
the
outer
portals
of
his
mind
*punct* ,
but
now
he
felt
compelled
to
give
serious
attention
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
a
little
panic-fear
grew
in
his
mind
*punct* .
*break*
as
his
imagination
went
forward
to
a
fight
*punct* ,
he
saw
hide
*punct* -
ous
possibilities
*punct* .
*break*
he
contemplated
the
lurking
menaces
of
the
future
*punct* ,
and
failed
in
an
effort
to
see
himself
standing
stoutly
in
the
midst
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
he
recalled
his
visions
of
broken-bladed
glory
*punct* ,
but
in
the
shadow
of
the
impending
tumult
he
suspected
them
to
be
impossible
pictures
*punct* .
*break*
he
sprang
from
the
bunk
and
began
to
pace
nervously
to
and
fro
*punct* .
*break*
good
lord
*punct* ,
what's
th
matter
with
me
*punct* ?
*break*
he
said
aloud
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
that
in
this
crisis
his
laws
of
life
were
useless
*punct* .
*break*
whatever
he
had
learned
of
himself
was
here
of
no
avail
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
an
unknown
quantity
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
that
he
would
again
be
obliged
to
experi
*punct* -
ment
as
he
had
in
early
youth
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
accumu
*punct* -
late
information
of
himself
*punct* ,
and
meanwhile
he
re
*punct* -
solved
to
remain
close
upon
his
guard
lest
those
qualities
of
which
he
knew
nothing
should
ever
*punct* -
lastingly
disgrace
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
re
*punct* -
peated
in
dismay
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
time
the
tall
soldier
slid
dexterously
through
the
hole
*punct* .
*break*
the
loud
private
followed
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
wrangling
*punct* .
*break*
that's
all
right
*punct* ,
said
the
tall
soldier
as
he
entered
*punct* .
*break*
he
waved
his
hand
expressively
*punct* .
*break*
you
can
believe
me
or
not
*punct* ,
jest
as
you
like
*punct* .
*break*
all
you
got
to
do
is
to
sit
down
and
wait
as
quiet
as
you
can
*punct* .
*break*
then
pretty
soon
you'll
find
out
i
was
right
*punct* .
*break*
his
comrade
grunted
stubbornly
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
mo
*punct* -
ment
he
seemed
to
be
searching
for
a
formidable
reply
*punct* .
*break*
finally
he
said
*punct* :
well
*punct* ,
you
don't
know
everything
in
the
world
*punct* ,
do
you
*punct* ?
*break*
didn't
say
i
knew
everything
in
the
world
*punct* ,
retorted
the
other
sharply
*punct* .
*break*
he
began
to
stow
various
articles
snugly
into
his
knapsack
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
pausing
in
his
nervous
walk
*punct* ,
looked
down
at
the
busy
figure
*punct* .
*break*
going
to
be
a
battle
*punct* ,
sure
*punct* ,
is
there
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ?
*break*
of
course
there
is
*punct* ,
replied
the
tall
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
there
is
*punct* .
*break*
you
jest
wait
til
to-morrow
*punct* ,
and
you'll
see
one
of
the
biggest
battles
ever
was
*punct* .
*break*
you
jest
wait
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
you'll
see
fighting
this
time
*punct* ,
my
boy
*punct* ,
what'll
be
regular
out-and-out
fighting
*punct* ,
added
the
tall
soldier
*punct* ,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
about
to
exhibit
a
battle
for
the
benefit
of
his
friends
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
loud
one
from
a
corner
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
remarked
the
youth
*punct* ,
like
as
not
this
story'll
turn
out
jest
like
them
others
did
*punct* .
*break*
not
much
it
won't
*punct* ,
replied
the
tall
soldier
*punct* ,
exasperated
*punct* .
*break*
not
much
it
won't
*punct* .
*break*
didn't
the
cavalry
all
start
this
morning
*punct* ?
*break*
he
glared
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
denied
his
statement
*punct* .
*break*
the
cav
*punct* -
alry
started
this
morning
*punct* ,
he
continued
*punct* .
*break*
they
say
there
ain't
hardly
any
cavalry
left
in
camp
*punct* .
*break*
they're
going
to
richmond
*punct* ,
or
some
place
*punct* ,
while
we
fight
all
the
johnnies
*punct* .
*break*
it's
some
dodge
like
that
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment's
got
orders
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
a
feller
what
seen
em
go
to
headquarters
told
me
a
little
while
ago
*punct* .
*break*
and
they're
raising
blazes
all
over
camp
*punct* ,
anybody
can
see
that
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
loud
one
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
remained
silent
for
a
time
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
he
spoke
to
the
tall
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
how
do
you
think
the
reg'ment
ll
do
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
they'll
fight
all
right
*punct* ,
i
guess
*punct* ,
after
they
once
get
into
it
*punct* ,
said
the
other
with
cold
judg
*punct* -
ment
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
a
fine
use
of
the
third
person
*punct* .
*break*
there's
been
heaps
of
fun
poked
at
em
because
they're
new
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
and
all
that
*punct* ;
but
they'll
fight
all
right
*punct* ,
i
guess
*punct* .
*break*
think
any
of
the
boys
ll
run
*punct* ?
*break*
persisted
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
there
may
be
a
few
of
em
run
*punct* ,
but
there's
them
kind
in
every
regiment
*punct* ,
specially
when
they
first
goes
under
fire
*punct* ,
said
the
other
in
a
tolerant
way
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
it
might
happen
that
the
hull
kit-and-boodle
might
start
and
run
*punct* ,
if
some
big
fighting
came
first-off
*punct* ,
and
then
again
they
might
stay
and
fight
like
fun
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
can't
bet
on
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
they
ain't
never
been
under
fire
yet
*punct* ,
and
it
ain't
likely
they'll
lick
the
hull
rebel
army
all-to-oncet
the
first
time
*punct* ;
but
i
think
they'll
fight
better
than
some
*punct* ,
if
worse
than
others
*punct* .
*break*
that's
the
way
i
figger
*punct* .
*break*
they
call
the
reg'ment
fresh
fish
and
everything
*punct* ;
but
the
boys
come
of
good
stock
*punct* ,
and
most
of
em
ll
fight
like
sin
after
they
oncet
git
shootin'
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* ,
with
a
mighty
emphasis
on
the
last
four
words
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
you
think
you
know
*punct* ,
began
the
loud
soldier
with
scorn
*punct* .
*break*
the
other
turned
savagely
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
a
rapid
altercation
*punct* ,
in
which
they
fastened
upon
each
other
various
strange
epithets
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
at
last
interrupted
them
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
ever
think
you
might
run
yourself
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ?
*break*
on
concluding
the
sentence
he
laughed
as
if
he
had
meant
to
aim
a
joke
*punct* .
*break*
the
loud
sol
*punct* -
dier
also
giggled
*punct* .
*break*
the
tall
private
waved
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
said
he
profoundly
*punct* ,
i've
thought
it
might
get
too
hot
for
jim
conklin
in
some
of
them
scrimmages
*punct* ,
and
if
a
whole
lot
of
boys
started
and
run
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
i
s'pose
i'd
start
and
run
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
i
once
started
to
run
*punct* ,
i'd
run
like
the
devil
*punct* ,
and
no
mistake
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
everybody
was
a-standing
and
a-fighting
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
i'd
stand
and
fight
*punct* .
*break*
be
jiminey
*punct* ,
i
would
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
bet
on
it
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
loud
one
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
of
this
tale
felt
gratitude
for
these
words
of
his
comrade
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
feared
that
all
of
the
untried
men
possessed
a
great
and
correct
confidence
*punct* .
*break*
he
now
was
in
a
measure
reassured
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
morning
the
youth
discovered
that
his
tall
comrade
had
been
the
fast-flying
messen
*punct* -
ger
of
a
mistake
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
much
scoffing
at
the
latter
by
those
who
had
yesterday
been
firm
adherents
of
his
views
*punct* ,
and
there
was
even
a
lit
*punct* -
tle
sneering
by
men
who
had
never
believed
the
rumor
*punct* .
*break*
the
tall
one
fought
with
a
man
from
chatfield
corners
and
beat
him
severely
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
felt
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
that
his
problem
was
in
no
wise
lifted
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
*punct* ,
on
the
contrary
*punct* ,
an
irritating
prolongation
*punct* .
*break*
the
tale
had
created
in
him
a
great
concern
for
himself
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
with
the
newborn
question
in
his
mind
*punct* ,
he
was
compelled
to
sink
back
into
his
old
place
as
part
of
a
blue
demonstration
*punct* .
*break*
for
days
he
made
ceaseless
calculations
*punct* ,
but
they
were
all
wondrously
unsatisfactory
*punct* .
*break*
he
found
that
he
could
establish
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
he
final
*punct* -
ly
concluded
that
the
only
way
to
prove
himself
was
to
go
into
the
blaze
*punct* ,
and
then
figuratively
to
18
watch
his
legs
to
discover
their
merits
and
faults
*punct* .
*break*
he
reluctantly
admitted
that
he
could
not
sit
still
and
with
a
mental
slate
and
pencil
derive
an
answer
*punct* .
*break*
to
gain
it
*punct* ,
he
must
have
blaze
*punct* ,
blood
*punct* ,
and
danger
*punct* ,
even
as
a
chemist
requires
this
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
and
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
so
he
fretted
for
an
opportunity
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
he
continually
tried
to
measure
himself
by
his
comrades
*punct* .
*break*
the
tall
soldier
*punct* ,
for
one
*punct* ,
gave
him
some
assurance
*punct* .
*break*
this
man's
se
*punct* -
rene
unconcern
dealt
him
a
measure
of
con
*punct* -
fidence
*punct* ,
for
he
had
known
him
since
childhood
*punct* ,
and
from
his
intimate
knowledge
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
be
capable
of
anything
that
was
beyond
him
*punct* ,
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
he
thought
that
his
comrade
might
be
mistaken
about
himself
*punct* .
*break*
or
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
he
might
be
a
man
here
*punct* -
tofore
doomed
to
peace
and
obscurity
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
in
reality
*punct* ,
made
to
shine
in
war
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
would
have
liked
to
have
discov
*punct* -
ered
another
who
suspected
himself
*punct* .
*break*
a
sympa
*punct* -
thetic
comparison
of
mental
notes
would
have
been
a
joy
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
occasionally
tried
to
fathom
a
comrade
with
seductive
sentences
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
about
to
find
men
in
the
proper
mood
*punct* .
*break*
all
attempts
failed
to
bring
forth
any
statement
which
looked
in
any
way
like
a
confession
to
those
doubts
which
he
privately
acknowledged
in
himself
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
afraid
to
make
an
open
declaration
of
his
concern
*punct* ,
because
he
dreaded
to
place
some
unscrupulous
confidant
upon
the
high
plane
of
the
unconfessed
from
which
elevation
he
could
be
derided
*punct* .
*break*
in
regard
to
his
companions
his
mind
wa
*punct* -
vered
between
two
opinions
*punct* ,
according
to
his
mood
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
he
inclined
to
believing
them
all
heroes
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
he
usually
admitted
in
secret
the
superior
development
of
the
higher
qualities
in
others
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
conceive
of
men
going
very
insignificantly
about
the
world
bearing
a
load
of
courage
unseen
*punct* ,
and
although
he
had
known
many
of
his
comrades
through
boyhood
*punct* ,
he
be
*punct* -
gan
to
fear
that
his
judgment
of
them
had
been
blind
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
in
other
moments
*punct* ,
he
flouted
these
theories
*punct* ,
and
assured
himself
that
his
fellows
were
all
privately
wondering
and
quaking
*punct* .
*break*
his
emotions
made
him
feel
strange
in
the
presence
of
men
who
talked
excitedly
of
a
pro
*punct* -
spective
battle
as
of
a
drama
they
were
about
to
witness
*punct* ,
with
nothing
but
eagerness
and
curiosity
apparent
in
their
faces
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
often
that
he
sus
*punct* -
pected
them
to
be
liars
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
pass
such
thoughts
without
severe
condemnation
of
himself
*punct* .
*break*
he
dinned
reproaches
at
times
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
convicted
by
himself
of
many
shameful
crimes
against
the
gods
of
traditions
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
great
anxiety
his
heart
was
continually
clamoring
at
what
he
considered
the
intolerable
slowness
of
the
generals
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
content
to
perch
tranquilly
on
the
river
bank
*punct* ,
and
leave
him
bowed
down
by
the
weight
of
a
great
prob
*punct* -
lem
*punct* .
*break*
he
wanted
it
settled
forthwith
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
long
bear
such
a
load
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
his
anger
at
the
commanders
reached
an
acute
stage
*punct* ,
and
he
grumbled
about
the
camp
like
a
veteran
*punct* .
*break*
one
morning
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
found
himself
in
the
ranks
of
his
prepared
regiment
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
were
whispering
speculations
and
recounting
the
old
rumors
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
gloom
before
the
break
of
the
day
their
uniforms
glowed
a
deep
purple
hue
*punct* .
*break*
from
across
the
river
the
red
eyes
were
still
peering
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
eastern
sky
there
was
a
yel
*punct* -
low
patch
like
a
rug
laid
for
the
feet
of
the
com
*punct* -
ing
sun
*punct* ;
and
against
it
*punct* ,
black
and
patternlike
*punct* ,
loomed
the
gigantic
figure
of
the
colonel
on
a
gigantic
horse
*punct* .
*break*
from
off
in
the
darkness
came
the
trampling
of
feet
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
could
occasionally
see
dark
shadows
that
moved
like
monsters
*punct* .
*break*
the
regi
*punct* -
ment
stood
at
rest
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
grew
impatient
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
unendurable
the
way
these
affairs
were
managed
*punct* .
*break*
he
won
*punct* -
dered
how
long
they
were
to
be
kept
waiting
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
looked
all
about
him
and
pondered
upon
the
mystic
gloom
*punct* ,
he
began
to
believe
that
at
any
moment
the
ominous
distance
might
be
aflare
*punct* ,
and
the
rolling
crashes
of
an
engagement
come
to
his
ears
*punct* .
*break*
staring
once
at
the
red
eyes
across
the
river
*punct* ,
he
conceived
them
to
be
grow
*punct* -
ing
larger
*punct* ,
as
the
orbs
of
a
row
of
dragons
ad
*punct* -
vancing
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
toward
the
colonel
and
saw
him
lift
his
gigantic
arm
and
calmly
stroke
his
mustache
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
he
heard
from
along
the
road
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
the
clatter
of
a
horse's
galloping
hoofs
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
be
the
coming
of
orders
*punct* .
*break*
he
bent
forward
*punct* ,
scarce
breathing
*punct* .
*break*
the
exciting
clickety-click
*punct* ,
as
it
grew
louder
and
louder
*punct* ,
seemed
to
be
beating
upon
his
soul
*punct* .
*break*
presently
a
horseman
with
jangling
equipment
drew
rein
be
*punct* -
fore
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
*punct* .
*break*
the
two
held
a
short
*punct* ,
sharp-worded
conversation
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
in
the
foremost
ranks
craned
their
necks
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
horseman
wheeled
his
animal
and
gal
*punct* -
loped
away
he
turned
to
shout
over
his
shoulder
*punct* ,
don't
forget
that
box
of
cigars
*punct* !
*break*
the
colonel
mumbled
in
reply
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
wondered
what
a
box
of
cigars
had
to
do
with
war
*punct* .
*break*
a
moment
later
the
regiment
went
swinging
off
into
the
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
now
like
one
of
those
moving
monsters
wending
with
many
feet
*punct* .
*break*
the
air
was
heavy
*punct* ,
and
cold
with
dew
*punct* .
*break*
a
mass
of
wet
grass
*punct* ,
marched
upon
*punct* ,
rustled
like
silk
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
an
occasional
flash
and
glimmer
of
steel
from
the
backs
of
all
these
huge
crawl
*punct* -
ing
reptiles
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
road
came
creakings
and
grumblings
as
some
surly
guns
were
dragged
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
stumbled
along
still
muttering
specu
*punct* -
lations
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
subdued
debate
*punct* .
*break*
once
a
man
fell
down
*punct* ,
and
as
he
reached
for
his
rifle
a
comrade
*punct* ,
unseeing
*punct* ,
trod
upon
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
he
of
the
injured
fingers
swore
bitterly
and
aloud
*punct* .
*break*
a
low
*punct* ,
tittering
laugh
went
among
his
fellows
*punct* .
*break*
presently
they
passed
into
a
roadway
and
marched
forward
with
easy
strides
*punct* .
*break*
a
dark
regiment
moved
before
them
*punct* ,
and
from
behind
also
came
the
tinkle
of
equipments
on
the
bodies
of
marching
men
*punct* .
*break*
the
rushing
yellow
of
the
developing
day
went
on
behind
their
backs
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
sunrays
at
last
struck
full
and
mellowingly
upon
the
earth
*punct* ,
the
youth
saw
that
the
landscape
was
streaked
with
two
long
*punct* ,
thin
*punct* ,
black
columns
which
disappeared
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
in
front
and
rearward
vanished
in
a
wood
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
like
two
serpents
crawling
from
the
cavern
of
the
night
*punct* .
*break*
the
river
was
not
in
view
*punct* .
*break*
the
tall
soldier
burst
into
praises
of
what
he
thought
to
be
his
powers
of
perception
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
the
tall
one's
companions
cried
with
emphasis
that
they
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
had
evolved
the
same
thing
*punct* ,
and
they
congratulated
themselves
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
were
others
who
said
that
the
tall
one's
plan
was
not
the
true
one
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
they
per
*punct* -
sisted
with
other
theories
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
vigorous
discussion
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
took
no
part
in
them
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
walked
along
in
careless
line
he
was
engaged
with
his
own
eternal
debate
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
hin
*punct* -
der
himself
from
dwelling
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
de
*punct* -
spondent
and
sullen
*punct* ,
and
threw
shifting
glances
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
ahead
*punct* ,
often
expecting
to
hear
from
the
advance
the
rattle
of
firing
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
long
serpents
crawled
slowly
from
hill
to
hill
without
bluster
of
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
a
dun-col
*punct* -
ored
cloud
of
dust
floated
away
to
the
right
*punct* .
*break*
the
sky
overhead
was
of
a
fairy
blue
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
studied
the
faces
of
his
compan
*punct* -
ions
*punct* ,
ever
on
the
watch
to
detect
kindred
emo
*punct* -
tions
*punct* .
*break*
he
suffered
disappointment
*punct* .
*break*
some
ardor
of
the
air
which
was
causing
the
veteran
com
*punct* -
mands
to
move
with
glee
*punct* ,
almost
with
song
*punct* ,
had
infected
the
new
regiment
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
began
to
speak
of
victory
as
of
a
thing
they
knew
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
the
tall
soldier
received
his
vindication
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
certainly
going
to
come
around
in
behind
the
enemy
*punct* .
*break*
they
expressed
commisera
*punct* -
tion
for
that
part
of
the
army
which
had
been
left
upon
the
river
bank
*punct* ,
felicitating
themselves
upon
being
a
part
of
a
blasting
host
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
considering
himself
as
separated
from
the
others
*punct* ,
was
saddened
by
the
blithe
and
merry
speeches
that
went
from
rank
to
rank
*punct* .
*break*
the
company
wags
all
made
their
best
endeav
*punct* -
ors
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
tramped
to
the
tune
of
laughter
*punct* .
*break*
the
blatant
soldier
often
convulsed
whole
files
by
his
biting
sarcasms
aimed
at
the
tall
one
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
was
not
long
before
all
the
men
seemed
to
forget
their
mission
*punct* .
*break*
whole
brigades
grinned
in
unison
*punct* ,
and
regiments
laughed
*punct* .
*break*
a
rather
fat
soldier
attempted
to
pilfer
a
horse
from
a
dooryard
*punct* .
*break*
he
planned
to
load
his
knap
*punct* -
sack
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
escaping
with
his
prize
when
a
young
girl
rushed
from
the
house
and
grabbed
the
animal's
mane
*punct* .
*break*
there
followed
a
wrangle
*punct* .
*break*
the
young
girl
*punct* ,
with
pink
cheeks
and
shining
eyes
*punct* ,
stood
like
a
dauntless
statue
*punct* .
*break*
the
observant
regiment
*punct* ,
standing
at
rest
in
the
roadway
*punct* ,
whooped
at
once
*punct* ,
and
entered
whole-souled
upon
the
side
of
the
maiden
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
became
so
engrossed
in
this
affair
that
they
entirely
ceased
to
remember
their
own
large
war
*punct* .
*break*
they
jeered
the
piratical
private
*punct* ,
and
called
attention
to
various
defects
in
his
personal
ap
*punct* -
pearance
*punct* ;
and
they
were
wildly
enthusiastic
in
support
of
the
young
girl
*punct* .
*break*
to
her
*punct* ,
from
some
distance
*punct* ,
came
bold
advice
*punct* .
*break*
hit
him
with
a
stick
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
crows
and
catcalls
showered
upon
him
when
he
retreated
without
the
horse
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
rejoiced
at
his
downfall
*punct* .
*break*
loud
and
vociferous
congratulations
were
showered
upon
the
maiden
*punct* ,
who
stood
panting
and
regard
*punct* -
ing
the
troops
with
defiance
*punct* .
*break*
at
nightfall
the
column
broke
into
regimental
pieces
*punct* ,
and
the
fragments
went
into
the
fields
to
camp
*punct* .
*break*
tents
sprang
up
like
strange
plants
*punct* .
*break*
camp
fires
*punct* ,
like
red
*punct* ,
peculiar
blossoms
*punct* ,
dotted
the
night
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
kept
from
intercourse
with
his
companions
as
much
as
circumstances
would
allow
him
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
evening
he
wandered
a
few
paces
into
the
gloom
*punct* .
*break*
from
this
little
distance
the
many
fires
*punct* ,
with
the
black
forms
of
men
pass
*punct* -
ing
to
and
fro
before
the
crimson
rays
*punct* ,
made
weird
and
satanic
effects
*punct* .
*break*
he
lay
down
in
the
grass
*punct* .
*break*
the
blades
pressed
tenderly
against
his
cheek
*punct* .
*break*
the
moon
had
been
lighted
and
was
hung
in
a
treetop
*punct* .
*break*
the
liquid
stillness
of
the
night
enveloping
him
made
him
feel
vast
pity
for
himself
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
caress
in
the
soft
winds
*punct* ;
and
the
whole
mood
of
the
darkness
*punct* ,
he
thought
*punct* ,
was
one
of
sympathy
for
himself
in
his
distress
*punct* .
*break*
he
wished
*punct* ,
without
reserve
*punct* ,
that
he
was
at
home
again
making
the
endless
rounds
from
the
house
to
the
barn
*punct* ,
from
the
barn
to
the
fields
*punct* ,
from
the
fields
to
the
barn
*punct* ,
from
the
barn
to
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
he
remembered
he
had
often
cursed
the
brindle
cow
and
her
mates
*punct* ,
and
had
sometimes
flung
milking
stools
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
from
his
present
point
of
view
*punct* ,
there
was
a
halo
of
happiness
about
each
of
their
heads
*punct* ,
and
he
would
have
sacrificed
all
the
brass
buttons
on
the
continent
to
have
been
enabled
to
return
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
he
told
himself
that
he
was
not
formed
for
a
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
mused
seriously
upon
the
radical
differences
between
himself
and
those
men
who
were
dodging
imp
*punct* -
like
around
the
fires
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
mused
thus
he
heard
the
rustle
of
grass
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
upon
turning
his
head
*punct* ,
discovered
the
loud
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
he
called
out
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
wilson
*punct* !
*break*
the
latter
approached
and
looked
down
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
hello
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ;
is
it
you
*punct* ?
*break*
what
you
do
*punct* -
ing
here
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
thinking
*punct* ,
said
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
the
other
sat
down
and
carefully
lighted
his
pipe
*punct* .
*break*
you're
getting
blue
*punct* ,
my
boy
*punct* .
*break*
you're
looking
thundering
peeked
*punct* .
*break*
what
the
dickens
is
wrong
with
you
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
nothing
*punct* ,
said
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
the
loud
soldier
launched
then
into
the
sub
*punct* -
ject
of
the
anticipated
fight
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
we've
got
em
now
*punct* !
*break*
as
he
spoke
his
boyish
face
was
wreathed
in
a
gleeful
smile
*punct* ,
and
his
voice
had
an
exultant
ring
*punct* .
*break*
we've
got
em
now
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
by
the
eternal
thunders
*punct* ,
we'll
lick
em
good
*punct* !
*break*
if
the
truth
was
known
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* ,
more
soberly
*punct* ,
they've
licked
us
about
every
clip
up
to
now
*punct* ;
but
this
time
*punct* ,
this
time
*punct* ,
we'll
lick
em
good
*punct* !
*break*
i
thought
you
was
objecting
to
this
march
a
little
while
ago
*punct* ,
said
the
youth
coldly
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
it
wasn't
that
*punct* ,
explained
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
mind
marching
*punct* ,
if
there's
going
to
be
fight
*punct* -
ing
at
the
end
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
what
i
hate
is
this
getting
moved
here
and
moved
there
*punct* ,
with
no
good
com
*punct* -
ing
of
it
*punct* ,
as
far
as
i
can
see
*punct* ,
excepting
sore
feet
and
damned
short
rations
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
jim
conklin
says
we'll
get
a
plenty
of
fighting
this
time
*punct* .
*break*
he's
right
for
once
*punct* ,
i
guess
*punct* ,
though
i
can't
see
how
it
come
*punct* .
*break*
this
time
we're
in
for
a
big
battle
*punct* ,
and
we've
got
the
best
end
of
it
*punct* ,
certain
sure
*punct* .
*break*
how
we
will
thump
em
*punct* !
*break*
he
arose
and
began
to
pace
to
and
fro
excit
*punct* -
edly
*punct* .
*break*
the
thrill
of
his
enthusiasm
made
him
walk
with
an
elastic
step
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
sprightly
*punct* ,
vigorous
*punct* ,
fiery
in
his
belief
in
success
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
into
the
future
with
clear
*punct* ,
proud
eye
*punct* ,
and
he
swore
with
the
air
of
an
old
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
watched
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
finally
spoke
his
voice
was
as
bitter
as
dregs
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
you're
going
to
do
great
things
*punct* ,
i
s'pose
*punct* !
*break*
the
loud
soldier
blew
a
thoughtful
cloud
of
smoke
from
his
pipe
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
i
don't
know
*punct* ,
he
remarked
with
dignity
*punct* ;
i
don't
know
*punct* .
*break*
i
s'pose
i'll
do
as
well
as
the
rest
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
going
to
try
like
thunder
*punct* .
*break*
he
evidently
complimented
himself
upon
the
modesty
of
this
statement
*punct* .
*break*
how
do
you
know
you
won't
run
when
the
time
comes
*punct* ?
*break*
asked
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
loud
one
*punct* ;
run?
*punct* ,
of
course
not
*punct* !
*break*
well
*punct* ,
continued
the
youth
*punct* ,
lots
of
good
*punct* -
a-'nough
men
have
thought
they
was
going
to
do
great
things
before
the
fight
*punct* ,
but
when
the
time
come
they
skedaddled
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
that's
all
true
*punct* ,
i
s'pose
*punct* ,
replied
the
other
*punct* ;
but
i'm
not
going
to
skedaddle
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
that
bets
on
my
running
will
lose
his
money
*punct* ,
that's
all
*punct* .
*break*
he
nodded
confidently
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
shucks
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
you
ain't
the
bravest
man
in
the
world
*punct* ,
are
you
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
ain't
*punct* ,
exclaimed
the
loud
soldier
in
*punct* -
dignantly
*punct* ;
and
i
didn't
say
i
was
the
bravest
man
in
the
world
*punct* ,
neither
*punct* .
*break*
i
said
i
was
going
to
do
my
share
of
fighting
*punct* ,
that's
what
i
said
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
am
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
who
are
you
*punct* ,
anyhow
*punct* .
*break*
you
talk
as
if
you
thought
you
was
napoleon
bonaparte
*punct* .
*break*
he
glared
at
the
youth
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
and
then
strode
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
called
in
a
savage
voice
after
his
comrade
*punct* :
well
*punct* ,
you
needn't
git
mad
about
it
*punct* !
*break*
but
the
other
continued
on
his
way
and
made
no
reply
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
alone
in
space
when
his
injured
com
*punct* -
rade
had
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
his
failure
to
discover
any
mite
of
resemblance
in
their
view
points
made
him
more
miserable
than
before
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
seemed
to
be
wrestling
with
such
a
terrific
per
*punct* -
sonal
problem
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
mental
outcast
*punct* .
*break*
he
went
slowly
to
his
tent
and
stretched
him
*punct* -
self
on
a
blanket
by
the
side
of
the
snoring
tall
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
darkness
he
saw
visions
of
a
thou
*punct* -
sand-tongued
fear
that
would
babble
at
his
back
and
cause
him
to
flee
*punct* ,
while
others
were
going
coolly
about
their
country's
business
*punct* .
*break*
he
admit
*punct* -
ted
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
cope
with
this
monster
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
that
every
nerve
in
his
body
would
be
an
ear
to
hear
the
voices
*punct* ,
while
other
men
would
remain
stolid
and
deaf
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
he
sweated
with
the
pain
of
these
thoughts
*punct* ,
he
could
hear
low
*punct* ,
serene
sentences
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
bid
five
*punct* .
*break*
make
it
six
*punct* .
*break*
he
stared
at
the
red
*punct* ,
shivering
reflection
of
a
fire
on
the
white
wall
of
his
tent
until
*punct* ,
ex
*punct* -
hausted
and
ill
from
the
monotony
of
his
suf
*punct* -
fering
*punct* ,
he
fell
asleep
*punct* .
*break*
when
another
night
came
the
columns
*punct* ,
changed
to
purple
streaks
*punct* ,
filed
across
two
pon
*punct* -
toon
bridges
*punct* .
*break*
a
glaring
fire
wine-tinted
the
waters
of
the
river
*punct* .
*break*
its
rays
*punct* ,
shining
upon
the
moving
masses
of
troops
*punct* ,
brought
forth
here
and
there
sudden
gleams
of
silver
or
gold
*punct* .
*break*
upon
the
other
shore
a
dark
and
mysterious
range
of
hills
was
curved
against
the
sky
*punct* .
*break*
the
insect
voices
of
the
night
sang
solemnly
*punct* .
*break*
after
this
crossing
the
youth
assured
himself
that
at
any
moment
they
might
be
suddenly
and
fearfully
assaulted
from
the
caves
of
the
lowering
woods
*punct* .
*break*
he
kept
his
eyes
watchfully
upon
the
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
regiment
went
unmolested
to
a
camp
*punct* -
ing
place
*punct* ,
and
its
soldiers
slept
the
brave
sleep
of
wearied
men
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
morning
they
were
routed
out
with
early
energy
*punct* ,
and
hustled
along
a
narrow
road
that
led
deep
into
the
forest
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
during
this
rapid
march
that
the
regi
*punct* -
32
ment
lost
many
of
the
marks
of
a
new
com
*punct* -
mand
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
had
begun
to
count
the
miles
upon
their
fingers
*punct* ,
and
they
grew
tired
*punct* .
*break*
sore
feet
an
damned
short
rations
*punct* ,
that's
all
*punct* ,
said
the
loud
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
perspiration
and
grum
*punct* -
blings
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
time
they
began
to
shed
their
knapsacks
*punct* .
*break*
some
tossed
them
unconcernedly
down
*punct* ;
others
hid
them
carefully
*punct* ,
asserting
their
plans
to
return
for
them
at
some
convenient
time
*punct* .
*break*
men
extricated
themselves
from
thick
shirts
*punct* .
*break*
presently
few
carried
anything
but
their
necessary
clothing
*punct* ,
blankets
*punct* ,
haversacks
*punct* ,
canteens
*punct* ,
and
arms
and
ammunition
*punct* .
*break*
you
can
now
eat
and
shoot
*punct* ,
said
the
tall
soldier
to
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
that's
all
you
want
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
sudden
change
from
the
ponderous
infantry
of
theory
to
the
light
and
speedy
infantry
of
practice
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
*punct* ,
relieved
of
a
burden
*punct* ,
received
a
new
impetus
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
was
much
loss
of
valuable
knapsacks
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
on
the
whole
*punct* ,
very
good
shirts
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
regiment
was
not
yet
veteranlike
in
appearance
*punct* .
*break*
veteran
regiments
in
the
army
were
likely
to
be
very
small
aggregations
of
men
*punct* .
*break*
once
*punct* ,
when
the
command
had
first
come
to
the
field
*punct* ,
some
perambulating
veterans
*punct* ,
noting
the
length
of
their
column
*punct* ,
had
accosted
them
thus
*punct* :
hey
*punct* ,
fellers
*punct* ,
what
brigade
is
that
*punct* ?
*break*
and
when
the
men
had
replied
that
they
formed
a
regiment
and
not
a
brigade
*punct* ,
the
older
soldiers
had
laughed
*punct* ,
and
said
*punct* ,
o
gawd
*punct* !
*break*
also
*punct* ,
there
was
too
great
a
similarity
in
the
hats
*punct* .
*break*
the
hats
of
a
regiment
should
properly
represent
the
history
of
headgear
for
a
period
of
years
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
there
were
no
letters
of
faded
gold
speaking
from
the
colors
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
new
and
beautiful
*punct* ,
and
the
color
bearer
habitu
*punct* -
ally
oiled
the
pole
*punct* .
*break*
presently
the
army
again
sat
down
to
think
*punct* .
*break*
the
odor
of
the
peaceful
pines
was
in
the
men's
nostrils
*punct* .
*break*
the
sound
of
monotonous
axe
blows
rang
through
the
forest
*punct* ,
and
the
insects
*punct* ,
nodding
upon
their
perches
*punct* ,
crooned
like
old
women
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
returned
to
his
theory
of
a
blue
dem
*punct* -
onstration
*punct* .
*break*
one
gray
dawn
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
was
kicked
in
the
leg
by
the
tall
soldier
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
before
he
was
entirely
awake
*punct* ,
he
found
himself
running
down
a
wood
road
in
the
midst
of
men
who
were
panting
from
the
first
effects
of
speed
*punct* .
*break*
his
can
*punct* -
teen
banged
rhythmically
upon
his
thigh
*punct* ,
and
his
haversack
bobbed
softly
*punct* .
*break*
his
musket
bounced
a
trifle
from
his
shoulder
at
each
stride
and
made
his
cap
feel
uncertain
upon
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
hear
the
men
whisper
jerky
sen
*punct* -
tences
*punct* :
say
*punct* ,
what's
all
this
*punct* ,
about
*punct* ?
*break*
what
th
thunder
*punct* ,
we
*punct* ,
skedaddlin
this
way
fer
*punct* ?
*break*
yeh
run
*punct* ,
like
a
cow
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
loud
soldier's
shrill
voice
could
be
heard
*punct* :
what
th
devil
they
in
sich
a
hurry
for
*punct* ?
*break*
the
youth
thought
the
damp
fog
of
early
morning
moved
from
the
rush
of
a
great
body
of
troops
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
distance
came
a
sudden
spatter
of
firing
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
bewildered
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
ran
with
his
com
*punct* -
rades
he
strenuously
tried
to
think
*punct* ,
but
all
he
knew
was
that
if
he
fell
down
those
coming
behind
would
tread
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
all
his
faculties
seemed
to
be
needed
to
guide
him
over
and
past
obstruc
*punct* -
tions
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
carried
along
by
a
mob
*punct* .
*break*
the
sun
spread
disclosing
rays
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
one
by
one
*punct* ,
regiments
burst
into
view
like
armed
men
just
born
of
the
earth
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
perceived
that
the
time
had
come
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
about
to
be
measured
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
he
felt
in
the
face
of
his
great
trial
like
a
babe
*punct* ,
and
the
flesh
over
his
heart
seemed
very
thin
*punct* .
*break*
he
seized
time
to
look
about
him
calculatingly
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
instantly
saw
that
it
would
be
impossi
*punct* -
ble
for
him
to
escape
from
the
regiment
*punct* .
*break*
it
in
*punct* -
closed
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
were
iron
laws
of
tradi
*punct* -
tion
and
law
on
four
sides
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
in
a
moving
box
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
perceived
this
fact
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
had
never
wished
to
come
to
the
war
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
not
enlisted
of
his
free
will
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
dragged
by
the
merciless
government
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
they
were
taking
him
out
to
be
slaughtered
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
slid
down
a
bank
and
wallowed
across
a
little
stream
*punct* .
*break*
the
mournful
current
moved
slowly
on
*punct* ,
and
from
the
water
*punct* ,
shaded
black
*punct* ,
some
white
bubble
eyes
looked
at
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
as
they
climbed
the
hill
on
the
farther
side
artillery
began
to
boom
*punct* .
*break*
here
the
youth
forgot
many
things
as
he
felt
a
sudden
impulse
of
curi
*punct* -
osity
*punct* .
*break*
he
scrambled
up
the
bank
with
a
speed
that
could
not
be
exceeded
by
a
bloodthirsty
man
*punct* .
*break*
he
expected
a
battle
scene
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
some
little
fields
girted
and
squeezed
by
a
forest
*punct* .
*break*
spread
over
the
grass
and
in
among
the
tree
trunks
*punct* ,
he
could
see
knots
and
waving
lines
of
skirmishers
who
were
running
hither
and
thither
and
firing
at
the
landscape
*punct* .
*break*
a
dark
battle
line
lay
upon
a
sunstruck
clearing
that
gleamed
orange
color
*punct* .
*break*
a
flag
fluttered
*punct* .
*break*
other
regiments
floundered
up
the
bank
*punct* .
*break*
the
brigade
was
formed
in
line
of
battle
*punct* ,
and
after
a
pause
started
slowly
through
the
woods
in
the
rear
of
the
receding
skirmishers
*punct* ,
who
were
con
*punct* -
tinually
melting
into
the
scene
to
appear
again
farther
on
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
always
busy
as
bees
*punct* ,
deeply
absorbed
in
their
little
combats
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
tried
to
observe
everything
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
use
care
to
avoid
trees
and
branches
*punct* ,
and
his
forgotten
feet
were
constantly
knocking
against
stones
or
getting
entangled
in
briers
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
aware
that
these
battalions
with
their
commotions
were
woven
red
and
startling
into
the
gentle
fabric
of
softened
greens
and
browns
*punct* .
*break*
it
looked
to
be
a
wrong
place
for
a
battle
field
*punct* .
*break*
the
skirmishers
in
advance
fascinated
him
*punct* .
*break*
their
shots
into
thickets
and
at
distant
and
prominent
trees
spoke
to
him
of
tragedies
*punct* ,
hid
*punct* -
den
*punct* ,
mysterious
*punct* ,
solemn
*punct* .
*break*
once
the
line
encountered
the
body
of
a
dead
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
he
lay
upon
his
back
staring
at
the
sky
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
dressed
in
an
awkward
suit
of
yellowish
brown
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
could
see
that
the
soles
of
his
shoes
had
been
worn
to
the
thinness
of
writing
paper
*punct* ,
and
from
a
great
rent
in
one
the
dead
foot
projected
piteously
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
was
as
if
fate
had
betrayed
the
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
in
death
it
exposed
to
his
enemies
that
poverty
which
in
life
he
had
perhaps
concealed
from
his
friends
*punct* .
*break*
the
ranks
opened
covertly
to
avoid
the
corpse
*punct* .
*break*
the
invulnerable
dead
man
forced
a
way
for
him
*punct* -
self
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
looked
keenly
at
the
ashen
face
*punct* .
*break*
the
wind
raised
the
tawny
beard
*punct* .
*break*
it
moved
as
if
a
hand
were
stroking
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
vaguely
desired
to
walk
around
and
around
the
body
and
stare
*punct* ;
the
impulse
of
the
living
to
try
to
read
in
dead
eyes
the
answer
to
the
question
*punct* .
*break*
during
the
march
the
ardor
which
the
youth
had
acquired
when
out
of
view
of
the
field
rapidly
faded
to
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
his
curiosity
was
quite
easily
satisfied
*punct* .
*break*
if
an
intense
scene
had
caught
him
with
its
wild
swing
as
he
came
to
the
top
of
the
bank
*punct* ,
he
might
have
gone
roaring
on
*punct* .
*break*
this
advance
upon
nature
was
too
calm
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
opportunity
to
reflect
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
time
in
which
to
wonder
about
himself
and
to
attempt
to
probe
his
sensa
*punct* -
tions
*punct* .
*break*
absurd
ideas
took
hold
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
that
he
did
not
relish
the
landscape
*punct* .
*break*
it
threatened
him
*punct* .
*break*
a
coldness
swept
over
his
back
*punct* ,
and
it
is
true
that
his
trousers
felt
to
him
that
they
were
no
fit
for
his
legs
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
a
house
standing
placidly
in
distant
fields
had
to
him
an
ominous
look
*punct* .
*break*
the
shadows
of
the
woods
were
formidable
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
certain
that
in
this
vista
there
lurked
fierce-eyed
hosts
*punct* .
*break*
the
swift
thought
came
to
him
that
the
generals
did
not
know
what
they
were
about
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
all
a
trap
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
those
close
forests
would
bristle
with
rifle
barrels
*punct* .
*break*
ironlike
brigades
would
ap
*punct* -
pear
in
the
rear
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
all
going
to
be
sacrificed
*punct* .
*break*
the
generals
were
stupids
*punct* .
*break*
the
enemy
would
presently
swallow
the
whole
com
*punct* -
mand
*punct* .
*break*
he
glared
about
him
*punct* ,
expecting
to
see
the
stealthy
approach
of
his
death
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
that
he
must
break
from
the
ranks
and
harangue
his
comrades
*punct* .
*break*
they
must
not
all
be
killed
like
pigs
*punct* ;
and
he
was
sure
it
would
come
to
pass
unless
they
were
informed
of
these
dangers
*punct* .
*break*
the
generals
were
idiots
to
send
them
marching
into
a
regular
pen
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
but
one
pair
of
eyes
in
the
corps
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
step
forth
and
make
a
speech
*punct* .
*break*
shrill
and
passionate
words
came
to
his
lips
*punct* .
*break*
the
line
*punct* ,
broken
into
moving
fragments
by
the
ground
*punct* ,
went
calmly
on
through
fields
and
woods
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
looked
at
the
men
nearest
him
*punct* ,
and
saw
*punct* ,
for
the
most
part
*punct* ,
expressions
of
deep
inter
*punct* -
est
*punct* ,
as
if
they
were
investigating
something
that
had
fascinated
them
*punct* .
*break*
one
or
two
stepped
with
overvaliant
airs
as
if
they
were
already
plunged
into
war
*punct* .
*break*
others
walked
as
upon
thin
ice
*punct* .
*break*
the
greater
part
of
the
untested
men
appeared
quiet
and
absorbed
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
going
to
look
at
war
*punct* ,
the
red
animal
*punct* ,
war
*punct* ,
the
blood-swollen
god
*punct* .
*break*
and
they
were
deeply
engrossed
in
this
march
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
looked
the
youth
gripped
his
outcry
at
his
throat
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
that
even
if
the
men
were
tottering
with
fear
they
would
laugh
at
his
warn
*punct* -
ing
*punct* .
*break*
they
would
jeer
him
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
if
practicable
*punct* ,
pelt
him
with
missiles
*punct* .
*break*
admitting
that
he
might
be
wrong
*punct* ,
a
frenzied
declamation
of
the
kind
would
turn
him
into
a
worm
*punct* .
*break*
he
assumed
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
the
demeanor
of
one
who
knows
that
he
is
doomed
alone
to
unwritten
re
*punct* -
sponsibilities
*punct* .
*break*
he
lagged
*punct* ,
with
tragic
glances
at
the
sky
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
surprised
presently
by
the
young
lieu
*punct* -
tenant
of
his
company
*punct* ,
who
began
heartily
to
beat
him
with
a
sword
*punct* ,
calling
out
in
a
loud
and
insolent
voice
*punct* :
come
*punct* ,
young
man
*punct* ,
get
up
into
ranks
there
*punct* .
*break*
no
skulking'll
do
here
*punct* .
*break*
he
mend
*punct* -
ed
his
pace
with
suitable
haste
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
hated
the
lieutenant
*punct* ,
who
had
no
appreciation
of
fine
minds
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
mere
brute
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
time
the
brigade
was
halted
in
the
cathedral
light
of
a
forest
*punct* .
*break*
the
busy
skirmish
*punct* -
ers
were
still
popping
*punct* .
*break*
through
the
aisles
of
the
wood
could
be
seen
the
floating
smoke
from
their
rifles
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
it
went
up
in
little
balls
*punct* ,
white
and
compact
*punct* .
*break*
during
this
halt
many
men
in
the
regiment
began
erecting
tiny
hills
in
front
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
used
stones
*punct* ,
sticks
*punct* ,
earth
*punct* ,
and
anything
they
thought
might
turn
a
bullet
*punct* .
*break*
some
built
com
*punct* -
paratively
large
ones
*punct* ,
while
others
seemed
con
*punct* -
tent
with
little
ones
*punct* .
*break*
this
procedure
caused
a
discussion
among
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
some
wished
to
fight
like
duelists
*punct* ,
believ
*punct* -
ing
it
to
be
correct
to
stand
erect
and
be
*punct* ,
from
their
feet
to
their
foreheads
*punct* ,
a
mark
*punct* .
*break*
they
said
they
scorned
the
devices
of
the
cautious
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
others
scoffed
in
reply
*punct* ,
and
pointed
to
the
veterans
on
the
flanks
who
were
digging
at
the
ground
like
terriers
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
short
time
there
was
quite
a
barricade
along
the
regimental
fronts
*punct* .
*break*
directly
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
they
were
ordered
to
with
*punct* -
draw
from
that
place
*punct* .
*break*
this
astounded
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
he
forgot
his
stewing
over
the
advance
movement
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
what
did
they
march
us
out
here
for
*punct* ?
*break*
he
demanded
of
the
tall
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
the
latter
with
calm
faith
began
a
heavy
explanation
*punct* ,
although
he
had
been
compelled
to
leave
a
little
protection
of
stones
and
dirt
to
which
he
had
devoted
much
care
and
skill
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
regiment
was
aligned
in
another
position
each
man's
regard
for
his
safety
caused
another
line
of
small
intrenchments
*punct* .
*break*
they
ate
their
noon
meal
behind
a
third
one
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
moved
from
this
one
also
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
marched
from
place
to
place
with
apparent
aimlessness
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
had
been
taught
that
a
man
be
*punct* -
came
another
thing
in
a
battle
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
his
sal
*punct* -
vation
in
such
a
change
*punct* .
*break*
hence
this
waiting
was
an
ordeal
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
in
a
fever
of
im
*punct* -
patience
*punct* .
*break*
he
considered
that
there
was
denoted
a
lack
of
purpose
on
the
part
of
the
generals
*punct* .
*break*
he
began
to
complain
to
the
tall
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
i
can't
stand
this
much
longer
*punct* ,
he
cried
*punct* .
*break*
he
wished
to
return
to
camp
*punct* ,
knowing
that
this
affair
was
a
blue
demonstration
*punct* ;
or
else
to
go
into
a
battle
and
discover
that
he
had
been
a
fool
in
his
doubts
*punct* ,
and
was
*punct* ,
in
truth
*punct* ,
a
man
of
traditional
courage
*punct* .
*break*
the
strain
of
present
circumstances
he
felt
to
be
intolerable
*punct* .
*break*
the
philosophical
tall
soldier
measured
a
sand
*punct* -
wich
of
cracker
and
pork
and
swallowed
it
in
a
nonchalant
manner
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
i
suppose
we
must
go
reconnoitering
around
the
country
jest
to
keep
em
from
getting
too
close
*punct* ,
or
to
develop
em
*punct* ,
or
something
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
loud
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
cried
the
youth
*punct* ,
still
fidgeting
*punct* ,
i'd
rather
do
anything
most
than
go
tramping
round
the
country
all
day
doing
no
good
to
nobody
and
jest
tiring
ourselves
out
*punct* .
*break*
so
would
i
*punct* ,
said
the
loud
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
it
ain't
right
*punct* .
*break*
i
tell
you
if
anybody
with
any
sense
was
a-runnin
this
army
it
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
shut
up
*punct* !
*break*
roared
the
tall
private
*punct* .
*break*
you
little
fool
*punct* .
*break*
you
little
damn
cuss
*punct* .
*break*
you
ain't
had
that
there
coat
and
them
pants
on
for
six
months
*punct* ,
and
yet
you
talk
as
if
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
i
wanta
do
some
fighting
anyway
*punct* ,
interrupted
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
i
didn't
come
here
to
walk
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
ave
walked
to
home
*punct* ,
'round
an
round
the
barn
*punct* ,
if
i
jest
wanted
to
walk
*punct* .
*break*
the
tall
one
*punct* ,
red-faced
*punct* ,
swallowed
another
sandwich
as
if
taking
poison
in
despair
*punct* .
*break*
but
gradually
*punct* ,
as
he
chewed
*punct* ,
his
face
became
again
quiet
and
contented
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
rage
in
fierce
argument
in
the
presence
of
such
sand
*punct* -
wiches
*punct* .
*break*
during
his
meals
he
always
wore
an
air
of
blissful
contemplation
of
the
food
he
had
swal
*punct* -
lowed
*punct* .
*break*
his
spirit
seemed
then
to
be
communing
with
the
viands
*punct* .
*break*
he
accepted
new
environment
and
circum
*punct* -
stance
with
great
coolness
*punct* ,
eating
from
his
haver
*punct* -
sack
at
every
opportunity
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
march
he
went
along
with
the
stride
of
a
hunter
*punct* ,
object
*punct* -
ing
to
neither
gait
nor
distance
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
had
not
raised
his
voice
when
he
had
been
ordered
away
from
three
little
protective
piles
of
earth
and
stone
*punct* ,
each
of
which
had
been
an
engineer
*punct* -
ing
feat
worthy
of
being
made
sacred
to
the
name
of
his
grandmother
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
afternoon
the
regiment
went
out
over
the
same
ground
it
had
taken
in
the
morn
*punct* -
ing
*punct* .
*break*
the
landscape
then
ceased
to
threaten
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
close
to
it
and
become
familiar
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
when
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
they
began
to
pass
into
a
new
region
*punct* ,
his
old
fears
of
stupidity
and
in
*punct* -
competence
reassailed
him
*punct* ,
but
this
time
he
dog
*punct* -
gedly
let
them
babble
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
occupied
with
his
problem
*punct* ,
and
in
his
desperation
he
concluded
that
the
stupidity
did
not
greatly
matter
*punct* .
*break*
once
he
thought
he
had
concluded
that
it
would
be
better
to
get
killed
directly
and
end
his
troubles
*punct* .
*break*
regarding
death
thus
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
*punct* ,
he
conceived
it
to
be
noth
*punct* -
ing
but
rest
*punct* ,
and
he
was
filled
with
a
momen
*punct* -
tary
astonishment
that
he
should
have
made
an
extraordinary
commotion
over
the
mere
matter
of
getting
killed
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
die
*punct* ;
he
would
go
to
some
place
where
he
would
be
understood
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
useless
to
expect
appreciation
of
his
pro
*punct* -
found
and
fine
senses
from
such
men
as
the
lieu
*punct* -
tenant
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
look
to
the
grave
for
compre
*punct* -
hension
*punct* .
*break*
the
skirmish
fire
increased
to
a
long
chatter
*punct* -
ing
sound
*punct* .
*break*
with
it
was
mingled
far-away
cheer
*punct* -
ing
*punct* .
*break*
a
battery
spoke
*punct* .
*break*
directly
the
youth
would
see
the
skirmishers
running
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
pursued
by
the
sound
of
musketry
fire
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
time
the
hot
*punct* ,
dangerous
flashes
of
the
rifles
were
visible
*punct* .
*break*
smoke
clouds
went
slowly
and
insolently
across
the
fields
like
observant
phantoms
*punct* .
*break*
the
din
became
crescendo
*punct* ,
like
the
roar
of
an
oncoming
train
*punct* .
*break*
a
brigade
ahead
of
them
and
on
the
right
went
into
action
with
a
rending
roar
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
as
if
it
had
exploded
*punct* .
*break*
and
thereafter
it
lay
stretched
in
the
distance
behind
a
long
gray
wall
*punct* ,
that
one
was
obliged
to
look
twice
at
to
make
sure
that
it
was
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
forgetting
his
neat
plan
of
getting
killed
*punct* ,
gazed
spell
bound
*punct* .
*break*
his
eyes
grew
wide
and
busy
with
the
action
of
the
scene
*punct* .
*break*
his
mouth
was
a
little
ways
open
*punct* .
*break*
of
a
sudden
he
felt
a
heavy
and
sad
hand
laid
upon
his
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
awakening
from
his
trance
of
observation
he
turned
and
beheld
the
loud
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
it's
my
first
and
last
battle
*punct* ,
old
boy
*punct* ,
said
the
latter
*punct* ,
with
intense
gloom
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
quite
pale
and
his
girlish
lip
was
trembling
*punct* .
*break*
murmured
the
youth
in
great
aston
*punct* -
ishment
*punct* .
*break*
it's
my
first
and

old

continued
the
loud
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
something

*break*
he
ended
in
a
quavering
sob
of
pity
for
himself
*punct* .
*break*
he
handed
the
youth
a
little
packet
done
up
in
a
yellow
envelope
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
what
the
devil
*punct* ,
began
the
youth
again
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
other
gave
him
a
glance
as
from
the
depths
of
a
tomb
*punct* ,
and
raised
his
limp
hand
in
a
prophetic
manner
and
turned
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
brigade
was
halted
in
the
fringe
of
a
grove
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
crouched
among
the
trees
and
pointed
their
restless
guns
out
at
the
fields
*punct* .
*break*
they
tried
to
look
beyond
the
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
out
of
this
haze
they
could
see
running
men
*punct* .
*break*
some
shouted
information
and
gestured
as
they
hurried
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
of
the
new
regiment
watched
and
listened
eagerly
*punct* ,
while
their
tongues
ran
on
in
gossip
of
the
battle
*punct* .
*break*
they
mouthed
rumors
that
had
flown
like
birds
out
of
the
unknown
*punct* .
*break*
they
say
perry

what
he
was
*punct* .
*break*
three
fingers
was
crunched
*punct* .
*break*
he's
a
funny
feller
*punct* .
*break*
the
din
in
front
swelled
to
a
tremendous
chorus
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
and
his
fellows
were
frozen
to
silence
*punct* .
*break*
they
could
see
a
flag
that
tossed
in
the
smoke
angrily
*punct* .
*break*
near
it
were
the
blurred
and
agitated
forms
of
troops
*punct* .
*break*
there
came
a
turbulent
stream
of
men
across
the
fields
*punct* .
*break*
a
battery
chang
*punct* -
ing
position
at
a
frantic
gallop
scattered
the
stragglers
right
and
left
*punct* .
*break*
a
shell
screaming
like
a
storm
banshee
went
over
the
huddled
heads
of
the
reserves
*punct* .
*break*
it
landed
in
the
grove
*punct* ,
and
exploding
redly
flung
the
brown
earth
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
little
shower
of
pine
needles
*punct* .
*break*
bullets
began
to
whistle
among
the
branches
and
nip
at
the
trees
*punct* .
*break*
twigs
and
leaves
came
sailing
down
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
as
if
a
thousand
axes
*punct* ,
wee
and
invisible
*punct* ,
were
being
wielded
*punct* .
*break*
many
of
the
men
were
constantly
dodging
and
ducking
their
heads
*punct* .
*break*
the
lieutenant
of
the
youth's
company
was
shot
in
the
hand
*punct* .
*break*
he
began
to
swear
so
won
*punct* -
drously
that
a
nervous
laugh
went
along
the
regi
*punct* -
mental
line
*punct* .
*break*
the
officer's
profanity
sounded
conventional
*punct* .
*break*
it
relieved
the
tightened
senses
of
the
new
men
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
as
if
he
had
hit
his
fingers
with
a
tack
hammer
at
home
*punct* .
*break*
he
held
the
wounded
member
carefully
away
from
his
side
so
that
the
blood
would
not
drip
upon
his
trousers
*punct* .
*break*
the
captain
of
the
company
*punct* ,
tucking
his
sword
under
his
arm
*punct* ,
produced
a
handkerchief
and
began
to
bind
with
it
the
lieutenant's
wound
*punct* .
*break*
and
they
disputed
as
to
how
the
binding
should
be
done
*punct* .
*break*
the
battle
flag
in
the
distance
jerked
about
madly
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
to
be
struggling
to
free
itself
from
an
agony
*punct* .
*break*
the
billowing
smoke
was
filled
with
horizontal
flashes
*punct* .
*break*
men
running
swiftly
emerged
from
it
*punct* .
*break*
they
grew
in
numbers
until
it
was
seen
that
the
whole
command
was
fleeing
*punct* .
*break*
the
flag
suddenly
sank
down
as
if
dying
*punct* .
*break*
its
motion
as
it
fell
was
a
gesture
of
despair
*punct* .
*break*
wild
yells
came
from
behind
the
walls
of
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
a
sketch
in
gray
and
red
dissolved
into
a
moblike
body
of
men
who
galloped
like
wild
horses
*punct* .
*break*
the
veteran
regiments
on
the
right
and
left
of
the
304th
immediately
began
to
jeer
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
passionate
song
of
the
bullets
and
the
banshee
shrieks
of
shells
were
mingled
loud
catcalls
and
bits
of
facetious
advice
concerning
places
of
safety
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
new
regiment
was
breathless
with
hor
*punct* -
ror
*punct* .
*break*
saunders's
got
crushed
*punct* !
*break*
whis
*punct* -
pered
the
man
at
the
youth's
elbow
*punct* .
*break*
they
shrank
back
and
crouched
as
if
compelled
to
await
a
flood
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
shot
a
swift
glance
along
the
blue
ranks
of
the
regiment
*punct* .
*break*
the
profiles
were
motion
*punct* -
less
*punct* ,
carven
*punct* ;
and
afterward
he
remembered
that
the
color
sergeant
was
standing
with
his
legs
apart
*punct* ,
as
if
he
expected
to
be
pushed
to
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
the
following
throng
went
whirling
around
the
flank
*punct* .
*break*
here
and
there
were
officers
carried
along
on
the
stream
like
exasperated
chips
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
striking
about
them
with
their
swords
and
with
their
left
fists
*punct* ,
punching
every
head
they
could
reach
*punct* .
*break*
they
cursed
like
highway
*punct* -
men
*punct* .
*break*
a
mounted
officer
displayed
the
furious
anger
of
a
spoiled
child
*punct* .
*break*
he
raged
with
his
head
*punct* ,
his
arms
*punct* ,
and
his
legs
*punct* .
*break*
another
*punct* ,
the
commander
of
the
brigade
*punct* ,
was
galloping
about
bawling
*punct* .
*break*
his
hat
was
gone
and
his
clothes
were
awry
*punct* .
*break*
he
resembled
a
man
who
has
come
from
bed
to
go
to
a
fire
*punct* .
*break*
the
hoofs
of
his
horse
often
threatened
the
heads
of
the
running
men
*punct* ,
but
they
scampered
with
sin
*punct* -
gular
fortune
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
rush
they
were
apparently
all
deaf
and
blind
*punct* .
*break*
they
heeded
not
the
largest
and
longest
of
the
oaths
that
were
thrown
at
them
from
all
directions
*punct* .
*break*
frequently
over
this
tumult
could
be
heard
the
grim
jokes
of
the
critical
veterans
*punct* ;
but
the
retreating
men
apparently
were
not
even
con
*punct* -
scious
of
the
presence
of
an
audience
*punct* .
*break*
the
battle
reflection
that
shone
for
an
instant
in
the
faces
on
the
mad
current
made
the
youth
feel
that
forceful
hands
from
heaven
would
not
have
been
able
to
have
held
him
in
place
if
he
could
have
got
intelligent
control
of
his
legs
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
an
appalling
imprint
upon
these
faces
*punct* .
*break*
the
struggle
in
the
smoke
had
pictured
an
exaggeration
of
itself
on
the
bleached
cheeks
and
in
the
eyes
wild
with
one
desire
*punct* .
*break*
the
sight
of
this
stampede
exerted
a
floodlike
force
that
seemed
able
to
drag
sticks
and
stones
and
men
from
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
they
of
the
reserves
had
to
hold
on
*punct* .
*break*
they
grew
pale
and
firm
*punct* ,
and
red
and
quaking
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
achieved
one
little
thought
in
the
midst
of
this
chaos
*punct* .
*break*
the
composite
monster
which
had
caused
the
other
troops
to
flee
had
not
then
appeared
*punct* .
*break*
he
resolved
to
get
a
view
of
it
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
he
thought
he
might
very
likely
run
better
than
the
best
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
moments
of
waiting
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
thought
of
the
village
street
at
home
before
the
arrival
of
the
circus
parade
on
a
day
in
the
spring
*punct* .
*break*
he
remembered
how
he
had
stood
*punct* ,
a
small
*punct* ,
thrillful
boy
*punct* ,
prepared
to
follow
the
dingy
lady
upon
the
white
horse
*punct* ,
or
the
band
in
its
faded
chariot
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
the
yellow
road
*punct* ,
the
lines
of
expectant
people
*punct* ,
and
the
sober
houses
*punct* .
*break*
he
particularly
remembered
an
old
fellow
who
used
to
sit
upon
a
cracker
box
in
front
of
the
store
and
feign
to
despise
such
exhibitions
*punct* .
*break*
a
thousand
details
of
color
and
form
surged
in
his
mind
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
fellow
upon
the
cracker
box
ap
*punct* -
peared
in
middle
prominence
*punct* .
*break*
some
one
cried
*punct* ,
here
they
come
*punct* !
*break*
there
was
rustling
and
muttering
among
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
they
displayed
a
feverish
desire
to
have
every
possible
cartridge
ready
to
their
hands
*punct* .
*break*
the
boxes
were
pulled
around
into
various
posi
*punct* -
tions
*punct* ,
and
adjusted
with
great
care
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
as
if
seven
hundred
new
bonnets
were
being
tried
on
*punct* .
*break*
53
the
tall
soldier
*punct* ,
having
prepared
his
rifle
*punct* ,
pro
*punct* -
duced
a
red
handkerchief
of
some
kind
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
engaged
in
knitting
it
about
his
throat
with
ex
*punct* -
quisite
attention
to
its
position
*punct* ,
when
the
cry
was
repeated
up
and
down
the
line
in
a
muffled
roar
of
sound
*punct* .
*break*
here
they
come
*punct* !
*break*
here
they
come
*punct* !
*break*
gun
locks
clicked
*punct* .
*break*
across
the
smoke-infested
fields
came
a
brown
swarm
of
running
men
who
were
giving
shrill
yells
*punct* .
*break*
they
came
on
*punct* ,
stooping
and
swinging
their
rifles
at
all
angles
*punct* .
*break*
a
flag
*punct* ,
tilted
forward
*punct* ,
sped
near
the
front
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
caught
sight
of
them
the
youth
was
momentarily
startled
by
a
thought
that
perhaps
his
gun
was
not
loaded
*punct* .
*break*
he
stood
trying
to
rally
his
faltering
intellect
so
that
he
might
rec
*punct* -
ollect
the
moment
when
he
had
loaded
*punct* ,
but
he
could
not
*punct* .
*break*
a
hatless
general
pulled
his
dripping
horse
to
a
stand
near
the
colonel
of
the
304th
*punct* .
*break*
he
shook
his
fist
in
the
other's
face
*punct* .
*break*
you
ve
got
to
hold
em
back
*punct* !
*break*
he
shouted
*punct* ,
savagely
*punct* ;
you
ve
got
to
hold
em
back
*punct* !
*break*
in
his
agitation
the
colonel
began
to
stammer
*punct* .
*break*
a-all
r-right
*punct* ,
general
*punct* ,
all
right
*punct* ,
by
gawd
*punct* !
*break*
we
*punct* -

we-we'll
d-d-do
*punct* ,
do
our
best
*punct* ,
gen
*punct* -
eral
*punct* .
*break*
the
general
made
a
passionate
gesture
and
galloped
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
colonel
*punct* ,
perchance
to
relieve
his
feelings
*punct* ,
began
to
scold
like
a
wet
parrot
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
turning
swiftly
to
make
sure
that
the
rear
was
unmolested
*punct* ,
saw
the
com
*punct* -
mander
regarding
his
men
in
a
highly
regretful
manner
*punct* ,
as
if
he
regretted
above
everything
his
association
with
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
at
the
youth's
elbow
was
mumbling
*punct* ,
as
if
to
himself
*punct* :
oh
*punct* ,
we
re
in
for
it
now
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
we
re
in
for
it
now
*punct* !
*break*
the
captain
of
the
company
had
been
pacing
excitedly
to
and
fro
in
the
rear
*punct* .
*break*
he
coaxed
in
schoolmistress
fashion
*punct* ,
as
to
a
congregation
of
boys
with
primers
*punct* .
*break*
his
talk
was
an
endless
repetition
*punct* .
*break*
reserve
your
fire
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* ,
don't
shoot
till
i
tell
you
*punct* ,
save
your
fire
*punct* ,
wait
till
they
get
close
up
*punct* ,
don't
be
damned
fools
*punct* ,
perspiration
streamed
down
the
youth's
face
*punct* ,
which
was
soiled
like
that
of
a
weeping
urchin
*punct* .
*break*
he
frequently
*punct* ,
with
a
nervous
movement
*punct* ,
wiped
his
eyes
with
his
coat
sleeve
*punct* .
*break*
his
mouth
was
still
a
little
ways
open
*punct* .
*break*
he
got
the
one
glance
at
the
foe-swarming
field
in
front
of
him
*punct* ,
and
instantly
ceased
to
de
*punct* -
bate
the
question
of
his
piece
being
loaded
*punct* .
*break*
be
*punct* -
fore
he
was
ready
to
begin
*punct* ,
before
he
had
an
*punct* -
nounced
to
himself
that
he
was
about
to
fight
*punct* ,
he
threw
the
obedient
*punct* ,
well-balanced
rifle
into
position
and
fired
a
first
wild
shot
*punct* .
*break*
directly
he
was
working
at
his
weapon
like
an
automatic
affair
*punct* .
*break*
he
suddenly
lost
concern
for
himself
*punct* ,
and
for
*punct* -
got
to
look
at
a
menacing
fate
*punct* .
*break*
he
became
not
a
man
but
a
member
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
that
something
of
which
he
was
a
part
*punct* ,
a
regiment
*punct* ,
an
army
*punct* ,
a
cause
*punct* ,
or
a
country
*punct* ,
was
in
a
crisis
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
welded
into
a
common
personality
which
was
dominated
by
a
single
desire
*punct* .
*break*
for
some
mo
*punct* -
ments
he
could
not
flee
no
more
than
a
little
finger
can
commit
a
revolution
from
a
hand
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
had
thought
the
regiment
was
about
to
be
annihilated
perhaps
he
could
have
amputated
himself
from
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
its
noise
gave
him
assur
*punct* -
ance
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
was
like
a
firework
that
*punct* ,
once
ignited
*punct* ,
proceeds
superior
to
circumstances
until
its
blazing
vitality
fades
*punct* .
*break*
it
wheezed
and
banged
with
a
mighty
power
*punct* .
*break*
he
pictured
the
ground
before
it
as
strewn
with
the
discom
*punct* -
fited
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
consciousness
always
of
the
pres
*punct* -
ence
of
his
comrades
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
the
subtle
battle
brotherhood
more
potent
even
than
the
cause
for
which
they
were
fighting
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
mysterious
fraternity
born
of
the
smoke
and
dan
*punct* -
ger
of
death
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
at
a
task
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
like
a
carpenter
who
has
made
many
boxes
*punct* ,
making
still
another
box
*punct* ,
only
there
was
furious
haste
in
his
move
*punct* -
ments
*punct* .
*break*
he
*punct* ,
in
his
thought
*punct* ,
was
careering
off
in
other
places
*punct* ,
even
as
the
carpenter
who
as
he
works
whistles
and
thinks
of
his
friend
or
his
enemy
*punct* ,
his
home
or
a
saloon
*punct* .
*break*
and
these
jolted
dreams
were
never
perfect
to
him
afterward
*punct* ,
but
remained
a
mass
of
blurred
shapes
*punct* .
*break*
presently
he
began
to
feel
the
effects
of
the
war
atmosphere
*punct* ,
a
blistering
sweat
*punct* ,
a
sensation
that
his
eyeballs
were
about
to
crack
like
hot
stones
*punct* .
*break*
a
burning
roar
filled
his
ears
*punct* .
*break*
following
this
came
a
red
rage
*punct* .
*break*
he
devel
*punct* -
oped
the
acute
exasperation
of
a
pestered
animal
*punct* ,
a
well-meaning
cow
worried
by
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
mad
feeling
against
his
rifle
*punct* ,
which
could
only
be
used
against
one
life
at
a
time
*punct* .
*break*
he
wished
to
rush
forward
and
strangle
with
his
fingers
*punct* .
*break*
he
craved
a
power
that
would
enable
him
to
make
a
world-sweeping
gesture
and
brush
all
back
*punct* .
*break*
his
impotency
appeared
to
him
*punct* ,
and
made
his
rage
into
that
of
a
driven
beast
*punct* .
*break*
buried
in
the
smoke
of
many
rifles
his
anger
was
directed
not
so
much
against
the
men
whom
he
knew
were
rushing
toward
him
as
against
the
swirling
battle
phantoms
which
were
choking
him
*punct* ,
stuffing
their
smoke
robes
down
his
parched
throat
*punct* .
*break*
he
fought
frantically
for
respite
for
his
senses
*punct* ,
for
air
*punct* ,
as
a
babe
being
smothered
attacks
the
deadly
blankets
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
blare
of
heated
rage
mingled
with
a
certain
expression
of
intentness
on
all
faces
*punct* .
*break*
many
of
the
men
were
making
low-toned
noises
with
their
mouths
*punct* ,
and
these
subdued
cheers
*punct* ,
snarls
*punct* ,
imprecations
*punct* ,
prayers
*punct* ,
made
a
wild
*punct* ,
bar
*punct* -
baric
song
that
went
as
an
undercurrent
of
sound
*punct* ,
strange
and
chantlike
with
the
resounding
chords
of
the
war
march
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
at
the
youth's
elbow
was
babbling
*punct* .
*break*
in
it
there
was
something
soft
and
tender
like
the
monologue
of
a
babe
*punct* .
*break*
the
tall
soldier
was
swearing
in
a
loud
voice
*punct* .
*break*
from
his
lips
came
a
black
procession
of
curious
oaths
*punct* .
*break*
of
a
sudden
another
broke
out
in
a
querulous
way
like
a
man
who
has
mislaid
his
hat
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
why
don't
they
support
us
*punct* ?
*break*
why
don't
they
send
supports
*punct* ?
*break*
do
they
think
*punct* ,
the
youth
in
his
battle
sleep
heard
this
as
one
who
dozes
hears
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
singular
absence
of
heroic
poses
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
bending
and
surging
in
their
haste
and
rage
were
in
every
impossible
attitude
*punct* .
*break*
the
steel
ramrods
clanked
and
clanged
with
incessant
din
as
the
men
pounded
them
furiously
into
the
hot
rifle
barrels
*punct* .
*break*
the
flaps
of
the
cartridge
boxes
were
all
unfastened
*punct* ,
and
bobbed
idiotically
with
each
movement
*punct* .
*break*
the
rifles
*punct* ,
once
loaded
*punct* ,
were
jerked
to
the
shoulder
and
fired
without
apparent
aim
into
the
smoke
or
at
one
of
the
blurred
and
shift
*punct* -
ing
forms
which
upon
the
field
before
the
regi
*punct* -
ment
had
been
growing
larger
and
larger
like
puppets
under
a
magician's
hand
*punct* .
*break*
the
officers
*punct* ,
at
their
intervals
*punct* ,
rearward
*punct* ,
neg
*punct* -
lected
to
stand
in
picturesque
attitudes
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
bobbing
to
and
fro
roaring
directions
and
encouragements
*punct* .
*break*
the
dimensions
of
their
howls
were
extraordinary
*punct* .
*break*
they
expended
their
lungs
with
prodigal
wills
*punct* .
*break*
and
often
they
nearly
stood
upon
their
heads
in
their
anxiety
to
observe
the
enemy
on
the
other
side
of
the
tumbling
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
the
lieutenant
of
the
youth's
company
had
en
*punct* -
countered
a
soldier
who
had
fled
screaming
at
the
first
volley
of
his
comrades
*punct* .
*break*
behind
the
lines
these
two
were
acting
a
little
isolated
scene
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
was
blubbering
and
staring
with
sheeplike
eyes
at
the
lieutenant
*punct* ,
who
had
seized
him
by
the
collar
and
was
pommeling
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
drove
him
back
into
the
ranks
with
many
blows
*punct* .
*break*
the
sol
*punct* -
dier
went
mechanically
*punct* ,
dully
*punct* ,
with
his
animal
*punct* -
like
eyes
upon
the
officer
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
there
was
to
him
a
divinity
expressed
in
the
voice
of
the
other
*punct* ,
stern
*punct* ,
hard
*punct* ,
with
no
reflection
of
fear
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
tried
to
reload
his
gun
*punct* ,
but
his
shaking
hands
pre
*punct* -
vented
*punct* .
*break*
the
lieutenant
was
obliged
to
assist
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
dropped
here
and
there
like
bundles
*punct* .
*break*
the
captain
of
the
youth's
company
had
been
killed
in
an
early
part
of
the
action
*punct* .
*break*
his
body
lay
stretched
out
in
the
position
of
a
tired
man
resting
*punct* ,
but
upon
his
face
there
was
an
astonished
and
sorrowful
look
*punct* ,
as
if
he
thought
some
friend
had
done
him
an
ill
turn
*punct* .
*break*
the
babbling
man
was
grazed
by
a
shot
that
made
the
blood
stream
widely
down
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
he
clapped
both
hands
to
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
*punct* ,
and
ran
*punct* .
*break*
another
grunted
suddenly
as
if
he
had
been
struck
by
a
club
in
the
stomach
*punct* .
*break*
he
sat
down
and
gazed
ruefully
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
eyes
there
was
mute
*punct* ,
indefinite
reproach
*punct* .
*break*
farther
up
the
line
a
man
*punct* ,
standing
behind
a
tree
*punct* ,
had
had
his
knee
joint
splintered
by
a
ball
*punct* .
*break*
immediately
he
had
dropped
his
rifle
and
gripped
the
tree
with
both
arms
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
he
remained
*punct* ,
clinging
desperately
and
crying
for
assistance
that
he
might
withdraw
his
hold
upon
the
tree
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
an
exultant
yell
went
along
the
quiver
*punct* -
ing
line
*punct* .
*break*
the
firing
dwindled
from
an
uproar
to
a
last
vindictive
popping
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
smoke
slowly
eddied
away
*punct* ,
the
youth
saw
that
the
charge
had
been
repulsed
*punct* .
*break*
the
enemy
were
scattered
into
reluctant
groups
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
a
man
climb
to
the
top
of
the
fence
*punct* ,
straddle
the
rail
*punct* ,
and
fire
a
part
*punct* -
ing
shot
*punct* .
*break*
the
waves
had
receded
*punct* ,
leaving
bits
of
dark
debris
upon
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
some
in
the
regiment
began
to
whoop
fren
*punct* -
ziedly
*punct* .
*break*
many
were
silent
*punct* .
*break*
apparently
they
were
trying
to
contemplate
themselves
*punct* .
*break*
after
the
fever
had
left
his
veins
*punct* ,
the
youth
thought
that
at
last
he
was
going
to
suffocate
*punct* .
*break*
he
became
aware
of
the
foul
atmosphere
in
which
he
had
been
struggling
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
grimy
and
dripping
like
a
laborer
in
a
foundry
*punct* .
*break*
he
grasped
his
canteen
and
took
a
long
swallow
of
the
warmed
water
*punct* .
*break*
a
sentence
with
variations
went
up
and
down
the
line
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
we
ve
helt
em
back
*punct* .
*break*
we
ve
helt
em
back
*punct* ;
derned
if
we
haven't
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
said
it
blissfully
*punct* ,
leering
at
each
other
with
dirty
smiles
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
turned
to
look
behind
him
and
off
to
the
right
and
off
to
the
left
*punct* .
*break*
he
experienced
the
joy
of
a
man
who
at
last
finds
leisure
in
which
to
look
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
under
foot
there
were
a
few
ghastly
forms
motionless
*punct* .
*break*
they
lay
twisted
in
fantastic
contor
*punct* -
tions
*punct* .
*break*
arms
were
bent
and
heads
were
turned
in
incredible
ways
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
that
the
dead
men
must
have
fallen
from
some
great
height
to
get
into
such
positions
*punct* .
*break*
they
looked
to
be
dumped
out
upon
the
ground
from
the
sky
*punct* .
*break*
from
a
position
in
the
rear
of
the
grove
a
bat
*punct* -
tery
was
throwing
shells
over
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
flash
of
the
guns
startled
the
youth
at
first
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
they
were
aimed
directly
at
him
*punct* .
*break*
through
the
trees
he
watched
the
black
figures
of
the
gunners
as
they
worked
swiftly
and
intently
*punct* .
*break*
their
labor
seemed
a
complicated
thing
*punct* .
*break*
he
wondered
how
they
could
remember
its
formula
in
the
midst
of
confusion
*punct* .
*break*
the
guns
squatted
in
a
row
like
savage
chiefs
*punct* .
*break*
they
argued
with
abrupt
violence
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
grim
pow-wow
*punct* .
*break*
their
busy
servants
ran
hither
and
thither
*punct* .
*break*
a
small
procession
of
wounded
men
were
go
*punct* -
ing
drearily
toward
the
rear
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
flow
of
blood
from
the
torn
body
of
the
brigade
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
were
the
dark
lines
of
other
troops
*punct* .
*break*
far
in
front
he
thought
he
could
see
lighter
masses
protruding
in
points
from
the
forest
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
suggestive
of
un
*punct* -
numbered
thousands
*punct* .
*break*
once
he
saw
a
tiny
battery
go
dashing
along
the
line
of
the
horizon
*punct* .
*break*
the
tiny
riders
were
beating
the
tiny
horses
*punct* .
*break*
from
a
sloping
hill
came
the
sound
of
cheer
*punct* -
ings
and
clashes
*punct* .
*break*
smoke
welled
slowly
through
the
leaves
*punct* .
*break*
batteries
were
speaking
with
thunderous
ora
*punct* -
torical
effort
*punct* .
*break*
here
and
there
were
flags
*punct* ,
the
red
in
the
stripes
dominating
*punct* .
*break*
they
splashed
bits
of
warm
color
upon
the
dark
lines
of
troops
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
felt
the
old
thrill
at
the
sight
of
the
emblem
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
like
beautiful
birds
strangely
undaunted
in
a
storm
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
listened
to
the
din
from
the
hillside
*punct* ,
to
a
deep
pulsating
thunder
that
came
from
afar
to
the
left
*punct* ,
and
to
the
lesser
clamors
which
came
from
many
directions
*punct* ,
it
occurred
to
him
that
they
were
fighting
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
over
there
*punct* ,
and
over
there
*punct* ,
and
over
there
*punct* .
*break*
heretofore
he
had
sup
*punct* -
posed
that
all
the
battle
was
directly
under
his
nose
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
gazed
around
him
the
youth
felt
a
flash
of
astonishment
at
the
blue
*punct* ,
pure
sky
and
the
sun
gleamings
on
the
trees
and
fields
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
surprising
that
nature
had
gone
tranquilly
on
with
her
golden
process
in
the
midst
of
so
much
devilment
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
awakened
slowly
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
grad
*punct* -
ually
back
to
a
position
from
which
he
could
re
*punct* -
gard
himself
*punct* .
*break*
for
moments
he
had
been
scruti
*punct* -
nizing
his
person
in
a
dazed
way
as
if
he
had
never
before
seen
himself
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
picked
up
his
cap
from
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
he
wriggled
in
his
jacket
to
make
a
more
comfortable
fit
*punct* ,
and
kneel
*punct* -
ing
relaced
his
shoe
*punct* .
*break*
he
thoughtfully
mopped
his
reeking
features
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
was
all
over
at
last
*punct* !
*break*
the
supreme
trial
had
been
passed
*punct* .
*break*
the
red
*punct* ,
formidable
difficulties
of
war
had
been
vanquished
*punct* .
*break*
he
went
into
an
ecstasy
of
self-satisfaction
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
the
most
delightful
sensations
of
his
life
*punct* .
*break*
standing
as
if
apart
from
himself
*punct* ,
he
viewed
that
last
scene
*punct* .
*break*
he
perceived
that
the
man
who
had
fought
thus
was
magnificent
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
that
he
was
a
fine
fellow
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
himself
even
with
those
ideals
which
he
had
con
*punct* -
sidered
as
far
beyond
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
smiled
in
deep
gratification
*punct* .
*break*
64
upon
his
fellows
he
beamed
tenderness
and
good
will
*punct* .
*break*
ain't
it
hot
*punct* ,
hey
*punct* ?
*break*
he
said
affably
to
a
man
who
was
polishing
his
stream
*punct* -
ing
face
with
his
coat
sleeves
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
other
*punct* ,
grinning
sociably
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
seen
sech
dumb
hotness
*punct* .
*break*
he
sprawled
out
luxuriously
on
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
gee
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* !
*break*
an
i
hope
we
don't
have
no
more
fightin
till
a
week
from
monday
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
some
handshakings
and
deep
speeches
with
men
whose
features
were
familiar
*punct* ,
but
with
whom
the
youth
now
felt
the
bonds
of
tied
hearts
*punct* .
*break*
he
helped
a
cursing
comrade
to
bind
up
a
wound
of
the
shin
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
of
a
sudden
*punct* ,
cries
of
amazement
broke
out
along
the
ranks
of
the
new
regiment
*punct* .
*break*
here
they
come
ag'in
*punct* !
*break*
here
they
come
ag'in
*punct* !
*break*
the
man
who
had
sprawled
upon
the
ground
started
up
and
said
*punct* ,
gosh
*punct* !
*break*
the
youth
turned
quick
eyes
upon
the
field
*punct* .
*break*
he
discerned
forms
begin
to
swell
in
masses
out
of
a
distant
wood
*punct* .
*break*
he
again
saw
the
tilted
flag
speeding
forward
*punct* .
*break*
the
shells
*punct* ,
which
had
ceased
to
trouble
the
regiment
for
a
time
*punct* ,
came
swirling
again
*punct* ,
and
ex
*punct* -
ploded
in
the
grass
or
among
the
leaves
of
the
trees
*punct* .
*break*
they
looked
to
be
strange
war
flowers
bursting
into
fierce
bloom
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
groaned
*punct* .
*break*
the
luster
faded
from
their
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
their
smudged
countenances
now
expressed
a
profound
dejection
*punct* .
*break*
they
moved
their
stiffened
bodies
slowly
*punct* ,
and
watched
in
sul
*punct* -
len
mood
the
frantic
approach
of
the
enemy
*punct* .
*break*
the
slaves
toiling
in
the
temple
of
this
god
began
to
feel
rebellion
at
his
harsh
tasks
*punct* .
*break*
they
fretted
and
complained
each
to
each
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
say
*punct* ,
this
is
too
much
of
a
good
thing
*punct* !
*break*
why
can't
somebody
send
us
supports
*punct* ?
*break*
we
ain't
never
goin
to
stand
this
second
banging
*punct* .
*break*
i
didn't
come
here
to
fight
the
hull
damn
rebel
army
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
one
who
raised
a
doleful
cry
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
bill
smithers
had
trod
on
my
hand
*punct* ,
in
*punct* -
steader
me
treddin
on
his'n
*punct* .
*break*
the
sore
joints
of
the
regiment
creaked
as
it
painfully
floundered
into
position
to
repulse
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
stared
*punct* .
*break*
surely
*punct* ,
he
thought
*punct* ,
this
impossible
thing
was
not
about
to
happen
*punct* .
*break*
he
waited
as
if
he
expected
the
enemy
to
suddenly
stop
*punct* ,
apologize
*punct* ,
and
retire
bowing
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
all
a
mistake
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
firing
began
somewhere
on
the
regi
*punct* -
mental
line
and
ripped
along
in
both
directions
*punct* .
*break*
the
level
sheets
of
flame
developed
great
clouds
of
smoke
that
tumbled
and
tossed
in
the
mild
wind
near
the
ground
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
and
then
rolled
through
the
ranks
as
through
a
gate
*punct* .
*break*
the
clouds
were
tinged
an
earthlike
yellow
in
the
sunrays
and
in
the
shadow
were
a
sorry
blue
*punct* .
*break*
the
flag
was
sometimes
eaten
and
lost
in
this
mass
of
vapor
*punct* ,
but
more
often
it
projected
*punct* ,
sun
*punct* -
touched
*punct* ,
resplendent
*punct* .
*break*
into
the
youth's
eyes
there
came
a
look
that
one
can
see
in
the
orbs
of
a
jaded
horse
*punct* .
*break*
his
neck
was
quivering
with
nervous
weakness
and
the
muscles
of
his
arms
felt
numb
and
bloodless
*punct* .
*break*
his
hands
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
seemed
large
and
awkward
as
if
he
was
wearing
invisible
mittens
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
was
a
great
uncertainty
about
his
knee
joints
*punct* .
*break*
the
words
that
comrades
had
uttered
previous
to
the
firing
began
to
recur
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
say
*punct* ,
this
is
too
much
of
a
good
thing
*punct* !
*break*
what
do
they
take
us
for
*punct* ,
why
don't
they
send
supports
*punct* ?
*break*
i
didn't
come
here
to
fight
the
hull
damned
rebel
army
*punct* .
*break*
he
began
to
exaggerate
the
endurance
*punct* ,
the
skill
*punct* ,
and
the
valor
of
those
who
were
coming
*punct* .
*break*
himself
reeling
from
exhaustion
*punct* ,
he
was
aston
*punct* -
ished
beyond
measure
at
such
persistency
*punct* .
*break*
they
must
be
machines
of
steel
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
very
gloomy
struggling
against
such
affairs
*punct* ,
wound
up
perhaps
to
fight
until
sundown
*punct* .
*break*
he
slowly
lifted
his
rifle
and
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
thickspread
field
he
blazed
at
a
cantering
cluster
*punct* .
*break*
he
stopped
then
and
began
to
peer
as
best
he
could
through
the
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
he
caught
changing
views
of
the
ground
covered
with
men
who
were
all
running
like
pursued
imps
*punct* ,
and
yelling
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
youth
it
was
an
onslaught
of
redoubt
*punct* -
able
dragons
*punct* .
*break*
he
became
like
the
man
who
lost
his
legs
at
the
approach
of
the
red
and
green
monster
*punct* .
*break*
he
waited
in
a
sort
of
a
horrified
*punct* ,
listening
attitude
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
to
shut
his
eyes
and
wait
to
be
gobbled
*punct* .
*break*
a
man
near
him
who
up
to
this
time
had
been
working
feverishly
at
his
rifle
suddenly
stopped
and
ran
with
howls
*punct* .
*break*
a
lad
whose
face
had
borne
an
expression
of
exalted
courage
*punct* ,
the
majesty
of
he
who
dares
give
his
life
*punct* ,
was
*punct* ,
at
an
instant
*punct* ,
smitten
abject
*punct* .
*break*
he
blanched
like
one
who
has
come
to
the
edge
of
a
cliff
at
midnight
and
is
sud
*punct* -
denly
made
aware
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
revelation
*punct* .
*break*
he
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
threw
down
his
gun
and
fled
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
shame
in
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
he
ran
like
a
rabbit
*punct* .
*break*
others
began
to
scamper
away
through
the
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
turned
his
head
*punct* ,
shaken
from
his
trance
by
this
movement
as
if
the
regiment
was
leaving
him
behind
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
the
few
fleeting
forms
*punct* .
*break*
he
yelled
then
with
fright
and
swung
about
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
in
the
great
clamor
*punct* ,
he
was
like
a
proverbial
chicken
*punct* .
*break*
he
lost
the
direction
of
safety
*punct* .
*break*
destruction
threatened
him
from
all
points
*punct* .
*break*
directly
he
began
to
speed
toward
the
rear
in
great
leaps
*punct* .
*break*
his
rifle
and
cap
were
gone
*punct* .
*break*
his
unbuttoned
coat
bulged
in
the
wind
*punct* .
*break*
the
flap
of
his
cartridge
box
bobbed
wildly
*punct* ,
and
his
canteen
*punct* ,
by
its
slender
cord
*punct* ,
swung
out
behind
*punct* .
*break*
on
his
face
was
all
the
horror
of
those
things
which
he
imagined
*punct* .
*break*
the
lieutenant
sprang
forward
bawling
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
saw
his
features
wrathfully
red
*punct* ,
and
saw
him
make
a
dab
with
his
sword
*punct* .
*break*
his
one
thought
of
the
incident
was
that
the
lieutenant
was
a
pecul
*punct* -
iar
creature
to
feel
interested
in
such
matters
upon
this
occasion
*punct* .
*break*
he
ran
like
a
blind
man
*punct* .
*break*
two
or
three
times
he
fell
down
*punct* .
*break*
once
he
knocked
his
shoulder
so
heavily
against
a
tree
that
he
went
headlong
*punct* .
*break*
since
he
had
turned
his
back
upon
the
fight
his
fears
had
been
wondrously
magnified
*punct* .
*break*
death
about
to
thrust
him
between
the
shoulder
blades
was
far
more
dreadful
than
death
about
to
smite
him
between
the
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
thought
of
it
later
*punct* ,
he
conceived
the
impression
that
it
is
better
to
view
the
appalling
than
to
be
merely
within
hearing
*punct* .
*break*
the
noises
of
the
battle
were
like
stones
*punct* ;
he
believed
himself
liable
to
be
crushed
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
ran
he
mingled
with
others
*punct* .
*break*
he
dimly
saw
men
on
his
right
and
on
his
left
*punct* ,
and
he
heard
footsteps
behind
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
that
all
the
regiment
was
fleeing
*punct* ,
pursued
by
these
ominous
crashes
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
flight
the
sound
of
these
following
foot
*punct* -
steps
gave
him
his
one
meager
relief
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
vaguely
that
death
must
make
a
first
choice
of
the
men
who
were
nearest
*punct* ;
the
initial
morsels
for
the
dragons
would
be
then
those
who
were
fol
*punct* -
lowing
him
*punct* .
*break*
so
he
displayed
the
zeal
of
an
insane
sprinter
in
his
purpose
to
keep
them
in
the
rear
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
race
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
*punct* ,
leading
*punct* ,
went
across
a
little
field
*punct* ,
he
found
himself
in
a
region
of
shells
*punct* .
*break*
they
hurtled
over
his
head
with
long
wild
screams
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
listened
he
imagined
them
to
have
rows
of
cruel
teeth
that
grinned
at
him
*punct* .
*break*
once
one
lit
before
him
and
the
livid
lightning
of
the
explosion
effectually
barred
the
way
in
his
chosen
direc
*punct* -
tion
*punct* .
*break*
he
groveled
on
the
ground
and
then
springing
up
went
careering
off
through
some
bushes
*punct* .
*break*
he
experienced
a
thrill
of
amazement
when
he
came
within
view
of
a
battery
in
action
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
there
seemed
to
be
in
conventional
moods
*punct* ,
altogether
unaware
of
the
impending
annihila
*punct* -
tion
*punct* .
*break*
the
battery
was
disputing
with
a
distant
antagonist
and
the
gunners
were
wrapped
in
admiration
of
their
shooting
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
con
*punct* -
tinually
bending
in
coaxing
postures
over
the
guns
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
to
be
patting
them
on
the
back
and
encouraging
them
with
words
*punct* .
*break*
the
guns
*punct* ,
stolid
and
undaunted
*punct* ,
spoke
with
dogged
valor
*punct* .
*break*
the
precise
gunners
were
coolly
enthusiastic
*punct* .
*break*
they
lifted
their
eyes
every
chance
to
the
smoke
*punct* -
wreathed
hillock
from
whence
the
hostile
battery
addressed
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
pitied
them
as
he
ran
*punct* .
*break*
the
refined
joy
of
planting
shells
in
the
midst
of
the
other
battery's
formation
would
appear
a
little
thing
when
the
infantry
came
swooping
out
of
the
woods
*punct* .
*break*
the
face
of
a
youthful
rider
*punct* ,
who
was
jerking
his
frantic
horse
with
an
abandon
of
temper
he
might
display
in
a
placid
barnyard
*punct* ,
was
im
*punct* -
pressed
deeply
upon
his
mind
*punct* .
*break*
he
knew
that
he
looked
upon
a
man
who
would
presently
be
dead
*punct* .
*break*
too
*punct* ,
he
felt
a
pity
for
the
guns
*punct* ,
standing
*punct* ,
six
good
comrades
*punct* ,
in
a
bold
row
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
a
brigade
going
to
the
relief
of
its
pes
*punct* -
tered
fellows
*punct* .
*break*
he
scrambled
upon
a
wee
hill
and
watched
it
sweeping
finely
*punct* ,
keeping
formation
in
difficult
places
*punct* .
*break*
the
blue
of
the
line
was
crusted
with
steel
color
*punct* ,
and
the
brilliant
flags
projected
*punct* .
*break*
officers
were
shouting
*punct* .
*break*
this
sight
also
filled
him
with
wonder
*punct* .
*break*
the
brigade
was
hurrying
briskly
to
be
gulped
into
the
infernal
mouths
of
the
war
god
*punct* .
*break*
what
man
*punct* -
ner
of
men
were
they
*punct* ,
anyhow
*punct* ?
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
it
was
some
wondrous
breed
*punct* !
*break*
or
else
they
didn't
compre
*punct* -
hend
*punct* ,
the
fools
*punct* .
*break*
a
furious
order
caused
commotion
in
the
artil
*punct* -
lery
*punct* .
*break*
an
officer
on
a
bounding
horse
made
mani
*punct* -
acal
motions
with
his
arms
*punct* .
*break*
the
teams
went
swinging
up
from
the
rear
*punct* ,
the
guns
were
whirled
about
*punct* ,
and
the
battery
scampered
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
cannon
with
their
noses
poked
slantingly
at
the
ground
grunted
and
grumbled
like
stout
men
*punct* ,
brave
but
with
objections
to
hurry
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
went
on
*punct* ,
moderating
his
pace
since
he
had
left
the
place
of
noises
*punct* .
*break*
later
he
came
upon
a
general
of
division
seated
upon
a
horse
that
pricked
its
ears
in
an
interested
way
at
the
battle
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
great
gleaming
of
yellow
and
patent
leather
about
the
saddle
and
bridle
*punct* .
*break*
the
quiet
man
astride
looked
mouse-colored
upon
such
a
splen
*punct* -
did
charger
*punct* .
*break*
a
jingling
staff
was
galloping
hither
and
thither
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
the
general
was
surrounded
by
horsemen
and
at
other
times
he
was
quite
alone
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
to
be
much
harassed
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
business
man
whose
market
is
swinging
up
and
down
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
went
slinking
around
this
spot
*punct* .
*break*
he
went
as
near
as
he
dared
trying
to
overhear
words
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
the
general
*punct* ,
unable
to
compre
*punct* -
hend
chaos
*punct* ,
might
call
upon
him
for
information
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
could
tell
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
knew
all
concerning
it
*punct* .
*break*
of
a
surety
the
force
was
in
a
fix
*punct* ,
and
any
fool
could
see
that
if
they
did
not
retreat
while
they
had
opportunity
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
he
felt
that
he
would
like
to
thrash
the
gen
*punct* -
eral
*punct* ,
or
at
least
approach
and
tell
him
in
plain
words
exactly
what
he
thought
him
to
be
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
criminal
to
stay
calmly
in
one
spot
and
make
no
effort
to
stay
destruction
*punct* .
*break*
he
loitered
in
a
fever
of
eagerness
for
the
division
commander
to
apply
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
a
slim
youth
on
a
fine
chestnut
horse
caught
these
swift
words
from
the
mouth
of
his
superior
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
his
horse
bound
into
a
gallop
almost
from
a
walk
in
his
haste
to
go
upon
his
mission
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
cloud
of
dust
*punct* .
*break*
a
moment
later
the
youth
saw
the
general
bounce
excitedly
in
his
saddle
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
by
heavens
*punct* ,
they
have
*punct* !
*break*
the
officer
leaned
forward
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
was
aflame
with
excite
*punct* -
ment
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
by
heavens
*punct* ,
they
ve
held
im
*punct* !
*break*
they
ve
held
im
*punct* !
*break*
he
began
to
blithely
roar
at
his
staff
*punct* :
we
ll
wallop
im
now
*punct* .
*break*
we
ll
wallop
im
now
*punct* .
*break*
we
ve
got
em
sure
*punct* .
*break*
as
another
officer
sped
his
horse
after
the
first
messenger
*punct* ,
the
general
beamed
upon
the
earth
like
a
sun
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
eyes
was
a
desire
to
chant
a
paean
*punct* .
*break*
he
kept
repeating
*punct* ,
they
ve
held
em
*punct* ,
by
heavens
*punct* !
*break*
his
excitement
made
his
horse
plunge
*punct* ,
and
he
merrily
kicked
and
swore
at
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
held
a
little
carnival
of
joy
on
horseback
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
cringed
as
if
discovered
in
a
crime
*punct* .
*break*
by
heavens
*punct* ,
they
had
won
after
all
*punct* !
*break*
the
im
*punct* -
becile
line
had
remained
and
become
victors
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
hear
cheering
*punct* .
*break*
he
lifted
himself
upon
his
toes
and
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
fight
*punct* .
*break*
a
yellow
fog
lay
wal
*punct* -
lowing
on
the
treetops
*punct* .
*break*
from
beneath
it
came
the
clatter
of
musketry
*punct* .
*break*
hoarse
cries
told
of
an
advance
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
away
amazed
and
angry
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
that
he
had
been
wronged
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
fled
*punct* ,
he
told
himself
*punct* ,
because
annihila
*punct* -
tion
approached
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
done
a
good
part
in
saving
himself
*punct* ,
who
was
a
little
piece
of
the
army
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
considered
the
time
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
to
be
one
in
which
it
was
the
duty
of
every
little
piece
to
res
*punct* -
cue
itself
if
possible
*punct* .
*break*
later
the
officers
could
fit
the
little
pieces
together
again
*punct* ,
and
make
a
battle
front
*punct* .
*break*
if
none
of
the
little
pieces
were
wise
enough
to
save
themselves
from
the
flurry
of
death
at
such
75
a
time
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
where
would
be
the
army
*punct* ?
*break*
it
was
all
plain
that
he
had
proceeded
according
to
very
correct
and
commendable
rules
*punct* .
*break*
his
ac
*punct* -
tions
had
been
sagacious
things
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
been
full
of
strategy
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
the
work
of
a
mas
*punct* -
ter's
legs
*punct* .
*break*
thoughts
of
his
comrades
came
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
brittle
blue
line
had
withstood
the
blows
and
won
*punct* .
*break*
he
grew
bitter
over
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
that
the
blind
ignorance
and
stupidity
of
those
little
pieces
had
betrayed
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
overturned
and
crushed
by
their
lack
of
sense
in
holding
the
po
*punct* -
sition
*punct* ,
when
intelligent
deliberation
would
have
convinced
them
that
it
was
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
he
*punct* ,
the
enlightened
man
who
looks
afar
in
the
dark
*punct* ,
had
fled
because
of
his
superior
perceptions
and
knowledge
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
a
great
anger
against
his
comrades
*punct* .
*break*
he
knew
it
could
be
proved
that
they
had
been
fools
*punct* .
*break*
he
wondered
what
they
would
remark
when
later
he
appeared
in
camp
*punct* .
*break*
his
mind
heard
howls
of
derision
*punct* .
*break*
their
density
would
not
en

able
them
to
understand
his
sharper
point
of
view
*punct* .
*break*
he
began
to
pity
himself
acutely
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
ill
used
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
trodden
beneath
the
feet
of
an
iron
injustice
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
proceeded
with
wisdom
and
from
the
most
righteous
motives
under
heaven's
blue
only
to
be
frustrated
by
hateful
circumstances
*punct* .
*break*
a
dull
*punct* ,
animal-like
rebellion
against
his
fel
*punct* -
lows
*punct* ,
war
in
the
abstract
*punct* ,
and
fate
grew
within
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
shambled
along
with
bowed
head
*punct* ,
his
brain
in
a
tumult
of
agony
and
despair
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
looked
loweringly
up
*punct* ,
quivering
at
each
sound
*punct* ,
his
eyes
had
the
expression
of
those
of
a
criminal
who
thinks
his
guilt
and
his
pun
*punct* -
ishment
great
*punct* ,
and
knows
that
he
can
find
no
words
*punct* .
*break*
he
went
from
the
fields
into
a
thick
woods
*punct* ,
as
if
resolved
to
bury
himself
*punct* .
*break*
he
wished
to
get
out
of
hearing
of
the
crackling
shots
which
were
to
him
like
voices
*punct* .
*break*
the
ground
was
cluttered
with
vines
and
bushes
*punct* ,
and
the
trees
grew
close
and
spread
out
like
bouquets
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
obliged
to
force
his
way
with
much
noise
*punct* .
*break*
the
creepers
*punct* ,
catching
against
his
legs
*punct* ,
cried
out
harshly
as
their
sprays
were
torn
from
the
barks
of
trees
*punct* .
*break*
the
swishing
sap
*punct* -
lings
tried
to
make
known
his
presence
to
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
conciliate
the
forest
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
made
his
way
*punct* ,
it
was
always
calling
out
prot
*punct* -
estations
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
separated
embraces
of
trees
and
vines
the
disturbed
foliages
waved
their
arms
and
turned
their
face
leaves
toward
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
dreaded
lest
these
noisy
motions
and
cries
should
bring
men
to
look
at
him
*punct* .
*break*
so
he
went
far
*punct* ,
seek
*punct* -
ing
dark
and
intricate
places
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
time
the
sound
of
musketry
grew
faint
and
the
cannon
boomed
in
the
distance
*punct* .
*break*
the
sun
*punct* ,
suddenly
apparent
*punct* ,
blazed
among
the
trees
*punct* .
*break*
the
insects
were
making
rhythmical
noises
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
to
be
grinding
their
teeth
in
unison
*punct* .
*break*
a
woodpecker
stuck
his
impudent
head
around
the
side
of
a
tree
*punct* .
*break*
a
bird
flew
on
lighthearted
wing
*punct* .
*break*
off
was
the
rumble
of
death
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
now
that
nature
had
no
ears
*punct* .
*break*
this
landscape
gave
him
assurance
*punct* .
*break*
a
fair
field
holding
life
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
religion
of
peace
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
die
if
its
timid
eyes
were
compelled
to
see
blood
*punct* .
*break*
he
conceived
nature
to
be
a
woman
with
a
deep
aversion
to
tragedy
*punct* .
*break*
he
threw
a
pine
cone
at
a
jovial
squirrel
*punct* ,
and
he
ran
with
chattering
fear
*punct* .
*break*
high
in
a
treetop
he
stopped
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
poking
his
head
cautiously
from
behind
a
branch
*punct* ,
looked
down
with
an
air
of
trepi
*punct* -
dation
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
felt
triumphant
at
this
exhibition
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
the
law
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
nature
had
given
him
a
sign
*punct* .
*break*
the
squirrel
*punct* ,
immediately
upon
rec
*punct* -
ognizing
danger
*punct* ,
had
taken
to
his
legs
without
ado
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
stand
stolidly
baring
his
furry
belly
to
the
missile
*punct* ,
and
die
with
an
upward
glance
at
the
sympathetic
heavens
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
con
*punct* -
trary
*punct* ,
he
had
fled
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
*punct* ;
and
he
was
but
an
ordinary
squirrel
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
doubtless
no
philosopher
of
his
race
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
wended
*punct* ,
feeling
that
nature
was
of
his
mind
*punct* .
*break*
she
re-enforced
his
argument
with
proofs
that
lived
where
the
sun
shone
*punct* .
*break*
once
he
found
himself
almost
into
a
swamp
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
obliged
to
walk
upon
bog
tufts
and
watch
his
feet
to
keep
from
the
oily
mire
*punct* .
*break*
paus
*punct* -
ing
at
one
time
to
look
about
him
he
saw
*punct* ,
out
at
some
black
water
*punct* ,
a
small
animal
pounce
in
and
emerge
directly
with
a
gleaming
fish
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
went
again
into
the
deep
thickets
*punct* .
*break*
the
brushed
branches
made
a
noise
that
drowned
the
sounds
of
cannon
*punct* .
*break*
he
walked
on
*punct* ,
going
from
obscurity
into
promises
of
a
greater
obscurity
*punct* .
*break*
at
length
he
reached
a
place
where
the
high
*punct* ,
arching
boughs
made
a
chapel
*punct* .
*break*
he
softly
pushed
the
green
doors
aside
and
entered
*punct* .
*break*
pine
needles
were
a
gentle
brown
carpet
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
reli
*punct* -
gious
half
light
*punct* .
*break*
near
the
threshold
he
stopped
*punct* ,
horror-stricken
at
the
sight
of
a
thing
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
being
looked
at
by
a
dead
man
who
was
seated
with
his
back
against
a
columnlike
tree
*punct* .
*break*
the
corpse
was
dressed
in
a
uniform
that
once
had
been
blue
*punct* ,
but
was
now
faded
to
a
mel
*punct* -
ancholy
shade
of
green
*punct* .
*break*
the
eyes
*punct* ,
staring
at
the
youth
*punct* ,
had
changed
to
the
dull
hue
to
be
seen
on
the
side
of
a
dead
fish
*punct* .
*break*
the
mouth
was
open
*punct* .
*break*
its
red
had
changed
to
an
appalling
yellow
*punct* .
*break*
over
the
gray
skin
of
the
face
ran
little
ants
*punct* .
*break*
one
was
trundling
some
sort
of
a
bundle
along
the
upper
lip
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
gave
a
shriek
as
he
confronted
the
thing
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
for
moments
turned
to
stone
be
*punct* -
fore
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
remained
staring
into
the
liquid-look
*punct* -
ing
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
the
dead
man
and
the
living
man
ex
*punct* -
changed
a
long
look
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
youth
cautiously
put
one
hand
behind
him
and
brought
it
against
a
tree
*punct* .
*break*
leaning
upon
this
he
retreated
*punct* ,
step
by
step
*punct* ,
with
his
face
still
toward
the
thing
*punct* .
*break*
he
feared
that
if
he
turned
his
back
the
body
might
spring
up
and
stealthily
pursue
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
branches
*punct* ,
pushing
against
him
*punct* ,
threat
*punct* -
ened
to
throw
him
over
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
his
unguided
feet
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
caught
aggravatingly
in
brambles
*punct* ;
and
with
it
all
he
received
a
subtle
suggestion
to
touch
the
corpse
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
thought
of
his
hand
upon
it
he
shuddered
profoundly
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
he
burst
the
bonds
which
had
fastened
him
to
the
spot
and
fled
*punct* ,
unheeding
the
under
*punct* -
brush
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
pursued
by
a
sight
of
the
black
ants
swarming
greedily
upon
the
gray
face
and
venturing
horribly
near
to
the
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
time
he
paused
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
breathless
and
panting
*punct* ,
listened
*punct* .
*break*
he
imagined
some
strange
voice
would
come
from
the
dead
throat
and
squawk
after
him
in
horrible
menaces
*punct* .
*break*
the
trees
about
the
portal
of
the
chapel
moved
soughingly
in
a
soft
wind
*punct* .
*break*
a
sad
silence
was
upon
the
little
guarding
edifice
*punct* .
*break*
the
trees
began
softly
to
sing
a
hymn
of
twi
*punct* -
light
*punct* .
*break*
the
sun
sank
until
slanted
bronze
rays
struck
the
forest
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
lull
in
the
noises
of
insects
as
if
they
had
bowed
their
beaks
and
were
making
a
devotional
pause
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
silence
save
for
the
chanted
chorus
of
the
trees
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
upon
this
stillness
*punct* ,
there
suddenly
broke
a
tremendous
clangor
of
sounds
*punct* .
*break*
a
crimson
roar
came
from
the
distance
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
stopped
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
transfixed
by
this
terrific
medley
of
all
noises
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
as
if
worlds
were
being
rended
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
the
rip
*punct* -
ping
sound
of
musketry
and
the
breaking
crash
of
the
artillery
*punct* .
*break*
his
mind
flew
in
all
directions
*punct* .
*break*
he
conceived
the
two
armies
to
be
at
each
other
panther
fashion
*punct* .
*break*
he
listened
for
a
time
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
began
to
run
in
the
direction
of
the
battle
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
that
it
was
an
ironical
thing
for
him
to
be
run
*punct* -
ning
thus
toward
that
which
he
had
been
at
such
82
pains
to
avoid
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
said
*punct* ,
in
substance
*punct* ,
to
him
*punct* -
self
that
if
the
earth
and
the
moon
were
about
to
clash
*punct* ,
many
persons
would
doubtless
plan
to
get
upon
the
roofs
to
witness
the
collision
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
ran
*punct* ,
he
became
aware
that
the
forest
had
stopped
its
music
*punct* ,
as
if
at
last
becoming
capable
of
hearing
the
foreign
sounds
*punct* .
*break*
the
trees
hushed
and
stood
motionless
*punct* .
*break*
everything
seemed
to
be
listening
to
the
crackle
and
clatter
and
ear
*punct* -
shaking
thunder
*punct* .
*break*
the
chorus
pealed
over
the
still
earth
*punct* .
*break*
it
suddenly
occurred
to
the
youth
that
the
fight
in
which
he
had
been
was
*punct* ,
after
all
*punct* ,
but
perfunctory
popping
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
hearing
of
this
present
din
he
was
doubtful
if
he
had
seen
real
battle
scenes
*punct* .
*break*
this
uproar
explained
a
celes
*punct* -
tial
battle
*punct* ;
it
was
tumbling
hordes
a-struggle
in
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
reflecting
*punct* ,
he
saw
a
sort
of
a
humor
in
the
point
of
view
of
himself
and
his
fellows
during
the
late
encounter
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
taken
themselves
and
the
enemy
very
seriously
and
had
imagined
that
they
were
deciding
the
war
*punct* .
*break*
individuals
must
have
supposed
that
they
were
cutting
the
letters
of
their
names
deep
into
everlasting
tablets
of
brass
*punct* ,
or
enshrining
their
reputations
forever
in
the
hearts
of
their
countrymen
*punct* ,
while
*punct* ,
as
to
fact
*punct* ,
the
affair
would
appear
in
printed
reports
under
a
meek
and
immaterial
title
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
saw
that
it
was
good
*punct* ,
else
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
in
battle
every
one
would
surely
run
save
forlorn
hopes
and
their
ilk
*punct* .
*break*
he
went
rapidly
on
*punct* .
*break*
he
wished
to
come
to
the
edge
of
the
forest
that
he
might
peer
out
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
hastened
*punct* ,
there
passed
through
his
mind
pictures
of
stupendous
conflicts
*punct* .
*break*
his
accumulated
thought
upon
such
subjects
was
used
to
form
scenes
*punct* .
*break*
the
noise
was
as
the
voice
of
an
eloquent
being
*punct* ,
describing
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
the
brambles
formed
chains
and
tried
to
hold
him
back
*punct* .
*break*
trees
*punct* ,
confronting
him
*punct* ,
stretched
out
their
arms
and
forbade
him
to
pass
*punct* .
*break*
after
its
previous
hostility
this
new
resistance
of
the
forest
filled
him
with
a
fine
bitterness
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
that
nature
could
not
be
quite
ready
to
kill
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
obstinately
took
roundabout
ways
*punct* ,
and
presently
he
was
where
he
could
see
long
gray
walls
of
vapor
where
lay
battle
lines
*punct* .
*break*
the
voices
of
cannon
shook
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
musketry
sounded
in
long
irregular
surges
that
played
havoc
with
his
ears
*punct* .
*break*
he
stood
regardant
for
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
his
eyes
had
an
awestruck
expression
*punct* .
*break*
he
gawked
in
the
direction
of
the
fight
*punct* .
*break*
presently
he
proceeded
again
on
his
forward
way
*punct* .
*break*
the
battle
was
like
the
grinding
of
an
immense
and
terrible
machine
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
its
com
*punct* -
plexities
and
powers
*punct* ,
its
grim
processes
*punct* ,
fascinated
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
go
close
and
see
it
produce
corpses
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
to
a
fence
and
clambered
over
it
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
far
side
*punct* ,
the
ground
was
littered
with
clothes
and
guns
*punct* .
*break*
a
newspaper
*punct* ,
folded
up
*punct* ,
lay
in
the
dirt
*punct* .
*break*
a
dead
soldier
was
stretched
with
his
face
hidden
in
his
arm
*punct* .
*break*
farther
off
there
was
a
group
of
four
or
five
corpses
keeping
mournful
company
*punct* .
*break*
a
hot
sun
had
blazed
upon
the
spot
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
place
the
youth
felt
that
he
was
an
invader
*punct* .
*break*
this
forgotten
part
of
the
battle
ground
was
owned
by
the
dead
men
*punct* ,
and
he
hurried
*punct* ,
in
the
vague
apprehension
that
one
of
the
swollen
forms
would
rise
and
tell
him
to
begone
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
finally
to
a
road
from
which
he
could
see
in
the
distance
dark
and
agitated
bodies
of
troops
*punct* ,
smoke-fringed
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
lane
was
a
blood-stained
crowd
streaming
to
the
rear
*punct* .
*break*
the
wounded
men
were
cursing
*punct* ,
groaning
*punct* ,
and
wailing
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
air
*punct* ,
always
*punct* ,
was
a
mighty
swell
of
sound
that
it
seemed
could
sway
the
earth
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
courageous
words
of
the
artillery
and
the
spiteful
sentences
of
the
musketry
mingled
red
cheers
*punct* .
*break*
and
from
this
region
of
noises
came
the
steady
current
of
the
maimed
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
the
wounded
men
had
a
shoeful
of
blood
*punct* .
*break*
he
hopped
like
a
schoolboy
in
a
game
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
laughing
hysterically
*punct* .
*break*
one
was
swearing
that
he
had
been
shot
in
the
arm
through
the
commanding
general's
misman
*punct* -
agement
of
the
army
*punct* .
*break*
one
was
marching
with
an
air
imitative
of
some
sublime
drum
major
*punct* .
*break*
upon
his
features
was
an
unholy
mixture
of
merriment
and
agony
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
marched
he
sang
a
bit
of
doggerel
in
a
high
and
quavering
voice
*punct* :
sing
a
song
a
vic'try
*punct* ,
a
pocketful
a
bullets
*punct* ,
five
an
twenty
dead
men
baked
in
a
*punct* ,
pie
*punct* .
*break*
parts
of
the
procession
limped
and
staggered
to
this
tune
*punct* .
*break*
another
had
the
gray
seal
of
death
already
upon
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
his
lips
were
curled
in
hard
lines
and
his
teeth
were
clinched
*punct* .
*break*
his
hands
were
bloody
from
where
he
had
pressed
them
upon
his
wound
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
to
be
awaiting
the
moment
when
he
should
pitch
headlong
*punct* .
*break*
he
stalked
like
the
specter
of
a
soldier
*punct* ,
his
eyes
burning
with
the
power
of
a
stare
into
the
unknown
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
some
who
proceeded
sullenly
*punct* ,
full
of
anger
at
their
wounds
*punct* ,
and
ready
to
turn
upon
anything
as
an
obscure
cause
*punct* .
*break*
an
officer
was
carried
along
by
two
privates
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
peevish
*punct* .
*break*
don't
joggle
so
*punct* ,
johnson
*punct* ,
yeh
fool
*punct* ,
he
cried
*punct* .
*break*
if
yeh
can't
carry
me
decent
*punct* ,
put
me
down
an
let
some
one
else
do
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
bellowed
at
the
tottering
crowd
who
blocked
the
quick
march
of
his
bearers
*punct* .
*break*
say
*punct* ,
make
way
there
*punct* ,
can't
yeh
*punct* ?
*break*
make
way
*punct* ,
dickens
take
it
all
*punct* .
*break*
they
sulkily
parted
and
went
to
the
road
*punct* -
sides
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
was
carried
past
they
made
pert
remarks
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
raged
in
reply
and
threatened
them
*punct* ,
they
told
him
to
be
damned
*punct* .
*break*
the
shoulder
of
one
of
the
tramping
bearers
knocked
heavily
against
the
spectral
soldier
who
was
staring
into
the
unknown
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
joined
this
crowd
and
marched
along
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
torn
bodies
expressed
the
awful
machinery
in
which
the
men
had
been
entangled
*punct* .
*break*
orderlies
and
couriers
occasionally
broke
through
the
throng
in
the
roadway
*punct* ,
scattering
wounded
men
right
and
left
*punct* ,
galloping
on
fol
*punct* -
lowed
by
howls
*punct* .
*break*
the
melancholy
march
was
continually
disturbed
by
the
messengers
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
by
bustling
batteries
that
came
swing
*punct* -
ing
and
thumping
down
upon
them
*punct* ,
the
officers
shouting
orders
to
clear
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
tattered
man
*punct* ,
fouled
with
dust
*punct* ,
blood
and
powder
stain
from
hair
to
shoes
*punct* ,
who
trudged
quietly
at
the
youth's
side
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
lis
*punct* -
tening
with
eagerness
and
much
humility
to
the
lurid
descriptions
of
a
bearded
sergeant
*punct* .
*break*
his
lean
features
wore
an
expression
of
awe
and
ad
*punct* -
miration
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
like
a
listener
in
a
country
store
to
wondrous
tales
told
among
the
sugar
barrels
*punct* .
*break*
he
eyed
the
story-teller
with
unspeak
*punct* -
able
wonder
*punct* .
*break*
his
mouth
was
agape
in
yokel
fashion
*punct* .
*break*
the
sergeant
*punct* ,
taking
note
of
this
*punct* ,
gave
pause
to
his
elaborate
history
while
he
administered
a
sardonic
comment
*punct* .
*break*
be
keerful
*punct* ,
honey
*punct* ,
you
ll
be
a-ketchin
flies
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
the
tattered
man
shrank
back
abashed
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
time
he
began
to
sidle
near
to
the
youth
*punct* ,
and
in
a
different
way
try
to
make
him
a
friend
*punct* .
*break*
his
voice
was
gentle
as
a
girl's
voice
and
his
eyes
were
pleading
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
saw
with
surprise
that
the
soldier
had
two
wounds
*punct* ,
one
in
the
head
*punct* ,
bound
with
a
blood-soaked
rag
*punct* ,
and
the
other
in
the
arm
*punct* ,
making
that
member
dangle
like
a
broken
bough
*punct* .
*break*
after
they
had
walked
together
for
some
time
the
tattered
man
mustered
sufficient
courage
to
speak
*punct* .
*break*
was
pretty
good
fight
*punct* ,
wa'n't
it
*punct* ?
*break*
he
timidly
said
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
deep
in
thought
*punct* ,
glanced
up
at
the
bloody
and
grim
figure
with
its
lamblike
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
was
pretty
good
fight
*punct* ,
wa'n't
it
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
the
youth
shortly
*punct* .
*break*
he
quick
*punct* -
ened
his
pace
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
other
hobbled
industriously
after
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
an
air
of
apology
in
his
manner
*punct* ,
but
he
evidently
thought
that
he
needed
only
to
talk
for
a
time
*punct* ,
and
the
youth
would
perceive
that
he
was
a
good
fellow
*punct* .
*break*
was
pretty
good
fight
*punct* ,
wa'n't
it
*punct* ?
*break*
he
began
in
a
small
voice
*punct* ,
and
then
he
achieved
the
forti
*punct* -
tude
to
continue
*punct* .
*break*
dern
me
if
i
ever
see
fellers
fight
so
*punct* .
*break*
laws
*punct* ,

*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
they're
fighters
*punct* ,
they
be
*punct* .
*break*
he
breathed
a
deep
breath
of
humble
ad
*punct* -
miration
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
looked
at
the
youth
for
en
*punct* -
couragement
several
times
*punct* .
*break*
he
received
none
*punct* ,
but
gradually
he
seemed
to
get
absorbed
in
his
subject
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
talkin
cross
pickets
with
a
boy
from
georgie
*punct* ,
onct
*punct* ,
an
that
boy
*punct* ,

*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
they

*punct* ,
an
fit
*punct* ,
an
fit
*punct* .
*break*
his
homely
face
was
suffused
with
a
light
of
love
for
the
army
which
was
to
him
all
things
beautiful
and
powerful
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
time
he
turned
to
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
where
yeh
hit
*punct* ,
ol
boy
*punct* ?
*break*
he
asked
in
a
brotherly
tone
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
felt
instant
panic
at
this
question
*punct* ,
although
at
first
its
full
import
was
not
borne
in
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
where
yeh
hit
*punct* ?
*break*
repeated
the
tattered
man
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
began
the
youth
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
he
turned
away
suddenly
and
slid
through
the
crowd
*punct* .
*break*
his
brow
was
heavily
flushed
*punct* ,
and
his
fingers
were
picking
nervously
at
one
of
his
buttons
*punct* .
*break*
he
bent
his
head
and
fastened
his
eyes
studiously
upon
the
button
as
if
it
were
a
little
problem
*punct* .
*break*
the
tattered
man
looked
after
him
in
aston
*punct* -
ishment
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
fell
back
in
the
procession
until
the
tattered
soldier
was
not
in
sight
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
started
to
walk
on
with
the
others
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
was
amid
wounds
*punct* .
*break*
the
mob
of
men
was
bleeding
*punct* .
*break*
because
of
the
tattered
soldier's
question
he
now
felt
that
his
shame
could
be
viewed
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
continually
casting
sidelong
glances
to
see
if
the
men
were
contemplating
the
letters
of
guilt
he
felt
burned
into
his
brow
*punct* .
*break*
at
times
he
regarded
the
wounded
soldiers
in
an
envious
way
*punct* .
*break*
he
conceived
persons
with
torn
bodies
to
be
peculiarly
happy
*punct* .
*break*
he
wished
that
he
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
had
a
wound
*punct* ,
a
red
badge
of
cour
*punct* -
age
*punct* .
*break*
the
spectral
soldier
was
at
his
side
like
a
stalking
reproach
*punct* .
*break*
the
man's
eyes
were
still
fixed
in
a
stare
into
the
unknown
*punct* .
*break*
his
gray
*punct* ,
appalling
face
had
attracted
attention
in
the
crowd
*punct* ,
and
men
*punct* ,
slowing
to
his
dreary
pace
*punct* ,
were
walking
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
discussing
his
plight
*punct* ,
questioning
him
and
giving
him
advice
*punct* .
*break*
91
in
a
dogged
way
he
repelled
them
*punct* ,
signing
to
them
to
go
on
and
leave
him
alone
*punct* .
*break*
the
shadows
of
his
face
were
deepening
and
his
tight
lips
seemed
holding
in
check
the
moan
of
great
despair
*punct* .
*break*
there
could
be
seen
a
certain
stiffness
in
the
movements
of
his
body
*punct* ,
as
if
he
were
taking
infinite
care
not
to
arouse
the
passion
of
his
wounds
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
went
on
*punct* ,
he
seemed
always
look
*punct* -
ing
for
a
place
*punct* ,
like
one
who
goes
to
choose
a
grave
*punct* .
*break*
something
in
the
gesture
of
the
man
as
he
waved
the
bloody
and
pitying
soldiers
away
made
the
youth
start
as
if
bitten
*punct* .
*break*
he
yelled
in
horror
*punct* .
*break*
tottering
forward
he
laid
a
quivering
hand
upon
the
man's
arm
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
latter
slowly
turned
his
waxlike
features
toward
him
*punct* ,
the
youth
screamed
*punct* :
gawd
*punct* !
*break*
the
tall
soldier
made
a
little
commonplace
smile
*punct* .
*break*
hello
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
swayed
on
his
legs
and
glared
strangely
*punct* .
*break*
he
stuttered
and
stammered
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ,
the
tall
soldier
held
out
his
gory
hand
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
curious
red
and
black
combination
of
new
blood
and
old
blood
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
where
yeh
been
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ?
*break*
he
continued
in
a
monoto
*punct* -
nous
voice
*punct* ,
i
thought
mebbe
yeh
got
keeled
over
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
worryin
about
it
a
good
deal
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
still
lamented
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ,

said
the
tall
soldier
*punct* ,
i
was
out
there
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
a
careful
gesture
*punct* .
*break*
an'
*punct* ,

*punct* ,

circus
*punct* !
*break*
an'

*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
b'jiminey
*punct* ,
i
got
shot
*punct* .
*break*
he
reiterated
this
fact
in
a
bewildered
way
*punct* ,
as
if
he
did
not
know
how
it
came
about
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
put
forth
anxious
arms
to
assist
him
*punct* ,
but
the
tall
soldier
went
firmly
on
as
if
pro
*punct* -
pelled
*punct* .
*break*
since
the
youth's
arrival
as
a
guardian
for
his
friend
*punct* ,
the
other
wounded
men
had
ceased
to
display
much
interest
*punct* .
*break*
they
occupied
them
*punct* -
selves
again
in
dragging
their
own
tragedies
toward
the
rear
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
*punct* ,
as
the
two
friends
marched
on
*punct* ,
the
tall
soldier
seemed
to
be
overcome
by
a
terror
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
turned
to
a
semblance
of
gray
paste
*punct* .
*break*
he
clutched
the
youth's
arm
and
looked
all
about
him
*punct* ,
as
if
dreading
to
be
overheard
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
take
care
of
yeh
*punct* !
*break*
sure
*punct* ,
will
yeh
*punct* ,

*punct* ?
*break*
the
tall
soldier
beseeched
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
i
tell
yeh
*punct* ,
i'll
take
care
of
yeh
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* !
*break*
protested
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
speak
accurately
because
of
the
gulpings
in
his
throat
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
tall
soldier
continued
to
beg
in
a
lowly
way
*punct* .
*break*
he
now
hung
babelike
to
the
youth's
arm
*punct* .
*break*
his
eyes
rolled
in
the
wildness
of
his
terror
*punct* .
*break*
i
ve
allus
been
a
pretty
good
feller
*punct* ,
ain't
i
*punct* ?
*break*
he
paused
in
piteous
anxiety
to
await
his
friend's
reply
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
had
reached
an
anguish
where
the
sobs
scorched
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
strove
to
express
his
loyalty
*punct* ,
but
he
could
only
make
fantastic
gestures
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
the
tall
soldier
seemed
suddenly
to
forget
all
those
fears
*punct* .
*break*
he
became
again
the
grim
*punct* ,
stalking
specter
of
a
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
he
went
stonily
forward
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
wished
his
friend
to
lean
upon
him
*punct* ,
but
the
other
always
shook
his
head
and
strangely
protested
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
leave
me
be
*punct* ,
leave
me
be
*punct* ,
his
look
was
fixed
again
upon
the
unknown
*punct* .
*break*
he
moved
with
mysterious
purpose
*punct* ,
and
all
of
the
youth's
offers
he
brushed
aside
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
leave
me
be
*punct* ,
leave
me
be
*punct* ,
the
youth
had
to
follow
*punct* .
*break*
presently
the
latter
heard
a
voice
talking
softly
near
his
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
turning
he
saw
that
it
belonged
to
the
tattered
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
where
th
blazes
does
he
git
his
stren'th
from
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
shaking
his
hands
helplessly
*punct* .
*break*
he
ran
forward
presently
and
grasped
the
tall
soldier
by
the
arm
*punct* .
*break*
he
coaxed
*punct* ,
come
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
the
tall
soldier
weakly
tried
to
wrench
himself
free
*punct* .
*break*
huh
*punct* ,
he
said
vacantly
*punct* .
*break*
he
stared
at
the
youth
for
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
he
spoke
as
if
dimly
comprehending
*punct* .
*break*
inteh
th
fields
*punct* ?
*break*
he
started
blindly
through
the
grass
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
turned
once
to
look
at
the
lashing
riders
and
jouncing
guns
of
the
battery
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
startled
from
this
view
by
a
shrill
outcry
from
the
tattered
man
*punct* .
*break*
turning
his
head
swiftly
*punct* ,
the
youth
saw
his
friend
running
in
a
staggering
and
stumbling
way
toward
a
little
clump
of
bushes
*punct* .
*break*
his
heart
seemed
to
wrench
itself
almost
free
from
his
body
at
this
sight
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
a
noise
of
pain
*punct* .
*break*
he
and
the
tattered
man
began
a
pursuit
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
singular
race
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
overtook
the
tall
soldier
he
began
to
plead
with
all
the
words
he
could
find
*punct* .
*break*
jim
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ,
what
are
you
doing
*punct* ,
what
makes
you
do
this
way
*punct* ,
you
ll
hurt
yerself
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
purpose
was
in
the
tall
soldier's
face
*punct* .
*break*
he
protested
in
a
dulled
way
*punct* ,
keeping
his
eyes
fastened
on
the
mystic
place
of
his
intentions
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
don't
tech
me
*punct* ,
leave
me
be
*punct* ,
leave
me
be
*punct* ,
the
youth
*punct* ,
aghast
and
filled
with
wonder
at
the
tall
soldier
*punct* ,
began
quaveringly
to
question
him
*punct* .
*break*
where
yeh
goin'
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ?
*break*
what
you
thinking
about
*punct* ?
*break*
where
you
going
*punct* ?
*break*
tell
me
*punct* ,
won't
you
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ?
*break*
the
tall
soldier
faced
about
as
upon
relentless
pursuers
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
eyes
there
was
a
great
appeal
*punct* .
*break*
leave
me
be
*punct* ,
can't
yeh
*punct* ?
*break*
leave
me
be
fer
a
minnit
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
recoiled
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
in
a
dazed
way
*punct* ,
what's
the
matter
with
you
*punct* ?
*break*
the
tall
soldier
turned
and
*punct* ,
lurching
danger
*punct* -
ously
*punct* ,
went
on
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
and
the
tattered
soldier
followed
*punct* ,
sneaking
as
if
whipped
*punct* ,
feeling
unable
to
face
the
stricken
man
if
he
should
again
confront
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
began
to
have
thoughts
of
a
solemn
ceremony
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
something
rite
*punct* -
like
in
these
movements
of
the
doomed
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
was
a
resemblance
in
him
to
a
devotee
of
a
mad
religion
*punct* ,
blood-sucking
*punct* ,
muscle-wrench
*punct* -
ing
*punct* ,
bone-crushing
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
awed
and
afraid
*punct* .
*break*
they
hung
back
lest
he
have
at
command
a
dreadful
weapon
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
they
saw
him
stop
and
stand
motion
*punct* -
less
*punct* .
*break*
hastening
up
*punct* ,
they
perceived
that
his
face
wore
an
expression
telling
that
he
had
at
last
found
the
place
for
which
he
had
struggled
*punct* .
*break*
his
spare
figure
was
erect
*punct* ;
his
bloody
hands
were
quietly
at
his
side
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
waiting
with
patience
for
something
that
he
had
come
to
meet
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
at
the
rendezvous
*punct* .
*break*
they
paused
and
stood
*punct* ,
ex
*punct* -
pectant
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
silence
*punct* .
*break*
finally
*punct* ,
the
chest
of
the
doomed
soldier
began
to
heave
with
a
strained
motion
*punct* .
*break*
it
increased
in
violence
until
it
was
as
if
an
animal
was
within
and
was
kicking
and
tumbling
furiously
to
be
free
*punct* .
*break*
this
spectacle
of
gradual
strangulation
made
the
youth
writhe
*punct* ,
and
once
as
his
friend
rolled
his
eyes
*punct* ,
he
saw
something
in
them
that
made
him
sink
wailing
to
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
he
raised
his
voice
in
a
last
supreme
call
*punct* .
*break*
jim
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ,
jim
*punct* ,
the
tall
soldier
opened
his
lips
and
spoke
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
a
gesture
*punct* .
*break*
leave
me
be
*punct* ,
don't
tech
me
*punct* ,
leave
me
be
*punct* ,
there
was
another
silence
while
he
waited
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
*punct* ,
his
form
stiffened
and
straightened
*punct* .
*break*
then
it
was
shaken
by
a
prolonged
ague
*punct* .
*break*
he
stared
into
space
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
two
watchers
there
was
a
curious
and
profound
dignity
in
the
firm
lines
of
his
awful
face
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
invaded
by
a
creeping
strangeness
that
slowly
enveloped
him
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
the
tremor
of
his
legs
caused
him
to
dance
a
sort
of
hideous
hornpipe
*punct* .
*break*
his
arms
beat
wildly
about
his
head
in
expression
of
implike
enthusiasm
*punct* .
*break*
his
tall
figure
stretched
itself
to
its
full
height
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
slight
rending
sound
*punct* .
*break*
then
it
began
to
swing
forward
*punct* ,
slow
and
straight
*punct* ,
in
the
man
*punct* -
ner
of
a
falling
tree
*punct* .
*break*
a
swift
muscular
contortion
made
the
left
shoulder
strike
the
ground
first
*punct* .
*break*
the
body
seemed
to
bounce
a
little
way
from
the
earth
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
tattered
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
had
watched
*punct* ,
spellbound
*punct* ,
this
ceremony
at
the
place
of
meeting
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
had
been
twisted
into
an
expression
of
every
agony
he
had
imagined
for
his
friend
*punct* .
*break*
he
now
sprang
to
his
feet
and
*punct* ,
going
closer
*punct* ,
gazed
upon
the
pastelike
face
*punct* .
*break*
the
mouth
was
open
and
the
teeth
showed
in
a
laugh
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
flap
of
the
blue
jacket
fell
away
from
the
body
*punct* ,
he
could
see
that
the
side
looked
as
if
it
had
been
chewed
by
wolves
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
turned
*punct* ,
with
sudden
*punct* ,
livid
rage
*punct* ,
toward
the
battlefield
*punct* .
*break*
he
shook
his
fist
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
about
to
deliver
a
philippic
*punct* .
*break*
hell
*punct* ,
the
red
sun
was
pasted
in
the
sky
like
a
wafer
*punct* .
*break*
the
tattered
man
stood
musing
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
he
was
reg'lar
jim-dandy
fer
nerve
*punct* ,
wa'n't
he
*punct* ,
said
he
finally
in
a
little
awestruck
voice
*punct* .
*break*
a
reg'lar
jim-dandy
*punct* .
*break*
he
thoughtfully
poked
one
of
the
docile
hands
with
his
foot
*punct* .
*break*
i
wonner
where
he
got
is
stren'th
from
*punct* ?
*break*
i
never
seen
a
man
do
like
that
before
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
funny
thing
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
he
was
a
reg'lar
jim-dandy
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
desired
to
screech
out
his
grief
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
stabbed
*punct* ,
but
his
tongue
lay
dead
in
the
tomb
of
his
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
he
threw
himself
again
upon
the
ground
and
began
to
brood
*punct* .
*break*
the
tattered
man
stood
musing
*punct* .
*break*
look-a-here
*punct* ,
pardner
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
after
a
time
*punct* .
*break*
he
regarded
the
corpse
as
he
spoke
*punct* .
*break*
this
here
thing
is
all
over
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
won't
bother
im
*punct* .
*break*
an
i
must
say
i
ain't
enjoying
any
great
health
m'self
these
days
*punct* .
*break*
100
the
youth
*punct* ,
awakened
by
the
tattered
soldier's
tone
*punct* ,
looked
quickly
up
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
that
he
was
swinging
uncertainly
on
his
legs
and
that
his
face
had
turned
to
a
shade
of
blue
*punct* .
*break*
he
cried
*punct* ,
you
ain't
goin
t'
*punct* ,
not
you
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
the
tattered
man
waved
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
nary
die
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
all
i
want
is
some
pea
soup
an
a
good
bed
*punct* .
*break*
some
pea
soup
*punct* ,
he
repeated
dreamfully
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
arose
from
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
i
wonder
where
he
came
from
*punct* .
*break*
i
left
him
over
there
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
i
find
im
here
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
was
coming
from
over
there
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
he
in
*punct* -
dicated
a
new
direction
*punct* .
*break*
they
both
turned
toward
the
body
as
if
to
ask
of
it
a
question
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
nodded
an
assent
wearily
*punct* .
*break*
they
both
turned
to
gaze
for
a
moment
at
the
corpse
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
murmured
something
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
tattered
man
as
if
in
response
*punct* .
*break*
they
turned
their
backs
upon
it
and
started
away
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
time
they
stole
softly
*punct* ,
treading
with
their
toes
*punct* .
*break*
it
remained
laughing
there
in
the
grass
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
groaned
*punct* .
*break*
he
won
*punct* -
dered
if
he
was
to
be
the
tortured
witness
of
another
grim
encounter
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
companion
waved
his
hand
reassur
*punct* -
ingly
*punct* .
*break*

*break*

*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
glancing
at
his
companion
could
see
by
the
shadow
of
a
smile
that
he
was
making
some
kind
of
fun
*punct* .
*break*
as
they
plodded
on
the
tattered
soldier
con
*punct* -
tinued
to
talk
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
if

they
went
slowly
on
in
silence
*punct* .

said
the
tattered
man
at

*punct* .

*break*
but
he
continued
his
harangue
with
*punct* -
out
waiting
for
a
reply
*punct* .
*break*

*break*
the
youth
had
been
wriggling
since
the
intro
*punct* -
duction
of
this
topic
*punct* .
*break*
he
now
gave
a
cry
of
ex
*punct* -
asperation
and
made
a
furious
motion
with
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
don't
bother
me
*punct* !
*break*
he
was
enraged
against
the
tattered
man
*punct* ,
and
could
have
strangled
him
*punct* .
*break*
his
companions
seemed
ever
to
play
intolerable
parts
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
ever
uprais
*punct* -
ing
the
ghost
of
shame
on
the
stick
of
their
curiosity
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
toward
the
tattered
man
as
one
at
bay
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
don't
bother

*punct* ,
he

said
the

*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
who
had
been
holding
a
bitter
de
*punct* -
bate
with
himself
and
casting
glances
of
hatred
and
contempt
at
the
tattered
man
*punct* ,
here
spoke
in
a
hard
voice
*punct* .
*break*
good-by
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
the
tattered
man
looked
at

in
gaping
amazement
*punct* .
*break*
why

*punct* ,

*break*
he
asked
unsteadily
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
looking
at
him
*punct* ,
could
see
that
he
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
like
that
other
one
*punct* ,
was
beginning
to
act
dumb
and
animal-like
*punct* .
*break*
his
thoughts
seemed
to
be
floundering
about
in
his
head
*punct* .
*break*

the

pointed
vaguely

*break*
over

he
replied
*punct* .
*break*
well

said
the
tattered
man
*punct* ,
rambling
on
in
idiot
fashion
*punct* .
*break*
his
head
was
hanging
forward
and
his
words
were
slurred
*punct* .
*break*

*break*
in
reply
the
youth
climbed
a
fence
and
started
away
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
hear
the
tattered
man
bleating
plaintively
*punct* .
*break*
once
he
faced
about
angrily
*punct* .
*break*

*break*
turning
at
a
distance
he
saw
the
tattered
man
wandering
about
helplessly
in
the
field
*punct* .
*break*
he
now
thought
that
he
wished
he
was
dead
*punct* .
*break*
he
believed
that
he
envied
those
men
whose
bodies
lay
strewn
over
the
grass
of
the
fields
and
on
the
fallen
leaves
of
the
forest
*punct* .
*break*
the
simple
questions
of
the
tattered
man
had
been
knife
thrusts
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
they
asserted
a
society
that
probes
pitilessly
at
secrets
until
all
is
apparent
*punct* .
*break*
his
late
companion's
chance
persist
*punct* -
ency
made
him
feel
that
he
could
not
keep
his
crime
concealed
in
his
bosom
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
sure
to
be
brought
plain
by
one
of
those
arrows
which
cloud
the
air
and
are
constantly
pricking
*punct* ,
dis
*punct* -
covering
*punct* ,
proclaiming
those
things
which
are
willed
to
be
forever
hidden
*punct* .
*break*
he
admitted
that
he
could
not
defend
himself
against
this
agency
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
within
the
power
of
vigilance
*punct* .
*break*
he
became
aware
that
the
furnace
roar
of
the
battle
was
growing
louder
*punct* .
*break*
great
brown
clouds
had
floated
to
the
still
heights
of
air
before
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
noise
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
was
approaching
*punct* .
*break*
the
woods
filtered
men
and
the
fields
became
dotted
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
rounded
a
hillock
*punct* ,
he
perceived
that
the
roadway
was
now
a
crying
mass
of
wagons
*punct* ,
teams
*punct* ,
and
men
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
heaving
tangle
issued
exhortations
*punct* ,
commands
*punct* ,
imprecations
*punct* .
*break*
fear
was
sweeping
it
all
along
*punct* .
*break*
the
cracking
whips
bit
and
horses
plunged
and
tugged
*punct* .
*break*
the
white
*punct* -
topped
wagons
strained
and
stumbled
in
their
exertions
like
fat
sheep
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
felt
comforted
in
a
measure
by
this
sight
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
all
retreating
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
he
was
not
so
bad
after
all
*punct* .
*break*
he
seated
himself
and
watched
the
terror-stricken
wagons
*punct* .
*break*
they
fled
like
soft
*punct* ,
ungainly
animals
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
roarers
and
lashers
served
to
help
him
to
magnify
the
dangers
and
horrors
of
the
engagement
that
he
107
might
try
to
prove
to
himself
that
the
thing
with
which
men
could
charge
him
was
in
truth
a
symmetrical
act
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
an
amount
of
pleas
*punct* -
ure
to
him
in
watching
the
wild
march
of
this
vindication
*punct* .
*break*
presently
the
calm
head
of
a
forward-going
column
of
infantry
appeared
in
the
road
*punct* .
*break*
it
came
swiftly
on
*punct* .
*break*
avoiding
the
obstructions
gave
it
the
sinuous
movement
of
a
serpent
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
at
the
head
butted
mules
with
their
musket
stocks
*punct* .
*break*
they
prodded
teamsters
indifferent
to
all
howls
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
forced
their
way
through
parts
of
the
dense
mass
by
strength
*punct* .
*break*
the
blunt
head
of
the
column
pushed
*punct* .
*break*
the
raving
team
*punct* -
sters
swore
many
strange
oaths
*punct* .
*break*
the
commands
to
make
way
had
the
ring
of
a
great
importance
in
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
were
going
forward
to
the
heart
of
the
din
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
to
confront
the
eager
rush
of
the
enemy
*punct* .
*break*
they
felt
the
pride
of
their
onward
movement
when
the
remainder
of
the
army
seemed
trying
to
dribble
down
this
road
*punct* .
*break*
they
tumbled
teams
about
with
a
fine
feeling
that
it
was
no
matter
so
long
as
their
column
got
to
the
front
in
time
*punct* .
*break*
this
importance
made
their
faces
grave
and
stern
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
backs
of
the
officers
were
very
rigid
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
youth
looked
at
them
the
black
weight
of
his
woe
returned
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
that
he
was
regarding
a
procession
of
chosen
beings
*punct* .
*break*
the
separation
was
as
great
to
him
as
if
they
had
marched
with
weapons
of
flame
and
banners
of
sunlight
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
never
be
like
them
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
have
wept
in
his
longings
*punct* .
*break*
he
searched
about
in
his
mind
for
an
ade
*punct* -
quate
malediction
for
the
indefinite
cause
*punct* ,
the
thing
upon
which
men
turn
the
words
of
final
blame
*punct* .
*break*
it
*punct* ,
whatever
it
was
*punct* ,
was
responsible
for
him
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
there
lay
the
fault
*punct* .
*break*
the
haste
of
the
column
to
reach
the
battle
seemed
to
the
forlorn
young
man
to
be
some
*punct* -
thing
much
finer
than
stout
fighting
*punct* .
*break*
heroes
*punct* ,
he
thought
*punct* ,
could
find
excuses
in
that
long
seething
lane
*punct* .
*break*
they
could
retire
with
perfect
self-respect
and
make
excuses
to
the
stars
*punct* .
*break*
he
wondered
what
those
men
had
eaten
that
they
could
be
in
such
haste
to
force
their
way
to
grim
chances
of
death
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
watched
his
envy
grew
until
he
thought
that
he
wished
to
change
lives
with
one
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
have
liked
to
have
used
a
tremendous
force
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
throw
off
himself
and
become
a
better
*punct* .
*break*
swift
pictures
of
himself
*punct* ,
apart
*punct* ,
yet
in
himself
*punct* ,
came
to
him
*punct* ,
a
blue
desperate
figure
leading
lurid
charges
with
one
knee
forward
and
a
broken
blade
high
*punct* ,
a
blue
*punct* ,
determined
figure
standing
before
a
crimson
and
steel
assault
*punct* ,
getting
calmly
killed
on
a
high
place
before
the
eyes
of
all
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
of
the
magnificent
pathos
of
his
dead
body
*punct* .
*break*
these
thoughts
uplifted
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
the
quiver
of
war
desire
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
ears
*punct* ,
he
heard
the
ring
of
victory
*punct* .
*break*
he
knew
the
frenzy
of
a
rapid
successful
charge
*punct* .
*break*
the
music
of
the
trampling
feet
*punct* ,
the
sharp
voices
*punct* ,
the
clanking
arms
of
the
column
near
him
made
him
soar
on
the
red
wings
of
war
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
few
moments
he
was
sublime
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
that
he
was
about
to
start
for
the
front
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
he
saw
a
picture
of
himself
*punct* ,
dust
*punct* -
stained
*punct* ,
haggard
*punct* ,
panting
*punct* ,
flying
to
the
front
at
the
proper
moment
to
seize
and
throttle
the
dark
*punct* ,
leering
witch
of
calamity
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
difficulties
of
the
thing
began
to
drag
at
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
hesitated
*punct* ,
balancing
awkwardly
on
one
foot
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
no
rifle
*punct* ;
he
could
not
fight
with
his
hands
*punct* ,
said
he
resentfully
to
his
plan
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
rifles
could
be
had
for
the
picking
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
extraordinarily
profuse
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
he
continued
*punct* ,
it
would
be
a
miracle
if
he
found
his
regiment
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
he
could
fight
with
any
regiment
*punct* .
*break*
he
started
forward
slowly
*punct* .
*break*
he
stepped
as
if
he
expected
to
tread
upon
some
explosive
thing
*punct* .
*break*
doubts
and
he
were
struggling
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
truly
be
a
worm
if
any
of
his
com
*punct* -
rades
should
see
him
returning
thus
*punct* ,
the
marks
of
his
flight
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
reply
that
the
intent
fighters
did
not
care
for
what
happened
rearward
saving
that
no
hostile
bayonets
ap
*punct* -
peared
there
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
battle-blur
his
face
would
*punct* ,
in
a
way
be
hidden
*punct* ,
like
the
face
of
a
cowled
man
*punct* .
*break*
but
then
he
said
that
his
tireless
fate
would
bring
forth
*punct* ,
when
the
strife
lulled
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
a
man
to
ask
of
him
an
explanation
*punct* .
*break*
in
imagina
*punct* -
tion
he
felt
the
scrutiny
of
his
companions
as
he
painfully
labored
through
some
lies
*punct* .
*break*
eventually
*punct* ,
his
courage
expended
itself
upon
these
objections
*punct* .
*break*
the
debates
drained
him
of
his
fire
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
not
cast
down
by
this
defeat
of
his
plan
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
upon
studying
the
affair
carefully
*punct* ,
he
could
not
but
admit
that
the
objections
were
very
formidable
*punct* .
*break*
furthermore
*punct* ,
various
ailments
had
begun
to
cry
out
*punct* .
*break*
in
their
presence
he
could
not
persist
in
flying
high
with
the
wings
of
war
*punct* ;
they
rendered
it
almost
impossible
for
him
to
see
him
*punct* -
self
in
a
heroic
light
*punct* .
*break*
he
tumbled
headlong
*punct* .
*break*
he
discovered
that
he
had
a
scorching
thirst
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
was
so
dry
and
grimy
that
he
thought
he
could
feel
his
skin
crackle
*punct* .
*break*
each
bone
of
his
body
had
an
ache
in
it
*punct* ,
and
seemingly
threatened
to
break
with
each
movement
*punct* .
*break*
his
feet
were
like
two
sores
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
his
body
was
calling
for
food
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
more
powerful
than
a
direct
hunger
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
dull
*punct* ,
weight
like
feeling
in
his
stom
*punct* -
ach
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
when
he
tried
to
walk
*punct* ,
his
head
swayed
and
he
tottered
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
see
with
distinct
*punct* -
ness
*punct* .
*break*
small
patches
of
green
mist
floated
before
his
vision
*punct* .
*break*
while
he
had
been
tossed
by
many
emotions
*punct* ,
he
had
not
been
aware
of
ailments
*punct* .
*break*
now
they
beset
him
and
made
clamor
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
was
at
last
compelled
to
pay
attention
to
them
*punct* ,
his
capacity
for
self-hate
was
multiplied
*punct* .
*break*
in
despair
*punct* ,
he
declared
that
he
was
not
like
those
others
*punct* .
*break*
he
now
conceded
it
to
be
impossible
that
he
should
ever
become
a
hero
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
craven
loon
*punct* .
*break*
those
pictures
of
glory
were
piteous
things
*punct* .
*break*
he
groaned
from
his
heart
and
went
staggering
off
*punct* .
*break*
a
certain
mothlike
quality
within
him
kept
him
in
the
vicinity
of
the
battle
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
great
desire
to
see
*punct* ,
and
to
get
news
*punct* .
*break*
he
wished
to
know
who
was
winning
*punct* .
*break*
he
told
himself
that
*punct* ,
despite
his
unprecedented
suffering
*punct* ,
he
had
never
lost
his
greed
for
a
victory
*punct* ,
yet
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
in
a
half-apologetic
manner
to
his
conscience
*punct* ,
he
could
not
but
know
that
a
defeat
for
the
army
this
time
might
mean
many
favor
*punct* -
able
things
for
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
blows
of
the
enemy
would
splinter
regiments
into
fragments
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
many
men
of
courage
*punct* ,
he
considered
*punct* ,
would
be
obliged
to
desert
the
colors
and
scurry
like
chickens
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
appear
as
one
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
would
be
sullen
brothers
in
distress
*punct* ,
and
he
could
then
easily
believe
he
had
not
run
any
farther
or
faster
than
they
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
he
himself
could
believe
in
his
virtuous
perfection
*punct* ,
he
con
*punct* -
ceived
that
there
would
be
small
trouble
in
con
*punct* -
vincing
all
others
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
*punct* ,
as
if
in
excuse
for
this
hope
*punct* ,
that
previously
the
army
had
encountered
great
defeats
and
in
a
few
months
had
shaken
off
all
blood
and
tradition
of
them
*punct* ,
emerging
as
bright
and
valiant
as
a
new
one
*punct* ;
thrusting
out
of
sight
the
memory
of
disaster
*punct* ,
and
appearing
with
the
valor
and
confidence
of
unconquered
legions
*punct* .
*break*
the
shrilling
voices
of
the
people
at
home
would
pipe
dismally
for
a
time
*punct* ,
but
various
generals
were
usually
compelled
to
listen
to
these
ditties
*punct* .
*break*
he
of
course
felt
no
compunctions
for
proposing
a
general
as
a
sacrifice
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
not
tell
who
the
chosen
for
the
barbs
might
be
*punct* ,
so
he
could
center
no
direct
sympathy
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
people
were
afar
and
he
did
not
conceive
public
opinion
to
be
accurate
at
long
range
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
quite
probable
they
would
hit
the
wrong
man
who
*punct* ,
after
he
had
recovered
from
his
amazement
would
perhaps
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
in
writ
*punct* -
ing
replies
to
the
songs
of
his
alleged
failure
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
very
unfortunate
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* ,
but
in
this
case
a
general
was
of
no
consequence
to
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
defeat
there
would
be
a
roundabout
vindication
of
himself
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
it
would
prove
*punct* ,
in
a
manner
*punct* ,
that
he
had
fled
early
because
of
his
superior
powers
of
perception
*punct* .
*break*
a
serious
prophet
upon
predicting
a
flood
should
be
the
first
man
to
climb
a
tree
*punct* .
*break*
this
would
demon
*punct* -
strate
that
he
was
indeed
a
seer
*punct* .
*break*
a
moral
vindication
was
regarded
by
the
youth
as
a
very
important
thing
*punct* .
*break*
without
salve
*punct* ,
he
could
not
*punct* ,
he
thought
*punct* ,
wear
the
sore
badge
of
his
dishonor
through
life
*punct* .
*break*
with
his
heart
con
*punct* -
tinually
assuring
him
that
he
was
despicable
*punct* ,
he
could
not
exist
without
making
it
*punct* ,
through
his
actions
*punct* ,
apparent
to
all
men
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
army
had
gone
gloriously
on
he
would
be
lost
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
din
meant
that
now
his
army's
flags
were
tilted
forward
he
was
a
condemned
wretch
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
be
compelled
to
doom
himself
to
isolation
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
men
were
advancing
*punct* ,
their
indifferent
feet
were
trampling
upon
his
chances
for
a
successful
life
*punct* .
*break*
as
these
thoughts
went
rapidly
through
his
mind
*punct* ,
he
turned
upon
them
and
tried
to
thrust
them
away
*punct* .
*break*
he
denounced
himself
as
a
villain
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
that
he
was
the
most
unutterably
selfish
man
in
existence
*punct* .
*break*
his
mind
pictured
the
soldiers
who
would
place
their
defiant
bodies
before
the
spear
of
the
yelling
battle
fiend
*punct* ,
and
as
he
saw
their
dripping
corpses
on
an
imagined
field
*punct* ,
he
said
that
he
was
their
murderer
*punct* .
*break*
again
he
thought
that
he
wished
he
was
dead
*punct* .
*break*
he
believed
that
he
envied
a
corpse
*punct* .
*break*
thinking
of
the
slain
*punct* ,
he
achieved
a
great
contempt
for
some
of
them
*punct* ,
as
if
they
were
guilty
for
thus
becoming
lifeless
*punct* .
*break*
they
might
have
been
killed
by
lucky
chances
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
before
they
had
had
opportunities
to
flee
or
before
they
had
been
really
tested
*punct* .
*break*
yet
they
would
receive
laurels
from
tradition
*punct* .
*break*
he
cried
out
bitterly
that
their
crowns
were
stolen
and
their
robes
of
glori
*punct* -
ous
memories
were
shams
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
he
still
said
that
it
was
a
great
pity
he
was
not
as
they
*punct* .
*break*
a
defeat
of
the
army
had
suggested
itself
to
him
as
a
means
of
escape
from
the
consequences
of
his
fall
*punct* .
*break*
he
considered
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
that
it
was
useless
to
think
of
such
a
possibility
*punct* .
*break*
his
education
had
been
that
success
for
that
mighty
blue
machine
was
certain
*punct* ;
that
it
would
make
victories
as
a
contrivance
turns
out
buttons
*punct* .
*break*
he
presently
discarded
all
his
speculations
in
the
other
direction
*punct* .
*break*
he
returned
to
the
creed
of
soldiers
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
perceived
again
that
it
was
not
possible
for
the
army
to
be
defeated
*punct* ,
he
tried
to
bethink
him
of
a
fine
tale
which
he
could
take
back
to
his
regiment
*punct* ,
and
with
it
turn
the
expected
shafts
of
derision
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
he
mortally
feared
these
shafts
*punct* ,
it
became
impossible
for
him
to
invent
a
tale
he
felt
he
could
trust
*punct* .
*break*
he
experimented
with
many
schemes
*punct* ,
but
threw
them
aside
one
by
one
as
flimsy
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
quick
to
see
vulnerable
places
in
them
all
*punct* .
*break*
furthermore
*punct* ,
he
was
much
afraid
that
some
arrow
of
scorn
might
lay
him
mentally
low
before
he
could
raise
his
protecting
tale
*punct* .
*break*
he
imagined
the
whole
regiment
saying
*punct* :
where's
henry
fleming
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
my
*punct* !
*break*
he
recalled
various
persons
who
would
be
quite
sure
to
leave
him
no
peace
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
they
would
doubtless
question
him
with
sneers
*punct* ,
and
laugh
at
his
stammering
hesi
*punct* -
tation
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
next
engagement
they
would
try
to
keep
watch
of
him
to
discover
when
he
would
run
*punct* .
*break*
wherever
he
went
in
camp
*punct* ,
he
would
en
*punct* -
counter
insolent
and
lingeringly
cruel
stares
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
imagined
himself
passing
near
a
crowd
of
comrades
*punct* ,
he
could
hear
some
one
say
*punct* ,
there
he
goes
*punct* !
*break*
then
*punct* ,
as
if
the
heads
were
moved
by
one
muscle
*punct* ,
all
the
faces
were
turned
toward
him
with
wide
*punct* ,
derisive
grins
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
to
hear
some
one
make
a
humorous
remark
in
a
low
tone
*punct* .
*break*
at
it
the
others
all
crowed
and
cackled
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
slang
phrase
*punct* .
*break*
the
column
that
had
butted
stoutly
at
the
obstacles
in
the
roadway
was
barely
out
of
the
youth's
sight
before
he
saw
dark
waves
of
men
come
sweeping
out
of
the
woods
and
down
through
the
fields
*punct* .
*break*
he
knew
at
once
that
the
steel
fibers
had
been
washed
from
their
hearts
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
bursting
from
their
coats
and
their
equipments
as
from
entanglements
*punct* .
*break*
they
charged
down
upon
him
like
terrified
buffaloes
*punct* .
*break*
behind
them
blue
smoke
curled
and
clouded
above
the
treetops
*punct* ,
and
through
the
thickets
he
could
sometimes
see
a
distant
pink
glare
*punct* .
*break*
the
voices
of
the
cannon
were
clamoring
in
intermi
*punct* -
nable
chorus
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
was
horrorstricken
*punct* .
*break*
he
stared
in
agony
and
amazement
*punct* .
*break*
he
forgot
that
he
was
engaged
in
combating
the
universe
*punct* .
*break*
he
threw
aside
his
mental
pamphlets
on
the
philoso
*punct* -
phy
of
the
retreated
and
rules
for
the
guidance
of
the
damned
*punct* .
*break*
118
the
fight
was
lost
*punct* .
*break*
the
dragons
were
com
*punct* -
ing
with
invincible
strides
*punct* .
*break*
the
army
*punct* ,
helpless
in
the
matted
thickets
and
blinded
by
the
over
*punct* -
hanging
night
*punct* ,
was
going
to
be
swallowed
*punct* .
*break*
war
*punct* ,
the
red
animal
*punct* ,
war
*punct* ,
the
blood-swollen
god
*punct* ,
would
have
bloated
fill
*punct* .
*break*
within
him
something
bade
to
cry
out
*punct* .
*break*
soon
he
was
in
the
midst
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
leaping
and
scampering
all
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
their
blanched
faces
shone
in
the
dusk
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
*punct* ,
for
the
most
part
*punct* ,
to
be
very
burly
men
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
turned
from
one
to
another
of
them
as
they
galloped
along
*punct* .
*break*
his
incoherent
questions
were
lost
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
heedless
of
his
appeals
*punct* .
*break*
they
did
not
seem
to
see
him
*punct* .
*break*
they
sometimes
gabbled
insanely
*punct* .
*break*
one
huge
man
was
asking
of
the
sky
*punct* :
say
*punct* ,
where
de
plank
road
*punct* ?
*break*
where
de
plank
road
*punct* !
*break*
it
was
as
if
he
had
lost
a
child
*punct* .
*break*
he
wept
in
his
pain
and
dismay
*punct* .
*break*
presently
*punct* ,
men
were
running
hither
and
thither
in
all
ways
*punct* .
*break*
the
artillery
booming
*punct* ,
forward
*punct* ,
rearward
*punct* ,
and
on
the
flanks
made
jumble
of
ideas
of
direction
*punct* .
*break*
landmarks
had
vanished
into
the
gathered
gloom
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
began
to
imagine
that
he
had
got
into
the
center
of
the
tremendous
quarrel
*punct* ,
and
he
could
perceive
no
way
out
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
mouths
of
the
fleeing
men
came
a
thousand
wild
questions
*punct* ,
but
no
one
made
answers
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
after
rushing
about
and
throwing
interrogations
at
the
heedless
bands
of
retreating
infantry
*punct* ,
finally
clutched
a
man
by
the
arm
*punct* .
*break*
they
swung
around
face
to
face
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
stammered
the
youth
strug
*punct* -
gling
with
his
balking
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
screamed
*punct* :
let
go
me
*punct* !
*break*
let
go
me
*punct* !
*break*
his
face
was
livid
and
his
eyes
were
roll
*punct* -
ing
uncontrolled
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
heaving
and
panting
*punct* .
*break*
he
still
grasped
his
rifle
*punct* ,
perhaps
having
for
*punct* -
gotten
to
release
his
hold
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
tugged
frantically
*punct* ,
and
the
youth
being
compelled
to
lean
forward
was
dragged
several
paces
*punct* .
*break*
let
go
me
*punct* !
*break*
let
go
me
*punct* !
*break*
why
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
stuttered
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
then
*punct* !
*break*
bawled
the
man
in
a
lurid
rage
*punct* .
*break*
he
adroitly
and
fiercely
swung
his
rifle
*punct* .
*break*
it
crushed
upon
the
youth's
head
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
ran
on
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth's
fingers
had
turned
to
paste
upon
the
other's
arm
*punct* .
*break*
the
energy
was
smitten
from
his
muscles
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
the
flaming
wings
of
light
*punct* -
ning
flash
before
his
vision
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
deaf
*punct* -
ening
rumble
of
thunder
within
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
his
legs
seemed
to
die
*punct* .
*break*
he
sank
writhing
to
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
he
tried
to
arise
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
efforts
against
the
numbing
pain
he
was
like
a
man
wrestling
with
a
creature
of
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
sinister
struggle
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
he
would
achieve
a
position
half
erect
*punct* ,
battle
with
the
air
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
and
then
fall
again
*punct* ,
grabbing
at
the
grass
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
was
of
a
clammy
pallor
*punct* .
*break*
deep
groans
were
wrenched
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
with
a
twisting
movement
*punct* ,
he
got
upon
his
hands
and
knees
*punct* ,
and
from
thence
*punct* ,
like
a
babe
trying
to
walk
*punct* ,
to
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
pressing
his
hands
to
his
temples
he
went
lurching
over
the
grass
*punct* .
*break*
he
fought
an
intense
battle
with
his
body
*punct* .
*break*
his
dulled
senses
wished
him
to
swoon
and
he
opposed
them
stubbornly
*punct* ,
his
mind
portraying
unknown
dangers
and
mutilations
if
he
should
fall
upon
the
field
*punct* .
*break*
he
went
tall
soldier
fashion
*punct* .
*break*
he
imagined
secluded
spots
where
he
could
fall
and
be
unmolested
*punct* .
*break*
to
search
for
one
he
strove
against
the
tide
of
his
pain
*punct* .
*break*
once
he
put
his
hand
to
the
top
of
his
head
and
timidly
touched
the
wound
*punct* .
*break*
the
scratching
pain
of
the
contact
made
him
draw
a
long
breath
through
his
clinched
teeth
*punct* .
*break*
his
fingers
were
dabbled
with
blood
*punct* .
*break*
he
regarded
them
with
a
fixed
stare
*punct* .
*break*
around
him
he
could
hear
the
grumble
of
jolted
cannon
as
the
scurrying
horses
were
lashed
toward
the
front
*punct* .
*break*
once
*punct* ,
a
young
officer
on
a
besplashed
charger
nearly
ran
him
down
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
and
watched
the
mass
of
guns
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
and
horses
sweeping
in
a
wide
curve
toward
a
gap
in
a
fence
*punct* .
*break*
the
officer
was
making
excited
motions
with
a
gauntleted
hand
*punct* .
*break*
the
guns
followed
the
teams
with
an
air
of
unwillingness
*punct* ,
of
being
dragged
by
the
heels
*punct* .
*break*
some
officers
of
the
scattered
infantry
were
cursing
and
railing
like
fishwives
*punct* .
*break*
their
scold
*punct* -
ing
voices
could
be
heard
above
the
din
*punct* .
*break*
into
the
unspeakable
jumble
in
the
roadway
rode
a
squadron
of
cavalry
*punct* .
*break*
the
faded
yellow
of
their
facings
shone
bravely
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
mighty
altercation
*punct* .
*break*
the
artillery
were
assembling
as
if
for
a
con
*punct* -
ference
*punct* .
*break*
the
blue
haze
of
evening
was
upon
the
field
*punct* .
*break*
the
lines
of
forest
were
long
purple
shadows
*punct* .
*break*
one
cloud
lay
along
the
western
sky
partly
smothering
the
red
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
youth
left
the
scene
behind
him
*punct* ,
he
heard
the
guns
suddenly
roar
out
*punct* .
*break*
he
imagined
them
shaking
in
black
rage
*punct* .
*break*
they
belched
and
howled
like
brass
devils
guarding
a
gate
*punct* .
*break*
the
soft
air
was
filled
with
the
tremendous
remon
*punct* -
strance
*punct* .
*break*
with
it
came
the
shattering
peal
of
opposing
infantry
*punct* .
*break*
turning
to
look
behind
him
*punct* ,
he
could
see
sheets
of
orange
light
illumine
the
shadowy
distance
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
subtle
and
sudden
lightnings
in
the
far
air
*punct* .
*break*
at
times
he
thought
he
could
see
heaving
masses
of
men
*punct* .
*break*
he
hurried
on
in
the
dusk
*punct* .
*break*
the
day
had
faded
until
he
could
barely
distinguish
place
for
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
the
purple
darkness
was
filled
with
men
who
lectured
and
jabbered
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
he
could
see
them
gesticulating
against
the
blue
and
somber
sky
*punct* .
*break*
there
seemed
to
be
a
great
ruck
of
men
and
munitions
spread
about
in
the
forest
and
in
the
fields
*punct* .
*break*
the
little
narrow
roadway
now
lay
lifeless
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
overturned
wagons
like
sun-dried
bowlders
*punct* .
*break*
the
bed
of
the
former
torrent
was
choked
with
the
bodies
of
horses
and
splintered
parts
of
war
machines
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
come
to
pass
that
his
wound
pained
him
but
little
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
afraid
to
move
rapidly
*punct* ,
how
*punct* -
ever
*punct* ,
for
a
dread
of
disturbing
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
held
his
head
very
still
and
took
many
precautions
against
stumbling
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
filled
with
anxiety
*punct* ,
and
his
face
was
pinched
and
drawn
in
anticipation
of
the
pain
of
any
sudden
mistake
of
his
feet
in
the
gloom
*punct* .
*break*
his
thoughts
*punct* ,
as
he
walked
*punct* ,
fixed
intently
upon
his
hurt
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
cool
*punct* ,
liquid
feeling
about
it
and
he
imagined
blood
moving
slowly
down
under
his
hair
*punct* .
*break*
his
head
seemed
swollen
to
a
size
that
made
him
think
his
neck
to
be
inadequate
*punct* .
*break*
the
new
silence
of
his
wound
made
much
worriment
*punct* .
*break*
the
little
blistering
voices
of
pain
that
had
called
out
from
his
scalp
were
*punct* ,
he
thought
*punct* ,
definite
in
their
expression
of
danger
*punct* .
*break*
by
them
he
believed
that
he
could
measure
his
plight
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
they
remained
ominously
silent
he
became
frightened
and
imagined
ter
*punct* -
rible
fingers
that
clutched
into
his
brain
*punct* .
*break*
amid
it
he
began
to
reflect
upon
various
incidents
and
conditions
of
the
past
*punct* .
*break*
he
be
*punct* -
thought
him
of
certain
meals
his
mother
had
cooked
at
home
*punct* ,
in
which
those
dishes
of
which
he
was
particularly
fond
had
occupied
prominent
positions
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
the
spread
table
*punct* .
*break*
the
pine
walls
of
the
kitchen
were
glowing
in
the
warm
light
from
the
stove
*punct* .
*break*
too
*punct* ,
he
remembered
how
he
and
his
companions
used
to
go
from
the
school
*punct* -
house
to
the
bank
of
a
shaded
pool
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
his
clothes
in
disorderly
array
upon
the
grass
of
the
bank
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
the
swash
of
the
fragrant
water
upon
his
body
*punct* .
*break*
the
leaves
of
the
overhanging
maple
rustled
with
melody
in
the
wind
of
youth
*punct* -
ful
summer
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
overcome
presently
by
a
dragging
weariness
*punct* .
*break*
his
head
hung
forward
and
his
shoulders
were
stooped
as
if
he
were
bearing
a
great
bundle
*punct* .
*break*
his
feet
shuffled
along
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
he
held
continuous
arguments
as
to
whether
he
should
lie
down
and
sleep
at
some
near
spot
*punct* ,
or
force
himself
on
until
he
reached
a
certain
haven
*punct* .
*break*
he
often
tried
to
dismiss
the
question
*punct* ,
but
his
body
persisted
in
rebellion
and
his
senses
nagged
at
him
like
pampered
babies
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
did
not
look
up
*punct* ,
but
he
assented
with
thick
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
the
owner
of
the
cheery
voice
took
him
firmly
by
the
arm
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
with
a
round
laugh
*punct* ,
i'm
goin
your
way
*punct* .
*break*
th
hull
gang
is
goin
your

a
lift
*punct* .
*break*
they
began
to
walk
like
a
drunken
man
and
his
friend
*punct* .
*break*
as
they
went
along
*punct* ,
the
man
questioned
the
youth
and
assisted
him
with
the
replies
like
one
manipulating
the
mind
of
a
child
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
he
interjected
anecdotes
*punct* .
*break*
what
reg'ment

*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
what
corps

*break*
by
dad
*punct* ,

*break*
sometimes
i
thought

*punct* ,
an
other
times
i
could
a
swore
i

from
th
bitter
end
of
florida
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
th
most
mixed
up
dern
thing

*punct* .
*break*
an
these
here
hull
woods

a
reg'lar
mess
*punct* .
*break*
it'll
be
a
miracle
if
we
find

reg'ments

*punct* .
*break*
pretty
soon
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
we
ll
meet
a-plenty
of
guards
an
provost
*punct* -
guards
*punct* ,
an
one
thing
an
another
*punct* .
*break*
there
they
go
with
an
off'cer
*punct* ,
i
guess
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
his
hand
a-draggin'
*punct* .
*break*
how
did

over

*punct* ,
anyhow
*punct* ?
*break*
your
reg'ment
is
a
long
way
from
here
*punct* ,
ain't
it
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
i
guess
we
can
find
it
*punct* .
*break*
yeh
know
there
was
a
boy
killed
in
my
comp'ny
t'-day
that
i
thought
th
world
an
all
of
*punct* .
*break*
jack
was
a
nice
feller
*punct* .
*break*
we
was
a-standin
purty
peaceable
fer
a
spell
*punct* ,
though
there
was
men
runnin
ev'ry
way
all
round
us
*punct* ,
an
while
we
was
a-standin
like
that
*punct* ,
long
come
a
big
fat
feller
*punct* .
*break*
an
jest
then
a
shot
slapped
him
bang
on
th
side
th
head
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
sergeant
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
them
was
his
last
words
*punct* .
*break*
thunder
*punct* ,
i
wish
we
was
sure
a
findin
our
reg'ments
t'-night
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
guess
we
kin
do
it
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
search
which
followed
*punct* ,
the
man
of
the
cheery
voice
seemed
to
the
youth
to
possess
a
wand
of
a
magic
kind
*punct* .
*break*
he
threaded
the
mazes
of
the
tangled
forest
with
a
strange
fortune
*punct* .
*break*
in
encounters
with
guards
and
patrols
he
displayed
the
keenness
of
a
detective
and
the
valor
of
a
gamin
*punct* .
*break*
obstacles
fell
before
him
and
became
of
assistance
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
with
his
chin
still
on
his
breast
*punct* ,
stood
woodenly
by
while
his
companion
beat
ways
and
means
out
of
sullen
things
*punct* .
*break*
the
forest
seemed
a
vast
hive
of
men
buzzing
about
in
frantic
circles
*punct* ,
but
the
cheery
man
con
*punct* -
ducted
the
youth
without
mistakes
*punct* ,
until
at
last
he
began
to
chuckle
with
glee
and
self-satisfaction
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
there
yeh
are
*punct* !
*break*
see
that
fire
*punct* ?
*break*
the
youth
nodded
stupidly
*punct* .
*break*
a
warm
and
strong
hand
clasped
the
youth's
languid
fingers
for
an
instant
*punct* ,
and
then
he
heard
a
cheerful
and
audacious
whistling
as
the
man
strode
away
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
who
had
so
befriended
him
was
thus
passing
out
of
his
life
*punct* ,
it
suddenly
oc
*punct* -
curred
to
the
youth
that
he
had
not
once
seen
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
went
slowly
toward
the
fire
in
*punct* -
dicated
by
his
departed
friend
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
reeled
*punct* ,
he
bethought
him
of
the
welcome
his
comrades
would
give
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
conviction
that
he
would
soon
feel
in
his
sore
heart
the
barbed
missiles
of
ridicule
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
no
strength
to
in
*punct* -
vent
a
tale
*punct* ;
he
would
be
a
soft
target
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
vague
plans
to
go
off
into
the
deeper
darkness
and
hide
*punct* ,
but
they
were
all
destroyed
by
the
voices
of
exhaustion
and
pain
from
his
body
*punct* .
*break*
his
ailments
*punct* ,
clamoring
*punct* ,
forced
him
to
seek
the
place
of
food
and
rest
*punct* ,
at
whatever
cost
*punct* .
*break*
he
swung
unsteadily
toward
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
see
the
forms
of
men
throwing
black
shadows
in
the
red
light
*punct* ,
and
as
he
went
nearer
it
became
known
to
him
in
some
way
that
the
ground
was
strewn
with
sleeping
men
*punct* .
*break*
of
a
sudden
he
confronted
a
black
and
monstrous
figure
*punct* .
*break*
a
rifle
barrel
caught
some
glinting
beams
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
dis
*punct* -
129
mayed
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
but
he
presently
thought
that
he
recognized
the
nervous
voice
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
stood
tottering
before
the
rifle
barrel
*punct* ,
he
called
out
*punct* :
why
*punct* ,
hello
*punct* ,
wilson
*punct* ,
you
*punct* ,
you
here
*punct* ?
*break*
the
rifle
was
lowered
to
a
position
of
caution
and
the
loud
soldier
came
slowly
forward
*punct* .
*break*
he
peered
into
the
youth's
face
*punct* .
*break*
that
you
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
it's
*punct* ,
it's
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
give
yeh
up
fer
a
goner
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
yeh
was
dead
sure
enough
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
husky
emotion
in
his
voice
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
found
that
now
he
could
barely
stand
upon
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
sudden
sinking
of
his
forces
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
he
must
hasten
to
pro
*punct* -
duce
his
tale
to
protect
him
from
the
missiles
already
at
the
lips
of
his
redoubtable
comrades
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
staggering
before
the
loud
soldier
*punct* ,
he
began
*punct* :
yes
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* .
*break*
i've
*punct* ,
i've
had
an
awful
time
*punct* .
*break*
i've
been

*punct* .
*break*
way
over
on
th
right
*punct* .
*break*
ter'ble

*punct* .
*break*
i
had
an
awful
time
*punct* .
*break*
i
got
separated
from
th
reg'ment
*punct* .
*break*
over
on
th
right
*punct* ,
i
got
shot
*punct* .
*break*
in
th
head
*punct* .
*break*
i

*break*
i
don't
see
how
i
could

got
separated
from
th
reg'ment
*punct* .
*break*
i
got
shot
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
his
friend
had
stepped
forward
quickly
*punct* .
*break*
why
didn't
yeh
say
so
first
*punct* ?
*break*
poor
ol
boy
*punct* ,
we
must
*punct* ,
hol

a
minnit
*punct* ;
what
am
i
doin'
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
call
simpson
*punct* .
*break*
another
figure
at
that
moment
loomed
in
the
gloom
*punct* .
*break*
they
could
see
that
it
was
the
corporal
*punct* .
*break*
who
yeh
talkin
to
*punct* ,
wilson
*punct* ?
*break*
his
voice
was
anger-toned
*punct* .
*break*
who
yeh
talkin
to
*punct* ?
*break*
yeh
th
derndest
sentinel
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
hello

*break*

hours
ago
*punct* !
*break*
great
jerusalem
*punct* ,

turnin
up
every
ten
minutes
or
so
*punct* !
*break*
we
thought
we'd
lost
forty-two
men
by
straight
count
*punct* ,
but
if
they
keep
on
a-comin
this
way
*punct* ,
we'll
git

comp'ny
all
back
by
mornin
yit
*punct* .
*break*
where
was
yeh
*punct* ?
*break*
over
on
th
right
*punct* .
*break*
i
got
separated
*punct* ,
began
the
youth
with
considerable
glibness
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
friend
had
interrupted
hastily
*punct* .
*break*
he
rested
his
rifle
in
the
hollow
of
his
left
arm
and
his
right
around
the
youth's
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
gee
*punct* ,
it
must
hurt
like
thunder
*punct* !
*break*
the
youth
leaned
heavily
upon
his
friend
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
it
hurts
*punct* ,
hurts
a
good
deal
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
faltering
in
his
voice
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
said
the
corporal
*punct* .
*break*
he
linked
his
arm
in
the
youth's
and
drew
him
forward
*punct* .
*break*
come
on
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
take
keer
a
yeh
*punct* .
*break*
an'
*punct* ,

on
a
minnit
*punct* ,
here's
my
canteen
*punct* .
*break*
it's
full
a
coffee
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
his
head
by
th
fire
an
see
how
it
looks
*punct* .
*break*
maybe
it's
a
pretty
bad
un
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth's
senses
were
so
deadened
that
his
friend's
voice
sounded
from
afar
and
he
could
scarcely
feel
the
pressure
of
the
corporal's
arm
*punct* .
*break*
he
submitted
passively
to
the
latter's
directing
strength
*punct* .
*break*
his
head
was
in
the
old
manner
hang
*punct* -
ing
forward
upon
his
breast
*punct* .
*break*
his
knees
wobbled
*punct* .
*break*
the
corporal
led
him
into
the
glare
of
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
let's
have
look
at
yer
ol
head
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
sat
down
obediently
and
the
cor
*punct* -
poral
*punct* ,
laying
aside
his
rifle
*punct* ,
began
to
fumble
in
the
bushy
hair
of
his
comrade
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
obliged
to
turn
the
other's
head
so
that
the
full
flush
of
the
fire
light
would
beam
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
puckered
his
mouth
with
a
critical
air
*punct* .
*break*
he
drew
back
his
lips
and
whistled
through
his
teeth
when
his
fingers
came
in
contact
with
the
splashed
blood
and
the
rare
wound
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
here
we
are
*punct* !
*break*
he
awkwardly
made
further
investigations
*punct* .
*break*
jest
as
i
thought
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* ,
presently
*punct* .
*break*
yeh've
been
grazed
by
a
ball
*punct* .
*break*
it's
raised
a
queer
lump
jest
as
if
some
feller
had
lammed
yeh
on
th
head
with
a
club
*punct* .
*break*
it
stopped
a-bleedin
long
time
ago
*punct* .
*break*
th
most
about
it
is
that
in
th
mornin
yeh'll
feel
that
a
number
ten
hat
wouldn't
fit
yeh
*punct* .
*break*
an
your
head'll
be
all
het
up
an
feel
as
dry
as
burnt
pork
*punct* .
*break*
an
yeh
may
git
a
lot
a
other
sicknesses
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
by
mornin'
*punct* .
*break*
yeh
can't
never
tell
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
i
don't
much
think
so
*punct* .
*break*
it's
jest
a
damn
good
belt
on
th
head
*punct* ,
an
nothin
more
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
you
jest
sit
here
an
don't
move
*punct* ,
while
i
go
rout
out
th
relief
*punct* .
*break*
the
corporal
went
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
re
*punct* -
mained
on
the
ground
like
a
parcel
*punct* .
*break*
he
stared
with
a
vacant
look
into
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
time
he
aroused
*punct* ,
for
some
part
*punct* ,
and
the
things
about
him
began
to
take
form
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
that
the
ground
in
the
deep
shadows
was
cluttered
with
men
*punct* ,
sprawling
in
every
con
*punct* -
ceivable
posture
*punct* .
*break*
glancing
narrowly
into
the
more
distant
darkness
*punct* ,
he
caught
occasional
glimpses
of
visages
that
loomed
pallid
and
ghostly
*punct* ,
lit
with
a
phosphorescent
glow
*punct* .
*break*
these
faces
expressed
in
their
lines
the
deep
stupor
of
the
tired
soldiers
*punct* .
*break*
they
made
them
appear
like
men
drunk
with
wine
*punct* .
*break*
this
bit
of
forest
might
have
appeared
to
an
ethereal
wanderer
as
a
scene
of
the
result
of
some
frightful
debauch
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
the
youth
observed
an
officer
asleep
*punct* ,
seated
bolt
upright
*punct* ,
with
his
back
against
a
tree
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
some
*punct* -
thing
perilous
in
his
position
*punct* .
*break*
badgered
by
dreams
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
he
swayed
with
little
bounces
and
starts
*punct* ,
like
an
old
toddy-stricken
grandfather
in
a
chimney
corner
*punct* .
*break*
dust
and
stains
were
upon
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
his
lower
jaw
hung
down
as
if
lacking
strength
to
assume
its
normal
position
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
the
picture
of
an
exhausted
soldier
after
a
feast
of
war
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
evidently
gone
to
sleep
with
his
sword
in
his
arms
*punct* .
*break*
these
two
had
slumbered
in
an
embrace
*punct* ,
but
the
weapon
had
been
allowed
in
time
to
fall
unheeded
to
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
the
brass-mounted
hilt
lay
in
contact
with
some
parts
of
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
within
the
gleam
of
rose
and
orange
light
from
the
burning
sticks
were
other
soldiers
*punct* ,
snoring
and
heaving
*punct* ,
or
lying
deathlike
in
slumber
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
pairs
of
legs
were
stuck
forth
*punct* ,
rigid
and
straight
*punct* .
*break*
the
shoes
displayed
the
mud
or
dust
of
marches
and
bits
of
rounded
trousers
*punct* ,
protruding
from
the
blankets
*punct* ,
showed
rents
and
tears
from
hurried
pitchings
through
the
dense
brambles
*punct* .
*break*
the
fire
crackled
musically
*punct* .
*break*
from
it
swelled
light
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
overhead
the
foliage
moved
softly
*punct* .
*break*
the
leaves
*punct* ,
with
their
faces
turned
toward
the
blaze
*punct* ,
were
colored
shifting
hues
of
silver
*punct* ,
often
edged
with
red
*punct* .
*break*
far
off
to
the
right
*punct* ,
through
a
window
in
the
forest
could
be
seen
a
handful
of
stars
lying
*punct* ,
like
glittering
pebbles
*punct* ,
on
the
black
level
of
the
night
*punct* .
*break*
occasionally
*punct* ,
in
this
low-arched
hall
*punct* ,
a
soldier
would
arouse
and
turn
his
body
to
a
new
posi
*punct* -
tion
*punct* ,
the
experience
of
his
sleep
having
taught
him
of
uneven
and
objectionable
places
upon
the
ground
under
him
*punct* .
*break*
or
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
he
would
lift
himself
to
a
sitting
posture
*punct* ,
blink
at
the
fire
for
an
unintelligent
moment
*punct* ,
throw
a
swift
glance
at
his
prostrate
companion
*punct* ,
and
then
cuddle
down
again
with
a
grunt
of
sleepy
content
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
sat
in
a
forlorn
heap
until
his
friend
the
loud
young
soldier
came
*punct* ,
swinging
two
canteens
by
their
light
strings
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ,
ol
boy
*punct* ,
said
the
latter
*punct* ,
we'll
have
yeh
fixed
up
in
jest
about
a
minnit
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
the
bustling
ways
of
an
amateur
nurse
*punct* .
*break*
he
fussed
around
the
fire
and
stirred
the
sticks
to
brilliant
exertions
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
his
patient
drink
largely
from
the
canteen
that
contained
the
coffee
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
to
the
youth
a
delicious
draught
*punct* .
*break*
he
tilted
his
head
afar
back
and
held
the
canteen
long
to
his
lips
*punct* .
*break*
the
cool
mixture
went
caress
*punct* -
ingly
down
his
blistered
throat
*punct* .
*break*
having
finished
*punct* ,
he
sighed
with
comfortable
delight
*punct* .
*break*
the
loud
young
soldier
watched
his
comrade
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
*punct* .
*break*
he
later
produced
an
extensive
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
*punct* .
*break*
he
folded
it
into
a
manner
of
bandage
and
soused
water
from
the
other
canteen
upon
the
middle
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
this
crude
arrangement
he
bound
over
the
youth's
head
*punct* ,
tying
the
ends
in
a
queer
knot
at
the
back
of
the
neck
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
moving
off
and
surveying
his
deed
*punct* ,
yeh
look
like
th
devil
*punct* ,
but
i
bet
yeh
feel
better
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
contemplated
his
friend
with
grate
*punct* -
ful
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
upon
his
aching
and
swelling
head
the
cold
cloth
was
like
a
tender
woman's
hand
*punct* .
*break*
yeh
don't
holler
ner
say
nothin'
*punct* ,
remarked
his
friend
approvingly
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
i'm
a
black
*punct* -
smith
at
takin
keer
a
sick
folks
*punct* ,
an

henry
*punct* .
*break*
most
a

would
a
been
in
th
hospital
long
ago
*punct* .
*break*
a
shot
in
th
head
ain't
foolin
business
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
made
no
reply
*punct* ,
but
began
to
fumble
with
the
buttons
of
his
jacket
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
come
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
continued
his
friend
*punct* ,
come
on
*punct* .
*break*
the
other
got
carefully
erect
*punct* ,
and
the
loud
young
soldier
led
him
among
the
sleeping
forms
lying
in
groups
and
rows
*punct* .
*break*
presently
he
stooped
and
picked
up
his
blankets
*punct* .
*break*
he
spread
the
rubber
one
upon
the
ground
and
placed
the
woolen
one
about
the
youth's
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
there
now
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
lie
down
an
git
some
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
with
his
manner
of
doglike
obe
*punct* -
dience
*punct* ,
got
carefully
down
like
a
crone
stoop
*punct* -
ing
*punct* .
*break*
he
stretched
out
with
a
murmur
of
relief
and
comfort
*punct* .
*break*
the
ground
felt
like
the
softest
couch
*punct* .
*break*
but
of
a
sudden
he
ejaculated
*punct* :
hol
on
a
minnit
*punct* !
*break*
his
friend
waved
his
hand
impatiently
*punct* .
*break*
right
down
there
by
yeh
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
but
hol
on
a
minnit
*punct* ,
continued
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
don't
be
makin
a
damn
fool
a
yerself
*punct* ,
he
said
severely
*punct* .
*break*
after
the
reproof
the
youth
said
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
an
exquisite
drowsiness
had
spread
through
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
warm
comfort
of
the
blanket
enveloped
him
and
made
a
gentle
languor
*punct* .
*break*
his
head
fell
for
*punct* -
ward
on
his
crooked
arm
and
his
weighted
lids
went
softly
down
over
his
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
hearing
a
splatter
of
musketry
from
the
distance
*punct* ,
he
wondered
indifferently
if
those
men
sometimes
slept
*punct* .
*break*
he
gave
a
long
sigh
*punct* ,
snuggled
down
into
his
blanket
*punct* ,
and
in
a
moment
was
like
his
com
*punct* -
rades
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
youth
awoke
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
asleep
for
a
thousand
years
*punct* ,
and
he
felt
sure
that
he
opened
his
eyes
upon
an
unex
*punct* -
pected
world
*punct* .
*break*
gray
mists
were
slowly
shifting
before
the
first
efforts
of
the
sun
rays
*punct* .
*break*
an
im
*punct* -
pending
splendor
could
be
seen
in
the
eastern
sky
*punct* .
*break*
an
icy
dew
had
chilled
his
face
*punct* ,
and
im
*punct* -
mediately
upon
arousing
he
curled
farther
down
into
his
blanket
*punct* .
*break*
he
stared
for
a
while
at
the
leaves
overhead
*punct* ,
moving
in
a
heraldic
wind
of
the
day
*punct* .
*break*
the
distance
was
splintering
and
blaring
with
the
noise
of
fighting
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
in
the
sound
an
expression
of
a
deadly
persistency
*punct* ,
as
if
it
had
not
begun
and
was
not
to
cease
*punct* .
*break*
about
him
were
the
rows
and
groups
of
men
that
he
had
dimly
seen
the
previous
night
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
getting
a
last
draught
of
sleep
before
the
awakening
*punct* .
*break*
the
gaunt
*punct* ,
careworn
features
and
dusty
figures
were
made
plain
by
this
quaint
139
light
at
the
dawning
*punct* ,
but
it
dressed
the
skin
of
the
men
in
corpselike
hues
and
made
the
tangled
limbs
appear
pulseless
and
dead
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
started
up
with
a
little
cry
when
his
eyes
first
swept
over
this
motionless
mass
of
men
*punct* ,
thick
*punct* -
spread
upon
the
ground
*punct* ,
pallid
*punct* ,
and
in
strange
postures
*punct* .
*break*
his
disordered
mind
interpreted
the
hall
of
the
forest
as
a
charnel
place
*punct* .
*break*
he
believed
for
an
instant
that
he
was
in
the
house
of
the
dead
*punct* ,
and
he
did
not
dare
to
move
lest
these
corpses
start
up
*punct* ,
squalling
and
squawking
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
second
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
achieved
his
proper
mind
*punct* .
*break*
he
swore
a
complicated
oath
at
himself
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
that
this
somber
picture
was
not
a
fact
of
the
present
*punct* ,
but
a
mere
prophecy
*punct* .
*break*
he
heard
then
the
noise
of
a
fire
crackling
briskly
in
the
cold
air
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
turning
his
head
*punct* ,
he
saw
his
friend
pottering
busily
about
a
small
blaze
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
other
figures
moved
in
the
fog
*punct* ,
and
he
heard
the
hard
cracking
of
axe
blows
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
there
was
a
hollow
rumble
of
drums
*punct* .
*break*
a
distant
bugle
sang
faintly
*punct* .
*break*
similar
sounds
*punct* ,
varying
in
strength
*punct* ,
came
from
near
and
far
over
the
forest
*punct* .
*break*
the
bugles
called
to
each
other
like
brazen
gamecocks
*punct* .
*break*
the
near
thunder
of
the
regimental
drums
rolled
*punct* .
*break*
the
body
of
men
in
the
woods
rustled
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
general
uplifting
of
heads
*punct* .
*break*
a
murmuring
of
voices
broke
upon
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
in
it
there
was
much
bass
of
grumbling
oaths
*punct* .
*break*
strange
gods
were
addressed
in
condemnation
of
the
early
hours
necessary
to
correct
war
*punct* .
*break*
an
officer's
peremptory
tenor
rang
out
and
quickened
the
stiffened
movement
of
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
the
tangled
limbs
unraveled
*punct* .
*break*
the
corpse-hued
faces
were
hidden
behind
fists
that
twisted
slowly
in
the
eye
sockets
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
sat
up
and
gave
vent
to
an
enormous
yawn
*punct* .
*break*
he
remarked
petulantly
*punct* .
*break*
he
rubbed
his
eyes
*punct* ,
and
then
putting
up
his
hand
felt
carefully
of
the
bandage
over
his
wound
*punct* .
*break*
his
friend
*punct* ,
perceiving
him
to
be
awake
*punct* ,
came
from
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ,
ol
man
*punct* ,
how
do
yeh
feel
this
mornin'
*punct* ?
*break*
the
youth
yawned
again
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
puckered
his
mouth
to
a
little
pucker
*punct* .
*break*
his
head
*punct* ,
in
truth
*punct* ,
felt
precisely
like
a
melon
*punct* ,
and
there
was
an
un
*punct* -
pleasant
sensation
at
his
stomach
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
lord
*punct* ,
i
feel
pretty
bad
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
exclaimed
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
i
hoped
ye'd
feel
all
right
this
mornin'
*punct* .
*break*
let's
see
th
bandage
*punct* ,
i
guess
it's
slipped
*punct* .
*break*
he
began
to
tinker
at
the
wound
in
rather
a
clumsy
way
until
the
youth
exploded
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
in
sharp
irritation
*punct* ;
you're
the
hangdest
man
i
ever
saw
*punct* !
*break*
you
wear
muffs
on
your
hands
*punct* .
*break*
why
in
good
thunderation
can't
you
be
more
easy
*punct* ?
*break*
i'd
rather
you'd
stand
off
an
throw
guns
at
it
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
go
slow
*punct* ,
an
don't
act
as
if
you
was
nailing
down
carpet
*punct* .
*break*
he
glared
with
insolent
command
at
his
friend
*punct* ,
but
the
latter
answered
soothingly
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
come
now
*punct* ,
an
git
some
grub
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
maybe
*punct* ,
yeh'll
feel
better
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
fireside
the
loud
young
soldier
watched
over
his
comrade's
wants
with
tender
*punct* -
ness
and
care
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
very
busy
marshaling
the
little
black
vagabonds
of
tin
cups
and
pour
*punct* -
ing
into
them
the
streaming
*punct* ,
iron
colored
mixture
from
a
small
and
sooty
tin
pail
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
some
fresh
meat
*punct* ,
which
he
roasted
hurriedly
upon
a
stick
*punct* .
*break*
he
sat
down
then
and
contemplated
the
youth's
appetite
with
glee
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
took
note
of
a
remarkable
change
in
his
comrade
since
those
days
of
camp
life
upon
the
river
bank
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
no
more
to
be
con
*punct* -
tinually
regarding
the
proportions
of
his
personal
prowess
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
not
furious
at
small
words
that
pricked
his
conceits
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
no
more
a
loud
young
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
about
him
now
a
fine
reliance
*punct* .
*break*
he
showed
a
quiet
belief
in
his
purposes
and
his
abilities
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
in
*punct* -
ward
confidence
evidently
enabled
him
to
be
indifferent
to
little
words
of
other
men
aimed
at
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
reflected
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
used
to
regarding
his
comrade
as
a
blatant
child
with
an
audacity
grown
from
his
inexperience
*punct* ,
thought
*punct* -
less
*punct* ,
headstrong
*punct* ,
jealous
*punct* ,
and
filled
with
a
tinsel
courage
*punct* .
*break*
a
swaggering
babe
accustomed
to
strut
in
his
own
dooryard
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
wondered
where
had
been
born
these
new
eyes
*punct* ;
when
his
comrade
had
made
the
great
discovery
that
there
were
many
men
who
would
refuse
to
be
subjected
by
him
*punct* .
*break*
apparently
*punct* ,
the
other
had
now
climbed
a
peak
of
wisdom
from
which
he
could
perceive
himself
as
a
very
wee
thing
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
youth
saw
that
ever
after
it
would
be
easier
to
live
in
his
friend's
neighborhood
*punct* .
*break*
his
comrade
balanced
his
ebony
coffee-cup
on
his
knee
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
what
d'yeh
think
th
chances
are
*punct* ?
*break*
d'yeh
think
we'll
wal
*punct* -
lop
em
*punct* ?
*break*
the
youth
considered
for
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
day
*punct* -
b'fore-yesterday
*punct* ,
he
finally
replied
*punct* ,
with
boldness
*punct* ,
you
would
a
bet
you'd
lick
the
hull
kit-an'
*punct* -
boodle
all
by
yourself
*punct* .
*break*
his
friend
looked
a
trifle
amazed
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
perhaps
i
would
*punct* ,
he
decided
at
last
*punct* .
*break*
he
stared
humbly
at
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
was
quite
disconcerted
at
this
sur
*punct* -
prising
reception
of
his
remarks
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
you
wouldn't
either
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
hastily
trying
to
re
*punct* -
trace
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
other
made
a
deprecating
gesture
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
yeh
needn't
mind
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
i
be
*punct* -
lieve
i
was
a
pretty
big
fool
in
those
days
*punct* .
*break*
he
spoke
as
after
a
lapse
of
years
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
little
pause
*punct* .
*break*
all
th
officers
say
we've
got
th
rebs
in
a
pretty
tight
box
*punct* ,
said
the
friend
*punct* ,
clearing
his
throat
in
a
commonplace
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
about
that
*punct* ,
the
youth
replied
*punct* .
*break*
what
i
seen
over
on
th
right
makes
me
think
it
was
th
other
way
about
*punct* .
*break*
from
where
i
was
*punct* ,
it
looked
as
if
we
was
gettin
a
good
poundin
yestirday
*punct* .
*break*
d'yeh
think
so
*punct* ?
*break*
inquired
the
friend
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
we
handled
em
pretty
rough
yestir
*punct* -
day
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
bit
*punct* ,
said
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
lord
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
you
didn't
see
nothing
of
the
fight
*punct* .
*break*
then
a
sudden
thought
came
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
jim
conklin's
dead
*punct* .
*break*
his
friend
started
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
spoke
slowly
*punct* .
*break*
shot
in
th
side
*punct* .
*break*
yeh
don't
say
so
*punct* .
*break*
jim
conklin
*punct* ...
poor
cuss
*punct* !
*break*
all
about
them
were
other
small
fires
sur
*punct* -
rounded
by
men
with
their
little
black
utensils
*punct* .
*break*
from
one
of
these
near
came
sudden
sharp
voices
in
a
row
*punct* .
*break*
it
appeared
that
two
light
*punct* -
footed
soldiers
had
been
teasing
a
huge
*punct* ,
bearded
man
*punct* ,
causing
him
to
spill
coffee
upon
his
blue
knees
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
had
gone
into
a
rage
and
had
sworn
comprehensively
*punct* .
*break*
stung
by
his
language
*punct* ,
his
tormentors
had
immediately
bristled
at
him
with
a
great
show
of
resenting
unjust
oaths
*punct* .
*break*
possibly
there
was
going
to
be
a
fight
*punct* .
*break*
the
friend
arose
and
went
over
to
them
*punct* ,
mak
*punct* -
ing
pacific
motions
with
his
arms
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
here
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* ,
what's
th
use
*punct* ?
*break*
we'll
be

*break*
what's

*break*
one
of
the
light-footed
soldiers
turned
upon
him
red-faced
and
violent
*punct* .
*break*
yeh
needn't
come
around
here
with
yer
preachin'
*punct* .
*break*
i
s'pose
yeh
don't
approve
a
fightin
since
charley
morgan
licked
yeh
*punct* ;
but
i
don't
see
what
business
this
here
is
a
yours
or
anybody
else
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
it
ain't
*punct* ,
said
the
friend
mildly
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
he
*punct* ,
said
the
two
*punct* ,
indicating
their
opponent
with
accusative
forefingers
*punct* .
*break*
the
huge
soldier
was
quite
purple
with
rage
*punct* .
*break*
he
pointed
at
the
two
soldiers
with
his
great
hand
*punct* ,
extended
clawlike
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
they
*punct* ,
but
during
this
argumentative
time
the
de
*punct* -
sire
to
deal
blows
seemed
to
pass
*punct* ,
although
they
said
much
to
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
finally
the
friend
re
*punct* -
turned
to
his
old
seat
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
short
while
the
three
antagonists
could
be
seen
together
in
an
amiable
bunch
*punct* .
*break*
he
ses
he
don't
allow
no
interferin
in
his
business
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
laughed
*punct* .
*break*
yer
changed
a
good
bit
*punct* .
*break*
yeh
ain't
at
all
like
yeh
was

*break*
i
remember
when
you
an
that
irish
feller
*punct* ,
he
stopped
and
laughed
again
*punct* .
*break*
that's
true
nough
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
i
didn't
mean
*punct* ,
began
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
the
friend
made
another
deprecatory
gesture
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
yeh
needn't
mind
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
another
little
pause
*punct* .
*break*
th
reg'ment
lost
over
half
th

yestir
*punct* -
day
*punct* ,
remarked
the
friend
eventually
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
a
course
they
was
all
dead
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
laws
*punct* ,
they
kep
a-comin
back
last
night
until
it
seems
*punct* ,
after
all
*punct* ,
we
didn't
lose
but
a
few
*punct* .
*break*
they'd
been
scattered
all
over
*punct* ,
wanderin
around
in
th
woods
*punct* ,
fightin
with
other
reg'ments
*punct* ,
an
everything
*punct* .
*break*
jest
like
you
done
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
was
standing
at
order
arms
at
the
side
of
a
lane
*punct* ,
waiting
for
the
command
to
march
*punct* ,
when
suddenly
the
youth
remembered
the
little
packet
enwrapped
in
a
faded
yellow
envelope
which
the
loud
young
soldier
with
lugu
*punct* -
brious
words
had
intrusted
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
made
him
start
*punct* .
*break*
he
uttered
an
exclamation
and
turned
toward
his
comrade
*punct* .
*break*
his
friend
*punct* ,
at
his
side
in
the
ranks
*punct* ,
was
thought
*punct* -
fully
staring
down
the
road
*punct* .
*break*
from
some
cause
his
expression
was
at
that
moment
very
meek
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
regarding
him
with
sidelong
glances
*punct* ,
felt
impelled
to
change
his
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
noth
*punct* -
ing
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
nothing
*punct* ,
repeated
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
he
resolved
not
to
deal
the
little
blow
*punct* .
*break*
it
148
was
sufficient
that
the
fact
made
him
glad
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
necessary
to
knock
his
friend
on
the
head
with
the
misguided
packet
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
possessed
of
much
fear
of
his
friend
*punct* ,
for
he
saw
how
easily
questionings
could
make
holes
in
his
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
lately
*punct* ,
he
had
as
*punct* -
sured
himself
that
the
altered
comrade
would
not
tantalize
him
with
a
persistent
curiosity
*punct* ,
but
he
felt
certain
that
during
the
first
period
of
leisure
his
friend
would
ask
him
to
relate
his
adventures
of
the
previous
day
*punct* .
*break*
he
now
rejoiced
in
the
possession
of
a
small
weapon
with
which
he
could
prostrate
his
com
*punct* -
rade
at
the
first
signs
of
a
cross-examination
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
master
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
now
be
he
who
could
laugh
and
shoot
the
shafts
of
derision
*punct* .
*break*
the
friend
had
*punct* ,
in
a
weak
hour
*punct* ,
spoken
with
sobs
of
his
own
death
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
delivered
a
mel
*punct* -
ancholy
oration
previous
to
his
funeral
*punct* ,
and
had
doubtless
in
the
packet
of
letters
*punct* ,
presented
vari
*punct* -
ous
keepsakes
to
relatives
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
had
not
died
*punct* ,
and
thus
he
had
delivered
himself
into
the
hands
of
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
the
latter
felt
immensely
superior
to
his
friend
*punct* ,
but
he
inclined
to
condescension
*punct* .
*break*
he
adopted
toward
him
an
air
of
patronizing
good
humor
*punct* .
*break*
his
self-pride
was
now
entirely
restored
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
shade
of
its
flourishing
growth
he
stood
with
braced
and
self-confident
legs
*punct* ,
and
since
nothing
could
now
be
discovered
he
did
not
shrink
from
an
encounter
with
the
eyes
of
judges
*punct* ,
and
allowed
no
thoughts
of
his
own
to
keep
him
from
an
attitude
of
manfulness
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
performed
his
mistakes
in
the
dark
*punct* ,
so
he
was
still
a
man
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
when
he
remembered
his
fortunes
of
yesterday
*punct* ,
and
looked
at
them
from
a
distance
he
began
to
see
something
fine
there
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
license
to
be
pompous
and
veteranlike
*punct* .
*break*
his
panting
agonies
of
the
past
he
put
out
of
his
sight
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
present
*punct* ,
he
declared
to
himself
that
it
was
only
the
doomed
and
the
damned
who
roared
with
sincerity
at
circumstance
*punct* .
*break*
few
but
they
ever
did
it
*punct* .
*break*
a
man
with
a
full
stomach
and
the
respect
of
his
fellows
had
no
business
to
scold
about
anything
that
he
might
think
to
be
wrong
in
the
ways
of
the
universe
*punct* ,
or
even
with
the
ways
of
society
*punct* .
*break*
let
the
unfortunates
rail
*punct* ;
the
others
may
play
marbles
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
give
a
great
deal
of
thought
to
these
battles
that
lay
directly
before
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
essential
that
he
should
plan
his
ways
in
regard
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
taught
that
many
obligations
of
a
life
were
easily
avoided
*punct* .
*break*
the
lessons
of
yesterday
had
been
that
retribution
was
a
laggard
and
blind
*punct* .
*break*
with
these
facts
before
him
he
did
not
deem
it
necessary
that
he
should
become
feverish
over
the
possibilities
of
the
ensuing
twenty-four
hours
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
leave
much
to
chance
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
a
faith
in
himself
had
secretly
blossomed
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
little
flower
of
confidence
growing
within
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
now
a
man
of
experience
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
out
among
the
dragons
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
and
he
assured
himself
that
they
were
not
so
hideous
as
he
had
imagined
them
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
they
were
inaccurate
*punct* ;
they
did
not
sting
with
precision
*punct* .
*break*
a
stout
heart
often
defied
*punct* ,
and
defying
*punct* ,
escaped
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
furthermore
*punct* ,
how
could
they
kill
him
who
was
the
chosen
of
gods
and
doomed
to
greatness
*punct* ?
*break*
he
remembered
how
some
of
the
men
had
run
from
the
battle
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
recalled
their
terror
*punct* -
struck
faces
he
felt
a
scorn
for
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
surely
been
more
fleet
and
more
wild
than
was
absolutely
necessary
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
weak
mortals
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
himself
*punct* ,
he
had
fled
with
discretion
and
dignity
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
aroused
from
this
reverie
by
his
friend
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
having
hitched
about
nervously
and
blinked
at
the
trees
for
a
time
*punct* ,
suddenly
coughed
in
an
introductory
way
*punct* ,
and
spoke
*punct* .
*break*
the
friend
put
his
hand
up
to
his
mouth
and
coughed
again
*punct* .
*break*
he
fidgeted
in
his
jacket
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
he
gulped
*punct* ,
at
last
*punct* ,
i
guess
yeh
might
as
well
give
me
back
them
letters
*punct* .
*break*
dark
*punct* ,
prick
*punct* -
ling
blood
had
flushed
into
his
cheeks
and
brow
*punct* .
*break*
all
right
*punct* ,
wilson
*punct* ,
said
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
he
loosened
two
buttons
of
his
coat
*punct* ,
thrust
in
his
hand
*punct* ,
and
brought
forth
the
packet
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
ex
*punct* -
tended
it
to
his
friend
the
latter's
face
was
turned
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
slow
in
the
act
of
producing
the
packet
because
during
it
he
had
been
trying
to
invent
a
remarkable
comment
upon
the
affair
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
conjure
nothing
of
sufficient
point
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
compelled
to
allow
his
friend
to
escape
unmolested
with
his
packet
*punct* .
*break*
and
for
this
he
took
unto
himself
considerable
credit
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
generous
thing
*punct* .
*break*
his
friend
at
his
side
seemed
suffering
great
shame
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
contemplated
him
*punct* ,
the
youth
felt
his
heart
grow
more
strong
and
stout
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
never
been
compelled
to
blush
in
such
manner
for
his
acts
*punct* ;
he
was
an
individual
of
extraordi
*punct* -
nary
virtues
*punct* .
*break*
he
reflected
*punct* ,
with
condescending
pity
*punct* :
too
bad
*punct* !
*break*
the
poor
devil
*punct* ,
it
makes
him
feel
tough
*punct* !
*break*
after
this
incident
*punct* ,
and
as
he
reviewed
the
battle
pictures
he
had
seen
*punct* ,
he
felt
quite
com
*punct* -
petent
to
return
home
and
make
the
hearts
of
the
people
glow
with
stories
of
war
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
see
himself
in
a
room
of
warm
tints
telling
tales
to
listeners
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
exhibit
laurels
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
insignificant
*punct* ;
still
*punct* ,
in
a
district
where
laurels
were
infrequent
*punct* ,
they
might
shine
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
his
gaping
audience
picturing
him
as
the
central
figure
in
blazing
scenes
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
imagined
the
consternation
and
the
ejaculations
of
his
mother
and
the
young
lady
at
the
seminary
as
they
drank
his
recitals
*punct* .
*break*
their
vague
feminine
formula
for
beloved
ones
doing
brave
deeds
on
the
field
of
battle
without
risk
of
life
would
be
destroyed
*punct* .
*break*
a
sputtering
of
musketry
was
always
to
be
heard
*punct* .
*break*
later
*punct* ,
the
cannon
had
entered
the
dis
*punct* -
pute
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
fog-filled
air
their
voices
made
a
thudding
sound
*punct* .
*break*
the
reverberations
were
con
*punct* -
tinued
*punct* .
*break*
this
part
of
the
world
led
a
strange
*punct* ,
battleful
existence
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth's
regiment
was
marched
to
relieve
a
command
that
had
lain
long
in
some
damp
trenches
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
took
positions
behind
a
curv
*punct* -
ing
line
of
rifle
pits
that
had
been
turned
up
*punct* ,
like
a
large
furrow
*punct* ,
along
the
line
of
woods
*punct* .
*break*
before
them
was
a
level
stretch
*punct* ,
peopled
with
short
*punct* ,
deformed
stumps
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
woods
beyond
came
the
dull
popping
of
the
skirmishers
and
pickets
*punct* ,
firing
in
the
fog
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
right
came
the
noise
of
a
terrific
fracas
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
cuddled
behind
the
small
embank
*punct* -
ment
and
sat
in
easy
attitudes
awaiting
their
turn
*punct* .
*break*
many
had
their
backs
to
the
firing
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth's
friend
lay
down
*punct* ,
buried
his
face
in
his
154
arms
*punct* ,
and
almost
instantly
*punct* ,
it
seemed
*punct* ,
he
was
in
a
deep
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
leaned
his
breast
against
the
brown
dirt
and
peered
over
at
the
woods
and
up
and
down
the
line
*punct* .
*break*
curtains
of
trees
interfered
with
his
ways
of
vision
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
see
the
low
line
of
trenches
but
for
a
short
distance
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
idle
flags
were
perched
on
the
dirt
hills
*punct* .
*break*
behind
them
were
rows
of
dark
bodies
with
a
few
heads
sticking
curiously
over
the
top
*punct* .
*break*
always
the
noise
of
skirmishers
came
from
the
woods
on
the
front
and
left
*punct* ,
and
the
din
on
the
right
had
grown
to
frightful
proportions
*punct* .
*break*
the
guns
were
roaring
without
an
instant's
pause
for
breath
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
that
the
cannon
had
come
from
all
parts
and
were
engaged
in
a
stupendous
wrangle
*punct* .
*break*
it
became
impossible
to
make
a
sen
*punct* -
tence
heard
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
wished
to
launch
a
joke
*punct* ,
a
quota
*punct* -
tion
from
newspapers
*punct* .
*break*
he
desired
to
say
*punct* ,
all
quiet
on
the
rappahannock
*punct* ,
but
the
guns
refused
to
permit
even
a
comment
upon
their
uproar
*punct* .
*break*
he
never
successfully
concluded
the
sentence
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
last
the
guns
stopped
*punct* ,
and
among
the
men
in
the
rifle
pits
rumors
again
flew
*punct* ,
like
birds
*punct* ,
but
they
were
now
for
the
most
part
black
creatures
who
flapped
their
wings
drearily
near
to
the
ground
and
refused
to
rise
on
any
wings
of
hope
*punct* .
*break*
the
men's
faces
grew
doleful
from
the
interpreting
of
omens
*punct* .
*break*
tales
of
hesitation
and
uncertainty
on
the
part
of
those
high
in
place
and
responsibility
came
to
their
ears
*punct* .
*break*
stories
of
disaster
were
borne
into
their
minds
with
many
proofs
*punct* .
*break*
this
din
of
musketry
on
the
right
*punct* ,
grow
*punct* -
ing
like
a
released
genie
of
sound
*punct* ,
expressed
and
emphasized
the
army's
plight
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
were
disheartened
and
began
to
mutter
*punct* .
*break*
they
made
gestures
expressive
of
the
sentence
*punct* :
ah
*punct* ,
what
more
can
we
do
*punct* ?
*break*
and
it
could
always
be
seen
that
they
were
bewildered
by
the
alleged
news
and
could
not
fully
compre
*punct* -
hend
a
defeat
*punct* .
*break*
before
the
gray
mists
had
been
totally
ob
*punct* -
literated
by
the
sun
rays
*punct* ,
the
regiment
was
march
*punct* -
ing
in
a
spread
column
that
was
retiring
carefully
through
the
woods
*punct* .
*break*
the
disordered
*punct* ,
hurrying
lines
of
the
enemy
could
sometimes
be
seen
down
through
the
groves
and
little
fields
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
yelling
*punct* ,
shrill
and
exultant
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
sight
the
youth
forgot
many
personal
matters
and
became
greatly
enraged
*punct* .
*break*
he
ex
*punct* -
ploded
in
loud
sentences
*punct* .
*break*
b'jiminey
*punct* ,
we're
generaled
by
a
lot
a
lunkheads
*punct* .
*break*
more
than
one
feller
has
said
that
t'-day
*punct* ,
observed
a
man
*punct* .
*break*
his
friend
*punct* ,
recently
aroused
*punct* ,
was
still
very
drowsy
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
behind
him
until
his
mind
took
in
the
meaning
of
the
movement
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
sighed
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
i
s'pose
we
got
licked
*punct* ,
he
remarked
sadly
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
had
a
thought
that
it
would
not
be
handsome
for
him
to
freely
condemn
other
men
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
an
attempt
to
restrain
himself
*punct* ,
but
the
words
upon
his
tongue
were
too
bitter
*punct* .
*break*
he
presently
began
a
long
and
intricate
denunciation
of
the
commander
of
the
forces
*punct* .
*break*
mebbe
*punct* ,
it
wa'n't
all
his
fault
*punct* ,
not
all
to
*punct* -
gether
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
th
best
he
knowed
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
trudging
along
with
stooped
shoulders
and
shifting
eyes
like
a
man
who
has
been
caned
and
kicked
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
don't
we
fight
like
the
devil
*punct* ?
*break*
don't
we
do
all
that
men
can
*punct* ?
*break*
demanded
the
youth
loudly
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
secretly
dumfounded
at
this
sentiment
when
it
came
from
his
lips
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
his
face
lost
its
valor
and
he
looked
guiltily
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
one
questioned
his
right
to
deal
in
such
words
*punct* ,
and
presently
he
recovered
his
air
of
courage
*punct* .
*break*
he
went
on
to
repeat
a
statement
he
had
heard
going
from
group
to
group
at
the
camp
that
morning
*punct* .
*break*
the
brigadier
said
he
never
saw
a
new
reg'ment
fight
the
way
we
fought
yestirday
*punct* ,
didn't
he
*punct* ?
*break*
and
we
didn't
do
better
than
many
another
reg'ment
*punct* ,
did
we
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
you
can't
say
it's
th
army's
fault
*punct* ,
can
you
*punct* ?
*break*
in
his
reply
*punct* ,
the
friend's
voice
was
stern
*punct* .
*break*
a
course
not
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
no
man
dare
say
we
don't
fight
like
th
devil
*punct* .
*break*
no
man
will
ever
dare
say
it
*punct* .
*break*
th
boys
fight
like
hell-roosters
*punct* .
*break*
but
still
*punct* ,
still
*punct* ,
we
don't
have
no
luck
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
if
we
fight
like
the
devil
an
don't
ever
whip
*punct* ,
it
must
be
the
general's
fault
*punct* ,
said
the
youth
grandly
and
decisively
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
don't
see
any
sense
in
fighting
and
fighting
and
fighting
*punct* ,
yet
always
losing
through
some
derned
old
lunkhead
of
a
general
*punct* .
*break*
a
sarcastic
man
who
was
tramping
at
the
youth's
side
*punct* ,
then
spoke
lazily
*punct* .
*break*
mebbe
yeh
think
yeh
fit
th
hull
battle
yestirday
*punct* ,
fleming
*punct* ,
he
remarked
*punct* .
*break*
the
speech
pierced
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
inwardly
he
was
reduced
to
an
abject
pulp
by
these
chance
words
*punct* .
*break*
his
legs
quaked
privately
*punct* .
*break*
he
cast
a
frightened
glance
at
the
sarcastic
man
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
he
hastened
to
say
in
a
concili
*punct* -
ating
voice
*punct* ,
i
don't
think
i
fought
the
whole
battle
yesterday
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
other
seemed
innocent
of
any
deeper
meaning
*punct* .
*break*
apparently
*punct* ,
he
had
no
information
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
merely
his
habit
*punct* .
*break*
he
replied
in
the
same
tone
of
calm
derision
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
nevertheless
*punct* ,
felt
a
threat
*punct* .
*break*
his
mind
shrank
from
going
near
to
the
danger
*punct* ,
and
thereafter
he
was
silent
*punct* .
*break*
the
significance
of
the
sarcastic
man's
words
took
from
him
all
loud
moods
that
would
make
him
appear
prominent
*punct* .
*break*
he
became
suddenly
a
modest
person
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
low-toned
talk
among
the
troops
*punct* .
*break*
the
officers
were
impatient
and
snappy
*punct* ,
their
countenances
clouded
with
the
tales
of
misfor
*punct* -
tune
*punct* .
*break*
the
troops
*punct* ,
sifting
through
the
forest
*punct* ,
were
sullen
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
youth's
company
once
a
man's
laugh
rang
out
*punct* .
*break*
a
dozen
soldiers
turned
their
faces
quickly
toward
him
and
frowned
with
vague
displeasure
*punct* .
*break*
the
noise
of
firing
dogged
their
footsteps
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
*punct* ,
it
seemed
to
be
driven
a
little
way
*punct* ,
but
it
always
returned
again
with
increased
insolence
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
muttered
and
cursed
*punct* ,
throwing
black
looks
in
its
direction
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
clear
space
the
troops
were
at
last
halted
*punct* .
*break*
regiments
and
brigades
*punct* ,
broken
and
detached
through
their
encounters
with
thickets
*punct* ,
grew
together
again
and
lines
were
faced
toward
the
pursuing
bark
of
the
enemy's
infantry
*punct* .
*break*
this
noise
*punct* ,
following
like
the
yellings
of
eager
*punct* ,
metallic
hounds
*punct* ,
increased
to
a
loud
and
joyous
burst
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
as
the
sun
went
serenely
up
the
sky
*punct* ,
throwing
illuminating
rays
into
the
gloomy
thickets
*punct* ,
it
broke
forth
into
prolonged
pealings
*punct* .
*break*
the
woods
began
to
crackle
as
if
afire
*punct* .
*break*
whoop-a-dadee
*punct* ,
said
a
man
*punct* ,
here
we
are
*punct* !
*break*
blood
an
destruction
*punct* .
*break*
he
jerked
without
mercy
at
his
little
mustache
*punct* .
*break*
he
strode
to
and
fro
with
dark
dignity
in
the
rear
of
his
men
*punct* ,
who
were
lying
down
behind
whatever
protection
they
had
collected
*punct* .
*break*
a
battery
had
trundled
into
position
in
the
rear
and
was
thoughtfully
shelling
the
distance
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
*punct* ,
unmolested
as
yet
*punct* ,
awaited
the
moment
when
the
gray
shadows
of
the
woods
before
them
should
be
slashed
by
the
lines
of
flame
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
much
growling
and
swearing
*punct* .
*break*
good
gawd
*punct* ,
the
youth
grumbled
*punct* ,
we're
always
being
chased
around
like
rats
*punct* !
*break*
it
makes
me
sick
*punct* .
*break*
nobody
seems
to
know
where
we
go
or
why
we
go
*punct* .
*break*
we
just
get
fired
around
from
pillar
to
post
and
get
licked
here
and
get
licked
there
*punct* ,
and
nobody
knows
what
it's
done
for
*punct* .
*break*
it
makes
a
man
feel
like
a
damn
kitten
in
a
bag
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
i'd
like
to
know
what
the
eternal
thunders
we
was
marched
into
these
woods
for
anyhow
*punct* ,
the
red
badge
of
courage
161
unless
it
was
to
give
the
rebs
a
regular
pot
shot
at
us
*punct* .
*break*
we
came
in
here
and
got
our
legs
all
tangled
up
in
these
cussed
briers
*punct* ,
and
then
we
begin
to
fight
and
the
rebs
had
an
easy
time
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
don't
tell
me
it's
just
luck
*punct* !
*break*
i
know
better
*punct* .
*break*
it's
this
derned
old
*punct* ,
the
friend
seemed
jaded
*punct* ,
but
he
interrupted
his
comrade
with
a
voice
of
calm
confidence
*punct* .
*break*
it'll
turn
out
all
right
in
th
end
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
the
devil
it
will
*punct* !
*break*
you
always
talk
like
a
dog-hanged
parson
*punct* .
*break*
don't
tell
me
*punct* !
*break*
i
know
*punct* ,
at
this
time
there
was
an
interposition
by
the
savage-minded
lieutenant
*punct* ,
who
was
obliged
to
vent
some
of
his
inward
dissatisfaction
upon
his
men
*punct* .
*break*
you
boys
shut
right
up
*punct* !
*break*
there
no
need
a
your
wastin
your
breath
in
long-winded
arguments
about
this
an
that
an
th
other
*punct* .
*break*
you've
been
jawin
like
a
lot
a
old
hens
*punct* .
*break*
less
talkin
an
more
fightin
is
what's
best
for
you
boys
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
saw
sech
gabbling
jackasses
*punct* .
*break*
he
paused
*punct* ,
ready
to
pounce
upon
any
man
who
might
have
the
temerity
to
reply
*punct* .
*break*
no
words
being
said
*punct* ,
he
resumed
his
dignified
pacing
*punct* .
*break*
there's
too
much
chin
music
an
too
little
fightin
in
this
war
*punct* ,
anyhow
*punct* ,
he
said
to
them
*punct* ,
turning
his
head
for
a
final
remark
*punct* .
*break*
the
day
had
grown
more
white
*punct* ,
until
the
sun
shed
his
full
radiance
upon
the
thronged
forest
*punct* .
*break*
a
sort
of
a
gust
of
battle
came
sweeping
toward
that
part
of
the
line
where
lay
the
youth's
regi
*punct* -
ment
*punct* .
*break*
the
front
shifted
a
trifle
to
meet
it
square
*punct* -
ly
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
wait
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
part
of
the
field
there
passed
slowly
the
intense
moments
that
pre
*punct* -
cede
the
tempest
*punct* .
*break*
a
single
rifle
flashed
in
a
thicket
before
the
regiment
*punct* .
*break*
in
an
instant
it
was
joined
by
many
others
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
mighty
song
of
clashes
and
crashes
that
went
sweeping
through
the
woods
*punct* .
*break*
the
guns
in
the
rear
*punct* ,
aroused
and
enraged
by
shells
that
had
been
thrown
burlike
at
them
*punct* ,
suddenly
involved
themselves
in
a
hideous
alter
*punct* -
cation
with
another
band
of
guns
*punct* .
*break*
the
battle
roar
settled
to
a
rolling
thunder
*punct* ,
which
was
a
single
*punct* ,
long
explosion
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
regiment
there
was
a
peculiar
kind
of
hesitation
denoted
in
the
attitudes
of
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
worn
*punct* ,
exhausted
*punct* ,
having
slept
but
lit
*punct* -
tle
and
labored
much
*punct* .
*break*
they
rolled
their
eyes
toward
the
advancing
battle
as
they
stood
await
*punct* -
ing
the
shock
*punct* .
*break*
some
shrank
and
flinched
*punct* .
*break*
they
stood
as
men
tied
to
stakes
*punct* .
*break*
this
advance
of
the
enemy
had
seemed
to
the
youth
like
a
ruthless
hunting
*punct* .
*break*
he
began
to
fume
with
rage
and
exasperation
*punct* .
*break*
he
beat
his
foot
upon
the
ground
*punct* ,
and
scowled
with
hate
at
the
swirling
smoke
that
was
approaching
like
a
phan
*punct* -
tom
flood
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
maddening
quality
in
this
seeming
resolution
of
the
foe
to
give
him
no
rest
*punct* ,
to
give
him
no
time
to
sit
down
and
think
*punct* .
*break*
yesterday
he
had
fought
and
had
fled
rapidly
*punct* .
*break*
there
had
been
many
adventures
*punct* .
*break*
for
to-day
he
felt
that
he
had
earned
opportunities
for
contem
*punct* -
plative
repose
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
have
enjoyed
portraying
to
uninitiated
listeners
various
scenes
at
which
he
had
been
a
witness
or
ably
discussing
the
pro
*punct* -
cesses
of
war
with
other
proved
men
*punct* .
*break*
too
it
was
important
that
he
should
have
time
for
physical
recuperation
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
sore
and
stiff
from
his
ex
*punct* -
periences
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
received
his
fill
of
all
exer
*punct* -
tions
*punct* ,
and
he
wished
to
rest
*punct* .
*break*
but
those
other
men
seemed
never
to
grow
weary
*punct* ;
they
were
fighting
with
their
old
speed
*punct* .
*break*
163
he
had
a
wild
hate
for
the
relentless
foe
*punct* .
*break*
yester
*punct* -
day
*punct* ,
when
he
had
imagined
the
universe
to
be
against
him
*punct* ,
he
had
hated
it
*punct* ,
little
gods
and
big
gods
*punct* ;
to-day
he
hated
the
army
of
the
foe
with
the
same
great
hatred
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
not
going
to
be
badgered
of
his
life
*punct* ,
like
a
kitten
chased
by
boys
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
well
to
drive
men
into
final
corners
*punct* ;
at
those
moments
they
could
all
develop
teeth
and
claws
*punct* .
*break*
he
leaned
and
spoke
into
his
friend's
ear
*punct* .
*break*
he
menaced
the
woods
with
a
gesture
*punct* .
*break*
if
they
keep
on
chasing
us
*punct* ,
by
gawd
*punct* ,
they'd
better
watch
out
*punct* .
*break*
can't
stand
too
much
*punct* .
*break*
the
friend
twisted
his
head
and
made
a
calm
reply
*punct* .
*break*
if
they
keep
on
a-chasin
us
they'll
drive
us
all
inteh
th
river
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
cried
out
savagely
at
this
state
*punct* -
ment
*punct* .
*break*
he
crouched
behind
a
little
tree
*punct* ,
with
his
eyes
burning
hatefully
and
his
teeth
set
in
a
cur
*punct* -
like
snarl
*punct* .
*break*
the
awkward
bandage
was
still
about
his
head
*punct* ,
and
upon
it
*punct* ,
over
his
wound
*punct* ,
there
was
a
spot
of
dry
blood
*punct* .
*break*
his
hair
was
wondrously
tousled
*punct* ,
and
some
straggling
*punct* ,
moving
locks
hung
over
the
cloth
of
the
bandage
down
toward
his
forehead
*punct* .
*break*
his
jacket
and
shirt
were
open
at
the
throat
*punct* ,
and
exposed
his
young
bronzed
neck
*punct* .
*break*
there
could
be
seen
spasmodic
gulpings
at
his
throat
*punct* .
*break*
his
fingers
twined
nervously
about
his
rifle
*punct* .
*break*
he
wished
that
it
was
an
engine
of
annihilating
power
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
that
he
and
his
companions
were
being
taunted
and
derided
from
sincere
convic
*punct* -
tions
that
they
were
poor
and
puny
*punct* .
*break*
his
knowl
*punct* -
edge
of
his
inability
to
take
vengeance
for
it
made
his
rage
into
a
dark
and
stormy
specter
*punct* ,
that
pos
*punct* -
sessed
him
and
made
him
dream
of
abominable
cruelties
*punct* .
*break*
the
tormentors
were
flies
sucking
in
*punct* -
solently
at
his
blood
*punct* ,
and
he
thought
that
he
would
have
given
his
life
for
a
revenge
of
seeing
their
faces
in
pitiful
plights
*punct* .
*break*
the
winds
of
battle
had
swept
all
about
the
regiment
*punct* ,
until
the
one
rifle
*punct* ,
instantly
followed
by
others
*punct* ,
flashed
in
its
front
*punct* .
*break*
a
moment
later
the
regiment
roared
forth
its
sudden
and
valiant
re
*punct* -
tort
*punct* .
*break*
a
dense
wall
of
smoke
settled
slowly
down
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
furiously
slit
and
slashed
by
the
knifelike
fire
from
the
rifles
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
youth
the
fighters
resembled
animals
tossed
for
a
death
struggle
into
a
dark
pit
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
sensation
that
he
and
his
fellows
*punct* ,
at
bay
*punct* ,
were
pushing
back
*punct* ,
always
pushing
fierce
on
*punct* -
slaughts
of
creatures
who
were
slippery
*punct* .
*break*
their
beams
of
crimson
seemed
to
get
no
purchase
upon
the
bodies
of
their
foes
*punct* ;
the
latter
seemed
to
evade
them
with
ease
*punct* ,
and
come
through
*punct* ,
between
*punct* ,
around
*punct* ,
and
about
with
unopposed
skill
*punct* .
*break*
when
*punct* ,
in
a
dream
*punct* ,
it
occurred
to
the
youth
that
his
rifle
was
an
impotent
stick
*punct* ,
he
lost
sense
of
everything
but
his
hate
*punct* ,
his
desire
to
smash
into
pulp
the
glittering
smile
of
victory
which
he
could
feel
upon
the
faces
of
his
enemies
*punct* .
*break*
the
blue
smoke-swallowed
line
curled
and
writhed
like
a
snake
stepped
upon
*punct* .
*break*
it
swung
its
ends
to
and
fro
in
an
agony
of
fear
and
rage
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
was
not
conscious
that
he
was
erect
upon
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
know
the
direction
of
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
once
he
even
lost
the
habit
of
balance
and
fell
heavily
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
up
again
immediately
*punct* .
*break*
one
thought
went
through
the
chaos
of
his
brain
at
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
he
wondered
if
he
had
fallen
because
he
had
been
shot
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
suspicion
flew
away
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
think
more
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
taken
up
a
first
position
behind
the
lit
*punct* -
tle
tree
*punct* ,
with
a
direct
determination
to
hold
it
against
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
not
deemed
it
possi
*punct* -
ble
that
his
army
could
that
day
succeed
*punct* ,
and
from
this
he
felt
the
ability
to
fight
harder
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
throng
had
surged
in
all
ways
*punct* ,
until
he
lost
directions
and
locations
*punct* ,
save
that
he
knew
where
lay
the
enemy
*punct* .
*break*
the
flames
bit
him
*punct* ,
and
the
hot
smoke
broiled
his
skin
*punct* .
*break*
his
rifle
barrel
grew
so
hot
that
ordi
*punct* -
narily
he
could
not
have
borne
it
upon
his
palms
*punct* ;
but
he
kept
on
stuffing
cartridges
into
it
*punct* ,
and
pounding
them
with
his
clanking
*punct* ,
bending
ram
*punct* -
rod
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
aimed
at
some
changing
form
through
the
smoke
*punct* ,
he
pulled
his
trigger
with
a
fierce
grunt
*punct* ,
as
if
he
were
dealing
a
blow
of
the
fist
with
all
his
strength
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
enemy
seemed
falling
back
before
him
and
his
fellows
*punct* ,
he
went
instantly
forward
*punct* ,
like
a
dog
who
*punct* ,
seeing
his
foes
lagging
*punct* ,
turns
and
insists
upon
being
pursued
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
he
was
compelled
to
retire
again
*punct* ,
he
did
it
slowly
*punct* ,
sul
*punct* -
lenly
*punct* ,
taking
steps
of
wrathful
despair
*punct* .
*break*
once
he
*punct* ,
in
his
intent
hate
*punct* ,
was
almost
alone
*punct* ,
and
was
firing
*punct* ,
when
all
those
near
him
had
ceased
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
so
engrossed
in
his
occupation
that
he
was
not
aware
of
a
lull
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
recalled
by
a
hoarse
laugh
and
a
sen
*punct* -
tence
that
came
to
his
ears
in
a
voice
of
contempt
and
amazement
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
then
and
*punct* ,
pausing
with
his
rifle
thrown
half
into
position
*punct* ,
looked
at
the
blue
line
of
his
comrades
*punct* .
*break*
during
this
moment
of
leisure
they
seemed
all
to
be
engaged
in
staring
with
astonishment
at
him
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
become
specta
*punct* -
tors
*punct* .
*break*
turning
to
the
front
again
he
saw
*punct* ,
under
the
lifted
smoke
*punct* ,
a
deserted
ground
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
bewildered
for
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
then
there
appeared
upon
the
glazed
vacancy
of
his
eyes
a
diamond
point
of
intelligence
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
comprehending
*punct* .
*break*
he
returned
to
his
comrades
and
threw
him
*punct* -
self
upon
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
he
sprawled
like
a
man
who
had
been
thrashed
*punct* .
*break*
his
flesh
seemed
strange
*punct* -
ly
on
fire
*punct* ,
and
the
sounds
of
the
battle
continued
in
his
ears
*punct* .
*break*
he
groped
blindly
for
his
canteen
*punct* .
*break*
the
lieutenant
was
crowing
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
drunk
with
fighting
*punct* .
*break*
he
called
out
to
the
youth
*punct* :
by
heavens
*punct* ,
if
i
had
ten
thousand
wild
cats
like
you
i
could
tear
th
stomach
outa
this
war
in
less'n
a
week
*punct* !
*break*
he
puffed
out
his
chest
with
large
dignity
as
he
said
it
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
the
men
muttered
and
looked
at
the
youth
in
awe-struck
ways
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
plain
that
as
he
had
gone
on
loading
and
firing
and
cursing
without
the
proper
intermission
*punct* ,
they
had
found
time
to
regard
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
they
now
looked
upon
him
as
a
war
devil
*punct* .
*break*
the
friend
came
staggering
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
some
fright
and
dismay
in
his
voice
*punct* .
*break*
are
yeh
all
right
*punct* ,
fleming
*punct* ?
*break*
do
yeh
feel
all
right
*punct* ?
*break*
there
ain't
nothin
th
matter
with
yeh
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ,
is
there
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
said
the
youth
with
difficulty
*punct* .
*break*
his
throat
seemed
full
of
knobs
and
burs
*punct* .
*break*
these
incidents
made
the
youth
ponder
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
revealed
to
him
that
he
had
been
a
barbarian
*punct* ,
a
beast
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
fought
like
a
pagan
who
de
*punct* -
fends
his
religion
*punct* .
*break*
regarding
it
*punct* ,
he
saw
that
it
was
fine
*punct* ,
wild
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
some
ways
*punct* ,
easy
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
a
tremendous
figure
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
by
this
struggle
he
had
overcome
obstacles
which
he
had
admitted
to
be
mountains
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
fallen
like
paper
peaks
*punct* ,
and
he
was
now
what
he
called
a
hero
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
had
not
been
aware
of
the
pro
*punct* -
cess
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
slept
and
*punct* ,
awakening
*punct* ,
found
him
*punct* -
self
a
knight
*punct* .
*break*
he
lay
and
basked
in
the
occasional
stares
of
his
comrades
*punct* .
*break*
their
faces
were
varied
in
de
*punct* -
grees
of
blackness
from
the
burned
powder
*punct* .
*break*
some
were
utterly
smudged
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
reek
*punct* -
ing
with
perspiration
*punct* ,
and
their
breaths
came
hard
and
wheezing
*punct* .
*break*
and
from
these
soiled
ex
*punct* -
panses
they
peered
at
him
*punct* .
*break*
cried
the
lieu
*punct* -
tenant
deliriously
*punct* .
*break*
he
walked
up
and
down
*punct* ,
restless
and
eager
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
his
voice
could
be
heard
in
a
wild
*punct* ,
incomprehensible
laugh
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
had
a
particularly
profound
thought
upon
the
science
of
war
he
always
unconsciously
addressed
himself
to
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
some
grim
rejoicing
by
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
by
thunder
*punct* ,
i
bet
this
army'll
never
see
another
new
reg'ment
like
us
*punct* !
*break*
a
dog
*punct* ,
a
woman
*punct* ,
an
a
walnut
tree
*punct* ,
th
more
yeh
beat
em
*punct* ,
th
better
they
be
*punct* !
*break*
that's
like
us
*punct* .
*break*
lost
a
piler
men
*punct* ,
they
did
*punct* .
*break*
if
an
ol
woman
swep
up
th
woods
she'd
git
a
dustpanful
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
an
if
she'll
come
around
ag'in
in
bout
an
hour
she'll
git
a
pile
more
*punct* .
*break*
the
forest
still
bore
its
burden
of
clamor
*punct* .
*break*
from
off
under
the
trees
came
the
rolling
clatter
of
the
musketry
*punct* .
*break*
each
distant
thicket
seemed
a
strange
porcupine
with
quills
of
flame
*punct* .
*break*
a
cloud
of
dark
smoke
*punct* ,
as
from
smoldering
ruins
*punct* ,
went
up
toward
the
sun
now
bright
and
gay
in
the
blue
*punct* ,
enameled
sky
*punct* .
*break*
the
ragged
line
had
respite
for
some
min
*punct* -
utes
*punct* ,
but
during
its
pause
the
struggle
in
the
forest
became
magnified
until
the
trees
seemed
to
quiver
from
the
firing
and
the
ground
to
shake
from
the
rushing
of
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
the
voices
of
the
cannon
were
mingled
in
a
long
and
interminable
row
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
difficult
to
live
in
such
an
atmos
*punct* -
phere
*punct* .
*break*
the
chests
of
the
men
strained
for
a
bit
of
freshness
*punct* ,
and
their
throats
craved
water
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
one
shot
through
the
body
*punct* ,
who
raised
a
cry
of
bitter
lamentation
when
came
this
lull
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
he
had
been
calling
out
during
the
fighting
also
*punct* ,
but
at
that
time
no
one
had
heard
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
the
men
turned
at
the
woe
*punct* -
ful
complaints
of
him
upon
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
who
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
who
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
jimmie
rogers
*punct* .
*break*
when
their
eyes
first
encountered
him
there
was
a
sudden
halt
*punct* ,
as
if
they
feared
to
go
near
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
thrashing
about
in
the
grass
*punct* ,
twisting
his
171
shuddering
body
into
many
strange
postures
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
screaming
loudly
*punct* .
*break*
this
instant's
hesita
*punct* -
tion
seemed
to
fill
him
with
a
tremendous
*punct* ,
fantas
*punct* -
tic
contempt
*punct* ,
and
he
damned
them
in
shrieked
sentences
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth's
friend
had
a
geographical
illusion
concerning
a
stream
*punct* ,
and
he
obtained
permission
to
go
for
some
water
*punct* .
*break*
immediately
canteens
were
showered
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
fill
mine
*punct* ,
will
yeh
*punct* ?
*break*
bring
me
some
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
and
me
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
he
departed
*punct* ,
ladened
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
went
with
his
friend
*punct* ,
feeling
a
desire
to
throw
his
heated
body
onto
the
stream
and
*punct* ,
soaking
there
*punct* ,
drink
quarts
*punct* .
*break*
they
made
a
hurried
search
for
the
supposed
stream
*punct* ,
but
did
not
find
it
*punct* .
*break*
no
water
here
*punct* ,
said
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
they
turned
without
delay
and
began
to
retrace
their
steps
*punct* .
*break*
from
their
position
as
they
again
faced
to
*punct* -
ward
the
place
of
the
fighting
*punct* ,
they
could
of
course
comprehend
a
greater
amount
of
the
bat
*punct* -
tle
than
when
their
visions
had
been
blurred
by
the
hurling
smoke
of
the
line
*punct* .
*break*
they
could
see
dark
stretches
winding
along
the
land
*punct* ,
and
on
one
cleared
space
there
was
a
row
of
guns
mak
*punct* -
ing
gray
clouds
*punct* ,
which
were
filled
with
large
flashes
of
orange-colored
flame
*punct* .
*break*
over
some
foli
*punct* -
age
they
could
see
the
roof
of
a
house
*punct* .
*break*
one
win
*punct* -
dow
*punct* ,
glowing
a
deep
murder
red
*punct* ,
shone
squarely
through
the
leaves
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
edifice
a
tall
lean
*punct* -
ing
tower
of
smoke
went
far
into
the
sky
*punct* .
*break*
looking
over
their
own
troops
*punct* ,
they
saw
mixed
masses
slowly
getting
into
regular
form
*punct* .
*break*
the
sunlight
made
twinkling
points
of
the
bright
steel
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
rear
there
was
a
glimpse
of
a
dis
*punct* -
tant
roadway
as
it
curved
over
a
slope
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
crowded
with
retreating
infantry
*punct* .
*break*
from
all
the
interwoven
forest
arose
the
smoke
and
bluster
of
the
battle
*punct* .
*break*
the
air
was
always
occupied
by
a
blaring
*punct* .
*break*
near
where
they
stood
shells
were
flip-flap
*punct* -
ping
and
hooting
*punct* .
*break*
occasional
bullets
buzzed
in
the
air
and
spanged
into
tree
trunks
*punct* .
*break*
wounded
men
and
other
stragglers
were
slinking
through
the
woods
*punct* .
*break*
looking
down
an
aisle
of
the
grove
*punct* ,
the
youth
and
his
companion
saw
a
jangling
general
and
his
staff
almost
ride
upon
a
wounded
man
*punct* ,
who
was
crawling
on
his
hands
and
knees
*punct* .
*break*
the
general
reined
strongly
at
his
charger's
opened
and
foamy
mouth
and
guided
it
with
dexterous
horsemanship
past
the
man
*punct* .
*break*
the
latter
scram
*punct* -
bled
in
wild
and
torturing
haste
*punct* .
*break*
his
strength
evidently
failed
him
as
he
reached
a
place
of
safety
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
his
arms
suddenly
weakened
*punct* ,
and
he
fell
*punct* ,
sliding
over
upon
his
back
*punct* .
*break*
he
lay
stretched
out
*punct* ,
breathing
gently
*punct* .
*break*
a
moment
later
the
small
*punct* ,
creaking
cavalcade
was
directly
in
front
of
the
two
soldiers
*punct* .
*break*
an
*punct* -
other
officer
*punct* ,
riding
with
the
skillful
abandon
of
a
cowboy
*punct* ,
galloped
his
horse
to
a
position
directly
before
the
general
*punct* .
*break*
the
two
unnoticed
foot
sol
*punct* -
diers
made
a
little
show
of
going
on
*punct* ,
but
they
lingered
near
in
the
desire
to
overhear
the
con
*punct* -
versation
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
*punct* ,
they
thought
*punct* ,
some
great
inner
historical
things
would
be
said
*punct* .
*break*
the
general
*punct* ,
whom
the
boys
knew
as
the
com
*punct* -
mander
of
their
division
*punct* ,
looked
at
the
other
officer
and
spoke
coolly
*punct* ,
as
if
he
were
criticising
his
clothes
*punct* .
*break*
th
enemy's
formin
over
there
for
another
charge
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
the
other
swore
at
his
restive
horse
*punct* ,
and
then
cleared
his
throat
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
a
gesture
toward
his
cap
*punct* .
*break*
i
presume
so
*punct* ,
remarked
the
general
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
began
to
talk
rapidly
and
in
a
lower
tone
*punct* .
*break*
he
frequently
illustrated
his
words
with
a
pointing
finger
*punct* .
*break*
the
two
infantrymen
could
hear
nothing
until
finally
he
asked
*punct* :
what
troops
can
you
spare
*punct* ?
*break*
the
officer
who
rode
like
a
cowboy
reflected
for
an
instant
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
i
had
to
order
in
th
12th
to
help
th
76th
*punct* ,
an
i
haven't
really
got
any
*punct* .
*break*
but
there's
th
304th
*punct* .
*break*
they
fight
like
a
lot
a
mule
drivers
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
spare
them
best
of
any
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
and
his
friend
exchanged
glances
of
astonishment
*punct* .
*break*
the
general
spoke
sharply
*punct* .
*break*
get
em
ready
*punct* ,
then
*punct* .
*break*
it'll
happen
in
five
minutes
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
other
officer
tossed
his
fingers
toward
his
cap
and
wheeling
his
horse
*punct* ,
started
away
*punct* ,
the
general
called
out
to
him
in
a
sober
voice
*punct* :
i
don't
believe
many
of
your
mule
drivers
will
get
back
*punct* .
*break*
the
other
shouted
something
in
reply
*punct* .
*break*
with
scared
faces
*punct* ,
the
youth
and
his
compan
*punct* -
ion
hurried
back
to
the
line
*punct* .
*break*
these
happenings
had
occupied
an
incredibly
short
time
*punct* ,
yet
the
youth
felt
that
in
them
he
had
been
made
aged
*punct* .
*break*
new
eyes
were
given
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
most
startling
thing
was
to
learn
sud
*punct* -
denly
that
he
was
very
insignificant
*punct* .
*break*
the
officer
spoke
of
the
regiment
as
if
he
referred
to
a
broom
*punct* .
*break*
some
part
of
the
woods
needed
sweep
*punct* -
ing
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
and
he
merely
indicated
a
broom
in
a
tone
properly
indifferent
to
its
fate
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
war
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* ,
but
it
appeared
strange
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
two
boys
approached
the
line
*punct* ,
the
lieu
*punct* -
tenant
perceived
them
and
swelled
with
wrath
*punct* .
*break*
fleming
*punct* ,
wilson
*punct* ,
how
long
does
it
take
yeh
to
git
water
*punct* ,
anyhow
*punct* ,
where
yeh
been
to
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
oration
ceased
as
he
saw
their
eyes
*punct* ,
which
were
large
with
great
tales
*punct* .
*break*
cried
the
youth's
friend
*punct* ,
hastening
with
his
news
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
lieutenant
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
b'gawd
*punct* !
*break*
now
*punct* ,
this
is
real
fightin'
*punct* .
*break*
over
his
soiled
countenance
there
went
a
boastful
smile
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
b'gawd
*punct* !
*break*
a
little
group
of
soldiers
surrounded
the
two
youths
*punct* .
*break*
are
we
*punct* ,
sure
nough
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
i'll
be
derned
*punct* !
*break*
wil
*punct* -
son
*punct* ,
you're
lyin'
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
to
die
*punct* ,
said
the
youth
*punct* ,
pitching
his
tones
to
the
key
of
angry
remonstrance
*punct* .
*break*
sure
as
shooting
*punct* ,
i
tell
you
*punct* .
*break*
and
his
friend
spoke
in
re-enforcement
*punct* .
*break*
not
by
a
blame
sight
*punct* ,
he
ain't
lyin'
*punct* .
*break*
we
heard
em
talkin'
*punct* .
*break*
they
caught
sight
of
two
mounted
figures
a
short
distance
from
them
*punct* .
*break*
one
was
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
and
the
other
was
the
officer
who
had
received
orders
from
the
commander
of
the
division
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
gesticulating
at
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
the
soldier
*punct* ,
pointing
at
them
*punct* ,
interpreted
the
scene
*punct* .
*break*
one
man
had
a
final
objection
*punct* :
how
could
yeh
hear
em
talkin'
*punct* ?
*break*
but
the
men
*punct* ,
for
a
large
part
*punct* ,
nodded
*punct* ,
admitting
that
previously
the
two
friends
had
spoken
truth
*punct* .
*break*
they
settled
back
into
reposeful
attitudes
with
airs
of
having
accepted
the
matter
*punct* .
*break*
and
they
mused
upon
it
*punct* ,
with
a
hundred
varieties
of
expression
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
an
engrossing
thing
to
think
about
*punct* .
*break*
many
tightened
their
belts
carefully
and
hitched
at
their
trousers
*punct* .
*break*
a
moment
later
the
officers
began
to
bustle
among
the
men
*punct* ,
pushing
them
into
a
more
com
*punct* -
pact
mass
and
into
a
better
alignment
*punct* .
*break*
they
chased
those
that
straggled
and
fumed
at
a
few
men
who
seemed
to
show
by
their
attitudes
that
they
had
decided
to
remain
at
that
spot
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
like
critical
shepherds
struggling
with
sheep
*punct* .
*break*
presently
*punct* ,
the
regiment
seemed
to
draw
itself
up
and
heave
a
deep
breath
*punct* .
*break*
none
of
the
men's
faces
were
mirrors
of
large
thoughts
*punct* .
*break*
the
sol
*punct* -
diers
were
bended
and
stooped
like
sprinters
be
*punct* -
fore
a
signal
*punct* .
*break*
many
pairs
of
glinting
eyes
peered
from
the
grimy
faces
toward
the
curtains
of
the
deeper
woods
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
deep
calculations
of
time
and
distance
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
surrounded
by
the
noises
of
the
monstrous
altercation
between
the
two
armies
*punct* .
*break*
the
world
was
fully
interested
in
other
matters
*punct* .
*break*
apparently
*punct* ,
the
regiment
had
its
small
affair
to
itself
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
turning
*punct* ,
shot
a
quick
*punct* ,
inquiring
glance
at
his
friend
*punct* .
*break*
the
latter
returned
to
him
the
same
manner
of
look
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
the
only
ones
who
possessed
an
inner
knowledge
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
an
ironical
secret
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
they
saw
no
hesitation
in
each
other's
faces
*punct* ,
and
they
nod
*punct* -
ded
a
mute
and
unprotesting
assent
when
a
shag
*punct* -
gy
man
near
them
said
in
a
meek
voice
*punct* :
we'll
git
swallowed
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
stared
at
the
land
in
front
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
its
foliages
now
seemed
to
veil
powers
and
hor
*punct* -
rors
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
unaware
of
the
machinery
of
orders
that
started
the
charge
*punct* ,
although
from
the
cor
*punct* -
ners
of
his
eyes
he
saw
an
officer
*punct* ,
who
looked
like
a
boy
a-horseback
*punct* ,
come
galloping
*punct* ,
waving
his
hat
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
he
felt
a
straining
and
heaving
among
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
the
line
fell
slowly
forward
like
a
toppling
wall
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
with
a
convulsive
gasp
that
was
intended
for
a
cheer
*punct* ,
the
regiment
began
its
journey
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
was
pushed
and
jostled
for
a
moment
before
he
understood
the
move
*punct* -
ment
at
all
*punct* ,
but
directly
he
lunged
ahead
and
began
to
run
*punct* .
*break*
he
fixed
his
eye
upon
a
distant
and
promi
*punct* -
nent
clump
of
trees
where
he
had
concluded
the
enemy
were
to
be
met
*punct* ,
and
he
ran
toward
it
as
toward
a
goal
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
believed
throughout
that
it
was
a
mere
question
of
getting
over
an
unpleas
*punct* -
ant
matter
as
quickly
as
possible
*punct* ,
and
he
ran
179
desperately
*punct* ,
as
if
pursued
for
a
murder
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
was
drawn
hard
and
tight
with
the
stress
of
his
endeavor
*punct* .
*break*
his
eyes
were
fixed
in
a
lurid
glare
*punct* .
*break*
and
with
his
soiled
and
disordered
dress
*punct* ,
his
red
and
inflamed
features
surmounted
by
the
dingy
rag
with
its
spot
of
blood
*punct* ,
his
wildly
swinging
rifle
and
banging
accouterments
*punct* ,
he
looked
to
be
an
insane
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
regiment
swung
from
its
position
out
into
a
cleared
space
the
woods
and
thickets
be
*punct* -
fore
it
awakened
*punct* .
*break*
yellow
flames
leaped
toward
it
from
many
directions
*punct* .
*break*
the
forest
made
a
tre
*punct* -
mendous
objection
*punct* .
*break*
the
line
lurched
straight
for
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
right
wing
swung
forward
*punct* ;
it
in
turn
was
surpassed
by
the
left
*punct* .
*break*
afterward
the
center
careered
to
the
front
until
the
regiment
was
a
wedge-shaped
mass
*punct* ,
but
an
instant
later
the
opposition
of
the
bushes
*punct* ,
trees
*punct* ,
and
uneven
places
on
the
ground
split
the
command
and
scattered
it
into
detached
clusters
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
light-footed
*punct* ,
was
unconsciously
in
advance
*punct* .
*break*
his
eyes
still
kept
note
of
the
clump
of
trees
*punct* .
*break*
from
all
places
near
it
the
clannish
yell
of
the
enemy
could
be
heard
*punct* .
*break*
the
little
flames
of
rifles
leaped
from
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
song
of
the
bullets
was
in
the
air
and
shells
snarled
among
the
tree
*punct* -
tops
*punct* .
*break*
one
tumbled
directly
into
the
middle
of
a
hurrying
group
and
exploded
in
crimson
fury
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
an
instant's
spectacle
of
a
man
*punct* ,
almost
over
it
*punct* ,
throwing
up
his
hands
to
shield
his
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
other
men
*punct* ,
punched
by
bullets
*punct* ,
fell
in
gro
*punct* -
tesque
agonies
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
left
a
coherent
trail
of
bodies
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
passed
into
a
clearer
atmosphere
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
an
effect
like
a
revelation
in
the
new
appearance
of
the
landscape
*punct* .
*break*
some
men
work
*punct* -
ing
madly
at
a
battery
were
plain
to
them
*punct* ,
and
the
opposing
infantry's
lines
were
defined
by
the
gray
walls
and
fringes
of
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
to
the
youth
that
he
saw
every
*punct* -
thing
*punct* .
*break*
each
blade
of
the
green
grass
was
bold
and
clear
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
that
he
was
aware
of
every
change
in
the
thin
*punct* ,
transparent
vapor
that
floated
idly
in
sheets
*punct* .
*break*
the
brown
or
gray
trunks
of
the
trees
showed
each
roughness
of
their
sur
*punct* -
faces
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
men
of
the
regiment
*punct* ,
with
their
starting
eyes
and
sweating
faces
*punct* ,
running
madly
*punct* ,
or
falling
*punct* ,
as
if
thrown
headlong
*punct* ,
to
queer
*punct* ,
heaped-up
corpses
*punct* ,
all
were
comprehended
*punct* .
*break*
his
mind
took
a
mechanical
but
firm
impression
*punct* ,
so
that
afterward
everything
was
pictured
and
ex
*punct* -
plained
to
him
*punct* ,
save
why
he
himself
was
there
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
was
a
frenzy
made
from
this
furious
rush
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
*punct* ,
pitching
forward
insanely
*punct* ,
had
burst
into
cheerings
*punct* ,
moblike
and
barbaric
*punct* ,
but
tuned
in
strange
keys
that
can
arouse
the
dullard
and
the
stoic
*punct* .
*break*
it
made
a
mad
enthusiasm
that
*punct* ,
it
seemed
*punct* ,
would
be
incapable
of
checking
itself
before
granite
and
brass
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
the
deli
*punct* -
rium
that
encounters
despair
and
death
*punct* ,
and
is
heedless
and
blind
to
the
odds
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
temporary
but
sublime
absence
of
selfishness
*punct* .
*break*
and
because
it
was
of
this
order
was
the
reason
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
why
the
youth
wondered
*punct* ,
afterward
*punct* ,
what
reasons
he
could
have
had
for
being
there
*punct* .
*break*
presently
the
straining
pace
ate
up
the
ener
*punct* -
gies
of
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
as
if
by
agreement
*punct* ,
the
leaders
began
to
slacken
their
speed
*punct* .
*break*
the
volleys
di
*punct* -
rected
against
them
had
had
a
seeming
windlike
effect
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
snorted
and
blew
*punct* .
*break*
among
some
stolid
trees
it
began
to
falter
and
hesitate
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
*punct* ,
staring
intently
*punct* ,
began
to
wait
for
some
of
the
distant
walls
of
smoke
to
move
and
dis
*punct* -
close
to
them
the
scene
*punct* .
*break*
since
much
of
their
strength
and
their
breath
had
vanished
*punct* ,
they
re
*punct* -
turned
to
caution
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
become
men
again
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
had
a
vague
belief
that
he
had
run
miles
*punct* ,
and
he
thought
*punct* ,
in
a
way
*punct* ,
that
he
was
now
in
some
new
and
unknown
land
*punct* .
*break*
the
moment
the
regiment
ceased
its
advance
the
protesting
splutter
of
musketry
became
a
steadied
roar
*punct* .
*break*
long
and
accurate
fringes
of
smoke
spread
out
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
top
of
a
small
hill
came
level
belchings
of
yellow
flame
that
caused
an
inhuman
whistling
in
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
*punct* ,
halted
*punct* ,
had
opportunity
to
see
some
of
their
comrades
dropping
with
moans
and
shrieks
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
lay
under
foot
*punct* ,
still
or
wailing
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
for
an
instant
the
men
stood
*punct* ,
their
rifles
slack
in
their
hands
*punct* ,
and
watched
the
regiment
dwindle
*punct* .
*break*
they
appeared
dazed
and
stupid
*punct* .
*break*
this
spectacle
seemed
to
paralyze
them
*punct* ,
overcome
them
with
a
fatal
fascination
*punct* .
*break*
they
stared
wood
*punct* -
enly
at
the
sights
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
lowering
their
eyes
*punct* ,
looked
from
face
to
face
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
strange
pause
*punct* ,
and
a
strange
silence
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
above
the
sounds
of
the
outside
commo
*punct* -
tion
*punct* ,
arose
the
roar
of
the
lieutenant
*punct* .
*break*
he
strode
suddenly
forth
*punct* ,
his
infantile
features
black
with
rage
*punct* .
*break*
come
on
*punct* ,
yeh
fools
*punct* !
*break*
yeh
can't
stay
here
*punct* .
*break*
yeh
must
come
on
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
more
*punct* ,
but
much
of
it
could
not
be
under
*punct* -
stood
*punct* .
*break*
he
started
rapidly
forward
*punct* ,
with
his
head
turned
toward
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
come
on
*punct* ,
he
was
shouting
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
stared
with
blank
and
yokel
*punct* -
like
eyes
at
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
obliged
to
halt
and
retrace
his
steps
*punct* .
*break*
he
stood
then
with
his
back
to
the
enemy
and
delivered
gigantic
curses
into
the
faces
of
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
his
body
vibrated
from
the
weight
and
force
of
his
imprecations
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
could
string
oaths
with
the
facility
of
a
maiden
who
strings
beads
*punct* .
*break*
the
friend
of
the
youth
aroused
*punct* .
*break*
lurching
suddenly
forward
and
dropping
to
his
knees
*punct* ,
he
fired
an
angry
shot
at
the
persistent
woods
*punct* .
*break*
this
action
awakened
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
they
huddled
no
more
like
sheep
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
suddenly
to
be
*punct* -
think
them
of
their
weapons
*punct* ,
and
at
once
com
*punct* -
menced
firing
*punct* .
*break*
belabored
by
their
officers
*punct* ,
they
began
to
move
forward
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
*punct* ,
involved
like
a
cart
involved
in
mud
and
muddle
*punct* ,
started
unevenly
with
many
jolts
and
jerks
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
stopped
now
every
few
paces
to
fire
and
load
*punct* ,
and
in
this
manner
moved
slowly
on
from
trees
to
trees
*punct* .
*break*
the
flaming
opposition
in
their
front
grew
with
their
advance
until
it
seemed
that
all
for
*punct* -
ward
ways
were
barred
by
the
thin
leaping
tongues
*punct* ,
and
off
to
the
right
an
ominous
demon
*punct* -
stration
could
sometimes
be
dimly
discerned
*punct* .
*break*
the
smoke
lately
generated
was
in
confusing
clouds
that
made
it
difficult
for
the
regiment
to
proceed
with
intelligence
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
passed
through
each
curling
mass
the
youth
wondered
what
would
confront
him
on
the
farther
side
*punct* .
*break*
the
command
went
painfully
forward
until
an
open
space
interposed
between
them
and
the
lurid
lines
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
crouching
and
cowering
be
*punct* -
hind
some
trees
*punct* ,
the
men
clung
with
desperation
*punct* ,
as
if
threatened
by
a
wave
*punct* .
*break*
they
looked
wild
*punct* -
eyed
*punct* ,
and
as
if
amazed
at
this
furious
disturbance
they
had
stirred
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
storm
there
was
an
ironical
expression
of
their
importance
*punct* .
*break*
the
faces
of
the
men
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
showed
a
lack
of
a
certain
feeling
of
responsibility
for
being
there
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
as
if
they
had
been
driven
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
dominant
animal
failing
to
remember
in
the
supreme
mo
*punct* -
ments
the
forceful
causes
of
various
superficial
qualities
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
affair
seemed
incompre
*punct* -
hensible
to
many
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
as
they
halted
thus
the
lieutenant
again
be
*punct* -
gan
to
bellow
profanely
*punct* .
*break*
regardless
of
the
vin
*punct* -
dictive
threats
of
the
bullets
*punct* ,
he
went
about
coaxing
*punct* ,
berating
*punct* ,
and
bedamning
*punct* .
*break*
his
lips
*punct* ,
that
were
habitually
in
a
soft
and
childlike
curve
*punct* ,
were
now
writhed
into
unholy
contortions
*punct* .
*break*
he
swore
by
all
possible
deities
*punct* .
*break*
once
he
grabbed
the
youth
by
the
arm
*punct* .
*break*
come
on
*punct* ,
yeh
lunkhead
*punct* !
*break*
we'll
all
git
killed
if
we
stay
here
*punct* .
*break*
an
then
*punct* ,
the
remainder
of
his
idea
disappeared
in
a
blue
haze
of
curses
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
stretched
forth
his
arm
*punct* .
*break*
his
mouth
was
puckered
in
doubt
and
awe
*punct* .
*break*
jest
cross
th
lot
*punct* !
*break*
we
can't
stay
here
*punct* ,
screamed
the
lieutenant
*punct* .
*break*
he
poked
his
face
close
to
the
youth
and
waved
his
ban
*punct* -
daged
hand
*punct* .
*break*
presently
he
grap
*punct* -
pled
with
him
as
if
for
a
wrestling
bout
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
as
if
he
planned
to
drag
the
youth
by
the
ear
on
to
the
assault
*punct* .
*break*
the
private
felt
a
sudden
unspeakable
indig
*punct* -
nation
against
his
officer
*punct* .
*break*
he
wrenched
fiercely
and
shook
him
off
*punct* .
*break*
come
on
herself
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
he
yelled
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
bitter
challenge
in
his
voice
*punct* .
*break*
they
galloped
together
down
the
regimental
front
*punct* .
*break*
the
friend
scrambled
after
them
*punct* .
*break*
in
front
of
the
colors
the
three
men
began
to
bawl
*punct* :
come
on
*punct* !
*break*
they
danced
and
gy
*punct* -
rated
like
tortured
savages
*punct* .
*break*
the
flag
*punct* ,
obedient
to
these
appeals
*punct* ,
bended
its
glittering
form
and
swept
toward
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
wavered
in
indecision
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
and
then
with
a
long
*punct* ,
wailful
cry
the
dilapidated
regiment
surged
forward
and
began
its
new
journey
*punct* .
*break*
over
the
field
went
the
scurrying
mass
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
handful
of
men
splattered
into
the
faces
of
the
enemy
*punct* .
*break*
toward
it
instantly
sprang
the
yel
*punct* -
low
tongues
*punct* .
*break*
a
vast
quantity
of
blue
smoke
hung
before
them
*punct* .
*break*
a
mighty
banging
made
ears
valueless
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
ran
like
a
madman
to
reach
the
woods
before
a
bullet
could
discover
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
ducked
his
head
low
*punct* ,
like
a
football
player
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
haste
his
eyes
almost
closed
*punct* ,
and
the
scene
was
a
wild
blur
*punct* .
*break*
pulsating
saliva
stood
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
within
him
*punct* ,
as
he
hurled
himself
forward
*punct* ,
was
born
a
love
*punct* ,
a
despairing
fondness
for
this
flag
which
was
near
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
creation
of
beauty
and
invulnerability
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
goddess
*punct* ,
radiant
*punct* ,
that
bended
its
form
with
an
imperious
gesture
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
woman
*punct* ,
red
and
white
*punct* ,
hating
and
loving
*punct* ,
that
called
him
with
the
voice
of
his
hopes
*punct* .
*break*
because
no
harm
could
come
to
it
he
en
*punct* -
dowed
it
with
power
*punct* .
*break*
he
kept
near
*punct* ,
as
if
it
could
be
a
saver
of
lives
*punct* ,
and
an
imploring
cry
went
from
his
mind
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
mad
scramble
he
was
aware
that
the
color
sergeant
flinched
suddenly
*punct* ,
as
if
struck
by
a
bludgeon
*punct* .
*break*
he
faltered
*punct* ,
and
then
became
motion
*punct* -
less
*punct* ,
save
for
his
quivering
knees
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
a
spring
and
a
clutch
at
the
pole
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
same
instant
his
friend
grabbed
it
from
the
other
side
*punct* .
*break*
they
jerked
at
it
*punct* ,
stout
and
furious
*punct* ,
but
the
color
sergeant
was
dead
*punct* ,
and
the
corpse
would
not
relinquish
its
trust
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
there
was
a
grim
encounter
*punct* .
*break*
the
dead
man
*punct* ,
swinging
with
bended
back
*punct* ,
seemed
to
be
obsti
*punct* -
nately
tugging
*punct* ,
in
ludicrous
and
awful
ways
*punct* ,
for
the
possession
of
the
flag
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
past
in
an
instant
of
time
*punct* .
*break*
they
wrenched
the
flag
furiously
from
the
dead
man
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
they
turned
again
*punct* ,
the
corpse
swayed
for
*punct* -
ward
with
bowed
head
*punct* .
*break*
one
arm
swung
high
*punct* ,
and
the
curved
hand
fell
with
heavy
protest
on
the
friend's
unheeding
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
two
youths
turned
with
the
flag
they
saw
that
much
of
the
regiment
had
crum
*punct* -
bled
away
*punct* ,
and
the
dejected
remnant
was
coming
slowly
back
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
*punct* ,
having
hurled
themselves
in
projectile
fashion
*punct* ,
had
presently
expended
their
forces
*punct* .
*break*
they
slowly
retreated
*punct* ,
with
their
faces
still
toward
the
spluttering
woods
*punct* ,
and
their
hot
rifles
still
replying
to
the
din
*punct* .
*break*
several
officers
were
giving
orders
*punct* ,
their
voices
keyed
to
screams
*punct* .
*break*
where
in
hell
yeh
goin'
*punct* ?
*break*
the
lieutenant
was
asking
in
a
sarcastic
howl
*punct* .
*break*
and
a
red-bearded
officer
*punct* ,
whose
voice
of
triple
brass
could
plainly
be
heard
*punct* ,
was
commanding
*punct* :
shoot
into
em
*punct* !
*break*
shoot
into
em
*punct* ,
gawd
damn
their
souls
*punct* !
*break*
there
was
a
melee
of
screeches
*punct* ,
in
which
the
men
were
ordered
to
do
conflicting
and
impossible
things
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
and
his
friend
had
a
small
scuffle
over
the
flag
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
let
me
keep
it
*punct* !
*break*
each
felt
satisfied
with
the
other's
pos
*punct* -
session
of
it
*punct* ,
but
each
felt
bound
to
declare
*punct* ,
by
189
an
offer
to
carry
the
emblem
*punct* ,
his
willingness
to
further
risk
himself
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
roughly
pushed
his
friend
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
fell
back
to
the
stolid
trees
*punct* .
*break*
there
it
halted
for
a
moment
to
blaze
at
some
dark
forms
that
had
begun
to
steal
upon
its
track
*punct* .
*break*
presently
it
resumed
its
march
again
*punct* ,
curving
among
the
tree
trunks
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
time
the
depleted
regiment
had
again
reached
the
first
open
space
they
were
receiving
a
fast
and
merciless
fire
*punct* .
*break*
there
seemed
to
be
mobs
all
about
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
greater
part
of
the
men
*punct* ,
discouraged
*punct* ,
their
spirits
worn
by
the
turmoil
*punct* ,
acted
as
if
stunned
*punct* .
*break*
they
accepted
the
pelting
of
the
bul
*punct* -
lets
with
bowed
and
weary
heads
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
of
no
purpose
to
strive
against
walls
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
of
no
use
to
batter
themselves
against
granite
*punct* .
*break*
and
from
this
consciousness
that
they
had
attempted
to
conquer
an
unconquerable
thing
there
seemed
to
arise
a
feeling
that
they
had
been
betrayed
*punct* .
*break*
they
glowered
with
bent
brows
*punct* ,
but
danger
*punct* -
ously
*punct* ,
upon
some
of
the
officers
*punct* ,
more
particu
*punct* -
larly
upon
the
red-bearded
one
with
the
voice
of
triple
brass
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
the
rear
of
the
regiment
was
fringed
with
men
*punct* ,
who
continued
to
shoot
irritably
at
the
advancing
foes
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
resolved
to
make
every
trouble
*punct* .
*break*
the
youthful
lieutenant
was
per
*punct* -
haps
the
last
man
in
the
disordered
mass
*punct* .
*break*
his
forgotten
back
was
toward
the
enemy
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
shot
in
the
arm
*punct* .
*break*
it
hung
straight
and
rigid
*punct* .
*break*
occasionally
he
would
cease
to
remember
it
*punct* ,
and
be
about
to
emphasize
an
oath
with
a
sweeping
gesture
*punct* .
*break*
the
multiplied
pain
caused
him
to
swear
with
incredible
power
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
went
along
with
slipping
*punct* ,
uncertain
feet
*punct* .
*break*
he
kept
watchful
eyes
rearward
*punct* .
*break*
a
scowl
of
mortification
and
rage
was
upon
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
thought
of
a
fine
revenge
upon
the
officer
who
had
referred
to
him
and
his
fellows
as
mule
drivers
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
saw
that
it
could
not
come
to
pass
*punct* .
*break*
his
dreams
had
collapsed
when
the
mule
drivers
*punct* ,
dwindling
rapidly
*punct* ,
had
wavered
and
hes
*punct* -
itated
on
the
little
clearing
*punct* ,
and
then
had
recoiled
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
the
retreat
of
the
mule
drivers
was
a
march
of
shame
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
a
dagger-pointed
gaze
from
without
his
black
*punct* -
ened
face
was
held
toward
the
enemy
*punct* ,
but
his
greater
hatred
was
riveted
upon
the
man
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
not
knowing
him
*punct* ,
had
called
him
a
mule
driver
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
knew
that
he
and
his
comrades
had
failed
to
do
anything
in
successful
ways
that
might
bring
the
little
pangs
of
a
kind
of
remorse
upon
the
officer
*punct* ,
the
youth
allowed
the
rage
of
the
baf
*punct* -
fled
to
possess
him
*punct* .
*break*
this
cold
officer
upon
a
monument
*punct* ,
who
dropped
epithets
unconcernedly
down
*punct* ,
would
be
finer
as
a
dead
man
*punct* ,
he
thought
*punct* .
*break*
so
grievous
did
he
think
it
that
he
could
never
possess
the
secret
right
to
taunt
truly
in
answer
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
pictured
red
letters
of
curious
revenge
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
mule
drivers
*punct* ,
are
we
*punct* ?
*break*
and
now
he
was
compelled
to
throw
them
away
*punct* .
*break*
he
presently
wrapped
his
heart
in
the
cloak
of
his
pride
and
kept
the
flag
erect
*punct* .
*break*
he
ha
*punct* -
rangued
his
fellows
*punct* ,
pushing
against
their
chests
with
his
free
hand
*punct* .
*break*
to
those
he
knew
well
he
made
frantic
appeals
*punct* ,
beseeching
them
by
name
*punct* .
*break*
between
him
and
the
lieutenant
*punct* ,
scolding
and
near
to
losing
his
mind
with
rage
*punct* ,
there
was
felt
a
subtle
fellowship
and
equality
*punct* .
*break*
they
supported
each
other
in
all
manner
of
hoarse
*punct* ,
howling
pro
*punct* -
tests
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
regiment
was
a
machine
run
down
*punct* .
*break*
the
two
men
babbled
at
a
forceless
thing
*punct* .
*break*
the
soldiers
who
had
heart
to
go
slowly
were
con
*punct* -
tinually
shaken
in
their
resolves
by
a
knowledge
that
comrades
were
slipping
with
speed
back
to
the
lines
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
difficult
to
think
of
reputation
when
others
were
thinking
of
skins
*punct* .
*break*
wounded
men
were
left
crying
on
this
black
journey
*punct* .
*break*
the
smoke
fringes
and
flames
blustered
al
*punct* -
ways
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
peering
once
through
a
sud
*punct* -
den
rift
in
a
cloud
*punct* ,
saw
a
brown
mass
of
troops
*punct* ,
interwoven
and
magnified
until
they
appeared
to
be
thousands
*punct* .
*break*
a
fierce-hued
flag
flashed
before
his
vision
*punct* .
*break*
immediately
*punct* ,
as
if
the
uplifting
of
the
smoke
had
been
prearranged
*punct* ,
the
discovered
troops
burst
into
a
rasping
yell
*punct* ,
and
a
hundred
flames
jetted
toward
the
retreating
band
*punct* .
*break*
a
rolling
gray
cloud
again
interposed
as
the
regiment
dog
*punct* -
gedly
replied
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
had
to
depend
again
upon
his
misused
ears
*punct* ,
which
were
trembling
and
buzzing
from
the
melee
of
musketry
and
yells
*punct* .
*break*
the
way
seemed
eternal
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
clouded
haze
men
became
panicstricken
with
the
thought
that
the
regiment
had
lost
its
path
*punct* ,
and
was
proceed
*punct* -
ing
in
a
perilous
direction
*punct* .
*break*
once
the
men
who
headed
the
wild
procession
turned
and
came
push
*punct* -
ing
back
against
their
comrades
*punct* ,
screaming
that
they
were
being
fired
upon
from
points
which
they
had
considered
to
be
toward
their
own
lines
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
cry
a
hysterical
fear
and
dismay
beset
the
troops
*punct* .
*break*
a
soldier
*punct* ,
who
heretofore
had
been
am
*punct* -
bitious
to
make
the
regiment
into
a
wise
little
band
that
would
proceed
calmly
amid
the
huge
*punct* -
appearing
difficulties
*punct* ,
suddenly
sank
down
and
buried
his
face
in
his
arms
with
an
air
of
bowing
to
a
doom
*punct* .
*break*
from
another
a
shrill
lamentation
rang
out
filled
with
profane
allusions
to
a
general
*punct* .
*break*
men
ran
hither
and
thither
*punct* ,
seeking
with
their
eyes
roads
of
escape
*punct* .
*break*
with
serene
regularity
*punct* ,
as
if
controlled
by
a
schedule
*punct* ,
bullets
buffed
into
men
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
walked
stolidly
into
the
midst
of
the
mob
*punct* ,
and
with
his
flag
in
his
hands
took
a
stand
as
if
he
expected
an
attempt
to
push
him
to
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
he
unconsciously
assumed
the
atti
*punct* -
tude
of
the
color
bearer
in
the
fight
of
the
pre
*punct* -
ceding
day
*punct* .
*break*
he
passed
over
his
brow
a
hand
that
trembled
*punct* .
*break*
his
breath
did
not
come
freely
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
choking
during
this
small
wait
for
the
crisis
*punct* .
*break*
his
friend
came
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ,
i
guess
this
is
good-by
*punct* ,
john
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
shut
up
*punct* ,
you
damned
fool
*punct* !
*break*
replied
the
youth
*punct* ,
and
he
would
not
look
at
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
the
officers
labored
like
politicians
to
beat
the
mass
into
a
proper
circle
to
face
the
men
*punct* -
aces
*punct* .
*break*
the
ground
was
uneven
and
torn
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
curled
into
depressions
and
fitted
them
*punct* -
selves
snugly
behind
whatever
would
frustrate
a
bullet
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
noted
with
vague
surprise
that
the
lieutenant
was
standing
mutely
with
his
legs
far
apart
and
his
sword
held
in
the
manner
of
a
cane
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
wondered
what
had
happened
to
his
vocal
organs
that
he
no
more
cursed
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
something
curious
in
this
little
in
*punct* -
tent
pause
of
the
lieutenant
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
like
a
babe
which
*punct* ,
having
wept
its
fill
*punct* ,
raises
its
eyes
and
fixes
upon
a
distant
toy
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
engrossed
in
this
contemplation
*punct* ,
and
the
soft
under
lip
quivered
from
self-whispered
words
*punct* .
*break*
some
lazy
and
ignorant
smoke
curled
slowly
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
*punct* ,
hiding
from
the
bullets
*punct* ,
waited
anx
*punct* -
iously
for
it
to
lift
and
disclose
the
plight
of
the
regiment
*punct* .
*break*
the
silent
ranks
were
suddenly
thrilled
by
the
eager
voice
of
the
youthful
lieutenant
bawling
out
*punct* :
here
they
come
*punct* !
*break*
right
onto
us
*punct* ,
b'gawd
*punct* !
*break*
his
further
words
were
lost
in
a
roar
of
wicked
thunder
from
the
men's
rifles
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth's
eyes
had
instantly
turned
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
awakened
and
agitated
lieutenant
*punct* ,
and
he
had
seen
the
haze
of
treachery
disclosing
a
body
of
soldiers
of
the
enemy
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
so
near
that
he
could
see
their
features
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
recognition
as
he
looked
at
the
types
of
faces
*punct* .
*break*
also
he
perceived
with
dim
amazement
that
their
uniforms
were
rather
gay
in
effect
*punct* ,
being
light
gray
*punct* ,
accented
with
a
brilliant-hued
facing
*punct* .
*break*
too
*punct* ,
the
clothes
seemed
new
*punct* .
*break*
these
troops
had
apparently
been
going
for
*punct* -
ward
with
caution
*punct* ,
their
rifles
held
in
readiness
*punct* ,
when
the
youthful
lieutenant
had
discovered
them
and
their
movement
had
been
interrupted
by
the
volley
from
the
blue
regiment
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
moment's
glimpse
*punct* ,
it
was
derived
that
they
had
been
unaware
of
the
proximity
of
their
dark
*punct* -
suited
foes
or
had
mistaken
the
direction
*punct* .
*break*
al
*punct* -
most
instantly
they
were
shut
utterly
from
the
youth's
sight
by
the
smoke
from
the
energetic
rifles
of
his
companions
*punct* .
*break*
he
strained
his
vision
to
learn
the
accomplishment
of
the
volley
*punct* ,
but
the
smoke
hung
before
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
two
bodies
of
troops
exchanged
blows
in
the
manner
of
a
pair
of
boxers
*punct* .
*break*
the
fast
angry
firings
went
back
and
forth
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
in
blue
were
intent
with
the
despair
of
their
circum
*punct* -
stances
and
they
seized
upon
the
revenge
to
be
had
at
close
range
*punct* .
*break*
their
thunder
swelled
loud
and
valiant
*punct* .
*break*
their
curving
front
bristled
with
flashes
and
the
place
resounded
with
the
clangor
of
their
ramrods
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
ducked
and
dodged
for
a
time
and
achieved
a
few
unsatisfactory
views
of
the
enemy
*punct* .
*break*
there
appeared
to
be
many
of
them
and
they
were
replying
swiftly
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
moving
toward
the
blue
regiment
*punct* ,
step
by
step
*punct* .
*break*
he
seated
himself
gloomily
on
the
ground
with
his
flag
between
his
knees
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
noted
the
vicious
*punct* ,
wolflike
temper
of
his
comrades
he
had
a
sweet
thought
that
if
the
enemy
was
about
to
swallow
the
regimental
broom
as
a
large
prisoner
*punct* ,
it
could
at
least
have
the
consolation
of
going
down
with
bristles
for
*punct* -
ward
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
blows
of
the
antagonist
began
to
grow
more
weak
*punct* .
*break*
fewer
bullets
ripped
the
air
*punct* ,
and
finally
*punct* ,
when
the
men
slackened
to
learn
of
the
fight
*punct* ,
they
could
see
only
dark
*punct* ,
floating
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
lay
still
and
gazed
*punct* .
*break*
pres
*punct* -
ently
some
chance
whim
came
to
the
pestering
blur
*punct* ,
and
it
began
to
coil
heavily
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
saw
a
ground
vacant
of
fighters
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
have
been
an
empty
stage
if
it
were
not
for
a
few
corpses
that
lay
thrown
and
twisted
into
fantastic
shapes
upon
the
sward
*punct* .
*break*
at
sight
of
this
tableau
*punct* ,
many
of
the
men
in
blue
sprang
from
behind
their
covers
and
made
an
ungainly
dance
of
joy
*punct* .
*break*
their
eyes
burned
and
a
hoarse
cheer
of
elation
broke
from
their
dry
lips
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
begun
to
seem
to
them
that
events
were
trying
to
prove
that
they
were
impotent
*punct* .
*break*
these
little
battles
had
evidently
endeavored
to
demon
*punct* -
strate
that
the
men
could
not
fight
well
*punct* .
*break*
when
on
the
verge
of
submission
to
these
opinions
*punct* ,
the
small
duel
had
showed
them
that
the
propor
*punct* -
tions
were
not
impossible
*punct* ,
and
by
it
they
had
revenged
themselves
upon
their
misgivings
and
upon
the
foe
*punct* .
*break*
the
impetus
of
enthusiasm
was
theirs
again
*punct* .
*break*
they
gazed
about
them
with
looks
of
uplifted
pride
*punct* ,
feeling
new
trust
in
the
grim
*punct* ,
always
confident
weapons
in
their
hands
*punct* .
*break*
and
they
were
men
*punct* .
*break*
presently
they
knew
that
no
firing
threat
*punct* -
ened
them
*punct* .
*break*
all
ways
seemed
once
more
opened
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
dusty
blue
lines
of
their
friends
were
disclosed
a
short
distance
away
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
distance
there
were
many
colossal
noises
*punct* ,
but
in
all
this
part
of
the
field
there
was
a
sudden
stillness
*punct* .
*break*
they
perceived
that
they
were
free
*punct* .
*break*
the
depleted
band
drew
a
long
breath
of
relief
and
gathered
itself
into
a
bunch
to
complete
its
trip
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
last
length
of
journey
the
men
began
to
show
strange
emotions
*punct* .
*break*
they
hurried
with
nervous
fear
*punct* .
*break*
some
who
had
been
dark
and
un
*punct* -
faltering
in
the
grimmest
moments
now
could
not
conceal
an
anxiety
that
made
them
frantic
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
perhaps
that
they
dreaded
to
be
killed
in
insignificant
ways
after
the
times
for
proper
military
deaths
had
passed
*punct* .
*break*
or
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
they
thought
it
would
be
too
ironical
to
get
killed
at
199
the
portals
of
safety
*punct* .
*break*
with
backward
looks
of
perturbation
*punct* ,
they
hastened
*punct* .
*break*
as
they
approached
their
own
lines
there
was
some
sarcasm
exhibited
on
the
part
of
a
gaunt
and
bronzed
regiment
that
lay
resting
in
the
shade
of
trees
*punct* .
*break*
questions
were
wafted
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
where
th
hell
yeh
been
*punct* ?
*break*
what
yeh
comin
back
fer
*punct* ?
*break*
why
didn't
yeh
stay
there
*punct* ?
*break*
was
it
warm
out
there
*punct* ,
sonny
*punct* ?
*break*
goin
home
now
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* ?
*break*
one
shouted
in
taunting
mimicry
*punct* :
oh
*punct* ,
mother
*punct* ,
come
quick
an
look
at
th
sojers
*punct* !
*break*
there
was
no
reply
from
the
bruised
and
bat
*punct* -
tered
regiment
*punct* ,
save
that
one
man
made
broad
*punct* -
cast
challenges
to
fist
fights
and
the
red-bearded
officer
walked
rather
near
and
glared
in
great
swashbuckler
style
at
a
tall
captain
in
the
other
regiment
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
lieutenant
suppressed
the
man
who
wished
to
fist
fight
*punct* ,
and
the
tall
cap
*punct* -
tain
*punct* ,
flushing
at
the
little
fanfare
of
the
red
*punct* -
bearded
one
*punct* ,
was
obliged
to
look
intently
at
some
trees
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth's
tender
flesh
was
deeply
stung
by
these
remarks
*punct* .
*break*
from
under
his
creased
brows
he
glowered
with
hate
at
the
mockers
*punct* .
*break*
he
meditated
upon
a
few
revenges
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
many
in
the
regiment
hung
their
heads
in
criminal
fashion
*punct* ,
so
that
it
came
to
pass
that
the
men
trudged
with
sudden
heaviness
*punct* ,
as
if
they
bore
upon
their
bended
shoulders
the
coffin
of
their
honor
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
youthful
lieutenant
*punct* ,
recollecting
himself
*punct* ,
be
*punct* -
gan
to
mutter
softly
in
black
curses
*punct* .
*break*
they
turned
when
they
arrived
at
their
old
position
to
regard
the
ground
over
which
they
had
charged
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
in
this
contemplation
was
smitten
with
a
large
astonishment
*punct* .
*break*
he
discovered
that
the
distances
*punct* ,
as
compared
with
the
brilliant
measurings
of
his
mind
*punct* ,
were
trivial
and
ridicu
*punct* -
lous
*punct* .
*break*
the
stolid
trees
*punct* ,
where
much
had
taken
place
*punct* ,
seemed
incredibly
near
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
now
that
he
reflected
*punct* ,
he
saw
to
have
been
short
*punct* .
*break*
he
wondered
at
the
number
of
emotions
and
events
that
had
been
crowded
into
such
little
spaces
*punct* .
*break*
elfin
thoughts
must
have
exaggerated
and
enlarged
everything
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
that
there
was
bitter
justice
in
the
speeches
of
the
gaunt
and
bronzed
vet
*punct* -
erans
*punct* .
*break*
he
veiled
a
glance
of
disdain
at
his
fel
*punct* -
lows
who
strewed
the
ground
*punct* ,
choking
with
dust
*punct* ,
red
from
perspiration
*punct* ,
misty-eyed
*punct* ,
disheveled
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
gulping
at
their
canteens
*punct* ,
fierce
to
wring
every
mite
of
water
from
them
*punct* ,
and
they
polished
at
their
swollen
and
watery
features
with
coat
sleeves
and
bunches
of
grass
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
to
the
youth
there
was
a
consider
*punct* -
able
joy
in
musing
upon
his
performances
during
the
charge
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
had
very
little
time
pre
*punct* -
viously
in
which
to
appreciate
himself
*punct* ,
so
that
there
was
now
much
satisfaction
in
quietly
think
*punct* -
ing
of
his
actions
*punct* .
*break*
he
recalled
bits
of
color
that
in
the
flurry
had
stamped
themselves
unawares
upon
his
engaged
senses
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
regiment
lay
heaving
from
its
hot
exer
*punct* -
tions
the
officer
who
had
named
them
as
mule
drivers
came
galloping
along
the
line
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
lost
his
cap
*punct* .
*break*
his
tousled
hair
streamed
wildly
*punct* ,
and
his
face
was
dark
with
vexation
and
wrath
*punct* .
*break*
his
temper
was
displayed
with
more
clearness
by
the
way
in
which
he
managed
his
horse
*punct* .
*break*
he
jerked
and
wrenched
savagely
at
his
bridle
*punct* ,
stop
*punct* -
ping
the
hard-breathing
animal
with
a
furious
pull
near
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
*punct* .
*break*
he
im
*punct* -
mediately
exploded
in
reproaches
which
came
unbidden
to
the
ears
of
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
suddenly
alert
*punct* ,
being
always
curious
about
black
words
between
officers
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
thunder
*punct* ,
macchesnay
*punct* ,
what
an
awful
bull
you
made
of
this
thing
*punct* !
*break*
began
the
officer
*punct* .
*break*
he
attempted
low
tones
*punct* ,
but
his
indignation
caused
certain
of
the
men
to
learn
the
sense
of
his
words
*punct* .
*break*
what
an
awful
mess
you
made
*punct* !
*break*
good
lord
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
you
stopped
about
a
hun
*punct* -
dred
feet
this
side
of
a
very
pretty
success
*punct* !
*break*
if
your
men
had
gone
a
hundred
feet
farther
you
would
have
made
a
great
charge
*punct* ,
but
as
it
is
*punct* ,
what
a
lot
of
mud
diggers
you've
got
any
*punct* -
way
*punct* !
*break*
the
men
*punct* ,
listening
with
bated
breath
*punct* ,
now
turned
their
curious
eyes
upon
the
colonel
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
a
ragamuffin
interest
in
this
affair
*punct* .
*break*
the
colonel
was
seen
to
straighten
his
form
and
put
one
hand
forth
in
oratorical
fashion
*punct* .
*break*
he
wore
an
injured
air
*punct* ;
it
was
as
if
a
deacon
had
been
accused
of
stealing
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
were
wiggling
in
an
ecstasy
of
excitement
*punct* .
*break*
but
of
a
sudden
the
colonel's
manner
changed
from
that
of
a
deacon
to
that
of
a
frenchman
*punct* .
*break*
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
general
*punct* ,
we
went
as
far
as
we
could
*punct* ,
he
said
calmly
*punct* .
*break*
as
far
as
you
could
*punct* ?
*break*
did
you
*punct* ,
b'gawd
*punct* ?
*break*
snorted
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
that
wasn't
very
far
*punct* ,
was
it
*punct* ?
*break*
he
added
*punct* ,
with
a
glance
of
cold
con
*punct* -
tempt
into
the
other's
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
not
very
far
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* .
*break*
you
were
intended
to
make
a
diversion
in
favor
of
whiterside
*punct* .
*break*
how
well
you
succeeded
your
own
ears
can
now
tell
you
*punct* .
*break*
he
wheeled
his
horse
and
rode
stiffly
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
colonel
*punct* ,
bidden
to
hear
the
jarring
noises
of
an
engagement
in
the
woods
to
the
left
*punct* ,
broke
out
in
vague
damnations
*punct* .
*break*
the
lieutenant
*punct* ,
who
had
listened
with
an
air
of
impotent
rage
to
the
interview
*punct* ,
spoke
suddenly
in
firm
and
undaunted
tones
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
care
what
a
man
is
*punct* ,
whether
he
is
a
general
or
what
*punct* ,
if
he
says
th
boys
didn't
put
up
a
good
fight
out
there
he's
a
damned
fool
*punct* .
*break*
lieutenant
*punct* ,
began
the
colonel
*punct* ,
severely
*punct* ,
this
is
my
own
affair
*punct* ,
and
i'll
trouble
you
*punct* ,
the
lieutenant
made
an
obedient
gesture
*punct* .
*break*
all
right
*punct* ,
colonel
*punct* ,
all
right
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
he
sat
down
with
an
air
of
being
content
with
him
*punct* -
self
*punct* .
*break*
the
news
that
the
regiment
had
been
re
*punct* -
proached
went
along
the
line
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
time
the
men
were
bewildered
by
it
*punct* .
*break*
they
ejaculated
*punct* ,
staring
at
the
vanishing
form
of
the
general
*punct* .
*break*
they
conceived
it
to
be
a
huge
mistake
*punct* .
*break*
presently
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
they
began
to
believe
that
in
truth
their
efforts
had
been
called
light
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
could
see
this
conviction
weigh
upon
the
entire
regiment
until
the
men
were
like
cuffed
and
cursed
animals
*punct* ,
but

the
friend
*punct* ,
with
a
grievance
in
his
eye

went
to
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
i
wonder
what
he
does
want
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
think
we
went
out
there
an
played
marbles
*punct* !
*break*
i
never
see
sech
a
man
*punct* !
*break*
the
youth
developed
a
tranquil
philosophy
for
these
moments
of
irritation
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
he
rejoined
*punct* ,
he
probably
didn't
see
nothing
of
it
at
all
and
got
mad
as
blazes
*punct* ,
and
concluded
we
were
a
lot
of
sheep
*punct* ,
just
because
we
didn't
do
what
he
wanted
done
*punct* .
*break*
it's
a
pity
old
grandpa
hender
*punct* -
son
got
killed
yestirday
*punct* ,
he'd
have
known
that
we
did
our

*break*
it's
just
our
awful
luck
*punct* ,
that's
what
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
say
so
*punct* ,
replied
the
friend
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
to
be
deeply
wounded
at
an
injustice
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
say
we
did
have
awful
luck

there's
no

everything
yeh
do

no

ain't
done
right

*break*
the
youth
spoke
soothingly
to
his
comrade
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
we
both
did
good
*punct* .
*break*
i'd
like
to
see
the
fool
what'd
say
we
both
didn't
do
as
good
as
we
could
*punct* !
*break*
of
course
we
did
*punct* ,
declared
the
friend
stoutly
*punct* .
*break*
an
i'd
break
th
feller's
neck
if
he
was
as
big
as
a
church
*punct* .
*break*
but
we're
all
right
*punct* ,
anyhow
*punct* ,
for
i
heard
one
feller
say
that
we
two
fit
th
best
in

*punct* ,
an
they
had
a
great
argument
bout
it

*break*
an
a
lot
more
struck
in

it
wasn't
a

we
did
fight
like
thunder

an
they
give

quite
a

the
youth
exclaimed
with
sudden
exaspera

*punct* :

a
lunkhead

*break*
he
makes
me

*break*
i
wish

come
along

*break*
we'd
show

he
ceased
because
several
men
had
come
hurrying
up
*punct* .
*break*
their

expressed
a
bringing

repeated
the

*punct* ,
and
he
arranged
himself
to
tell
his

*break*
the
others
made
an
excited

*break*
but
despite
these
youthful
scoffings
and
embar
*punct* -
rassments
*punct* ,
they
knew
that
their
faces
were
deeply
flushing
from
thrills
of
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
they
ex
*punct* -
changed
a
secret
glance
of
joy
and
congratula

tion
*punct* .
*break*
they
speedily
forgot
many
things
*punct* .
*break*
the
past
held
no
pictures
of
error
and
disappointment
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
very
happy
*punct* ,
and
their
hearts
swelled
with
grateful
affection
for
the
colonel
and
the
youthful
lieutenant
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
woods
again
began
to
pour
forth
the
dark-hued
masses
of
the
enemy
the
youth
felt
serene
self-confidence
*punct* .
*break*
he
smiled
briefly
when
he
saw
men
dodge
and
duck
at
the
long
screech
*punct* -
ings
of
shells
that
were
thrown
in
giant
handfuls
over
them
*punct* .
*break*
he
stood
*punct* ,
erect
and
tranquil
*punct* ,
watch
*punct* -
ing
the
attack
begin
against
a
part
of
the
line
that
made
a
blue
curve
along
the
side
of
an
adja
*punct* -
cent
hill
*punct* .
*break*
his
vision
being
unmolested
by
smoke
from
the
rifles
of
his
companions
*punct* ,
he
had
oppor
*punct* -
tunities
to
see
parts
of
the
hard
fight
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
relief
to
perceive
at
last
from
whence
came
some
of
these
noises
which
had
been
roared
into
his
ears
*punct* .
*break*
off
a
short
way
he
saw
two
regiments
fight
*punct* -
ing
a
little
separate
battle
with
two
other
regi
*punct* -
ments
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
in
a
cleared
space
*punct* ,
wearing
a
set
*punct* -
apart
look
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
blazing
as
if
upon
a
wager
*punct* ,
giving
and
taking
tremendous
blows
*punct* .
*break*
the
firings
were
incredibly
fierce
and
rapid
*punct* .
*break*
209
these
intent
regiments
apparently
were
oblivious
of
all
larger
purposes
of
war
*punct* ,
and
were
slugging
each
other
as
if
at
a
matched
game
*punct* .
*break*
in
another
direction
he
saw
a
magnificent
brigade
going
with
the
evident
intention
of
driv
*punct* -
ing
the
enemy
from
a
wood
*punct* .
*break*
they
passed
in
out
of
sight
and
presently
there
was
a
most
awe-in
*punct* -
spiring
racket
in
the
wood
*punct* .
*break*
the
noise
was
un
*punct* -
speakable
*punct* .
*break*
having
stirred
this
prodigious
up
*punct* -
roar
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
apparently
*punct* ,
finding
it
too
prodigious
*punct* ,
the
brigade
*punct* ,
after
a
little
time
*punct* ,
came
marching
airily
out
again
with
its
fine
formation
in
nowise
disturbed
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
no
traces
of
speed
in
its
movements
*punct* .
*break*
the
brigade
was
jaunty
and
seemed
to
point
a
proud
thumb
at
the
yelling
wood
*punct* .
*break*
on
a
slope
to
the
left
there
was
a
long
row
of
guns
*punct* ,
gruff
and
maddened
*punct* ,
denouncing
the
enemy
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
down
through
the
woods
*punct* ,
were
forming
for
another
attack
in
the
pitiless
mo
*punct* -
notony
of
conflicts
*punct* .
*break*
the
round
red
discharges
from
the
guns
made
a
crimson
flare
and
a
high
*punct* ,
thick
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
occasional
glimpses
could
be
caught
of
groups
of
the
toiling
artillerymen
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
rear
of
this
row
of
guns
stood
a
house
*punct* ,
calm
and
white
*punct* ,
amid
bursting
shells
*punct* .
*break*
a
congregation
of
horses
*punct* ,
tied
to
a
long
railing
*punct* ,
were
tugging
frenziedly
at
their
bridles
*punct* .
*break*
men
were
running
hither
and
thither
*punct* .
*break*
the
detached
battle
between
the
four
regi
*punct* -
ments
lasted
for
some
time
*punct* .
*break*
there
chanced
to
be
no
interference
*punct* ,
and
they
settled
their
dispute
by
themselves
*punct* .
*break*
they
struck
savagely
and
pow
*punct* -
erfully
at
each
other
for
a
period
of
minutes
*punct* ,
and
then
the
lighter-hued
regiments
faltered
and
drew
back
*punct* ,
leaving
the
dark-blue
lines
shouting
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
could
see
the
two
flags
shaking
with
laughter
amid
the
smoke
remnants
*punct* .
*break*
presently
there
was
a
stillness
*punct* ,
pregnant
with
meaning
*punct* .
*break*
the
blue
lines
shifted
and
changed
a
trifle
and
stared
expectantly
at
the
silent
woods
and
fields
before
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
hush
was
solemn
and
churchlike
*punct* ,
save
for
a
distant
battery
that
*punct* ,
evidently
unable
to
remain
quiet
*punct* ,
sent
a
faint
rolling
thunder
over
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
it
irritated
*punct* ,
like
the
noises
of
unimpressed
boys
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
imagined
that
it
would
prevent
their
perched
ears
from
hearing
the
first
words
of
the
new
battle
*punct* .
*break*
of
a
sudden
the
guns
on
the
slope
roared
out
a
message
of
warning
*punct* .
*break*
a
spluttering
sound
had
begun
in
the
woods
*punct* .
*break*
it
swelled
with
amazing
speed
to
a
profound
clamor
that
involved
the
earth
in
noises
*punct* .
*break*
the
splitting
crashes
swept
along
the
lines
until
an
interminable
roar
was
developed
*punct* .
*break*
to
those
in
the
midst
of
it
it
became
a
din
fitted
to
the
universe
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
whirring
and
thumping
of
gigantic
machinery
*punct* ,
complica
*punct* -
tions
among
the
smaller
stars
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth's
ears
were
filled
up
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
incapable
of
hearing
more
*punct* .
*break*
on
an
incline
over
which
a
road
wound
he
saw
wild
and
desperate
rushes
of
men
perpet
*punct* -
ually
backward
and
forward
in
riotous
surges
*punct* .
*break*
these
parts
of
the
opposing
armies
were
two
long
waves
that
pitched
upon
each
other
madly
at
dictated
points
*punct* .
*break*
to
and
fro
they
swelled
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
*punct* ,
one
side
by
its
yells
and
cheers
would
proclaim
decisive
blows
*punct* ,
but
a
moment
later
the
other
side
would
be
all
yells
and
cheers
*punct* .
*break*
once
the
youth
saw
a
spray
of
light
forms
go
in
houndlike
leaps
toward
the
waving
blue
lines
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
much
howling
*punct* ,
and
presently
it
went
away
with
a
vast
mouthful
of
prisoners
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
he
saw
a
blue
wave
dash
with
such
thunderous
force
against
a
gray
obstruction
that
it
seemed
to
clear
the
earth
of
it
and
leave
nothing
but
trampled
sod
*punct* .
*break*
and
always
in
their
swift
and
deadly
rushes
to
and
fro
the
men
screamed
and
yelled
like
maniacs
*punct* .
*break*
particular
pieces
of
fence
or
secure
positions
behind
collections
of
trees
were
wrangled
over
*punct* ,
as
gold
thrones
or
pearl
bedsteads
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
desperate
lunges
at
these
chosen
spots
seemingly
every
instant
*punct* ,
and
most
of
them
were
bandied
like
light
toys
between
the
contending
forces
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
could
not
tell
from
the
battle
flags
flying
like
crimson
foam
in
many
directions
which
color
of
cloth
was
winning
*punct* .
*break*
his
emaciated
regiment
bustled
forth
with
undiminished
fierceness
when
its
time
came
*punct* .
*break*
when
assaulted
again
by
bullets
*punct* ,
the
men
burst
out
in
a
barbaric
cry
of
rage
and
pain
*punct* .
*break*
they
bent
their
heads
in
aims
of
intent
hatred
behind
the
projected
hammers
of
their
guns
*punct* .
*break*
their
ramrods
clanged
loud
with
fury
as
their
eager
arms
pounded
the
cartridges
into
the
rifle
barrels
*punct* .
*break*
the
front
of
the
regiment
was
a
smoke
*punct* -
wall
penetrated
by
the
flashing
points
of
yellow
and
red
*punct* .
*break*
wallowing
in
the
fight
*punct* ,
they
were
in
an
astonishingly
short
time
resmudged
*punct* .
*break*
they
surpassed
in
stain
and
dirt
all
their
previous
ap
*punct* -
pearances
*punct* .
*break*
moving
to
and
fro
with
strained
exertion
*punct* ,
jabbering
the
while
*punct* ,
they
were
*punct* ,
with
their
swaying
bodies
*punct* ,
black
faces
*punct* ,
and
glowing
eyes
*punct* ,
like
strange
and
ugly
friends
jigging
heavily
in
the
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
the
lieutenant
*punct* ,
returning
from
a
tour
after
a
bandage
*punct* ,
produced
from
a
hidden
receptacle
of
his
mind
new
and
portentous
oaths
suited
to
the
emergency
*punct* .
*break*
strings
of
expletives
he
swung
lashlike
over
the
backs
of
his
men
*punct* ,
and
it
was
evident
that
his
previous
efforts
had
in
nowise
impaired
his
resources
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
still
the
bearer
of
the
colors
*punct* ,
did
not
feel
his
idleness
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
deeply
absorbed
as
a
spectator
*punct* .
*break*
the
crash
and
swing
of
the
great
drama
made
him
lean
forward
*punct* ,
intent-eyed
*punct* ,
his
face
working
in
small
contortions
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
he
prattled
*punct* ,
words
coming
unconsciously
from
him
in
grotesque
exclamations
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
know
that
he
breathed
*punct* ;
that
the
flag
hung
silently
over
him
*punct* ,
so
absorbed
was
he
*punct* .
*break*
a
formidable
line
of
the
enemy
came
within
dangerous
range
*punct* .
*break*
they
could
be
seen
plainly
*punct* ,
tall
*punct* ,
gaunt
men
with
excited
faces
running
with
long
strides
toward
a
wandering
fence
*punct* .
*break*
at
sight
of
this
danger
the
men
suddenly
ceased
their
cursing
monotone
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
an
instant
of
strained
silence
before
they
threw
up
their
rifles
and
fired
a
plumping
volley
at
the
foes
*punct* .
*break*
there
had
been
no
order
given
*punct* ;
the
men
*punct* ,
upon
recognizing
the
menace
*punct* ,
had
immedi
*punct* -
ately
let
drive
their
flock
of
bullets
without
wait
*punct* -
ing
for
word
of
command
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
enemy
were
quick
to
gain
the
protec
*punct* -
tion
of
the
wandering
line
of
fence
*punct* .
*break*
they
slid
down
behind
it
with
remarkable
celerity
*punct* ,
and
from
this
position
they
began
briskly
to
slice
up
the
blue
men
*punct* .
*break*
these
latter
braced
their
energies
for
a
great
struggle
*punct* .
*break*
often
*punct* ,
white
clinched
teeth
shone
from
the
dusky
faces
*punct* .
*break*
many
heads
surged
to
and
fro
*punct* ,
floating
upon
a
pale
sea
of
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
those
behind
the
fence
frequently
shouted
and
yelped
in
taunts
and
gibelike
cries
*punct* ,
but
the
regi
*punct* -
ment
maintained
a
stressed
silence
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
*punct* ,
at
this
new
assault
the
men
recalled
the
fact
that
they
had
been
named
mud
diggers
*punct* ,
and
it
made
their
situation
thrice
bitter
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
breath
*punct* -
lessly
intent
upon
keeping
the
ground
and
thrust
*punct* -
ing
away
the
rejoicing
body
of
the
enemy
*punct* .
*break*
they
fought
swiftly
and
with
a
despairing
savageness
denoted
in
their
expressions
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
had
resolved
not
to
budge
what
*punct* -
ever
should
happen
*punct* .
*break*
some
arrows
of
scorn
that
had
buried
themselves
in
his
heart
had
generated
strange
and
unspeakable
hatred
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
clear
to
him
that
his
final
and
absolute
revenge
was
to
be
achieved
by
his
dead
body
lying
*punct* ,
torn
and
gluttering
*punct* ,
upon
the
field
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
to
be
a
poignant
retaliation
upon
the
officer
who
had
said
mule
drivers
*punct* ,
and
later
mud
diggers
*punct* ,
for
in
all
the
wild
graspings
of
his
mind
for
a
unit
responsible
for
his
sufferings
and
commo
*punct* -
tions
he
always
seized
upon
the
man
who
had
dubbed
him
wrongly
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
was
his
idea
*punct* ,
vaguely
formulated
*punct* ,
that
his
corpse
would
be
for
those
eyes
a
great
and
salt
reproach
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
bled
extravagantly
*punct* .
*break*
grunting
bundles
of
blue
began
to
drop
*punct* .
*break*
the
orderly
sergeant
of
the
youth's
company
was
shot
through
the
cheeks
*punct* .
*break*
its
supports
being
injured
*punct* ,
his
jaw
hung
afar
down
*punct* ,
disclosing
in
the
wide
cavern
of
his
mouth
a
pulsing
mass
of
blood
and
teeth
*punct* .
*break*
and
with
it
all
he
made
attempts
to
cry
out
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
endeavor
there
was
a
dreadful
earnestness
*punct* ,
as
if
he
conceived
that
one
great
shriek
would
make
him
well
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
saw
him
presently
go
rearward
*punct* .
*break*
his
strength
seemed
in
nowise
impaired
*punct* .
*break*
he
ran
swiftly
*punct* ,
casting
wild
glances
for
succor
*punct* .
*break*
others
fell
down
about
the
feet
of
their
com
*punct* -
panions
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
the
wounded
crawled
out
and
away
*punct* ,
but
many
lay
still
*punct* ,
their
bodies
twisted
into
impossible
shapes
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
looked
once
for
his
friend
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
a
vehement
young
man
*punct* ,
powder-smeared
and
frowzled
*punct* ,
whom
he
knew
to
be
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
lieu
*punct* -
tenant
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
was
unscathed
in
his
position
at
the
rear
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
continued
to
curse
*punct* ,
but
it
was
now
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
using
his
last
box
of
oaths
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
fire
of
the
regiment
had
begun
to
wane
and
drip
*punct* .
*break*
the
robust
voice
*punct* ,
that
had
come
strangely
from
the
thin
ranks
*punct* ,
was
growing
rapidly
weak
*punct* .
*break*
the
colonel
came
running
along
back
of
the
line
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
other
officers
following
him
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
charge'm
*punct* !
*break*
we
must
charge'm
*punct* !
*break*
they
cried
with
resentful
voices
*punct* ,
as
if
anticipating
a
rebellion
against
this
plan
by
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
upon
hearing
the
shouts
*punct* ,
began
to
study
the
distance
between
him
and
the
enemy
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
vague
calculations
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
that
to
be
firm
soldiers
they
must
go
forward
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
death
to
stay
in
the
present
place
*punct* ,
and
with
all
the
circumstances
to
go
backward
would
exalt
too
many
others
*punct* .
*break*
their
hope
was
to
push
the
galling
foes
away
from
the
fence
*punct* .
*break*
he
expected
that
his
companions
*punct* ,
weary
and
stiffened
*punct* ,
would
have
to
be
driven
to
this
assault
*punct* ,
but
as
he
turned
toward
them
he
perceived
with
a
certain
surprise
that
they
were
giving
quick
and
unqualified
expressions
of
assent
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
an
ominous
*punct* ,
clanging
overture
to
the
charge
217
when
the
shafts
of
the
bayonets
rattled
upon
the
rifle
barrels
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
yelled
words
of
command
the
soldiers
sprang
forward
in
eager
leaps
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
new
and
unexpected
force
in
the
movement
of
the
regiment
*punct* .
*break*
a
knowledge
of
its
faded
and
jaded
condition
made
the
charge
ap
*punct* -
pear
like
a
paroxysm
*punct* ,
a
display
of
the
strength
that
comes
before
a
final
feebleness
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
scampered
in
insane
fever
of
haste
*punct* ,
racing
as
if
to
achieve
a
sudden
success
before
an
exhilarating
fluid
should
leave
them
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
blind
and
de
*punct* -
spairing
rush
by
the
collection
of
men
in
dusty
and
tattered
blue
*punct* ,
over
a
green
sward
and
under
a
sapphire
sky
*punct* ,
toward
a
fence
*punct* ,
dimly
outlined
in
smoke
*punct* ,
from
behind
which
spluttered
the
fierce
rifles
of
enemies
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
kept
the
bright
colors
to
the
front
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
waving
his
free
arm
in
furious
circles
*punct* ,
the
while
shrieking
mad
calls
and
appeals
*punct* ,
urging
on
those
that
did
not
need
to
be
urged
*punct* ,
for
it
seemed
that
the
mob
of
blue
men
hurling
them
*punct* -
selves
on
the
dangerous
group
of
rifles
were
again
grown
suddenly
wild
with
an
enthusiasm
of
unselfishness
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
many
firings
starting
toward
them
*punct* ,
it
looked
as
if
they
would
merely
succeed
in
making
a
great
sprinkling
of
corpses
on
the
grass
between
their
former
position
and
the
fence
*punct* .
*break*
but
they
were
in
a
state
of
frenzy
*punct* ,
perhaps
because
of
forgotten
vanities
*punct* ,
and
it
made
an
exhibition
of
sublime
recklessness
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
obvious
questioning
*punct* ,
nor
figurings
*punct* ,
nor
dia
*punct* -
grams
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
*punct* ,
apparently
*punct* ,
no
considered
loopholes
*punct* .
*break*
it
appeared
that
the
swift
wings
of
their
desires
would
have
shattered
against
the
iron
gates
of
the
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
he
himself
felt
the
daring
spirit
of
a
savage
religion
mad
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
capable
of
profound
sacri
*punct* -
fices
*punct* ,
a
tremendous
death
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
no
time
for
dissections
*punct* ,
but
he
knew
that
he
thought
of
the
bullets
only
as
things
that
could
prevent
him
from
reaching
the
place
of
his
endeavor
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
subtle
flashings
of
joy
within
him
that
thus
should
be
his
mind
*punct* .
*break*
he
strained
all
his
strength
*punct* .
*break*
his
eyesight
was
shaken
and
dazzled
by
the
tension
of
thought
and
muscle
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
see
anything
excepting
the
mist
of
smoke
gashed
by
the
little
knives
of
fire
*punct* ,
but
he
knew
that
in
it
lay
the
aged
fence
of
a
vanished
farmer
protecting
the
snuggled
bodies
of
the
gray
men
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
ran
a
thought
of
the
shock
of
contact
gleamed
in
his
mind
*punct* .
*break*
he
expected
a
great
con
*punct* -
cussion
when
the
two
bodies
of
troops
crashed
together
*punct* .
*break*
this
became
a
part
of
his
wild
battle
madness
*punct* .
*break*
he
could
feel
the
onward
swing
of
the
regiment
about
him
and
he
conceived
of
a
thun
*punct* -
derous
*punct* ,
crushing
blow
that
would
prostrate
the
resistance
and
spread
consternation
and
amaze
*punct* -
ment
for
miles
*punct* .
*break*
the
flying
regiment
was
going
to
have
a
catapultian
effect
*punct* .
*break*
this
dream
made
him
run
faster
among
his
comrades
*punct* ,
who
were
giving
vent
to
hoarse
and
frantic
cheers
*punct* .
*break*
but
presently
he
could
see
that
many
of
the
men
in
gray
did
not
intend
to
abide
the
blow
*punct* .
*break*
the
smoke
*punct* ,
rolling
*punct* ,
disclosed
men
who
ran
*punct* ,
their
faces
still
turned
*punct* .
*break*
these
grew
to
a
crowd
*punct* ,
who
retired
stubbornly
*punct* .
*break*
individuals
wheeled
fre
*punct* -
quently
to
send
a
bullet
at
the
blue
wave
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
one
part
of
the
line
there
was
a
grim
and
obdurate
group
that
made
no
movement
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
settled
firmly
down
behind
posts
and
rails
*punct* .
*break*
a
flag
*punct* ,
ruffled
and
fierce
*punct* ,
waved
over
them
and
their
rifles
dinned
fiercely
*punct* .
*break*
the
blue
whirl
of
men
got
very
near
*punct* ,
until
it
seemed
that
in
truth
there
would
be
a
close
and
frightful
scuffle
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
an
expressed
disdain
in
the
opposition
of
the
little
group
*punct* ,
that
changed
the
meaning
of
the
cheers
of
the
men
in
blue
*punct* .
*break*
they
became
yells
of
wrath
*punct* ,
directed
*punct* ,
personal
*punct* .
*break*
the
cries
of
the
two
parties
were
now
in
sound
an
interchange
of
scathing
insults
*punct* .
*break*
they
in
blue
showed
their
teeth
*punct* ;
their
eyes
shone
all
white
*punct* .
*break*
they
launched
themselves
as
at
the
throats
of
those
who
stood
resisting
*punct* .
*break*
the
space
between
dwindled
to
an
insignificant
dis
*punct* -
tance
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
had
centered
the
gaze
of
his
soul
upon
that
other
flag
*punct* .
*break*
its
possession
would
be
high
pride
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
express
bloody
minglings
*punct* ,
near
blows
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
gigantic
hatred
for
those
who
made
great
difficulties
and
complications
*punct* .
*break*
they
caused
it
to
be
as
a
craved
treasure
of
my
*punct* -
thology
*punct* ,
hung
amid
tasks
and
contrivances
of
danger
*punct* .
*break*
he
plunged
like
a
mad
horse
at
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
resolved
it
should
not
escape
if
wild
blows
and
darings
of
blows
could
seize
it
*punct* .
*break*
his
own
em
*punct* -
blem
*punct* ,
quivering
and
aflare
*punct* ,
was
winging
toward
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
there
would
shortly
be
an
encounter
of
strange
beaks
and
claws
*punct* ,
as
of
eagles
*punct* .
*break*
the
swirling
body
of
blue
men
came
to
a
sudden
halt
at
close
and
disastrous
range
and
roared
a
swift
volley
*punct* .
*break*
the
group
in
gray
was
split
and
broken
by
this
fire
*punct* ,
but
its
riddled
body
still
fought
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
in
blue
yelled
again
and
rushed
in
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
*punct* ,
in
his
leapings
*punct* ,
saw
*punct* ,
as
through
a
mist
*punct* ,
a
picture
of
four
or
five
men
stretched
upon
the
ground
or
writhing
upon
their
knees
with
bowed
heads
as
if
they
had
been
stricken
by
bolts
from
the
sky
*punct* .
*break*
tottering
among
them
was
the
rival
color
bearer
*punct* ,
whom
the
youth
saw
had
been
bitten
vitally
by
the
bullets
of
the
last
formidable
volley
*punct* .
*break*
he
perceived
this
man
fighting
a
last
struggle
*punct* ,
the
struggle
of
one
whose
legs
are
grasped
by
demons
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
ghastly
battle
*punct* .
*break*
over
his
face
was
the
bleach
of
death
*punct* ,
but
set
upon
it
was
the
dark
and
hard
lines
of
desperate
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
with
this
terrible
grin
of
resolution
he
hugged
his
precious
flag
to
him
and
was
stum
*punct* -
bling
and
staggering
in
his
design
to
go
the
way
that
led
to
safety
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
wounds
always
made
it
seem
that
his
feet
were
retarded
*punct* ,
held
*punct* ,
and
he
fought
a
grim
fight
*punct* ,
as
with
invisible
ghouls
fastened
greedily
upon
his
limbs
*punct* .
*break*
those
in
advance
of
the
scam
*punct* -
pering
blue
men
*punct* ,
howling
cheers
*punct* ,
leaped
at
the
fence
*punct* .
*break*
the
despair
of
the
lost
was
in
his
eyes
as
he
glanced
back
at
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth's
friend
went
over
the
obstruction
in
a
tumbling
heap
and
sprang
at
the
flag
as
a
panther
at
prey
*punct* .
*break*
he
pulled
at
it
and
*punct* ,
wrench
*punct* -
ing
it
free
*punct* ,
swung
up
its
red
brilliancy
with
a
mad
cry
of
exultation
even
as
the
color
bearer
*punct* ,
gasping
*punct* ,
lurched
over
in
a
final
throe
and
*punct* ,
stiff
*punct* -
ening
convulsively
*punct* ,
turned
his
dead
face
to
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
much
blood
upon
the
grass
blades
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
place
of
success
there
began
more
wild
clamorings
of
cheers
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
gesticulated
and
bellowed
in
an
ecstasy
*punct* .
*break*
when
they
spoke
it
was
as
if
they
considered
their
listener
to
be
a
mile
away
*punct* .
*break*
what
hats
and
caps
were
left
to
them
they
often
slung
high
in
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
at
one
part
of
the
line
four
men
had
been
swooped
upon
*punct* ,
and
they
now
sat
as
prisoners
*punct* .
*break*
some
blue
men
were
about
them
in
an
eager
and
curious
circle
*punct* .
*break*
the
soldiers
had
trapped
strange
birds
*punct* ,
and
there
was
an
examination
*punct* .
*break*
a
flurry
of
fast
questions
was
in
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
the
prisoners
was
nursing
a
superficial
wound
in
the
foot
*punct* .
*break*
he
cuddled
it
*punct* ,
baby-wise
*punct* ,
but
he
looked
up
from
it
often
to
curse
with
an
astonishing
utter
abandon
straight
at
the
noses
of
his
captors
*punct* .
*break*
he
consigned
them
to
red
regions
*punct* ;
he
called
upon
the
pestilential
wrath
of
strange
gods
*punct* .
*break*
and
with
it
all
he
was
singularly
free
from
recognition
of
the
finer
points
of
the
con
*punct* -
duct
of
prisoners
of
war
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
as
if
a
clumsy
clod
had
trod
upon
his
toe
and
he
conceived
it
to
be
his
privilege
*punct* ,
his
duty
*punct* ,
to
use
deep
*punct* ,
resentful
oaths
*punct* .
*break*
another
*punct* ,
who
was
a
boy
in
years
*punct* ,
took
his
plight
with
great
calmness
and
apparent
good
nature
*punct* .
*break*
he
conversed
with
the
men
in
blue
*punct* ,
studying
their
faces
with
his
bright
and
keen
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
they
spoke
of
battles
and
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
an
acute
interest
in
all
their
faces
dur
*punct* -
ing
this
exchange
of
view
points
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
a
great
satisfaction
to
hear
voices
from
where
all
had
been
darkness
and
speculation
*punct* .
*break*
the
third
captive
sat
with
a
morose
counte
*punct* -
nance
*punct* .
*break*
he
preserved
a
stoical
and
cold
attitude
*punct* .
*break*
the
last
of
the
four
was
always
silent
and
*punct* ,
for
the
most
part
*punct* ,
kept
his
face
turned
in
un
*punct* -
molested
directions
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
views
the
youth
received
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
state
of
absolute
dejection
*punct* .
*break*
shame
was
upon
him
*punct* ,
and
with
it
profound
regret
that
he
was
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
no
more
to
be
counted
in
the
ranks
of
his
fellows
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
could
detect
no
expression
that
would
allow
him
to
believe
that
the
other
was
giving
a
thought
to
his
narrowed
future
*punct* ,
the
pictured
dungeons
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
and
starvations
and
brutali
*punct* -
ties
*punct* ,
liable
to
the
imagination
*punct* .
*break*
all
to
be
seen
was
shame
for
captivity
and
regret
for
the
right
to
antagonize
*punct* .
*break*
after
the
men
had
celebrated
sufficiently
they
settled
down
behind
the
old
rail
fence
*punct* ,
on
the
opposite
side
to
the
one
from
which
their
foes
had
been
driven
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
shot
perfunctorily
at
distant
marks
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
some
long
grass
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
nestled
in
it
and
rested
*punct* ,
making
a
convenient
rail
support
the
flag
*punct* .
*break*
his
friend
*punct* ,
jubilant
and
glori
*punct* -
fied
*punct* ,
holding
his
treasure
with
vanity
*punct* ,
came
to
him
there
*punct* .
*break*
they
sat
side
by
side
and
congratu
*punct* -
lated
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
the
roarings
that
had
stretched
in
a
long
line
of
sound
across
the
face
of
the
forest
began
to
grow
intermittent
and
weaker
*punct* .
*break*
the
stentorian
speeches
of
the
artillery
continued
in
some
dis
*punct* -
tant
encounter
*punct* ,
but
the
crashes
of
the
musketry
had
almost
ceased
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
and
his
friend
of
a
sudden
looked
up
*punct* ,
feeling
a
deadened
form
of
distress
at
the
waning
of
these
noises
*punct* ,
which
had
become
a
part
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
they
could
see
changes
going
on
among
the
troops
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
march
*punct* -
ings
this
way
and
that
way
*punct* .
*break*
a
battery
wheeled
leisurely
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
crest
of
a
small
hill
was
the
thick
gleam
of
many
departing
muskets
*punct* .
*break*
the
youth
arose
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
what
now
*punct* ,
i
won
*punct* -
der
*punct* ?
*break*
by
his
tone
he
seemed
to
be
preparing
to
resent
some
new
monstrosity
in
the
way
of
dins
and
smashes
*punct* .
*break*
he
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
grimy
hand
and
gazed
over
the
field
*punct* .
*break*
his
friend
also
arose
and
stared
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
i
swan
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
youth
*punct* .
*break*
they
waited
*punct* ,
watching
*punct* .
*break*
within
a
little
while
the
regiment
received
orders
to
retrace
its
way
*punct* .
*break*
the
men
got
up
grunting
from
the
grass
*punct* ,
regret
*punct* -
ting
the
soft
repose
*punct* .
*break*
they
jerked
their
stiffened
legs
*punct* ,
and
stretched
their
arms
over
their
heads
*punct* .
*break*
one
man
swore
as
he
rubbed
his
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
they
all
groaned
o
lord
*punct* !
*break*
they
had
as
many
objec
*punct* -
tions
to
this
change
as
they
would
have
had
to
a
proposal
for
a
new
battle
*punct* .
*break*
they
trampled
slowly
back
over
the
field
across
which
they
had
run
in
a
mad
scamper
*punct* .
*break*
the
regiment
marched
until
it
had
joined
its
fellows
*punct* .
*break*
the
reformed
brigade
*punct* ,
in
column
*punct* ,
aimed
through
a
wood
at
the
road
*punct* .
*break*
directly
they
were
in
a
mass
of
dust-covered
troops
*punct* ,
and
were
trudging
along
in
a
way
parallel
to
the
enemy's
lines
as
these
had
been
defined
by
the
previous
turmoil
*punct* .
*break*
they
passed
within
view
of
a
stolid
white
house
*punct* ,
and
saw
in
front
of
it
groups
of
their
com
*punct* -
rades
lying
in
wait
behind
a
neat
breastwork
*punct* .
*break*
a
row
of
guns
were
booming
at
a
distant
enemy
*punct* .
*break*
shells
thrown
in
reply
were
raising
clouds
of
dust
and
splinters
*punct* .
*break*
horsemen
dashed
along
the
line
of
intrenchments
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
point
of
its
march
the
division
curved
away
from
the
field
and
went
winding
off
in
the
direction
of
the
river
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
significance
of
this
movement
had
impressed
itself
upon
the
youth
he
turned
his
head
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
toward
the
trampled
and
debris-strewed
ground
*punct* .
*break*
he
breathed
a
breath
of
new
satisfac
*punct* -
tion
*punct* .
*break*
he
finally
nudged
his
friend
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
it's
all
over
*punct* ,
he
said
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
his
friend
gazed
backward
*punct* .
*break*
b'gawd
*punct* ,
it
is
*punct* ,
he
assented
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
time
the
youth
was
obliged
to
reflect
in
a
puzzled
and
uncertain
way
*punct* .
*break*
his
mind
was
undergoing
a
subtle
change
*punct* .
*break*
it
took
moments
for
it
to
cast
off
its
battleful
ways
and
resume
its
accustomed
course
of
thought
*punct* .
*break*
gradually
his
brain
emerged
from
the
clogged
clouds
*punct* ,
and
at
last
he
was
enabled
to
more
closely
compre
*punct* -
hend
himself
and
circumstance
*punct* .
*break*
he
understood
then
that
the
existence
of
shot
and
counter-shot
was
in
the
past
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
dwelt
in
a
land
of
strange
*punct* ,
squalling
upheavals
and
had
come
forth
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
where
there
was
red
of
blood
and
black
of
passion
*punct* ,
and
he
was
es
*punct* -
caped
*punct* .
*break*
his
first
thoughts
were
given
to
rejoic
*punct* -
ings
at
this
fact
*punct* .
*break*
later
he
began
to
study
his
deeds
*punct* ,
his
fail
*punct* -
ures
*punct* ,
and
his
achievements
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
fresh
from
scenes
where
many
of
his
usual
machines
of
re
*punct* -
flection
had
been
idle
*punct* ,
from
where
he
had
pro
*punct* -
ceeded
sheeplike
*punct* ,
he
struggled
to
marshal
all
his
acts
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
they
marched
before
him
clearly
*punct* .
*break*
from
this
present
view
point
he
was
enabled
to
look
upon
them
in
spectator
fashion
and
to
criticise
them
with
some
correctness
*punct* ,
for
his
new
condition
had
already
defeated
certain
sym
*punct* -
pathies
*punct* .
*break*
regarding
his
procession
of
memory
he
felt
gleeful
and
unregretting
*punct* ,
for
in
it
his
public
deeds
were
paraded
in
great
and
shining
prominence
*punct* .
*break*
those
performances
which
had
been
witnessed
by
his
fellows
marched
now
in
wide
purple
and
gold
*punct* ,
having
various
deflections
*punct* .
*break*
they
went
gayly
with
music
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
pleasure
to
watch
these
things
*punct* .
*break*
he
spent
delightful
minutes
viewing
the
gilded
images
of
memory
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
that
he
was
good
*punct* .
*break*
he
recalled
with
a
thrill
of
joy
the
respectful
comments
of
his
fel
*punct* -
lows
upon
his
conduct
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
the
ghost
of
his
flight
from
the
first
engagement
appeared
to
him
and
danced
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
small
shoutings
in
his
brain
about
these
matters
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
he
blushed
*punct* ,
and
the
light
of
his
soul
flickered
with
shame
*punct* .
*break*
a
specter
of
reproach
came
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
loomed
the
dogging
memory
of
the
tattered
soldier
*punct* ,
he
who
*punct* ,
gored
by
bullets
and
faint
for
blood
*punct* ,
had
fretted
concerning
an
imagined
wound
in
another
*punct* ;
he
who
had
loaned
his
last
of
strength
and
intellect
for
the
tall
soldier
*punct* ;
he
who
*punct* ,
blind
with
weariness
and
pain
*punct* ,
had
been
deserted
in
the
field
*punct* .
*break*
for
an
instant
a
wretched
chill
of
sweat
was
upon
him
at
the
thought
that
he
might
be
detected
in
the
thing
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
stood
persistently
before
his
vision
*punct* ,
he
gave
vent
to
a
cry
of
sharp
irritation
and
agony
*punct* .
*break*
his
friend
turned
*punct* .
*break*
what's
the
matter
*punct* ,
henry
*punct* ?
*break*
the
youth's
reply
was
an
outburst
of
crimson
oaths
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
marched
along
the
little
branch-hung
roadway
among
his
prattling
companions
this
vision
of
cruelty
brooded
over
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
clung
near
him
always
and
darkened
his
view
of
these
deeds
in
purple
and
gold
*punct* .
*break*
whichever
way
his
thoughts
turned
they
were
followed
by
the
somber
phantom
of
the
desertion
in
the
fields
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
stealthily
at
his
companions
*punct* ,
feeling
sure
that
they
must
discern
in
his
face
evidences
of
this
pursuit
*punct* .
*break*
but
they
were
plodding
in
ragged
array
*punct* ,
discussing
with
quick
tongues
the
accomplishments
of
the
late
battle
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
if
a
man
should
come
up
an
ask

*punct* ,
i'd
say

*break*
for
a
time
this
pursuing
recollection
of
the
tattered
man
took
all
elation
from
the
youth's
veins
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
his
vivid
error
*punct* ,
and
he
was
afraid
that
it
would
stand
before
him
all
his
life
*punct* .
*break*
he
took
no
share
in
the
chatter
of
his
comrades
*punct* ,
nor
did
he
look
at
them
or
know
them
*punct* ,
save
when
he
felt
sudden
suspicion
that
they
were
seeing
his
thoughts
and
scrutinizing
each
detail
of
the
scene
with
the
tattered
soldier
*punct* .
*break*
yet
gradually
he
mustered
force
to
put
the
sin
at
a
distance
*punct* .
*break*
and
at
last
his
eyes
seemed
to
open
to
some
new
ways
*punct* .
*break*
he
found
that
he
could
look
back
upon
the
brass
and
bombast
of
his
earlier
gospels
and
see
them
truly
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
gleeful
when
he
discovered
that
he
now
despised
them
*punct* .
*break*
with
this
conviction
came
a
store
of
assur
*punct* -
ance
*punct* .
*break*
he
felt
a
quiet
manhood
*punct* ,
nonassertive
but
of
sturdy
and
strong
blood
*punct* .
*break*
he
knew
that
he
would
no
more
quail
before
his
guides
wher
*punct* -
ever
they
should
point
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
to
touch
the
great
death
*punct* ,
and
found
that
*punct* ,
after
all
*punct* ,
it
was
but
the
great
death
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
man
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
came
to
pass
that
as
he
trudged
from
the
place
of
blood
and
wrath
his
soul
changed
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
from
hot
plowshares
to
prospects
of
clover
tranquilly
*punct* ,
and
it
was
as
if
hot
plowshares
were
not
*punct* .
*break*
scars
faded
as
flowers
*punct* .
*break*
the
procession
of
weary
soldiers
became
a
bedraggled
train
*punct* ,
despondent
and
muttering
*punct* ,
marching
with
churning
effort
in
a
trough
of
liquid
brown
mud
under
a
low
*punct* ,
wretched
sky
*punct* .
*break*
yet
the
youth
smiled
*punct* ,
for
he
saw
that
the
world
was
a
world
for
him
*punct* ,
though
many
discovered
it
to
be
made
of
oaths
and
walking
sticks
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
rid
himself
of
the
red
sickness
of
battle
*punct* .
*break*
the
sultry
nightmare
was
in
the
past
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
an
animal
blistered
and
sweating
in
the
heat
and
pain
of
war
*punct* .
*break*
he
turned
now
with
a
lover's
thirst
to
images
of
tranquil
skies
*punct* ,
fresh
meadows
*punct* ,
cool
brooks
*punct* ,
an
existence
of
soft
and
eternal
peace
*punct* .
*break*
over
the
river
a
golden
ray
of
sun
came
through
the
hosts
of
leaden
rain
clouds
*punct* .
*break*
