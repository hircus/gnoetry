Title: Moby Dick
Author: Herman Melville
call
me
ishmael
*punct* .
*break*
some
years
ago
*punct* ,
never
mind
how
long
precisely
*punct* ,
having
little
or
no
money
in
my
purse
*punct* ,
and
nothing
particular
to
interest
me
on
shore
*punct* ,
i
thought
i
would
sail
about
a
little
and
see
the
watery
part
of
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
way
i
have
of
driving
off
the
spleen
*punct* ,
and
regulating
the
circulation
*punct* .
*break*
whenever
i
find
myself
growing
grim
about
the
mouth
*punct* ;
whenever
it
is
a
damp
*punct* ,
drizzly
november
in
my
soul
*punct* ;
whenever
i
find
myself
involuntarily
pausing
before
coffin
warehouses
*punct* ,
and
bringing
up
the
rear
of
every
funeral
i
meet
*punct* ;
and
especially
whenever
my
hypos
get
such
an
upper
hand
of
me
*punct* ,
that
it
requires
a
strong
moral
principle
to
prevent
me
from
deliberately
stepping
into
the
street
*punct* ,
and
methodically
knocking
people's
hats
off
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
i
account
it
high
time
to
get
to
sea
as
soon
as
i
can
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
my
substitute
for
pistol
and
ball
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
philosophical
flourish
cato
throws
himself
upon
his
sword
*punct* ;
i
quietly
take
to
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
nothing
surprising
in
this
*punct* .
*break*
if
they
but
knew
it
*punct* ,
almost
all
men
in
their
degree
*punct* ,
some
time
or
other
*punct* ,
cherish
very
nearly
the
same
feelings
towards
the
ocean
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
there
now
is
your
insular
city
of
the
manhattoes
*punct* ,
belted
round
by
wharves
as
indian
isles
by
coral
reefs
*punct* ,
commerce
surrounds
it
with
her
surf
*punct* .
*break*
right
and
left
*punct* ,
the
streets
take
you
waterward
*punct* .
*break*
its
extreme
down-town
is
the
battery
*punct* ,
where
that
noble
mole
is
washed
by
waves
*punct* ,
and
cooled
by
breezes
*punct* ,
which
a
few
hours
previous
were
out
of
sight
of
land
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
the
crowds
of
water-gazers
there
*punct* .
*break*
circumambulate
the
city
of
a
dreamy
sabbath
afternoon
*punct* .
*break*
go
from
corlears
hook
to
coenties
slip
*punct* ,
and
from
thence
*punct* ,
by
whitehall
northward
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
see?
*punct* ,
posted
like
silent
sentinels
all
around
the
town
*punct* ,
stand
thousands
upon
thousands
of
mortal
men
fixed
in
ocean
reveries
*punct* .
*break*
some
leaning
against
the
spiles
*punct* ;
some
seated
upon
the
pier-heads
*punct* ;
some
looking
over
the
bulwarks
glasses
*punct* !
*break*
but
these
are
all
landsmen
*punct* ;
of
week
days
pent
up
in
lath
and
plaster
*punct* ,
tied
to
counters
*punct* ,
nailed
to
benches
*punct* ,
clinched
to
desks
*punct* .
*break*
how
then
is
this
*punct* ?
*break*
are
the
green
fields
gone
*punct* ?
*break*
what
do
they
here
*punct* ?
*break*
here
come
more
crowds
*punct* ,
pacing
straight
for
the
water
*punct* ,
and
seemingly
bound
for
a
dive
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
will
content
them
but
the
extremest
limit
of
the
land
*punct* ;
loitering
under
the
shady
lee
of
yonder
warehouses
will
not
suffice
*punct* .
*break*
they
must
get
just
as
nigh
the
water
as
they
possibly
can
without
falling
in
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
they
stand
*punct* ,
miles
of
them
*punct* ,
leagues
*punct* .
*break*
inlanders
all
*punct* ,
they
come
from
lanes
and
alleys
*punct* ,
streets
and
avenues,
*punct* ,
north
*punct* ,
east
*punct* ,
south
*punct* ,
and
west
*punct* .
*break*
yet
here
they
all
unite
*punct* .
*break*
tell
me
*punct* ,
does
the
magnetic
virtue
of
the
needles
of
the
compasses
of
all
those
ships
attract
them
thither
*punct* ?
*break*
say
*punct* ,
you
are
in
the
country
*punct* ;
in
some
high
land
of
lakes
*punct* .
*break*
take
almost
any
path
you
please
*punct* ,
and
ten
to
one
it
carries
you
down
in
a
dale
*punct* ,
and
leaves
you
there
by
a
pool
in
the
stream
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
magic
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
let
the
most
absent-minded
of
men
be
plunged
in
his
deepest
reveries
*punct* ,
stand
that
man
on
his
legs
*punct* ,
set
his
feet
a-going
*punct* ,
and
he
will
infallibly
lead
you
to
water
*punct* ,
if
water
there
be
in
all
that
region
*punct* .
*break*
should
you
ever
be
athirst
in
the
great
american
desert
*punct* ,
try
this
experiment
*punct* ,
if
your
caravan
happen
to
be
supplied
with
a
metaphysical
professor
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
as
every
one
knows
*punct* ,
meditation
and
water
are
wedded
for
ever
*punct* .
*break*
but
here
is
an
artist
*punct* .
*break*
he
desires
to
paint
you
the
dreamiest
*punct* ,
shadiest
*punct* ,
quietest
*punct* ,
most
enchanting
bit
of
romantic
landscape
in
all
the
valley
of
the
saco
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
the
chief
element
he
employs
*punct* ?
*break*
there
stand
his
trees
*punct* ,
each
with
a
hollow
trunk
*punct* ,
as
if
a
hermit
and
a
crucifix
were
within
*punct* ;
and
here
sleeps
his
meadow
*punct* ,
and
there
sleep
his
cattle
*punct* ;
and
up
from
yonder
cottage
goes
a
sleepy
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
deep
into
distant
woodlands
winds
a
mazy
way
*punct* ,
reaching
to
overlapping
spurs
of
mountains
bathed
in
their
hill-side
blue
*punct* .
*break*
but
though
the
picture
lies
thus
tranced
*punct* ,
and
though
this
pine-tree
shakes
down
its
sighs
like
leaves
upon
this
shepherd's
head
*punct* ,
yet
all
were
vain
*punct* ,
unless
the
shepherd's
eye
were
fixed
upon
the
magic
stream
before
him
*punct* .
*break*
were
niagara
but
a
cataract
of
sand
*punct* ,
would
you
travel
your
thousand
miles
to
see
it
*punct* ?
*break*
why
did
the
poor
poet
of
tennessee
*punct* ,
upon
suddenly
receiving
two
handfuls
of
silver
*punct* ,
deliberate
whether
to
buy
him
a
coat
*punct* ,
which
he
sadly
needed
*punct* ,
or
invest
his
money
in
a
pedestrian
trip
to
rockaway
beach
*punct* ?
*break*
why
is
almost
every
robust
healthy
boy
with
a
robust
healthy
soul
in
him
*punct* ,
at
some
time
or
other
crazy
to
go
to
sea
*punct* ?
*break*
why
upon
your
first
voyage
as
a
passenger
*punct* ,
did
you
yourself
feel
such
a
mystical
vibration
*punct* ,
when
first
told
that
you
and
your
ship
were
now
out
of
sight
of
land
*punct* ?
*break*
why
did
the
old
persians
hold
the
sea
holy
*punct* ?
*break*
why
did
the
greeks
give
it
a
separate
deity
*punct* ,
and
own
brother
of
jove
*punct* ?
*break*
surely
all
this
is
not
without
meaning
*punct* .
*break*
and
still
deeper
the
meaning
of
that
story
of
narcissus
*punct* ,
who
because
he
could
not
grasp
the
tormenting
*punct* ,
mild
image
he
saw
in
the
fountain
*punct* ,
plunged
into
it
and
was
drowned
*punct* .
*break*
but
that
same
image
*punct* ,
we
ourselves
see
in
all
rivers
and
oceans
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
the
image
of
the
ungraspable
phantom
of
life
*punct* ;
and
this
is
the
key
to
it
all
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
when
i
say
that
i
am
in
the
habit
of
going
to
sea
whenever
i
begin
to
grow
hazy
about
the
eyes
*punct* ,
and
begin
to
be
over
conscious
of
my
lungs
*punct* ,
i
do
not
mean
to
have
it
inferred
that
i
ever
go
to
sea
as
a
passenger
*punct* .
*break*
for
to
go
as
a
passenger
you
must
needs
have
a
purse
*punct* ,
and
a
purse
is
but
a
rag
unless
you
have
something
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
passengers
get
sea-sick
*punct* ,
grow
quarrelsome
*punct* ,
don't
sleep
of
nights
*punct* ,
do
not
enjoy
themselves
much
*punct* ,
as
a
general
thing;
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
i
never
go
as
a
passenger
*punct* ;
nor
*punct* ,
though
i
am
something
of
a
salt
*punct* ,
do
i
ever
go
to
sea
as
a
commodore
*punct* ,
or
a
captain
*punct* ,
or
a
cook
*punct* .
*break*
i
abandon
the
glory
and
distinction
of
such
offices
to
those
who
like
them
*punct* .
*break*
for
my
part
*punct* ,
i
abominate
all
honorable
respectable
toils
*punct* ,
trials
*punct* ,
and
tribulations
of
every
kind
whatsoever
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
quite
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
take
care
of
myself
*punct* ,
without
taking
care
of
ships
*punct* ,
barques
*punct* ,
brigs
*punct* ,
schooners
*punct* ,
and
what
not
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
out
of
the
idolatrous
dotings
of
the
old
egyptians
upon
broiled
ibis
and
roasted
river
horse
*punct* ,
that
you
see
the
mummies
of
those
creatures
in
their
huge
bake-houses
the
pyramids
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
when
i
go
to
sea
*punct* ,
i
go
as
a
simple
sailor
*punct* ,
right
before
the
mast
*punct* ,
plumb
down
into
the
forecastle
*punct* ,
aloft
there
to
the
royal
mast-head
*punct* .
*break*
true
*punct* ,
they
rather
order
me
about
some
*punct* ,
and
make
me
jump
from
spar
to
spar
*punct* ,
like
a
grasshopper
in
a
may
meadow
*punct* .
*break*
and
at
first
*punct* ,
this
sort
of
thing
is
unpleasant
enough
*punct* .
*break*
it
touches
one's
sense
of
honor
*punct* ,
particularly
if
you
come
of
an
old
established
family
in
the
land
*punct* ,
the
van
rensselaers
*punct* ,
or
randolphs
*punct* ,
or
hardicanutes
*punct* .
*break*
and
more
than
all
*punct* ,
if
just
previous
to
putting
your
hand
into
the
tar-pot
*punct* ,
you
have
been
lording
it
as
a
country
schoolmaster
*punct* ,
making
the
tallest
boys
stand
in
awe
of
you
*punct* .
*break*
the
transition
is
a
keen
one
*punct* ,
i
assure
you
*punct* ,
from
the
schoolmaster
to
a
sailor
*punct* ,
and
requires
a
strong
decoction
of
seneca
and
the
stoics
to
enable
you
to
grin
and
bear
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
even
this
wears
off
in
time
*punct* .
*break*
what
of
it
*punct* ,
if
some
old
hunks
of
a
sea-captain
orders
me
to
get
a
broom
and
sweep
down
the
decks
*punct* ?
*break*
what
does
that
indignity
amount
to
*punct* ,
weighed
*punct* ,
i
mean
*punct* ,
in
the
scales
of
the
new
testament
*punct* ?
*break*
do
you
think
the
archangel
gabriel
thinks
anything
the
less
of
me
*punct* ,
because
i
promptly
and
respectfully
obey
that
old
hunks
in
that
particular
instance
*punct* ?
*break*
who
aint
a
slave
*punct* ?
*break*
tell
me
that
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
however
the
old
sea-captains
may
order
me
about
*punct* ,
however
they
may
thump
and
punch
me
about
*punct* ,
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
it
is
all
right
*punct* ;
that
everybody
else
is
one
way
or
other
served
in
much
the
same
way
*punct* ,
either
in
a
physical
or
metaphysical
point
of
view
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ;
and
so
the
universal
thump
is
passed
round
*punct* ,
and
all
hands
should
rub
each
other's
shoulder-blades
*punct* ,
and
be
content
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
i
always
go
to
sea
as
a
sailor
*punct* ,
because
they
make
a
point
of
paying
me
for
my
trouble
*punct* ,
whereas
they
never
pay
passengers
a
single
penny
that
i
ever
heard
of
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
contrary
*punct* ,
passengers
themselves
must
pay
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
paying
and
being
paid
*punct* .
*break*
but
being
paid,
*punct* ,
what
will
compare
with
it
*punct* ?
*break*
the
urbane
activity
with
which
a
man
receives
money
is
really
marvellous
*punct* ,
considering
that
we
so
earnestly
believe
money
to
be
the
root
of
all
earthly
ills
*punct* ,
and
that
on
no
account
can
a
monied
man
enter
heaven
*punct* .
*break*
how
cheerfully
we
consign
ourselves
to
perdition
*punct* !
*break*
finally
*punct* ,
i
always
go
to
sea
as
a
sailor
*punct* ,
because
of
the
wholesome
exercise
and
pure
air
of
the
forecastle
deck
*punct* .
*break*
for
as
in
this
world
*punct* ,
head
winds
are
far
more
prevalent
than
winds
from
astern
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
if
you
never
violate
the
pythagorean
maxim
*punct* ,
so
for
the
most
part
the
commodore
on
the
quarter-deck
gets
his
atmosphere
at
second
hand
from
the
sailors
on
the
forecastle
*punct* .
*break*
he
thinks
he
breathes
it
first
*punct* ;
but
not
so
*punct* .
*break*
in
much
the
same
way
do
the
commonalty
lead
their
leaders
in
many
other
things
*punct* ,
at
the
same
time
that
the
leaders
little
suspect
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
wherefore
it
was
that
after
having
repeatedly
smelt
the
sea
as
a
merchant
sailor
*punct* ,
i
should
now
take
it
into
my
head
to
go
on
a
whaling
voyage
*punct* ;
this
the
invisible
police
officer
of
the
fates
*punct* ,
who
has
the
constant
surveillance
of
me
*punct* ,
and
secretly
dogs
me
*punct* ,
and
influences
me
in
some
unaccountable
way
*punct* ,
he
can
better
answer
than
any
one
else
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
doubtless
*punct* ,
my
going
on
this
whaling
voyage
*punct* ,
formed
part
of
the
grand
programme
of
providence
that
was
drawn
up
a
long
time
ago
*punct* .
*break*
it
came
in
as
a
sort
of
brief
interlude
and
solo
between
more
extensive
performances
*punct* .
*break*
i
take
it
that
this
part
of
the
bill
must
have
run
something
like
this
*punct* :
grand
contested
election
for
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
*punct* .
*break*
whaling
voyage
by
one
ishmael
*punct* .
*break*
bloody
battle
in
affghanistan
*punct* .
*break*
chief
among
these
motives
was
the
overwhelming
idea
of
the
great
whale
himself
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
portentous
and
mysterious
monster
roused
all
my
curiosity
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
wild
and
distant
seas
where
he
rolled
his
island
bulk
*punct* ;
the
undeliverable
*punct* ,
nameless
perils
of
the
whale
*punct* ;
these
*punct* ,
with
all
the
attending
marvels
of
a
thousand
patagonian
sights
and
sounds
*punct* ,
helped
to
sway
me
to
my
wish
*punct* .
*break*
with
other
men
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
such
things
would
not
have
been
inducements
*punct* ;
but
as
for
me
*punct* ,
i
am
tormented
with
an
everlasting
itch
for
things
remote
*punct* .
*break*
i
love
to
sail
forbidden
seas
*punct* ,
and
land
on
barbarous
coasts
*punct* .
*break*
not
ignoring
what
is
good
*punct* ,
i
am
quick
to
perceive
a
horror
*punct* ,
and
could
still
be
social
with
it
*punct* ,
would
they
let
me
*punct* ,
since
it
is
but
well
to
be
on
friendly
terms
with
all
the
inmates
of
the
place
one
lodges
in
*punct* .
*break*
quitting
the
good
city
of
old
manhatto
*punct* ,
i
duly
arrived
in
new
bedford
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
on
a
saturday
night
in
december
*punct* .
*break*
much
was
i
disappointed
upon
learning
that
the
little
packet
for
nantucket
had
already
sailed
*punct* ,
and
that
no
way
of
reaching
that
place
would
offer
*punct* ,
till
the
following
monday
*punct* .
*break*
for
my
mind
was
made
up
to
sail
in
no
other
than
a
nantucket
craft
*punct* ,
because
there
was
a
fine
*punct* ,
boisterous
something
about
everything
connected
with
that
famous
old
island
*punct* ,
which
amazingly
pleased
me
*punct* .
*break*
besides
though
new
bedford
has
of
late
been
gradually
monopolizing
the
business
of
whaling
*punct* ,
and
though
in
this
matter
poor
old
nantucket
is
now
much
behind
her
*punct* ,
yet
nantucket
was
her
great
original
*punct* ,
the
tyre
of
this
carthage;
*punct* ,
the
place
where
the
first
dead
american
whale
was
stranded
*punct* .
*break*
where
else
but
from
nantucket
did
those
aboriginal
whalemen
*punct* ,
the
red-men
*punct* ,
first
sally
out
in
canoes
to
give
chase
to
the
leviathan
*punct* ?
*break*
and
where
but
from
nantucket
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
did
that
first
adventurous
little
sloop
put
forth
*punct* ,
partly
laden
with
imported
cobble-stones
*punct* ,
so
goes
the
story
*punct* ,
to
throw
at
the
whales
*punct* ,
in
order
to
discover
when
they
were
nigh
enough
to
risk
a
harpoon
from
the
bowsprit
*punct* ?
*break*
now
having
a
night
*punct* ,
a
day
*punct* ,
and
still
another
night
following
before
me
in
new
bedford
*punct* ,
ere
i
could
embark
for
my
destined
port
*punct* ,
it
became
a
matter
of
concernment
where
i
was
to
eat
and
sleep
meanwhile
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
very
dubious-looking
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
a
very
dark
and
dismal
night
*punct* ,
bitingly
cold
and
cheerless
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
no
one
in
the
place
*punct* .
*break*
with
anxious
grapnels
i
had
sounded
my
pocket
*punct* ,
and
only
brought
up
a
few
pieces
of
silver,
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ,
wherever
you
go
*punct* ,
ishmael
*punct* ,
said
i
to
myself
*punct* ,
as
i
stood
in
the
middle
of
a
dreary
street
shouldering
my
bag
*punct* ,
and
comparing
the
gloom
towards
the
north
with
the
darkness
towards
the
south
*punct* ,
wherever
in
your
wisdom
you
may
conclude
to
lodge
for
the
night
*punct* ,
my
dear
ishmael
*punct* ,
be
sure
to
inquire
the
price
*punct* ,
and
don't
be
too
particular
*punct* .
*break*
with
halting
steps
i
paced
the
streets
*punct* ,
and
passed
the
sign
of
the
crossed
harpoons
*punct* ,
but
it
looked
too
expensive
and
jolly
there
*punct* .
*break*
too
expensive
and
jolly
*punct* ,
again
thought
i
*punct* ,
pausing
one
moment
to
watch
the
broad
glare
in
the
street
*punct* ,
and
hear
the
sounds
of
the
tinkling
glasses
within
*punct* .
*break*
but
go
on
*punct* ,
ishmael
*punct* ,
said
i
at
last
*punct* ;
don't
you
hear
*punct* ?
*break*
get
away
from
before
the
door
*punct* ;
your
patched
boots
are
stopping
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
so
on
i
went
*punct* .
*break*
i
now
by
instinct
followed
the
streets
that
took
me
waterward
*punct* ,
for
there
*punct* ,
doubtless
*punct* ,
were
the
cheapest
*punct* ,
if
not
the
cheeriest
inns
*punct* .
*break*
such
dreary
streets
*punct* !
*break*
blocks
of
blackness
*punct* ,
not
houses
*punct* ,
on
either
hand
*punct* ,
and
here
and
there
a
candle
*punct* ,
like
a
candle
moving
about
in
a
tomb
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
hour
of
the
night
*punct* ,
of
the
last
day
of
the
week
*punct* ,
that
quarter
of
the
town
proved
all
but
deserted
*punct* .
*break*
but
presently
i
came
to
a
smoky
light
proceeding
from
a
low
*punct* ,
wide
building
*punct* ,
the
door
of
which
stood
invitingly
open
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
a
careless
look
*punct* ,
as
if
it
were
meant
for
the
uses
of
the
public
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
entering
*punct* ,
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
stumble
over
an
ash-box
in
the
porch
*punct* .
*break*
thought
i
*punct* ,
ha
*punct* ,
as
the
flying
particles
almost
choked
me
*punct* ,
are
these
ashes
from
that
destroyed
city
*punct* ,
gomorrah
*punct* ?
*break*
but
the
crossed
harpoons
*punct* ,
and
the
sword-fish?
*punct* ,
this
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
must
needs
be
the
sign
of
the
trap
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
i
picked
myself
up
and
hearing
a
loud
voice
within
*punct* ,
pushed
on
and
opened
a
second
*punct* ,
interior
door
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
the
great
black
parliament
sitting
in
tophet
*punct* .
*break*
a
hundred
black
faces
turned
round
in
their
rows
to
peer
*punct* ;
and
beyond
*punct* ,
a
black
angel
of
doom
was
beating
a
book
in
a
pulpit
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
negro
church
*punct* ;
and
the
preacher's
text
was
about
the
blackness
of
darkness
*punct* ,
and
the
weeping
and
wailing
and
teeth-gnashing
there
*punct* .
*break*
ha
*punct* ,
ishmael
*punct* ,
muttered
i
*punct* ,
backing
out
*punct* ,
wretched
entertainment
at
the
sign
of
the
trap
*punct* !
*break*
moving
on
*punct* ,
i
at
last
came
to
a
dim
sort
of
light
not
far
from
the
docks
*punct* ,
and
heard
a
forlorn
creaking
in
the
air
*punct* ;
and
looking
up
*punct* ,
saw
a
swinging
sign
over
the
door
with
a
white
painting
upon
it
*punct* ,
faintly
representing
a
tall
straight
jet
of
misty
spray
*punct* ,
and
these
words
underneath
*punct* ,
the
spouter-inn:
*punct* ,
peter
coffin
*punct* .
*break*
coffin?
*punct* ,
spouter?
*punct* ,
rather
ominous
in
that
particular
connexion
*punct* ,
thought
i
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
a
common
name
in
nantucket
*punct* ,
they
say
*punct* ,
and
i
suppose
this
peter
here
is
an
emigrant
from
there
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
queer
sort
of
place
*punct* ,
a
gable-ended
old
house
*punct* ,
one
side
palsied
as
it
were
*punct* ,
and
leaning
over
sadly
*punct* .
*break*
it
stood
on
a
sharp
bleak
corner
*punct* ,
where
that
tempestuous
wind
euroclydon
kept
up
a
worse
howling
than
ever
it
did
about
poor
paul's
tossed
craft
*punct* .
*break*
euroclydon
*punct* ,
nevertheless
*punct* ,
is
a
mighty
pleasant
zephyr
to
any
one
in-doors
*punct* ,
with
his
feet
on
the
hob
quietly
toasting
for
bed
*punct* .
*break*
in
judging
of
that
tempestuous
wind
called
euroclydon
*punct* ,
says
an
old
writer
*punct* ,
of
whose
works
i
possess
the
only
copy
extant
*punct* ,
it
maketh
a
marvellous
difference
*punct* ,
whether
thou
lookest
out
at
it
from
a
glass
window
where
the
frost
is
all
on
the
outside
*punct* ,
or
whether
thou
observest
it
from
that
sashless
window
*punct* ,
where
the
frost
is
on
both
sides
*punct* ,
and
of
which
the
wight
death
is
the
only
glazier
*punct* .
*break*
true
enough
*punct* ,
thought
i
*punct* ,
as
this
passage
occurred
to
my
mind
*punct* ,
old
black-letter
*punct* ,
thou
reasonest
well
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
these
eyes
are
windows
*punct* ,
and
this
body
of
mine
is
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
pity
they
didn't
stop
up
the
chinks
and
the
crannies
though
*punct* ,
and
thrust
in
a
little
lint
here
and
there
*punct* .
*break*
but
it's
too
late
to
make
any
improvements
now
*punct* .
*break*
the
universe
is
finished
*punct* ;
the
copestone
is
on
*punct* ,
and
the
chips
were
carted
off
a
million
years
ago
*punct* .
*break*
poor
lazarus
there
*punct* ,
chattering
his
teeth
against
the
curbstone
for
his
pillow
*punct* ,
and
shaking
off
his
tatters
with
his
shiverings
*punct* ,
he
might
plug
up
both
ears
with
rags
*punct* ,
and
put
a
corn-cob
into
his
mouth
*punct* ,
and
yet
that
would
not
keep
out
the
tempestuous
euroclydon
*punct* .
*break*
says
old
dives
*punct* ,
in
his
red
silken
wrapper
*punct* ,
he
had
a
redder
one
afterwards
*punct* ,
pooh
*punct* ,
pooh
*punct* !
*break*
what
a
fine
frosty
night
*punct* ;
how
orion
glitters
*punct* ;
what
northern
lights
*punct* !
*break*
let
them
talk
of
their
oriental
summer
climes
of
everlasting
conservatories
*punct* ;
give
me
the
privilege
of
making
my
own
summer
with
my
own
coals
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
thinks
lazarus
*punct* ?
*break*
can
he
warm
his
blue
hands
by
holding
them
up
to
the
grand
northern
lights
*punct* ?
*break*
would
not
lazarus
rather
be
in
sumatra
than
here
*punct* ?
*break*
go
down
to
the
fiery
pit
itself
*punct* ,
in
order
to
keep
out
this
frost
*punct* ?
*break*
now
*punct* ,
that
lazarus
should
lie
stranded
there
on
the
curbstone
before
the
door
of
dives
*punct* ,
this
is
more
wonderful
than
that
an
iceberg
should
be
moored
to
one
of
the
moluccas
*punct* .
*break*
yet
dives
himself
*punct* ,
he
too
lives
like
a
czar
in
an
ice
palace
made
of
frozen
sighs
*punct* ,
and
being
a
president
of
a
temperance
society
*punct* ,
he
only
drinks
the
tepid
tears
of
orphans
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
more
of
this
blubbering
now
*punct* ,
we
are
going
a-whaling
*punct* ,
and
there
is
plenty
of
that
yet
to
come
*punct* .
*break*
on
one
side
hung
a
very
large
oil-painting
so
thoroughly
besmoked
*punct* ,
and
every
way
defaced
*punct* ,
that
in
the
unequal
cross-lights
by
which
you
viewed
it
*punct* ,
it
was
only
by
diligent
study
and
a
series
of
systematic
visits
to
it
*punct* ,
and
careful
inquiry
of
the
neighbors
*punct* ,
that
you
could
any
way
arrive
at
an
understanding
of
its
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
such
unaccountable
masses
of
shades
and
shadows
*punct* ,
that
at
first
you
almost
thought
some
ambitious
young
artist
*punct* ,
in
the
time
of
the
new
england
hags
*punct* ,
had
endeavored
to
delineate
chaos
bewitched
*punct* .
*break*
but
by
dint
of
much
and
earnest
contemplation
*punct* ,
and
oft
repeated
ponderings
*punct* ,
and
especially
by
throwing
open
the
little
window
towards
the
back
of
the
entry
*punct* ,
you
at
last
come
to
the
conclusion
that
such
an
idea
*punct* ,
however
wild
*punct* ,
might
not
be
altogether
unwarranted
*punct* .
*break*
a
boggy
*punct* ,
soggy
*punct* ,
squitchy
picture
truly
*punct* ,
enough
to
drive
a
nervous
man
distracted
*punct* .
*break*
yet
was
there
a
sort
of
indefinite
*punct* ,
half-attained
*punct* ,
unimaginable
sublimity
about
it
that
fairly
froze
you
to
it
*punct* ,
till
you
involuntarily
took
an
oath
with
yourself
to
find
out
what
that
marvellous
painting
meant
*punct* .
*break*
ever
and
anon
a
bright
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
alas
*punct* ,
deceptive
idea
would
dart
you
through.
*punct* ,
it's
the
black
sea
in
a
midnight
gale.
*punct* ,
it's
the
unnatural
combat
of
the
four
primal
elements.
*punct* ,
it's
a
blasted
heath.
*punct* ,
it's
a
hyperborean
winter
scene.
*punct* ,
it's
the
breaking-up
of
the
ice-bound
stream
of
time
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
last
all
these
fancies
yielded
to
that
one
portentous
something
in
the
picture's
midst
*punct* .
*break*
that
once
found
out
*punct* ,
and
all
the
rest
were
plain
*punct* .
*break*
but
stop
*punct* ;
does
it
not
bear
a
faint
resemblance
to
a
gigantic
fish
*punct* ?
*break*
even
the
great
leviathan
himself
*punct* ?
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
the
artist's
design
seemed
this
*punct* :
a
final
theory
of
my
own
*punct* ,
partly
based
upon
the
aggregated
opinions
of
many
aged
persons
with
whom
i
conversed
upon
the
subject
*punct* .
*break*
the
picture
represents
a
cape-horner
in
a
great
hurricane
*punct* ;
the
half-foundered
ship
weltering
there
with
its
three
dismantled
masts
alone
visible
*punct* ;
and
an
exasperated
whale
*punct* ,
purposing
to
spring
clean
over
the
craft
*punct* ,
is
in
the
enormous
act
of
impaling
himself
upon
the
three
mast-heads
*punct* .
*break*
the
opposite
wall
of
this
entry
was
hung
all
over
with
a
heathenish
array
of
monstrous
clubs
and
spears
*punct* .
*break*
some
were
thickly
set
with
glittering
teeth
resembling
ivory
saws
*punct* ;
others
were
tufted
with
knots
of
human
hair
*punct* ;
and
one
was
sickle-shaped
*punct* ,
with
a
vast
handle
sweeping
round
like
the
segment
made
in
the
new-mown
grass
by
a
long-armed
mower
*punct* .
*break*
you
shuddered
as
you
gazed
*punct* ,
and
wondered
what
monstrous
cannibal
and
savage
could
ever
have
gone
a
death-harvesting
with
such
a
hacking
*punct* ,
horrifying
implement
*punct* .
*break*
mixed
with
these
were
rusty
old
whaling
lances
and
harpoons
all
broken
and
deformed
*punct* .
*break*
some
were
storied
weapons
*punct* .
*break*
with
this
once
long
lance
*punct* ,
now
wildly
elbowed
*punct* ,
fifty
years
ago
did
nathan
swain
kill
fifteen
whales
between
a
sunrise
and
a
sunset
*punct* .
*break*
and
that
harpoon
*punct* ,
so
like
a
corkscrew
now
*punct* ,
was
flung
in
javan
seas
*punct* ,
and
run
away
with
by
a
whale
*punct* ,
years
afterward
slain
off
the
cape
of
blanco
*punct* .
*break*
crossing
this
dusky
entry
*punct* ,
and
on
through
yon
low-arched
way
*punct* ,
cut
through
what
in
old
times
must
have
been
a
great
central
chimney
with
fire-places
all
round
*punct* ,
you
enter
the
public
room
*punct* .
*break*
a
still
duskier
place
is
this
*punct* ,
with
such
low
ponderous
beams
above
*punct* ,
and
such
old
wrinkled
planks
beneath
*punct* ,
that
you
would
almost
fancy
you
trod
some
old
craft's
cockpits
*punct* ,
especially
of
such
a
howling
night
*punct* ,
when
this
corner-anchored
old
ark
rocked
so
furiously
*punct* .
*break*
on
one
side
stood
a
long
*punct* ,
low
*punct* ,
shelf-like
table
covered
with
cracked
glass
cases
*punct* ,
filled
with
dusty
rarities
gathered
from
this
wide
world's
remotest
nooks
*punct* .
*break*
projecting
from
the
further
angle
of
the
room
stands
a
dark-looking
den
*punct* ,
the
bar
*punct* ,
a
rude
attempt
at
a
right
whale's
head
*punct* .
*break*
be
that
how
it
may
*punct* ,
there
stands
the
vast
arched
bone
of
the
whale's
jaw
*punct* ,
so
wide
*punct* ,
a
coach
might
almost
drive
beneath
it
*punct* .
*break*
within
are
shabby
shelves
*punct* ,
ranged
round
with
old
decanters
*punct* ,
bottles
*punct* ,
flasks
*punct* ;
and
in
those
jaws
of
swift
destruction
*punct* ,
like
another
cursed
jonah
*punct* ,
by
which
name
indeed
they
called
him
*punct* ,
bustles
a
little
withered
old
man
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
for
their
money
*punct* ,
dearly
sells
the
sailors
deliriums
and
death
*punct* .
*break*
abominable
are
the
tumblers
into
which
he
pours
his
poison
*punct* .
*break*
though
true
cylinders
without
*punct* ,
within
*punct* ,
the
villanous
green
goggling
glasses
deceitfully
tapered
downwards
to
a
cheating
bottom
*punct* .
*break*
parallel
meridians
rudely
pecked
into
the
glass
*punct* ,
surround
these
footpads
goblets
*punct* .
*break*
fill
to
this
mark
*punct* ,
and
your
charge
is
but
a
penny
*punct* ;
to
this
a
penny
more
*punct* ;
and
so
on
to
the
full
glass
*punct* ,
the
cape
horn
measure
*punct* ,
which
you
may
gulp
down
for
a
shilling
*punct* .
*break*
upon
entering
the
place
i
found
a
number
of
young
seamen
gathered
about
a
table
*punct* ,
examining
by
a
dim
light
divers
specimens
of
skrimshander
*punct* .
*break*
i
sought
the
landlord
*punct* ,
and
telling
him
i
desired
to
be
accommodated
with
a
room
*punct* ,
received
for
answer
that
his
house
was
full
*punct* ,
not
a
bed
unoccupied
*punct* .
*break*
but
avast
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* ,
tapping
his
forehead
*punct* ,
you
haint
no
objections
to
sharing
a
harpooneer's
blanket
*punct* ,
have
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
i
thought
so
*punct* .
*break*
all
right
*punct* ;
take
a
seat
*punct* .
*break*
supper?
*punct* ,
you
want
supper
*punct* ?
*break*
supper
ll
be
ready
directly
*punct* .
*break*
i
sat
down
on
an
old
wooden
settle
*punct* ,
carved
all
over
like
a
bench
on
the
battery
*punct* .
*break*
at
one
end
a
ruminating
tar
was
still
further
adorning
it
with
his
jack-knife
*punct* ,
stooping
over
and
diligently
working
away
at
the
space
between
his
legs
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
trying
his
hand
at
a
ship
under
full
sail
*punct* ,
but
he
didn't
make
much
headway
*punct* ,
i
thought
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
some
four
or
five
of
us
were
summoned
to
our
meal
in
an
adjoining
room
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
cold
as
iceland
*punct* ,
no
fire
at
all
*punct* ,
the
landlord
said
he
couldn't
afford
it
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
but
two
dismal
tallow
candles
*punct* ,
each
in
a
winding
sheet
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
fain
to
button
up
our
monkey
jackets
*punct* ,
and
hold
to
our
lips
cups
of
scalding
tea
with
our
half
frozen
fingers
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
fare
was
of
the
most
substantial
kind
*punct* ,
not
only
meat
and
potatoes
*punct* ,
but
dumplings
*punct* ;
good
heavens
*punct* !
*break*
dumplings
for
supper
*punct* !
*break*
one
young
fellow
in
a
green
box
coat
*punct* ,
addressed
himself
to
these
dumplings
in
a
most
direful
manner
*punct* .
*break*
my
boy
*punct* ,
said
the
landlord
*punct* ,
you'll
have
the
nightmare
to
a
dead
sartainty
*punct* .
*break*
landlord
*punct* ,
i
whispered
*punct* ,
that
aint
the
harpooneer
*punct* ,
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
looking
a
sort
of
diabolically
funny
*punct* ,
the
harpooneer
is
a
dark
complexioned
chap
*punct* .
*break*
he
never
eats
dumplings
*punct* ,
he
don't
*punct* ,
he
eats
nothing
but
steaks
*punct* ,
and
likes
em
rare
*punct* .
*break*
the
devil
he
does
*punct* ,
says
i
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
that
harpooneer
*punct* ?
*break*
is
he
here
*punct* ?
*break*
he'll
be
here
afore
long
*punct* ,
was
the
answer
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
help
it
*punct* ,
but
i
began
to
feel
suspicious
of
this
dark
complexioned
harpooneer
*punct* .
*break*
presently
a
rioting
noise
was
heard
without
*punct* .
*break*
starting
up
*punct* ,
the
landlord
cried
*punct* ,
that's
the
grampus's
crew
*punct* .
*break*
i
seed
her
reported
in
the
offing
this
morning
*punct* ;
a
three
years
voyage
*punct* ,
and
a
full
ship
*punct* .
*break*
hurrah
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* ;
now
we'll
have
the
latest
news
from
the
feegees
*punct* .
*break*
a
tramping
of
sea
boots
was
heard
in
the
entry
*punct* ;
the
door
was
flung
open
*punct* ,
and
in
rolled
a
wild
set
of
mariners
enough
*punct* .
*break*
enveloped
in
their
shaggy
watch
coats
*punct* ,
and
with
their
heads
muffled
in
woollen
comforters
*punct* ,
all
bedarned
and
ragged
*punct* ,
and
their
beards
stiff
with
icicles
*punct* ,
they
seemed
an
eruption
of
bears
from
labrador
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
just
landed
from
their
boat
*punct* ,
and
this
was
the
first
house
they
entered
*punct* .
*break*
no
wonder
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
that
they
made
a
straight
wake
for
the
whale's
mouth
*punct* ,
the
bar
*punct* ,
when
the
wrinkled
little
old
jonah
*punct* ,
there
officiating
*punct* ,
soon
poured
them
out
brimmers
all
round
*punct* .
*break*
one
complained
of
a
bad
cold
in
his
head
*punct* ,
upon
which
jonah
mixed
him
a
pitch-like
potion
of
gin
and
molasses
*punct* ,
which
he
swore
was
a
sovereign
cure
for
all
colds
and
catarrhs
whatsoever
*punct* ,
never
mind
of
how
long
standing
*punct* ,
or
whether
caught
off
the
coast
of
labrador
*punct* ,
or
on
the
weather
side
of
an
ice-island
*punct* .
*break*
the
liquor
soon
mounted
into
their
heads
*punct* ,
as
it
generally
does
even
with
the
arrantest
topers
newly
landed
from
sea
*punct* ,
and
they
began
capering
about
most
obstreperously
*punct* .
*break*
i
observed
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
that
one
of
them
held
somewhat
aloof
*punct* ,
and
though
he
seemed
desirous
not
to
spoil
the
hilarity
of
his
shipmates
by
his
own
sober
face
*punct* ,
yet
upon
the
whole
he
refrained
from
making
as
much
noise
as
the
rest
*punct* .
*break*
this
man
interested
me
at
once
*punct* ;
and
since
the
sea-gods
had
ordained
that
he
should
soon
become
my
shipmate
*punct* ,
though
but
a
sleeping-partner
one
*punct* ,
so
far
as
this
narrative
is
concerned
*punct* ,
i
will
here
venture
upon
a
little
description
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
stood
full
six
feet
in
height
*punct* ,
with
noble
shoulders
*punct* ,
and
a
chest
like
a
coffer-dam
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
seldom
seen
such
brawn
in
a
man
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
was
deeply
brown
and
burnt
*punct* ,
making
his
white
teeth
dazzling
by
the
contrast
*punct* ;
while
in
the
deep
shadows
of
his
eyes
floated
some
reminiscences
that
did
not
seem
to
give
him
much
joy
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
revelry
of
his
companions
had
mounted
to
its
height
*punct* ,
this
man
slipped
away
unobserved
*punct* ,
and
i
saw
no
more
of
him
till
he
became
my
comrade
on
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
few
minutes
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
was
missed
by
his
shipmates
*punct* ,
and
being
*punct* ,
it
seems
*punct* ,
for
some
reason
a
huge
favorite
with
them
*punct* ,
they
raised
a
cry
of
bulkington
*punct* !
*break*
and
darted
out
of
the
house
in
pursuit
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
now
about
nine
o'clock
*punct* ,
and
the
room
seeming
almost
supernaturally
quiet
after
these
orgies
*punct* ,
i
began
to
congratulate
myself
upon
a
little
plan
that
had
occurred
to
me
just
previous
to
the
entrance
of
the
seamen
*punct* .
*break*
no
man
prefers
to
sleep
two
in
a
bed
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
you
would
a
good
deal
rather
not
sleep
with
your
own
brother
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
how
it
is
*punct* ,
but
people
like
to
be
private
when
they
are
sleeping
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
it
comes
to
sleeping
with
an
unknown
stranger
*punct* ,
in
a
strange
inn
*punct* ,
in
a
strange
town
*punct* ,
and
that
stranger
a
harpooneer
*punct* ,
then
your
objections
indefinitely
multiply
*punct* .
*break*
nor
was
there
any
earthly
reason
why
i
as
a
sailor
should
sleep
two
in
a
bed
*punct* ,
more
than
anybody
else
*punct* ;
for
sailors
no
more
sleep
two
in
a
bed
at
sea
*punct* ,
than
bachelor
kings
do
ashore
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
sure
they
all
sleep
together
in
one
apartment
*punct* ,
but
you
have
your
own
hammock
*punct* ,
and
cover
yourself
with
your
own
blanket
*punct* ,
and
sleep
in
your
own
skin
*punct* .
*break*
the
more
i
pondered
over
this
harpooneer
*punct* ,
the
more
i
abominated
the
thought
of
sleeping
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
fair
to
presume
that
being
a
harpooneer
*punct* ,
his
linen
or
woollen
*punct* ,
as
the
case
might
be
*punct* ,
would
not
be
of
the
tidiest
*punct* ,
certainly
none
of
the
finest
*punct* .
*break*
i
began
to
twitch
all
over
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
it
was
getting
late
*punct* ,
and
my
decent
harpooneer
ought
to
be
home
and
going
bedwards
*punct* .
*break*
suppose
now
*punct* ,
he
should
tumble
in
upon
me
at
midnight
*punct* ,
how
could
i
tell
from
what
vile
hole
he
had
been
coming
*punct* ?
*break*
i've
changed
my
mind
about
that
harpooneer.
*punct* ,
i
shan't
sleep
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
try
the
bench
here
*punct* .
*break*
just
as
you
please
*punct* ;
i'm
sorry
i
cant
spare
ye
a
tablecloth
for
a
mattress
*punct* ,
and
it's
a
plaguy
rough
board
here
*punct* ,
feeling
of
the
knots
and
notches
*punct* .
*break*
so
saying
he
procured
the
plane
*punct* ;
and
with
his
old
silk
handkerchief
first
dusting
the
bench
*punct* ,
vigorously
set
to
planing
away
at
my
bed
*punct* ,
the
while
grinning
like
an
ape
*punct* .
*break*
the
shavings
flew
right
and
left
*punct* ;
till
at
last
the
plane-iron
came
bump
against
an
indestructible
knot
*punct* .
*break*
the
landlord
was
near
spraining
his
wrist
*punct* ,
and
i
told
him
for
heaven's
sake
to
quit
*punct* ,
the
bed
was
soft
enough
to
suit
me
*punct* ,
and
i
did
not
know
how
all
the
planing
in
the
world
could
make
eider
down
of
a
pine
plank
*punct* .
*break*
so
gathering
up
the
shavings
with
another
grin
*punct* ,
and
throwing
them
into
the
great
stove
in
the
middle
of
the
room
*punct* ,
he
went
about
his
business
*punct* ,
and
left
me
in
a
brown
study
*punct* .
*break*
i
now
took
the
measure
of
the
bench
*punct* ,
and
found
that
it
was
a
foot
too
short
*punct* ;
but
that
could
be
mended
with
a
chair
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
was
a
foot
too
narrow
*punct* ,
and
the
other
bench
in
the
room
was
about
four
inches
higher
than
the
planed
one
*punct* ,
so
there
was
no
yoking
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
then
placed
the
first
bench
lengthwise
along
the
only
clear
space
against
the
wall
*punct* ,
leaving
a
little
interval
between
*punct* ,
for
my
back
to
settle
down
in
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
soon
found
that
there
came
such
a
draught
of
cold
air
over
me
from
under
the
sill
of
the
window
*punct* ,
that
this
plan
would
never
do
at
all
*punct* ,
especially
as
another
current
from
the
rickety
door
met
the
one
from
the
window
*punct* ,
and
both
together
formed
a
series
of
small
whirlwinds
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
spot
where
i
had
thought
to
spend
the
night
*punct* .
*break*
the
devil
fetch
that
harpooneer
*punct* ,
thought
i
*punct* ,
but
stop
*punct* ,
couldn't
i
steal
a
march
on
him
*punct* ,
bolt
his
door
inside
*punct* ,
and
jump
into
his
bed
*punct* ,
not
to
be
wakened
by
the
most
violent
knockings
*punct* ?
*break*
it
seemed
no
bad
idea
*punct* ;
but
upon
second
thoughts
i
dismissed
it
*punct* .
*break*
for
who
could
tell
but
what
the
next
morning
*punct* ,
so
soon
as
i
popped
out
of
the
room
*punct* ,
the
harpooneer
might
be
standing
in
the
entry
*punct* ,
all
ready
to
knock
me
down
*punct* !
*break*
still
*punct* ,
looking
around
me
again
*punct* ,
and
seeing
no
possible
chance
of
spending
a
sufferable
night
unless
in
some
other
person's
bed
*punct* ,
i
began
to
think
that
after
all
i
might
be
cherishing
unwarrantable
prejudices
against
this
unknown
harpooneer
*punct* .
*break*
thinks
i
*punct* ,
i'll
wait
awhile
*punct* ;
he
must
be
dropping
in
before
long
*punct* .
*break*
said
i
*punct* ,
what
sort
of
a
chap
is
he
*punct* ,
does
he
always
keep
such
late
hours
*punct* ?
*break*
it
was
now
hard
upon
twelve
o'clock
*punct* .
*break*
the
landlord
chuckled
again
with
his
lean
chuckle
*punct* ,
and
seemed
to
be
mightily
tickled
at
something
beyond
my
comprehension
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
he
answered
*punct* ,
generally
he's
an
early
bird
*punct* ,
airley
to
bed
and
airley
to
rise
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
he's
the
bird
what
catches
the
worm.
*punct* ,
but
to-night
he
went
out
a
peddling
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* ,
and
i
don't
see
what
on
airth
keeps
him
so
late
*punct* ,
unless
*punct* ,
may
be
*punct* ,
he
can't
sell
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
can't
sell
his
head?
*punct* ,
what
sort
of
a
bamboozingly
story
is
this
you
are
telling
me
*punct* ?
*break*
getting
into
a
towering
rage
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
pretend
to
say
*punct* ,
landlord
*punct* ,
that
this
harpooneer
is
actually
engaged
this
blessed
saturday
night
*punct* ,
or
rather
sunday
morning
*punct* ,
in
peddling
his
head
around
this
town
*punct* ?
*break*
that's
precisely
it
*punct* ,
said
the
landlord
*punct* ,
and
i
told
him
he
couldn't
sell
it
here
*punct* ,
the
market's
overstocked
*punct* .
*break*
with
heads
to
be
sure
*punct* ;
ain't
there
too
many
heads
in
the
world
*punct* ?
*break*
i
tell
you
what
it
is
*punct* ,
landlord
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
quite
calmly
*punct* ,
you'd
better
stop
spinning
that
yarn
to
me
*punct* ,
i'm
not
green
*punct* .
*break*
may
be
not
*punct* ,
taking
out
a
stick
and
whittling
a
toothpick
*punct* ,
but
i
rayther
guess
you'll
be
done
brown
if
that
ere
harpooneer
hears
you
a
slanderin
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
break
it
for
him
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
now
flying
into
a
passion
again
at
this
unaccountable
farrago
of
the
landlord's
*punct* .
*break*
it's
broke
a'ready
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* .
*break*
broke
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
broke
*punct* ,
do
you
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
sartain
*punct* ,
and
that's
the
very
reason
he
can't
sell
it
*punct* ,
i
guess
*punct* .
*break*
landlord
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
going
up
to
him
as
cool
as
mt
*punct* .
*break*
hecla
in
a
snow
storm,
*punct* ,
landlord
*punct* ,
stop
whittling
*punct* .
*break*
you
and
i
must
understand
one
another
*punct* ,
and
that
too
without
delay
*punct* .
*break*
i
come
to
your
house
and
want
a
bed
*punct* ;
you
tell
me
you
can
only
give
me
half
a
one
*punct* ;
that
the
other
half
belongs
to
a
certain
harpooneer
*punct* .
*break*
i
now
demand
of
you
to
speak
out
and
tell
me
who
and
what
this
harpooneer
is
*punct* ,
and
whether
i
shall
be
in
all
respects
safe
to
spend
the
night
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
the
first
place
*punct* ,
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
unsay
that
story
about
selling
his
head
*punct* ,
which
if
true
i
take
to
be
good
evidence
that
this
harpooneer
is
stark
mad
*punct* ,
and
i've
no
idea
of
sleeping
with
a
madman
*punct* ;
and
you
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
you
i
mean
*punct* ,
landlord
*punct* ,
you
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
by
trying
to
induce
me
to
do
so
knowingly
*punct* ,
would
thereby
render
yourself
liable
to
a
criminal
prosecution
*punct* .
*break*
wall
*punct* ,
said
the
landlord
*punct* ,
fetching
a
long
breath
*punct* ,
that's
a
purty
long
sarmon
for
a
chap
that
rips
a
little
now
and
then
*punct* .
*break*
but
be
easy
*punct* ,
be
easy
*punct* ,
this
here
harpooneer
i
have
been
tellin
you
of
has
just
arrived
from
the
south
seas
*punct* ,
where
he
bought
up
a
lot
of
balmed
new
zealand
heads
*punct* ,
great
curios
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
and
he's
sold
all
on
em
but
one
*punct* ,
and
that
one
he's
trying
to
sell
to-night
*punct* ,
cause
to-morrow's
sunday
*punct* ,
and
it
would
not
do
to
be
sellin
human
heads
about
the
streets
when
folks
is
goin
to
churches
*punct* .
*break*
he
wanted
to
*punct* ,
last
sunday
*punct* ,
but
i
stopped
him
just
as
he
was
goin
out
of
the
door
with
four
heads
strung
on
a
string
*punct* ,
for
all
the
airth
like
a
string
of
inions
*punct* .
*break*
this
account
cleared
up
the
otherwise
unaccountable
mystery
*punct* ,
and
showed
that
the
landlord
*punct* ,
after
all
*punct* ,
had
had
no
idea
of
fooling
me
*punct* ,
but
at
the
same
time
what
could
i
think
of
a
harpooneer
who
stayed
out
a
saturday
night
clean
into
the
holy
sabbath
*punct* ,
engaged
in
such
a
cannibal
business
as
selling
the
heads
of
dead
idolators
*punct* ?
*break*
depend
upon
it
*punct* ,
landlord
*punct* ,
that
harpooneer
is
a
dangerous
man
*punct* .
*break*
he
pays
reg'lar
*punct* ,
was
the
rejoinder
*punct* .
*break*
but
come
*punct* ,
it's
getting
dreadful
late
*punct* ,
you
had
better
be
turning
flukes
*punct* ,
it's
a
nice
bed
*punct* :
sal
and
me
slept
in
that
ere
bed
the
night
we
were
spliced
*punct* .
*break*
there's
plenty
room
for
two
to
kick
about
in
that
bed
*punct* ;
it's
an
almighty
big
bed
that
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
afore
we
give
it
up
*punct* ,
sal
used
to
put
our
sam
and
little
johnny
in
the
foot
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
got
a
dreaming
and
sprawling
about
one
night
*punct* ,
and
somehow
*punct* ,
sam
got
pitched
on
the
floor
*punct* ,
and
came
near
breaking
his
arm
*punct* .
*break*
come
along
here
*punct* ,
i'll
give
ye
a
glim
in
a
jiffy
*punct* ;
and
so
saying
he
lighted
a
candle
and
held
it
towards
me
*punct* ,
offering
to
lead
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
stood
irresolute
*punct* ;
when
looking
at
a
clock
in
the
corner
*punct* ,
he
exclaimed
i
vum
it's
sunday
*punct* ,
you
won't
see
that
harpooneer
to-night
*punct* ;
he's
come
to
anchor
somewhere
*punct* ,
come
along
then
*punct* ;
do
come
*punct* ;
won't
ye
come
*punct* ?
*break*
i
considered
the
matter
a
moment
*punct* ,
and
then
up
stairs
we
went
*punct* ,
and
i
was
ushered
into
a
small
room
*punct* ,
cold
as
a
clam
*punct* ,
and
furnished
*punct* ,
sure
enough
*punct* ,
with
a
prodigious
bed
*punct* ,
almost
big
enough
indeed
for
any
four
harpooneers
to
sleep
abreast
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
said
the
landlord
*punct* ,
placing
the
candle
on
a
crazy
old
sea
chest
that
did
double
duty
as
a
wash-stand
and
centre
table
*punct* ;
there
*punct* ,
make
yourself
comfortable
now
*punct* ,
and
good
night
to
ye
*punct* .
*break*
i
turned
round
from
eyeing
the
bed
*punct* ,
but
he
had
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
folding
back
the
counterpane
*punct* ,
i
stooped
over
the
bed
*punct* .
*break*
though
none
of
the
most
elegant
*punct* ,
it
yet
stood
the
scrutiny
tolerably
well
*punct* .
*break*
i
then
glanced
round
the
room
*punct* ;
and
besides
the
bedstead
and
centre
table
*punct* ,
could
see
no
other
furniture
belonging
to
the
place
*punct* ,
but
a
rude
shelf
*punct* ,
the
four
walls
*punct* ,
and
a
papered
fireboard
representing
a
man
striking
a
whale
*punct* .
*break*
of
things
not
properly
belonging
to
the
room
*punct* ,
there
was
a
hammock
lashed
up
*punct* ,
and
thrown
upon
the
floor
in
one
corner
*punct* ;
also
a
large
seaman's
bag
*punct* ,
containing
the
harpooneer's
wardrobe
*punct* ,
no
doubt
in
lieu
of
a
land
trunk
*punct* .
*break*
likewise
*punct* ,
there
was
a
parcel
of
outlandish
bone
fish
hooks
on
the
shelf
over
the
fire-place
*punct* ,
and
a
tall
harpoon
standing
at
the
head
of
the
bed
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
is
this
on
the
chest
*punct* ?
*break*
i
took
it
up
*punct* ,
and
held
it
close
to
the
light
*punct* ,
and
felt
it
*punct* ,
and
smelt
it
*punct* ,
and
tried
every
way
possible
to
arrive
at
some
satisfactory
conclusion
concerning
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
compare
it
to
nothing
but
a
large
door
mat
*punct* ,
ornamented
at
the
edges
with
little
tinkling
tags
something
like
the
stained
porcupine
quills
round
an
indian
moccasin
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
hole
or
slit
in
the
middle
of
this
mat
*punct* ,
as
you
see
the
same
in
south
american
ponchos
*punct* .
*break*
but
could
it
be
possible
that
any
sober
harpooneer
would
get
into
a
door
mat
*punct* ,
and
parade
the
streets
of
any
christian
town
in
that
sort
of
guise
*punct* ?
*break*
i
went
up
in
it
to
a
bit
of
glass
stuck
against
the
wall
*punct* ,
and
i
never
saw
such
a
sight
in
my
life
*punct* .
*break*
i
tore
myself
out
of
it
in
such
a
hurry
that
i
gave
myself
a
kink
in
the
neck
*punct* .
*break*
i
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
*punct* ,
and
commenced
thinking
about
this
head-peddling
harpooneer
*punct* ,
and
his
door
mat
*punct* .
*break*
after
thinking
some
time
on
the
bed-side
*punct* ,
i
got
up
and
took
off
my
monkey
jacket
*punct* ,
and
then
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
thinking
*punct* .
*break*
i
then
took
off
my
coat
*punct* ,
and
thought
a
little
more
in
my
shirt
sleeves
*punct* .
*break*
but
beginning
to
feel
very
cold
now
*punct* ,
half
undressed
as
i
was
*punct* ,
and
remembering
what
the
landlord
said
about
the
harpooneer's
not
coming
home
at
all
that
night
*punct* ,
it
being
so
very
late
*punct* ,
i
made
no
more
ado
*punct* ,
but
jumped
out
of
my
pantaloons
and
boots
*punct* ,
and
then
blowing
out
the
light
tumbled
into
bed
*punct* ,
and
commended
myself
to
the
care
of
heaven
*punct* .
*break*
whether
that
mattress
was
stuffed
with
corn-cobs
or
broken
crockery
*punct* ,
there
is
no
telling
*punct* ,
but
i
rolled
about
a
good
deal
*punct* ,
and
could
not
sleep
for
a
long
time
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
i
slid
off
into
a
light
doze
*punct* ,
and
had
pretty
nearly
made
a
good
offing
towards
the
land
of
nod
*punct* ,
when
i
heard
a
heavy
footfall
in
the
passage
*punct* ,
and
saw
a
glimmer
of
light
come
into
the
room
from
under
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
lord
save
me
*punct* ,
thinks
i
*punct* ,
that
must
be
the
harpooneer
*punct* ,
the
infernal
head-peddler
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
lay
perfectly
still
*punct* ,
and
resolved
not
to
say
a
word
till
spoken
to
*punct* .
*break*
holding
a
light
in
one
hand
*punct* ,
and
that
identical
new
zealand
head
in
the
other
*punct* ,
the
stranger
entered
the
room
*punct* ,
and
without
looking
towards
the
bed
*punct* ,
placed
his
candle
a
good
way
off
from
me
on
the
floor
in
one
corner
*punct* ,
and
then
began
working
away
at
the
knotted
cords
of
the
large
bag
i
before
spoke
of
as
being
in
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
all
eagerness
to
see
his
face
*punct* ,
but
he
kept
it
averted
for
some
time
while
employed
in
unlacing
the
bag's
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
this
accomplished
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
turned
round
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
good
heavens
*punct* !
*break*
what
a
sight
*punct* !
*break*
such
a
face
*punct* !
*break*
it
was
of
a
dark
purplish
*punct* ,
yellow
color
*punct* ,
here
and
there
stuck
over
with
large
*punct* ,
blackish
looking
squares
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
it's
just
as
i
thought
*punct* ,
he's
a
terrible
bedfellow
*punct* ;
he's
been
in
a
fight
*punct* ,
got
dreadfully
cut
*punct* ,
and
here
he
is
*punct* ,
just
from
the
surgeon
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
stains
of
some
sort
or
other
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
i
knew
not
what
to
make
of
this
*punct* ;
but
soon
an
inkling
of
the
truth
occurred
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
remembered
a
story
of
a
white
man
*punct* ,
a
whaleman
too
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
falling
among
the
cannibals
*punct* ,
had
been
tattooed
by
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
concluded
that
this
harpooneer
*punct* ,
in
the
course
of
his
distant
voyages
*punct* ,
must
have
met
with
a
similar
adventure
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
is
it
*punct* ,
thought
i
*punct* ,
after
all
*punct* !
*break*
it's
only
his
outside
*punct* ;
a
man
can
be
honest
in
any
sort
of
skin
*punct* .
*break*
but
then
*punct* ,
what
to
make
of
his
unearthly
complexion
*punct* ,
that
part
of
it
*punct* ,
i
mean
*punct* ,
lying
round
about
*punct* ,
and
completely
independent
of
the
squares
of
tattooing
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
sure
*punct* ,
it
might
be
nothing
but
a
good
coat
of
tropical
tanning
*punct* ;
but
i
never
heard
of
a
hot
sun's
tanning
a
white
man
into
a
purplish
yellow
one
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
i
had
never
been
in
the
south
seas
*punct* ;
and
perhaps
the
sun
there
produced
these
extraordinary
effects
upon
the
skin
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
while
all
these
ideas
were
passing
through
me
like
lightning
*punct* ,
this
harpooneer
never
noticed
me
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
after
some
difficulty
having
opened
his
bag
*punct* ,
he
commenced
fumbling
in
it
*punct* ,
and
presently
pulled
out
a
sort
of
tomahawk
*punct* ,
and
a
seal-skin
wallet
with
the
hair
on
*punct* .
*break*
placing
these
on
the
old
chest
in
the
middle
of
the
room
*punct* ,
he
then
took
the
new
zealand
head
*punct* ,
a
ghastly
thing
enough
*punct* ,
and
crammed
it
down
into
the
bag
*punct* .
*break*
he
now
took
off
his
hat
*punct* ,
a
new
beaver
hat
*punct* ,
when
i
came
nigh
singing
out
with
fresh
surprise
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
no
hair
on
his
head
*punct* ,
none
to
speak
of
at
least
*punct* ,
nothing
but
a
small
scalp-knot
twisted
up
on
his
forehead
*punct* .
*break*
his
bald
purplish
head
now
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
mildewed
skull
*punct* .
*break*
had
not
the
stranger
stood
between
me
and
the
door
*punct* ,
i
would
have
bolted
out
of
it
quicker
than
ever
i
bolted
a
dinner
*punct* .
*break*
even
as
it
was
*punct* ,
i
thought
something
of
slipping
out
of
the
window
*punct* ,
but
it
was
the
second
floor
back
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
no
coward
*punct* ,
but
what
to
make
of
this
head-peddling
purple
rascal
altogether
passed
my
comprehension
*punct* .
*break*
ignorance
is
the
parent
of
fear
*punct* ,
and
being
completely
nonplussed
and
confounded
about
the
stranger
*punct* ,
i
confess
i
was
now
as
much
afraid
of
him
as
if
it
was
the
devil
himself
who
had
thus
broken
into
my
room
at
the
dead
of
night
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
live
*punct* ,
these
covered
parts
of
him
were
checkered
with
the
same
squares
as
his
face
*punct* ;
his
back
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
was
all
over
the
same
dark
squares
*punct* ;
he
seemed
to
have
been
in
a
thirty
years
war
*punct* ,
and
just
escaped
from
it
with
a
sticking-plaster
shirt
*punct* .
*break*
still
more
*punct* ,
his
very
legs
were
marked
*punct* ,
as
if
a
parcel
of
dark
green
frogs
were
running
up
the
trunks
of
young
palms
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
now
quite
plain
that
he
must
be
some
abominable
savage
or
other
shipped
aboard
of
a
whaleman
in
the
south
seas
*punct* ,
and
so
landed
in
this
christian
country
*punct* .
*break*
i
quaked
to
think
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
a
peddler
of
heads
too
*punct* ,
perhaps
the
heads
of
his
own
brothers
*punct* .
*break*
he
might
take
a
fancy
to
mine
*punct* ,
heavens
*punct* !
*break*
look
at
that
tomahawk
*punct* !
*break*
but
there
was
no
time
for
shuddering
*punct* ,
for
now
the
savage
went
about
something
that
completely
fascinated
my
attention
*punct* ,
and
convinced
me
that
he
must
indeed
be
a
heathen
*punct* .
*break*
going
to
his
heavy
grego
*punct* ,
or
wrapall
*punct* ,
or
dreadnaught
*punct* ,
which
he
had
previously
hung
on
a
chair
*punct* ,
he
fumbled
in
the
pockets
*punct* ,
and
produced
at
length
a
curious
little
deformed
image
with
a
hunch
on
its
back
*punct* ,
and
exactly
the
color
of
a
three
days
old
congo
baby
*punct* .
*break*
remembering
the
embalmed
head
*punct* ,
at
first
i
almost
thought
that
this
black
manikin
was
a
real
baby
preserved
in
some
similar
manner
*punct* .
*break*
but
seeing
that
it
was
not
at
all
limber
*punct* ,
and
that
it
glistened
a
good
deal
like
polished
ebony
*punct* ,
i
concluded
that
it
must
be
nothing
but
a
wooden
idol
*punct* ,
which
indeed
it
proved
to
be
*punct* .
*break*
for
now
the
savage
goes
up
to
the
empty
fireplace
*punct* ,
and
removing
the
papered
fire-board
*punct* ,
sets
up
this
little
hunchbacked
image
*punct* ,
like
a
tenpin
*punct* ,
between
the
andirons
*punct* .
*break*
the
chimney
jambs
and
all
the
bricks
inside
were
very
sooty
*punct* ,
so
that
i
thought
this
fire-place
made
a
very
appropriate
little
shrine
or
chapel
for
his
congo
idol
*punct* .
*break*
i
now
screwed
my
eyes
hard
towards
the
half
hidden
image
*punct* ,
feeling
but
ill
at
ease
meantime
*punct* ,
to
see
what
was
next
to
follow
*punct* .
*break*
first
he
takes
about
a
double
handful
of
shavings
out
of
his
grego
pocket
*punct* ,
and
places
them
carefully
before
the
idol
*punct* ;
then
laying
a
bit
of
ship
biscuit
on
top
and
applying
the
flame
from
the
lamp
*punct* ,
he
kindled
the
shavings
into
a
sacrificial
blaze
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
little
devil
did
not
seem
to
fancy
such
dry
sort
of
fare
at
all
*punct* ;
he
never
moved
his
lips
*punct* .
*break*
all
these
strange
antics
were
accompanied
by
still
stranger
guttural
noises
from
the
devotee
*punct* ,
who
seemed
to
be
praying
in
a
sing-song
or
else
singing
some
pagan
psalmody
or
other
*punct* ,
during
which
his
face
twitched
about
in
the
most
unnatural
manner
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
extinguishing
the
fire
*punct* ,
he
took
the
idol
up
very
unceremoniously
*punct* ,
and
bagged
it
again
in
his
grego
pocket
as
carelessly
as
if
he
were
a
sportsman
bagging
a
dead
woodcock
*punct* .
*break*
all
these
queer
proceedings
increased
my
uncomfortableness
*punct* ,
and
seeing
him
now
exhibiting
strong
symptoms
of
concluding
his
business
operations
*punct* ,
and
jumping
into
bed
with
me
*punct* ,
i
thought
it
was
high
time
*punct* ,
now
or
never
*punct* ,
before
the
light
was
put
out
*punct* ,
to
break
the
spell
into
which
i
had
so
long
been
bound
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
interval
i
spent
in
deliberating
what
to
say
*punct* ,
was
a
fatal
one
*punct* .
*break*
taking
up
his
tomahawk
from
the
table
*punct* ,
he
examined
the
head
of
it
for
an
instant
*punct* ,
and
then
holding
it
to
the
light
*punct* ,
with
his
mouth
at
the
handle
*punct* ,
he
puffed
out
great
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
moment
the
light
was
extinguished
*punct* ,
and
this
wild
cannibal
*punct* ,
tomahawk
between
his
teeth
*punct* ,
sprang
into
bed
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
sang
out
*punct* ,
i
could
not
help
it
now
*punct* ;
and
giving
a
sudden
grunt
of
astonishment
he
began
feeling
me
*punct* .
*break*
stammering
out
something
*punct* ,
i
knew
not
what
*punct* ,
i
rolled
away
from
him
against
the
wall
*punct* ,
and
then
conjured
him
*punct* ,
whoever
or
whatever
he
might
be
*punct* ,
to
keep
quiet
*punct* ,
and
let
me
get
up
and
light
the
lamp
again
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
guttural
responses
satisfied
me
at
once
that
he
but
ill
comprehended
my
meaning
*punct* .
*break*
who-e
debel
you?
*punct* ,
he
at
last
said
*punct* ,
you
no
speak-e
*punct* ,
dam-me
*punct* ,
i
kill-e
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
saying
the
lighted
tomahawk
began
flourishing
about
me
in
the
dark
*punct* .
*break*
landlord
*punct* ,
for
god's
sake
*punct* ,
peter
coffin
*punct* !
*break*
tell-ee
me
who-ee
be
*punct* ,
or
dam-me
*punct* ,
i
kill-e
*punct* !
*break*
but
thank
heaven
*punct* ,
at
that
moment
the
landlord
came
into
the
room
light
in
hand
*punct* ,
and
leaping
from
the
bed
i
ran
up
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
don't
be
afraid
now
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
grinning
again
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
here
wouldn't
harm
a
hair
of
your
head
*punct* .
*break*
stop
your
grinning
*punct* ,
shouted
i
*punct* ,
and
why
didn't
you
tell
me
that
that
infernal
harpooneer
was
a
cannibal
*punct* ?
*break*
i
thought
ye
know'd
it;
*punct* ,
didn't
i
tell
ye
*punct* ,
he
was
peddlin
heads
around
town?
*punct* ,
but
turn
flukes
again
and
go
to
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
*punct* ,
look
here
*punct* ,
you
sabbee
me
*punct* ,
i
sabbee
you
*punct* ,
this
man
sleepe
you
*punct* ,
you
sabbee
*punct* ?
*break*
me
sabbee
plenty
*punct* ,
grunted
queequeg
*punct* ,
puffing
away
at
his
pipe
and
sitting
up
in
bed
*punct* .
*break*
you
gettee
in
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* ,
motioning
to
me
with
his
tomahawk
*punct* ,
and
throwing
the
clothes
to
one
side
*punct* .
*break*
he
really
did
this
in
not
only
a
civil
but
a
really
kind
and
charitable
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
stood
looking
at
him
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
for
all
his
tattooings
he
was
on
the
whole
a
clean
*punct* ,
comely
looking
cannibal
*punct* .
*break*
what's
all
this
fuss
i
have
been
making
about
*punct* ,
thought
i
to
myself
*punct* ,
the
man's
a
human
being
just
as
i
am
*punct* :
he
has
just
as
much
reason
to
fear
me
*punct* ,
as
i
have
to
be
afraid
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
better
sleep
with
a
sober
cannibal
than
a
drunken
christian
*punct* .
*break*
landlord
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
tell
him
to
stash
his
tomahawk
there
*punct* ,
or
pipe
*punct* ,
or
whatever
you
call
it
*punct* ;
tell
him
to
stop
smoking
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
and
i
will
turn
in
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
don't
fancy
having
a
man
smoking
in
bed
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
i
aint
insured
*punct* .
*break*
this
being
told
to
queequeg
*punct* ,
he
at
once
complied
*punct* ,
and
again
politely
motioned
me
to
get
into
bed
*punct* ,
rolling
over
to
one
side
as
much
as
to
say
*punct* ,
i
wont
touch
a
leg
of
ye
*punct* .
*break*
good
night
*punct* ,
landlord
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
you
may
go
*punct* .
*break*
you
had
almost
thought
i
had
been
his
wife
*punct* .
*break*
the
counterpane
was
of
patchwork
*punct* ,
full
of
odd
little
parti-colored
squares
and
triangles
*punct* ;
and
this
arm
of
his
tattooed
all
over
with
an
interminable
cretan
labyrinth
of
a
figure
*punct* ,
no
two
parts
of
which
were
of
one
precise
shade
*punct* ,
owing
i
suppose
to
his
keeping
his
arm
at
sea
unmethodically
in
sun
and
shade
*punct* ,
his
shirt
sleeves
irregularly
rolled
up
at
various
times
*punct* ,
this
same
arm
of
his
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
looked
for
all
the
world
like
a
strip
of
that
same
patchwork
quilt
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
partly
lying
on
it
as
the
arm
did
when
i
first
awoke
*punct* ,
i
could
hardly
tell
it
from
the
quilt
*punct* ,
they
so
blended
their
hues
together
*punct* ;
and
it
was
only
by
the
sense
of
weight
and
pressure
that
i
could
tell
that
queequeg
was
hugging
me
*punct* .
*break*
my
sensations
were
strange
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
try
to
explain
them
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
was
a
child
*punct* ,
i
well
remember
a
somewhat
similar
circumstance
that
befell
me
*punct* ;
whether
it
was
a
reality
or
a
dream
*punct* ,
i
never
could
entirely
settle
*punct* .
*break*
the
circumstance
was
this
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
been
cutting
up
some
caper
or
other
*punct* ,
i
think
it
was
trying
to
crawl
up
the
chimney
*punct* ,
as
i
had
seen
a
little
sweep
do
a
few
days
previous
*punct* ;
and
my
stepmother
who
*punct* ,
somehow
or
other
*punct* ,
was
all
the
time
whipping
me
*punct* ,
or
sending
me
to
bed
supperless,
*punct* ,
my
mother
dragged
me
by
the
legs
out
of
the
chimney
and
packed
me
off
to
bed
*punct* ,
though
it
was
only
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
21st
june
*punct* ,
the
longest
day
in
the
year
in
our
hemisphere
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
dreadfully
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
*punct* ,
so
up
stairs
i
went
to
my
little
room
in
the
third
floor
*punct* ,
undressed
myself
as
slowly
as
possible
so
as
to
kill
time
*punct* ,
and
with
a
bitter
sigh
got
between
the
sheets
*punct* .
*break*
i
lay
there
dismally
calculating
that
sixteen
entire
hours
must
elapse
before
i
could
hope
for
a
resurrection
*punct* .
*break*
the
small
of
my
back
ached
to
think
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
was
so
light
too
*punct* ;
the
sun
shining
in
at
the
window
*punct* ,
and
a
great
rattling
of
coaches
in
the
streets
*punct* ,
and
the
sound
of
gay
voices
all
over
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
worse
and
worse
*punct* ,
at
last
i
got
up
*punct* ,
dressed
*punct* ,
and
softly
going
down
in
my
stockinged
feet
*punct* ,
sought
out
my
stepmother
*punct* ,
and
suddenly
threw
myself
at
her
feet
*punct* ,
beseeching
her
as
a
particular
favor
to
give
me
a
good
slippering
for
my
misbehavior
*punct* ;
anything
indeed
but
condemning
me
to
lie
abed
such
an
unendurable
length
of
time
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
was
the
best
and
most
conscientious
of
stepmothers
*punct* ,
and
back
i
had
to
go
to
my
room
*punct* .
*break*
for
several
hours
i
lay
there
broad
awake
*punct* ,
feeling
a
great
deal
worse
than
i
have
ever
done
since
*punct* ,
even
from
the
greatest
subsequent
misfortunes
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
i
must
have
fallen
into
a
troubled
nightmare
of
a
doze
*punct* ;
and
slowly
waking
from
it
*punct* ,
half
steeped
in
dreams
*punct* ,
i
opened
my
eyes
*punct* ,
and
the
before
sun-lit
room
was
now
wrapped
in
outer
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
instantly
i
felt
a
shock
running
through
all
my
frame
*punct* ;
nothing
was
to
be
seen
*punct* ,
and
nothing
was
to
be
heard
*punct* ;
but
a
supernatural
hand
seemed
placed
in
mine
*punct* .
*break*
my
arm
hung
over
the
counterpane
*punct* ,
and
the
nameless
*punct* ,
unimaginable
*punct* ,
silent
form
or
phantom
*punct* ,
to
which
the
hand
belonged
*punct* ,
seemed
closely
seated
by
my
bedside
*punct* .
*break*
for
what
seemed
ages
piled
on
ages
*punct* ,
i
lay
there
*punct* ,
frozen
with
the
most
awful
fears
*punct* ,
not
daring
to
drag
away
my
hand
*punct* ;
yet
ever
thinking
that
if
i
could
but
stir
it
one
single
inch
*punct* ,
the
horrid
spell
would
be
broken
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
not
how
this
consciousness
at
last
glided
away
from
me
*punct* ;
but
waking
in
the
morning
*punct* ,
i
shudderingly
remembered
it
all
*punct* ,
and
for
days
and
weeks
and
months
afterwards
i
lost
myself
in
confounding
attempts
to
explain
the
mystery
*punct* .
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
to
this
very
hour
*punct* ,
i
often
puzzle
myself
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
take
away
the
awful
fear
*punct* ,
and
my
sensations
at
feeling
the
supernatural
hand
in
mine
were
very
similar
*punct* ,
in
their
strangeness
*punct* ,
to
those
which
i
experienced
on
waking
up
and
seeing
queequeg's
pagan
arm
thrown
round
me
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
length
all
the
past
night's
events
soberly
recurred
*punct* ,
one
by
one
*punct* ,
in
fixed
reality
*punct* ,
and
then
i
lay
only
alive
to
the
comical
predicament
*punct* .
*break*
for
though
i
tried
to
move
his
arm
*punct* ,
unlock
his
bridegroom
clasp
*punct* ,
yet
*punct* ,
sleeping
as
he
was
*punct* ,
he
still
hugged
me
tightly
*punct* ,
as
though
naught
but
death
should
part
us
twain
*punct* .
*break*
i
then
rolled
over
*punct* ,
my
neck
feeling
as
if
it
were
in
a
horse-collar
*punct* ;
and
suddenly
felt
a
slight
scratch
*punct* .
*break*
throwing
aside
the
counterpane
*punct* ,
there
lay
the
tomahawk
sleeping
by
the
savage's
side
*punct* ,
as
if
it
were
a
hatchet-faced
baby
*punct* .
*break*
a
pretty
pickle
*punct* ,
truly
*punct* ,
thought
i
*punct* ;
abed
here
in
a
strange
house
in
the
broad
day
*punct* ,
with
a
cannibal
and
a
tomahawk
*punct* !
*break*
queequeg!
*punct* ,
in
the
name
of
goodness
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
wake
*punct* !
*break*
at
length
*punct* ,
by
dint
of
much
wriggling
*punct* ,
and
loud
and
incessant
expostulations
upon
the
unbecomingness
of
his
hugging
a
fellow
male
in
that
matrimonial
sort
of
style
*punct* ,
i
succeeded
in
extracting
a
grunt
*punct* ;
and
presently
*punct* ,
he
drew
back
his
arm
*punct* ,
shook
himself
all
over
like
a
newfoundland
dog
just
from
the
water
*punct* ,
and
sat
up
in
bed
*punct* ,
stiff
as
a
pike-staff
*punct* ,
looking
at
me
*punct* ,
and
rubbing
his
eyes
as
if
he
did
not
altogether
remember
how
i
came
to
be
there
*punct* ,
though
a
dim
consciousness
of
knowing
something
about
me
seemed
slowly
dawning
over
him
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
*punct* ,
i
lay
quietly
eyeing
him
*punct* ,
having
no
serious
misgivings
now
*punct* ,
and
bent
upon
narrowly
observing
so
curious
a
creature
*punct* .
*break*
when
*punct* ,
at
last
*punct* ,
his
mind
seemed
made
up
touching
the
character
of
his
bedfellow
*punct* ,
and
he
became
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ,
reconciled
to
the
fact
*punct* ;
he
jumped
out
upon
the
floor
*punct* ,
and
by
certain
signs
and
sounds
gave
me
to
understand
that
*punct* ,
if
it
pleased
me
*punct* ,
he
would
dress
first
and
then
leave
me
to
dress
afterwards
*punct* ,
leaving
the
whole
apartment
to
myself
*punct* .
*break*
thinks
i
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
under
the
circumstances
*punct* ,
this
is
a
very
civilized
overture
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
the
truth
is
*punct* ,
these
savages
have
an
innate
sense
of
delicacy
*punct* ,
say
what
you
will
*punct* ;
it
is
marvellous
how
essentially
polite
they
are
*punct* .
*break*
i
pay
this
particular
compliment
to
queequeg
*punct* ,
because
he
treated
me
with
so
much
civility
and
consideration
*punct* ,
while
i
was
guilty
of
great
rudeness
*punct* ;
staring
at
him
from
the
bed
*punct* ,
and
watching
all
his
toilette
motions
*punct* ;
for
the
time
my
curiosity
getting
the
better
of
my
breeding
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
a
man
like
queequeg
you
don't
see
every
day
*punct* ,
he
and
his
ways
were
well
worth
unusual
regarding
*punct* .
*break*
he
commenced
dressing
at
top
by
donning
his
beaver
hat
*punct* ,
a
very
tall
one
*punct* ,
by
the
by
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
still
minus
his
trowsers
*punct* ,
he
hunted
up
his
boots
*punct* .
*break*
but
queequeg
*punct* ,
do
you
see
*punct* ,
was
a
creature
in
the
transition
state
*punct* ,
neither
caterpillar
nor
butterfly
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
just
enough
civilized
to
show
off
his
outlandishness
in
the
strangest
possible
manner
*punct* .
*break*
his
education
was
not
yet
completed
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
an
undergraduate
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
had
not
been
a
small
degree
civilized
*punct* ,
he
very
probably
would
not
have
troubled
himself
with
boots
at
all
*punct* ;
but
then
*punct* ,
if
he
had
not
been
still
a
savage
*punct* ,
he
never
would
have
dreamt
of
getting
under
the
bed
to
put
them
on
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
he
emerged
with
his
hat
very
much
dented
and
crushed
down
over
his
eyes
*punct* ,
and
began
creaking
and
limping
about
the
room
*punct* ,
as
if
*punct* ,
not
being
much
accustomed
to
boots
*punct* ,
his
pair
of
damp
*punct* ,
wrinkled
cowhide
ones
*punct* ,
probably
not
made
to
order
either
*punct* ,
rather
pinched
and
tormented
him
at
the
first
go
off
of
a
bitter
cold
morning
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
that
there
were
no
curtains
to
the
window
*punct* ,
and
that
the
street
being
very
narrow
*punct* ,
the
house
opposite
commanded
a
plain
view
into
the
room
*punct* ,
and
observing
more
and
more
the
indecorous
figure
that
queequeg
made
*punct* ,
staving
about
with
little
else
but
his
hat
and
boots
on
*punct* ;
i
begged
him
as
well
as
i
could
*punct* ,
to
accelerate
his
toilet
somewhat
*punct* ,
and
particularly
to
get
into
his
pantaloons
as
soon
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
he
complied
*punct* ,
and
then
proceeded
to
wash
himself
*punct* .
*break*
at
that
time
in
the
morning
any
christian
would
have
washed
his
face
*punct* ;
but
queequeg
*punct* ,
to
my
amazement
*punct* ,
contented
himself
with
restricting
his
ablutions
to
his
chest
*punct* ,
arms
*punct* ,
and
hands
*punct* .
*break*
he
then
donned
his
waistcoat
*punct* ,
and
taking
up
a
piece
of
hard
soap
on
the
wash-stand
centre-table
*punct* ,
dipped
it
into
water
and
commenced
lathering
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
watching
to
see
where
he
kept
his
razor
*punct* ,
when
lo
and
behold
*punct* ,
he
takes
the
harpoon
from
the
bed
corner
*punct* ,
slips
out
the
long
wooden
stock
*punct* ,
unsheathes
the
head
*punct* ,
whets
it
a
little
on
his
boot
*punct* ,
and
striding
up
to
the
bit
of
mirror
against
the
wall
*punct* ,
begins
a
vigorous
scraping
*punct* ,
or
rather
harpooning
of
his
cheeks
*punct* .
*break*
thinks
i
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
this
is
using
rogers's
best
cutlery
with
a
vengeance
*punct* .
*break*
i
cherished
no
malice
towards
him
*punct* ,
though
he
had
been
skylarking
with
me
not
a
little
in
the
matter
of
my
bedfellow
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
a
good
laugh
is
a
mighty
good
thing
*punct* ,
and
rather
too
scarce
a
good
thing
*punct* ;
the
more's
the
pity
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
if
any
one
man
*punct* ,
in
his
own
proper
person
*punct* ,
afford
stuff
for
a
good
joke
to
anybody
*punct* ,
let
him
not
be
backward
*punct* ,
but
let
him
cheerfully
allow
himself
to
spend
and
be
spent
in
that
way
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
man
that
has
anything
bountifully
laughable
about
him
*punct* ,
be
sure
there
is
more
in
that
man
than
you
perhaps
think
for
*punct* .
*break*
the
bar-room
was
now
full
of
the
boarders
who
had
been
dropping
in
the
night
previous
*punct* ,
and
whom
i
had
not
as
yet
had
a
good
look
at
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
nearly
all
whalemen
*punct* ;
chief
mates
*punct* ,
and
second
mates
*punct* ,
and
third
mates
*punct* ,
and
sea
carpenters
*punct* ,
and
sea
coopers
*punct* ,
and
sea
blacksmiths
*punct* ,
and
harpooneers
*punct* ,
and
ship
keepers
*punct* ;
a
brown
and
brawny
company
*punct* ,
with
bosky
beards
*punct* ;
an
unshorn
*punct* ,
shaggy
set
*punct* ,
all
wearing
monkey
jackets
for
morning
gowns
*punct* .
*break*
you
could
pretty
plainly
tell
how
long
each
one
had
been
ashore
*punct* .
*break*
this
young
fellow's
healthy
cheek
is
like
a
sun-toasted
pear
in
hue
*punct* ,
and
would
seem
to
smell
almost
as
musky
*punct* ;
he
cannot
have
been
three
days
landed
from
his
indian
voyage
*punct* .
*break*
that
man
next
him
looks
a
few
shades
lighter
*punct* ;
you
might
say
a
touch
of
satin
wood
is
in
him
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
complexion
of
a
third
still
lingers
a
tropic
tawn
*punct* ,
but
slightly
bleached
withal
*punct* ;
he
doubtless
has
tarried
whole
weeks
ashore
*punct* .
*break*
which
*punct* ,
barred
with
various
tints
*punct* ,
seemed
like
the
andes
western
slope
*punct* ,
to
show
forth
in
one
array
*punct* ,
contrasting
climates
*punct* ,
zone
by
zone
*punct* .
*break*
grub
*punct* ,
ho
*punct* !
*break*
now
cried
the
landlord
*punct* ,
flinging
open
a
door
*punct* ,
and
in
we
went
to
breakfast
*punct* .
*break*
they
say
that
men
who
have
seen
the
world
*punct* ,
thereby
become
quite
at
ease
in
manner
*punct* ,
quite
self-possessed
in
company
*punct* .
*break*
not
always
*punct* ,
though
*punct* :
ledyard
*punct* ,
the
great
new
england
traveller
*punct* ,
and
mungo
park
*punct* ,
the
scotch
one
*punct* ;
of
all
men
*punct* ,
they
possessed
the
least
assurance
in
the
parlor
*punct* .
*break*
but
perhaps
the
mere
crossing
of
siberia
in
a
sledge
drawn
by
dogs
as
ledyard
did
*punct* ,
or
the
taking
a
long
solitary
walk
on
an
empty
stomach
*punct* ,
in
the
negro
heart
of
africa
*punct* ,
which
was
the
sum
of
poor
mungo's
performances
*punct* ,
this
kind
of
travel
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
may
not
be
the
very
best
mode
of
attaining
a
high
social
polish
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
for
the
most
part
*punct* ,
that
sort
of
thing
is
to
be
had
anywhere
*punct* .
*break*
these
reflections
just
here
are
occasioned
by
the
circumstance
that
after
we
were
all
seated
at
the
table
*punct* ,
and
i
was
preparing
to
hear
some
good
stories
about
whaling
*punct* ;
to
my
no
small
surprise
*punct* ,
nearly
every
man
maintained
a
profound
silence
*punct* .
*break*
and
not
only
that
*punct* ,
but
they
looked
embarrassed
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
here
were
a
set
of
sea-dogs
*punct* ,
many
of
whom
without
the
slightest
bashfulness
had
boarded
great
whales
on
the
high
seas
*punct* ,
entire
strangers
to
them
*punct* ,
and
duelled
them
dead
without
winking
*punct* ;
and
yet
*punct* ,
here
they
sat
at
a
social
breakfast
table
*punct* ,
all
of
the
same
calling
*punct* ,
all
of
kindred
tastes
*punct* ,
looking
round
as
sheepishly
at
each
other
as
though
they
had
never
been
out
of
sight
of
some
sheepfold
among
the
green
mountains
*punct* .
*break*
a
curious
sight
*punct* ;
these
bashful
bears
*punct* ,
these
timid
warrior
whalemen
*punct* !
*break*
but
as
for
queequeg
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
queequeg
sat
there
among
them
*punct* ,
at
the
head
of
the
table
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
it
so
chanced
*punct* ;
as
cool
as
an
icicle
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
sure
i
cannot
say
much
for
his
breeding
*punct* .
*break*
his
greatest
admirer
could
not
have
cordially
justified
his
bringing
his
harpoon
into
breakfast
with
him
*punct* ,
and
using
it
there
without
ceremony
*punct* ;
reaching
over
the
table
with
it
*punct* ,
to
the
imminent
jeopardy
of
many
heads
*punct* ,
and
grappling
the
beefsteaks
towards
him
*punct* .
*break*
we
will
not
speak
of
all
queequeg's
peculiarities
here
*punct* ;
how
he
eschewed
coffee
and
hot
rolls
*punct* ,
and
applied
his
undivided
attention
to
beefsteaks
*punct* ,
done
rare
*punct* .
*break*
in
thoroughfares
nigh
the
docks
*punct* ,
any
considerable
seaport
will
frequently
offer
to
view
the
queerest
looking
nondescripts
from
foreign
parts
*punct* .
*break*
even
in
broadway
and
chestnut
streets
*punct* ,
mediterranean
mariners
will
sometimes
jostle
the
affrighted
ladies
*punct* .
*break*
regent
street
is
not
unknown
to
lascars
and
malays
*punct* ;
and
at
bombay
*punct* ,
in
the
apollo
green
*punct* ,
live
yankees
have
often
scared
the
natives
*punct* .
*break*
but
new
bedford
beats
all
water
street
and
wapping
*punct* .
*break*
in
these
last-mentioned
haunts
you
see
only
sailors
*punct* ;
but
in
new
bedford
*punct* ,
actual
cannibals
stand
chatting
at
street
corners
*punct* ;
savages
outright
*punct* ;
many
of
whom
yet
carry
on
their
bones
unholy
flesh
*punct* .
*break*
it
makes
a
stranger
stare
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
mostly
young
*punct* ,
of
stalwart
frames
*punct* ;
fellows
who
have
felled
forests
*punct* ,
and
now
seek
to
drop
the
axe
and
snatch
the
whale-lance
*punct* .
*break*
many
are
as
green
as
the
green
mountains
whence
they
came
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
things
you
would
think
them
but
a
few
hours
old
*punct* .
*break*
that
chap
strutting
round
the
corner
*punct* .
*break*
he
wears
a
beaver
hat
and
swallow-tailed
coat
*punct* ,
girdled
with
a
sailor-belt
and
sheath-knife
*punct* .
*break*
here
comes
another
with
a
sou'-wester
and
a
bombazine
cloak
*punct* .
*break*
no
town-bred
dandy
will
compare
with
a
country-bred
one
*punct* ,
i
mean
a
downright
bumpkin
dandy
*punct* ,
a
fellow
that
*punct* ,
in
the
dog-days
*punct* ,
will
mow
his
two
acres
in
buckskin
gloves
for
fear
of
tanning
his
hands
*punct* .
*break*
now
when
a
country
dandy
like
this
takes
it
into
his
head
to
make
a
distinguished
reputation
*punct* ,
and
joins
the
great
whale-fishery
*punct* ,
you
should
see
the
comical
things
he
does
upon
reaching
the
seaport
*punct* .
*break*
in
bespeaking
his
sea-outfit
*punct* ,
he
orders
bell-buttons
to
his
waistcoats
*punct* ;
straps
to
his
canvas
trowsers
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
poor
hay-seed
*punct* !
*break*
how
bitterly
will
burst
those
straps
in
the
first
howling
gale
*punct* ,
when
thou
art
driven
*punct* ,
straps
*punct* ,
buttons
*punct* ,
and
all
*punct* ,
down
the
throat
of
the
tempest
*punct* .
*break*
but
think
not
that
this
famous
town
has
only
harpooneers
*punct* ,
cannibals
*punct* ,
and
bumpkins
to
show
her
visitors
*punct* .
*break*
not
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
still
new
bedford
is
a
queer
place
*punct* .
*break*
had
it
not
been
for
us
whalemen
*punct* ,
that
tract
of
land
would
this
day
perhaps
have
been
in
as
howling
condition
as
the
coast
of
labrador
*punct* .
*break*
as
it
is
*punct* ,
parts
of
her
back
country
are
enough
to
frighten
one
*punct* ,
they
look
so
bony
*punct* .
*break*
the
town
itself
is
perhaps
the
dearest
place
to
live
in
*punct* ,
in
all
new
england
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
land
of
oil
*punct* ,
true
enough
*punct* ;
but
not
like
canaan
*punct* ;
a
land
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
of
corn
and
wine
*punct* .
*break*
the
streets
do
not
run
with
milk
*punct* ;
nor
in
the
spring-time
do
they
pave
them
with
fresh
eggs
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
this
*punct* ,
nowhere
in
all
america
will
you
find
more
patrician-like
houses
*punct* ;
parks
and
gardens
more
opulent
*punct* ,
than
in
new
bedford
*punct* .
*break*
whence
came
they
*punct* ?
*break*
how
planted
upon
this
once
scraggy
scoria
of
a
country
*punct* ?
*break*
go
and
gaze
upon
the
iron
emblematical
harpoons
round
yonder
lofty
mansion
*punct* ,
and
your
question
will
be
answered
*punct* .
*break*
one
and
all
*punct* ,
they
were
harpooned
and
dragged
up
hither
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
can
herr
alexander
perform
a
feat
like
that
*punct* ?
*break*
in
new
bedford
*punct* ,
fathers
*punct* ,
they
say
*punct* ,
give
whales
for
dowers
to
their
daughters
*punct* ,
and
portion
off
their
nieces
with
a
few
porpoises
a-piece
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
go
to
new
bedford
to
see
a
brilliant
wedding
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
they
say
*punct* ,
they
have
reservoirs
of
oil
in
every
house
*punct* ,
and
every
night
recklessly
burn
their
lengths
in
spermaceti
candles
*punct* .
*break*
in
summer
time
*punct* ,
the
town
is
sweet
to
see
*punct* ;
full
of
fine
maples
*punct* ,
long
avenues
of
green
and
gold
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
august
*punct* ,
high
in
air
*punct* ,
the
beautiful
and
bountiful
horse-chestnuts
*punct* ,
candelabra-wise
*punct* ,
proffer
the
passer-by
their
tapering
upright
cones
of
congregated
blossoms
*punct* .
*break*
so
omnipotent
is
art
*punct* ;
which
in
many
a
district
of
new
bedford
has
superinduced
bright
terraces
of
flowers
upon
the
barren
refuse
rocks
thrown
aside
at
creation's
final
day
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
women
of
new
bedford
*punct* ,
they
bloom
like
their
own
red
roses
*punct* .
*break*
but
roses
only
bloom
in
summer
*punct* ;
whereas
the
fine
carnation
of
their
cheeks
is
perennial
as
sunlight
in
the
seventh
heavens
*punct* .
*break*
elsewhere
match
that
bloom
of
theirs
*punct* ,
ye
cannot
*punct* ,
save
in
salem
*punct* ,
where
they
tell
me
the
young
girls
breathe
such
musk
*punct* ,
their
sailor
sweethearts
smell
them
miles
off
shore
*punct* ,
as
though
they
were
drawing
nigh
the
odorous
moluccas
instead
of
the
puritanic
sands
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
same
new
bedford
there
stands
a
whaleman's
chapel
*punct* ,
and
few
are
the
moody
fishermen
*punct* ,
shortly
bound
for
the
indian
ocean
or
pacific
*punct* ,
who
fail
to
make
a
sunday
visit
to
the
spot
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
sure
that
i
did
not
*punct* .
*break*
returning
from
my
first
morning
stroll
*punct* ,
i
again
sallied
out
upon
this
special
errand
*punct* .
*break*
wrapping
myself
in
my
shaggy
jacket
of
the
cloth
called
bearskin
*punct* ,
i
fought
my
way
against
the
stubborn
storm
*punct* .
*break*
entering
*punct* ,
i
found
a
small
scattered
congregation
of
sailors
*punct* ,
and
sailors
wives
and
widows
*punct* .
*break*
a
muffled
silence
reigned
*punct* ,
only
broken
at
times
by
the
shrieks
of
the
storm
*punct* .
*break*
each
silent
worshipper
seemed
purposely
sitting
apart
from
the
other
*punct* ,
as
if
each
silent
grief
were
insular
and
incommunicable
*punct* .
*break*
the
chaplain
had
not
yet
arrived
*punct* ;
and
there
these
silent
islands
of
men
and
women
sat
steadfastly
eyeing
several
marble
tablets
*punct* ,
with
black
borders
*punct* ,
masoned
into
the
wall
on
either
side
the
pulpit
*punct* .
*break*
this
tablet
is
erected
to
his
memory
by
his
sister
*punct* .
*break*
shaking
off
the
sleet
from
my
ice-glazed
hat
and
jacket
*punct* ,
i
seated
myself
near
the
door
*punct* ,
and
turning
sideways
was
surprised
to
see
queequeg
near
me
*punct* .
*break*
affected
by
the
solemnity
of
the
scene
*punct* ,
there
was
a
wondering
gaze
of
incredulous
curiosity
in
his
countenance
*punct* .
*break*
this
savage
was
the
only
person
present
who
seemed
to
notice
my
entrance
*punct* ;
because
he
was
the
only
one
who
could
not
read
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
was
not
reading
those
frigid
inscriptions
on
the
wall
*punct* .
*break*
whether
any
of
the
relatives
of
the
seamen
whose
names
appeared
there
were
now
among
the
congregation
*punct* ,
i
knew
not
*punct* ;
but
so
many
are
the
unrecorded
accidents
in
the
fishery
*punct* ,
and
so
plainly
did
several
women
present
wear
the
countenance
if
not
the
trappings
of
some
unceasing
grief
*punct* ,
that
i
feel
sure
that
here
before
me
were
assembled
those
*punct* ,
in
whose
unhealing
hearts
the
sight
of
those
bleak
tablets
sympathetically
caused
the
old
wounds
to
bleed
afresh
*punct* .
*break*
ye
whose
dead
lie
buried
beneath
the
green
grass
*punct* ;
who
standing
among
flowers
can
say
*punct* ,
here
*punct* ,
here
lies
my
beloved
*punct* ;
ye
know
not
the
desolation
that
broods
in
bosoms
like
these
*punct* .
*break*
what
bitter
blanks
in
those
black-bordered
marbles
which
cover
no
ashes
*punct* !
*break*
what
despair
in
those
immovable
inscriptions
*punct* !
*break*
what
deadly
voids
and
unbidden
infidelities
in
the
lines
that
seem
to
gnaw
upon
all
faith
*punct* ,
and
refuse
resurrections
to
the
beings
who
have
placelessly
perished
without
a
grave
*punct* .
*break*
as
well
might
those
tablets
stand
in
the
cave
of
elephanta
as
here
*punct* .
*break*
all
these
things
are
not
without
their
meanings
*punct* .
*break*
but
faith
*punct* ,
like
a
jackal
*punct* ,
feeds
among
the
tombs
*punct* ,
and
even
from
these
dead
doubts
she
gathers
her
most
vital
hope
*punct* .
*break*
it
needs
scarcely
to
be
told
*punct* ,
with
what
feelings
*punct* ,
on
the
eve
of
a
nantucket
voyage
*punct* ,
i
regarded
those
marble
tablets
*punct* ,
and
by
the
murky
light
of
that
darkened
*punct* ,
doleful
day
read
the
fate
of
the
whalemen
who
had
gone
before
me
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
ishmael
*punct* ,
the
same
fate
may
be
thine
*punct* .
*break*
but
somehow
i
grew
merry
again
*punct* .
*break*
delightful
inducements
to
embark
*punct* ,
fine
chance
for
promotion
*punct* ,
it
seems
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
a
stove
boat
will
make
me
an
immortal
by
brevet
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
there
is
death
in
this
business
of
whaling
*punct* ,
a
speechlessly
quick
chaotic
bundling
of
a
man
into
eternity
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
then
*punct* ?
*break*
methinks
we
have
hugely
mistaken
this
matter
of
life
and
death
*punct* .
*break*
methinks
that
what
they
call
my
shadow
here
on
earth
is
my
true
substance
*punct* .
*break*
methinks
that
in
looking
at
things
spiritual
*punct* ,
we
are
too
much
like
oysters
observing
the
sun
through
the
water
*punct* ,
and
thinking
that
thick
water
the
thinnest
of
air
*punct* .
*break*
methinks
my
body
is
but
the
lees
of
my
better
being
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
take
my
body
who
will
*punct* ,
take
it
i
say
*punct* ,
it
is
not
me
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
it
was
the
famous
father
mapple
*punct* ,
so
called
by
the
whalemen
*punct* ,
among
whom
he
was
a
very
great
favorite
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
a
sailor
and
a
harpooneer
in
his
youth
*punct* ,
but
for
many
years
past
had
dedicated
his
life
to
the
ministry
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
time
i
now
write
of
*punct* ,
father
mapple
was
in
the
hardy
winter
of
a
healthy
old
age
*punct* ;
that
sort
of
old
age
which
seems
merging
into
a
second
flowering
youth
*punct* ,
for
among
all
the
fissures
of
his
wrinkles
*punct* ,
there
shone
certain
mild
gleams
of
a
newly
developing
bloom
*punct* ,
the
spring
verdure
peeping
forth
even
beneath
february's
snow
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
having
previously
heard
his
history
*punct* ,
could
for
the
first
time
behold
father
mapple
without
the
utmost
interest
*punct* ,
because
there
were
certain
engrafted
clerical
peculiarities
about
him
*punct* ,
imputable
to
that
adventurous
maritime
life
he
had
led
*punct* .
*break*
when
he
entered
i
observed
that
he
carried
no
umbrella
*punct* ,
and
certainly
had
not
come
in
his
carriage
*punct* ,
for
his
tarpaulin
hat
ran
down
with
melting
sleet
*punct* ,
and
his
great
pilot
cloth
jacket
seemed
almost
to
drag
him
to
the
floor
with
the
weight
of
the
water
it
had
absorbed
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
hat
and
coat
and
overshoes
were
one
by
one
removed
*punct* ,
and
hung
up
in
a
little
space
in
an
adjacent
corner
*punct* ;
when
*punct* ,
arrayed
in
a
decent
suit
*punct* ,
he
quietly
approached
the
pulpit
*punct* .
*break*
the
wife
of
a
whaling
captain
had
provided
the
chapel
with
a
handsome
pair
of
red
worsted
man-ropes
for
this
ladder
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
being
itself
nicely
headed
*punct* ,
and
stained
with
a
mahogany
color
*punct* ,
the
whole
contrivance
*punct* ,
considering
what
manner
of
chapel
it
was
*punct* ,
seemed
by
no
means
in
bad
taste
*punct* .
*break*
halting
for
an
instant
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
*punct* ,
and
with
both
hands
grasping
the
ornamental
knobs
of
the
man-ropes
*punct* ,
father
mapple
cast
a
look
upwards
*punct* ,
and
then
with
a
truly
sailorlike
but
still
reverential
dexterity
*punct* ,
hand
over
hand
*punct* ,
mounted
the
steps
as
if
ascending
the
main-top
of
his
vessel
*punct* .
*break*
the
perpendicular
parts
of
this
side
ladder
*punct* ,
as
is
usually
the
case
with
swinging
ones
*punct* ,
were
of
cloth-covered
rope
*punct* ,
only
the
rounds
were
of
wood
*punct* ,
so
that
at
every
step
there
was
a
joint
*punct* .
*break*
at
my
first
glimpse
of
the
pulpit
*punct* ,
it
had
not
escaped
me
that
however
convenient
for
a
ship
*punct* ,
these
joints
in
the
present
instance
seemed
unnecessary
*punct* .
*break*
for
i
was
not
prepared
to
see
father
mapple
after
gaining
the
height
*punct* ,
slowly
turn
round
*punct* ,
and
stooping
over
the
pulpit
*punct* ,
deliberately
drag
up
the
ladder
step
by
step
*punct* ,
till
the
whole
was
deposited
within
*punct* ,
leaving
him
impregnable
in
his
little
quebec
*punct* .
*break*
i
pondered
some
time
without
fully
comprehending
the
reason
for
this
*punct* .
*break*
father
mapple
enjoyed
such
a
wide
reputation
for
sincerity
and
sanctity
*punct* ,
that
i
could
not
suspect
him
of
courting
notoriety
by
any
mere
tricks
of
the
stage
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
thought
i
*punct* ,
there
must
be
some
sober
reason
for
this
thing
*punct* ;
furthermore
*punct* ,
it
must
symbolize
something
unseen
*punct* .
*break*
can
it
be
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
that
by
that
act
of
physical
isolation
*punct* ,
he
signifies
his
spiritual
withdrawal
for
the
time
*punct* ,
from
all
outward
worldly
ties
and
connexions
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
for
replenished
with
the
meat
and
wine
of
the
word
*punct* ,
to
the
faithful
man
of
god
*punct* ,
this
pulpit
*punct* ,
i
see
*punct* ,
is
a
self-containing
stronghold
*punct* ,
a
lofty
ehrenbreitstein
*punct* ,
with
a
perennial
well
of
water
within
the
walls
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
side
ladder
was
not
the
only
strange
feature
of
the
place
*punct* ,
borrowed
from
the
chaplain's
former
sea-farings
*punct* .
*break*
between
the
marble
cenotaphs
on
either
hand
of
the
pulpit
*punct* ,
the
wall
which
formed
its
back
was
adorned
with
a
large
painting
representing
a
gallant
ship
beating
against
a
terrible
storm
off
a
lee
coast
of
black
rocks
and
snowy
breakers
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
noble
ship
*punct* ,
the
angel
seemed
to
say
*punct* ,
beat
on
*punct* ,
beat
on
*punct* ,
thou
noble
ship
*punct* ,
and
bear
a
hardy
helm
*punct* ;
for
lo
*punct* !
*break*
the
sun
is
breaking
through
*punct* ;
the
clouds
are
rolling
off
*punct* ,
serenest
azure
is
at
hand
*punct* .
*break*
nor
was
the
pulpit
itself
without
a
trace
of
the
same
sea-taste
that
had
achieved
the
ladder
and
the
picture
*punct* .
*break*
its
panelled
front
was
in
the
likeness
of
a
ship's
bluff
bows
*punct* ,
and
the
holy
bible
rested
on
the
projecting
piece
of
scroll
work
*punct* ,
fashioned
after
a
ship's
fiddle-headed
beak
*punct* .
*break*
what
could
be
more
full
of
meaning?
*punct* ,
for
the
pulpit
is
ever
this
earth's
foremost
part
*punct* ;
all
the
rest
comes
in
its
rear
*punct* ;
the
pulpit
leads
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
from
thence
it
is
the
storm
of
god's
quick
wrath
is
first
descried
*punct* ,
and
the
bow
must
bear
the
earliest
brunt
*punct* .
*break*
from
thence
it
is
the
god
of
breezes
fair
or
foul
is
first
invoked
for
favorable
winds
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
the
world's
a
ship
on
its
passage
out
*punct* ,
and
not
a
voyage
complete
*punct* ;
and
the
pulpit
is
its
prow
*punct* .
*break*
father
mapple
rose
*punct* ,
and
in
a
mild
voice
of
unassuming
authority
ordered
the
scattered
people
to
condense
*punct* .
*break*
starboard
gangway
*punct* ,
there
*punct* !
*break*
side
away
to
larboard
*punct* ,
larboard
gangway
to
starboard
*punct* !
*break*
there
was
a
low
rumbling
of
heavy
sea-boots
among
the
benches
*punct* ,
and
a
still
slighter
shuffling
of
women's
shoes
*punct* ,
and
all
was
quiet
again
*punct* ,
and
every
eye
on
the
preacher
*punct* .
*break*
this
ended
*punct* ,
in
prolonged
solemn
tones
*punct* ,
like
the
continual
tolling
of
a
bell
in
a
ship
that
is
foundering
at
sea
in
a
fog
*punct* ,
in
such
tones
he
commenced
reading
the
following
hymn
*punct* ;
but
changing
his
manner
towards
the
concluding
stanzas
*punct* ,
burst
forth
with
a
pealing
exultation
and
joy
*punct* ,
the
ribs
and
terrors
in
the
whale
*punct* ,
arched
over
me
a
dismal
gloom
*punct* ,
while
all
god's
sun-lit
waves
rolled
by
*punct* ,
and
lift
me
deepening
down
to
doom
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
the
opening
maw
of
hell
*punct* ,
with
endless
pains
and
sorrows
there
*punct* ;
which
none
but
they
that
feel
can
tell
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
i
was
plunging
to
despair
*punct* .
*break*
in
black
distress
*punct* ,
i
called
my
god
*punct* ,
when
i
could
scarce
believe
him
mine
*punct* ,
he
bowed
his
ear
to
my
complaints
*punct* ,
no
more
the
whale
did
me
confine
*punct* .
*break*
with
speed
he
flew
to
my
relief
*punct* ,
as
on
a
radiant
dolphin
borne
*punct* ;
awful
*punct* ,
yet
bright
*punct* ,
as
lightning
shone
the
face
of
my
deliverer
god
*punct* .
*break*
my
song
for
ever
shall
record
that
terrible
*punct* ,
that
joyful
hour
*punct* ;
i
give
the
glory
to
my
god
*punct* ,
his
all
the
mercy
and
the
power
*punct* .
*break*
nearly
all
joined
in
singing
this
hymn
*punct* ,
which
swelled
high
above
the
howling
of
the
storm
*punct* .
*break*
a
brief
pause
ensued
*punct* ;
the
preacher
slowly
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
bible
*punct* ,
and
at
last
*punct* ,
folding
his
hand
down
upon
the
proper
page
*punct* ,
said
*punct* :
beloved
shipmates
*punct* ,
clinch
the
last
verse
of
the
first
chapter
of
jonah
*punct* ,
and
god
had
prepared
a
great
fish
to
swallow
up
jonah
*punct* .
*break*
shipmates
*punct* ,
this
book
*punct* ,
containing
only
four
chapters
*punct* ,
four
yarns
*punct* ,
is
one
of
the
smallest
strands
in
the
mighty
cable
of
the
scriptures
*punct* .
*break*
yet
what
depths
of
the
soul
does
jonah's
deep
sealine
sound
*punct* !
*break*
what
a
pregnant
lesson
to
us
is
this
prophet
*punct* !
*break*
how
billow-like
and
boisterously
grand
*punct* !
*break*
we
feel
the
floods
surging
over
us
*punct* ;
we
sound
with
him
to
the
kelpy
bottom
of
the
waters
*punct* ;
sea-weed
and
all
the
slime
of
the
sea
is
about
us
*punct* !
*break*
but
what
is
this
lesson
that
the
book
of
jonah
teaches
*punct* ?
*break*
shipmates
*punct* ,
it
is
a
two-stranded
lesson
*punct* ;
a
lesson
to
us
all
as
sinful
men
*punct* ,
and
a
lesson
to
me
as
a
pilot
of
the
living
god
*punct* .
*break*
as
sinful
men
*punct* ,
it
is
a
lesson
to
us
all
*punct* ,
because
it
is
a
story
of
the
sin
*punct* ,
hard-heartedness
*punct* ,
suddenly
awakened
fears
*punct* ,
the
swift
punishment
*punct* ,
repentance
*punct* ,
prayers
*punct* ,
and
finally
the
deliverance
and
joy
of
jonah
*punct* .
*break*
as
with
all
sinners
among
men
*punct* ,
the
sin
of
this
son
of
amittai
was
in
his
wilful
disobedience
of
the
command
of
god
*punct* ,
never
mind
now
what
that
command
was
*punct* ,
or
how
conveyed
*punct* ,
which
he
found
a
hard
command
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
the
things
that
god
would
have
us
do
are
hard
for
us
to
do
*punct* ,
remember
that
*punct* ,
and
hence
*punct* ,
he
oftener
commands
us
than
endeavors
to
persuade
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
we
obey
god
*punct* ,
we
must
disobey
ourselves
*punct* ;
and
it
is
in
this
disobeying
ourselves
*punct* ,
wherein
the
hardness
of
obeying
god
consists
*punct* .
*break*
with
this
sin
of
disobedience
in
him
*punct* ,
jonah
still
further
flouts
at
god
*punct* ,
by
seeking
to
flee
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
thinks
that
a
ship
made
by
men
*punct* ,
will
carry
him
into
countries
where
god
does
not
reign
*punct* ,
but
only
the
captains
of
this
earth
*punct* .
*break*
he
skulks
about
the
wharves
of
joppa
*punct* ,
and
seeks
a
ship
that's
bound
for
tarshish
*punct* .
*break*
there
lurks
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
a
hitherto
unheeded
meaning
here
*punct* .
*break*
by
all
accounts
tarshish
could
have
been
no
other
city
than
the
modern
cadiz
*punct* .
*break*
that's
the
opinion
of
learned
men
*punct* .
*break*
and
where
is
cadiz
*punct* ,
shipmates
*punct* ?
*break*
cadiz
is
in
spain
*punct* ;
as
far
by
water
*punct* ,
from
joppa
*punct* ,
as
jonah
could
possibly
have
sailed
in
those
ancient
days
*punct* ,
when
the
atlantic
was
an
almost
unknown
sea
*punct* .
*break*
because
joppa
*punct* ,
the
modern
jaffa
*punct* ,
shipmates
*punct* ,
is
on
the
most
easterly
coast
of
the
mediterranean
*punct* ,
the
syrian
*punct* ;
and
tarshish
or
cadiz
more
than
two
thousand
miles
to
the
westward
from
that
*punct* ,
just
outside
the
straits
of
gibraltar
*punct* .
*break*
see
ye
not
then
*punct* ,
shipmates
*punct* ,
that
jonah
sought
to
flee
world-wide
from
god
*punct* ?
*break*
most
contemptible
and
worthy
of
all
scorn
*punct* ;
with
slouched
hat
and
guilty
eye
*punct* ,
skulking
from
his
god
*punct* ;
prowling
among
the
shipping
like
a
vile
burglar
hastening
to
cross
the
seas
*punct* .
*break*
how
plainly
he's
a
fugitive
*punct* !
*break*
no
baggage
*punct* ,
not
a
hat-box
*punct* ,
valise
*punct* ,
or
carpet-bag,
*punct* ,
no
friends
accompany
him
to
the
wharf
with
their
adieux
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
after
much
dodging
search
*punct* ,
he
finds
the
tarshish
ship
receiving
the
last
items
of
her
cargo
*punct* ;
and
as
he
steps
on
board
to
see
its
captain
in
the
cabin
*punct* ,
all
the
sailors
for
the
moment
desist
from
hoisting
in
the
goods
*punct* ,
to
mark
the
stranger's
evil
eye
*punct* .
*break*
jonah
sees
this
*punct* ;
but
in
vain
he
tries
to
look
all
ease
and
confidence
*punct* ;
in
vain
essays
his
wretched
smile
*punct* .
*break*
strong
intuitions
of
the
man
assure
the
mariners
he
can
be
no
innocent
*punct* .
*break*
in
their
gamesome
but
still
serious
way
*punct* ,
one
whispers
to
the
other
*punct* ,
jack
*punct* ,
he's
robbed
a
widow
*punct* ;
or,joe
*punct* ,
do
you
mark
him
*punct* ;
he's
a
bigamist
*punct* ;
or,harry
lad
*punct* ,
i
guess
he's
the
adulterer
that
broke
jail
in
old
gomorrah
*punct* ,
or
belike
*punct* ,
one
of
the
missing
murderers
from
sodom
*punct* .
*break*
another
runs
to
read
the
bill
that's
stuck
against
the
spile
upon
the
wharf
to
which
the
ship
is
moored
*punct* ,
offering
five
hundred
gold
coins
for
the
apprehension
of
a
parricide
*punct* ,
and
containing
a
description
of
his
person
*punct* .
*break*
he
reads
*punct* ,
and
looks
from
jonah
to
the
bill
*punct* ;
while
all
his
sympathetic
shipmates
now
crowd
round
jonah
*punct* ,
prepared
to
lay
their
hands
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
frighted
jonah
trembles
*punct* ,
and
summoning
all
his
boldness
to
his
face
*punct* ,
only
looks
so
much
the
more
a
coward
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
not
confess
himself
suspected
*punct* ;
but
that
itself
is
strong
suspicion
*punct* .
*break*
so
he
makes
the
best
of
it
*punct* ;
and
when
the
sailors
find
him
not
to
be
the
man
that
is
advertised
*punct* ,
they
let
him
pass
*punct* ,
and
he
descends
into
the
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
cries
the
captain
at
his
busy
desk
*punct* ,
hurriedly
making
out
his
papers
for
the
customs
*punct* ,
who's
there
*punct* ?
*break*
how
that
harmless
question
mangles
jonah
*punct* !
*break*
for
the
instant
he
almost
turns
to
flee
again
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
rallies
*punct* .
*break*
i
seek
a
passage
in
this
ship
to
tarshish
*punct* ;
how
soon
sail
ye
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
thus
far
the
busy
captain
had
not
looked
up
to
jonah
*punct* ,
though
the
man
now
stands
before
him
*punct* ;
but
no
sooner
does
he
hear
that
hollow
voice
*punct* ,
than
he
darts
a
scrutinizing
glance
*punct* .
*break*
we
sail
with
the
next
coming
tide
*punct* ,
at
last
he
slowly
answered
*punct* ,
still
intently
eyeing
him
*punct* .
*break*
no
sooner
*punct* ,
sir?
*punct* ,
soon
enough
for
any
honest
man
that
goes
a
passenger
*punct* .
*break*
jonah
*punct* ,
that's
another
stab
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
swiftly
calls
away
the
captain
from
that
scent
*punct* .
*break*
for
it
is
particularly
written
*punct* ,
shipmates
*punct* ,
as
if
it
were
a
thing
not
to
be
overlooked
in
this
history,that
he
paid
the
fare
thereof
ere
the
craft
did
sail
*punct* .
*break*
and
taken
with
the
context
*punct* ,
this
is
full
of
meaning
*punct* .
*break*
now
jonah's
captain
*punct* ,
shipmates
*punct* ,
was
one
whose
discernment
detects
crime
in
any
*punct* ,
but
whose
cupidity
exposes
it
only
in
the
penniless
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
world
*punct* ,
shipmates
*punct* ,
sin
that
pays
its
way
can
travel
freely
*punct* ,
and
without
a
passport
*punct* ;
whereas
virtue
*punct* ,
if
a
pauper
*punct* ,
is
stopped
at
all
frontiers
*punct* .
*break*
so
jonah's
captain
prepares
to
test
the
length
of
jonah's
purse
*punct* ,
ere
he
judge
him
openly
*punct* .
*break*
he
charges
him
thrice
the
usual
sum
*punct* ;
and
it's
assented
to
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
captain
knows
that
jonah
is
a
fugitive
*punct* ;
but
at
the
same
time
resolves
to
help
a
flight
that
paves
its
rear
with
gold
*punct* .
*break*
yet
when
jonah
fairly
takes
out
his
purse
*punct* ,
prudent
suspicions
still
molest
the
captain
*punct* .
*break*
he
rings
every
coin
to
find
a
counterfeit
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
forger
*punct* ,
any
way
*punct* ,
he
mutters
*punct* ;
and
jonah
is
put
down
for
his
passage
*punct* .
*break*
point
out
my
state-room
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
says
jonah
now
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
travel-weary
*punct* ;
i
need
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
thou
look'st
like
it
*punct* ,
says
the
captain
*punct* ,
there's
thy
room
*punct* .
*break*
jonah
enters
*punct* ,
and
would
lock
the
door
*punct* ,
but
the
lock
contains
no
key
*punct* .
*break*
hearing
him
foolishly
fumbling
there
*punct* ,
the
captain
laughs
lowly
to
himself
*punct* ,
and
mutters
something
about
the
doors
of
convicts
cells
being
never
allowed
to
be
locked
within
*punct* .
*break*
all
dressed
and
dusty
as
he
is
*punct* ,
jonah
throws
himself
into
his
berth
*punct* ,
and
finds
the
little
state-room
ceiling
almost
resting
on
his
forehead
*punct* .
*break*
the
air
is
close
*punct* ,
and
jonah
gasps
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
in
that
contracted
hole
*punct* ,
sunk
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
beneath
the
ship's
water-line
*punct* ,
jonah
feels
the
heralding
presentiment
of
that
stifling
hour
*punct* ,
when
the
whale
shall
hold
him
in
the
smallest
of
his
bowel's
wards
*punct* .
*break*
screwed
at
its
axis
against
the
side
*punct* ,
a
swinging
lamp
slightly
oscillates
in
jonah's
room
*punct* ;
and
the
ship
*punct* ,
heeling
over
towards
the
wharf
with
the
weight
of
the
last
bales
received
*punct* ,
the
lamp
*punct* ,
flame
and
all
*punct* ,
though
in
slight
motion
*punct* ,
still
maintains
a
permanent
obliquity
with
reference
to
the
room
*punct* ;
though
*punct* ,
in
truth
*punct* ,
infallibly
straight
itself
*punct* ,
it
but
made
obvious
the
false
*punct* ,
lying
levels
among
which
it
hung
*punct* .
*break*
the
lamp
alarms
and
frightens
jonah
*punct* ;
as
lying
in
his
berth
his
tormented
eyes
roll
round
the
place
*punct* ,
and
this
thus
far
successful
fugitive
finds
no
refuge
for
his
restless
glance
*punct* .
*break*
the
floor
*punct* ,
the
ceiling
*punct* ,
and
the
side
*punct* ,
are
all
awry
*punct* .
*break*
so
my
conscience
hangs
in
me
*punct* !
*break*
he
groans
*punct* ,
straight
upward
*punct* ,
so
it
burns
*punct* ;
but
the
chambers
of
my
soul
are
all
in
crookedness
*punct* !
*break*
like
one
who
after
a
night
of
drunken
revelry
hies
to
his
bed
*punct* ,
still
reeling
*punct* ,
but
with
conscience
yet
pricking
him
*punct* ,
as
the
plungings
of
the
roman
race-horse
but
so
much
the
more
strike
his
steel
tags
into
him
*punct* ;
as
one
who
in
that
miserable
plight
still
turns
and
turns
in
giddy
anguish
*punct* ,
praying
god
for
annihilation
until
the
fit
be
passed
*punct* ;
and
at
last
amid
the
whirl
of
woe
he
feels
*punct* ,
a
deep
stupor
steals
over
him
*punct* ,
as
over
the
man
who
bleeds
to
death
*punct* ,
for
conscience
is
the
wound
*punct* ,
and
there's
naught
to
staunch
it
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
after
sore
wrestlings
in
his
berth
*punct* ,
jonah's
prodigy
of
ponderous
misery
drags
him
drowning
down
to
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
the
time
of
tide
has
come
*punct* ;
the
ship
casts
off
her
cables
*punct* ;
and
from
the
deserted
wharf
the
uncheered
ship
for
tarshish
*punct* ,
all
careening
*punct* ,
glides
to
sea
*punct* .
*break*
that
ship
*punct* ,
my
friends
*punct* ,
was
the
first
of
recorded
smugglers
*punct* !
*break*
the
contraband
was
jonah
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
sea
rebels
*punct* ;
he
will
not
bear
the
wicked
burden
*punct* .
*break*
a
dreadful
storm
comes
on
*punct* ,
the
ship
is
like
to
break
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
when
the
boatswain
calls
all
hands
to
lighten
her
*punct* ;
when
boxes
*punct* ,
bales
*punct* ,
and
jars
are
clattering
overboard
*punct* ;
when
the
wind
is
shrieking
*punct* ,
and
the
men
are
yelling
*punct* ,
and
every
plank
thunders
with
trampling
feet
right
over
jonah's
head
*punct* ;
in
all
this
raging
tumult
*punct* ,
jonah
sleeps
his
hideous
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
he
sees
no
black
sky
and
raging
sea
*punct* ,
feels
not
the
reeling
timbers
*punct* ,
and
little
hears
he
or
heeds
he
the
far
rush
of
the
mighty
whale
*punct* ,
which
even
now
with
open
mouth
is
cleaving
the
seas
after
him
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
shipmates
*punct* ,
jonah
was
gone
down
into
the
sides
of
the
ship
*punct* ,
a
berth
in
the
cabin
as
i
have
taken
it
*punct* ,
and
was
fast
asleep
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
frightened
master
comes
to
him
*punct* ,
and
shrieks
in
his
dead
ear
*punct* ,
what
meanest
thou
*punct* ,
o
sleeper
*punct* !
*break*
startled
from
his
lethargy
by
that
direful
cry
*punct* ,
jonah
staggers
to
his
feet
*punct* ,
and
stumbling
to
the
deck
*punct* ,
grasps
a
shroud
*punct* ,
to
look
out
upon
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
that
moment
he
is
sprung
upon
by
a
panther
billow
leaping
over
the
bulwarks
*punct* .
*break*
wave
after
wave
thus
leaps
into
the
ship
*punct* ,
and
finding
no
speedy
vent
runs
roaring
fore
and
aft
*punct* ,
till
the
mariners
come
nigh
to
drowning
while
yet
afloat
*punct* .
*break*
terrors
upon
terrors
run
shouting
through
his
soul
*punct* .
*break*
in
all
his
cringing
attitudes
*punct* ,
the
god-fugitive
is
now
too
plainly
known
*punct* .
*break*
the
sailors
mark
him
*punct* ;
more
and
more
certain
grow
their
suspicions
of
him
*punct* ,
and
at
last
*punct* ,
fully
to
test
the
truth
*punct* ,
by
referring
the
whole
matter
to
high
heaven
*punct* ,
they
fall
to
casting
lots
*punct* ,
to
see
for
whose
cause
this
great
tempest
was
upon
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
lot
is
jonah's
*punct* ;
that
discovered
*punct* ,
then
how
furiously
they
mob
him
with
their
questions
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
thine
occupation
*punct* ?
*break*
whence
comest
thou
*punct* ?
*break*
but
mark
now
*punct* ,
my
shipmates
*punct* ,
the
behavior
of
poor
jonah
*punct* .
*break*
the
eager
mariners
but
ask
him
who
he
is
*punct* ,
and
where
from
*punct* ;
whereas
*punct* ,
they
not
only
receive
an
answer
to
those
questions
*punct* ,
but
likewise
another
answer
to
a
question
not
put
by
them
*punct* ,
but
the
unsolicited
answer
is
forced
from
jonah
by
the
hard
hand
of
god
that
is
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
a
hebrew
*punct* ,
he
cries
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
i
fear
the
lord
the
god
of
heaven
who
hath
made
the
sea
and
the
dry
land
*punct* !
*break*
fear
him
*punct* ,
o
jonah
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
well
mightest
thou
fear
the
lord
god
then
*punct* !
*break*
straightway
*punct* ,
he
now
goes
on
to
make
a
full
confession
*punct* ;
whereupon
the
mariners
became
more
and
more
appalled
*punct* ,
but
still
are
pitiful
*punct* .
*break*
for
when
jonah
*punct* ,
not
yet
supplicating
god
for
mercy
*punct* ,
since
he
but
too
well
knew
the
darkness
of
his
deserts,
*punct* ,
when
wretched
jonah
cries
out
to
them
to
take
him
and
cast
him
forth
into
the
sea
*punct* ,
for
he
knew
that
for
his
sake
this
great
tempest
was
upon
them
*punct* ;
they
mercifully
turn
from
him
*punct* ,
and
seek
by
other
means
to
save
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
in
vain
*punct* ;
the
indignant
gale
howls
louder
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
with
one
hand
raised
invokingly
to
god
*punct* ,
with
the
other
they
not
unreluctantly
lay
hold
of
jonah
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
behold
jonah
taken
up
as
an
anchor
and
dropped
into
the
sea
*punct* ;
when
instantly
an
oily
calmness
floats
out
from
the
east
*punct* ,
and
the
sea
is
still
*punct* ,
as
jonah
carries
down
the
gale
with
him
*punct* ,
leaving
smooth
water
behind
*punct* .
*break*
but
observe
his
prayer
*punct* ,
and
so
many
white
bolts
*punct* ,
upon
his
prison
*punct* .
*break*
then
jonah
prayed
unto
learn
a
weighty
lesson
*punct* .
*break*
for
sinful
as
he
is
*punct* ,
jonah
does
not
weep
and
wail
for
direct
deliverance
*punct* .
*break*
he
feels
that
his
dreadful
punishment
is
just
*punct* .
*break*
he
leaves
all
his
deliverance
to
god
*punct* ,
contenting
himself
with
this
*punct* ,
that
spite
of
all
his
pains
and
pangs
*punct* ,
he
will
still
look
towards
his
holy
temple
*punct* .
*break*
and
here
*punct* ,
shipmates
*punct* ,
is
true
and
faithful
repentance
*punct* ;
not
clamorous
for
pardon
*punct* ,
but
grateful
for
punishment
*punct* .
*break*
and
how
pleasing
to
god
was
this
conduct
in
jonah
*punct* ,
is
shown
in
the
eventual
deliverance
of
him
from
the
sea
and
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
shipmates
*punct* ,
i
do
not
place
jonah
before
you
to
be
copied
for
his
sin
but
i
do
place
him
before
you
as
a
model
for
repentance
*punct* .
*break*
sin
not
*punct* ;
but
if
you
do
*punct* ,
take
heed
to
repent
of
it
like
jonah
*punct* .
*break*
while
he
was
speaking
these
words
*punct* ,
the
howling
of
the
shrieking
*punct* ,
slanting
storm
without
seemed
to
add
new
power
to
the
preacher
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
when
describing
jonah's
sea-storm
*punct* ,
seemed
tossed
by
a
storm
himself
*punct* .
*break*
his
deep
chest
heaved
as
with
a
ground-swell
*punct* ;
his
tossed
arms
seemed
the
warring
elements
at
work
*punct* ;
and
the
thunders
that
rolled
away
from
off
his
swarthy
brow
*punct* ,
and
the
light
leaping
from
his
eye
*punct* ,
made
all
his
simple
hearers
look
on
him
with
a
quick
fear
that
was
strange
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
there
now
came
a
lull
in
his
look
*punct* ,
as
he
silently
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
book
once
more
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
at
last
*punct* ,
standing
motionless
*punct* ,
with
closed
eyes
*punct* ,
for
the
moment
*punct* ,
seemed
communing
with
god
and
himself
*punct* .
*break*
but
again
he
leaned
over
towards
the
people
*punct* ,
and
bowing
his
head
lowly
*punct* ,
with
an
aspect
of
the
deepest
yet
manliest
humility
*punct* ,
he
spake
these
words
*punct* :
shipmates
*punct* ,
god
has
laid
but
one
hand
upon
you
*punct* ;
both
his
hands
press
upon
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
read
ye
by
what
murky
light
may
be
mine
the
lesson
that
jonah
teaches
to
all
sinners
*punct* ;
and
therefore
to
ye
*punct* ,
and
still
more
to
me
*punct* ,
for
i
am
a
greater
sinner
than
ye
*punct* .
*break*
how
being
an
anointed
pilot-prophet
*punct* ,
or
speaker
of
true
things
*punct* ,
and
bidden
by
the
lord
to
sound
those
unwelcome
truths
in
the
ears
of
a
wicked
nineveh
*punct* ,
jonah
*punct* ,
appalled
at
the
hostility
he
should
raise
*punct* ,
fled
from
his
mission
*punct* ,
and
sought
to
escape
his
duty
and
his
god
by
taking
ship
at
joppa
*punct* .
*break*
but
god
is
everywhere
*punct* ;
tarshish
he
never
reached
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
have
seen
*punct* ,
god
came
upon
him
in
the
whale
*punct* ,
and
swallowed
him
down
to
living
gulfs
of
doom
*punct* ,
and
with
swift
slantings
tore
him
alonginto
the
midst
of
the
seas
*punct* ,
where
the
eddying
depths
sucked
him
ten
thousand
fathoms
down
*punct* ,
andthe
weeds
were
wrapped
about
his
head
*punct* ,
and
all
the
watery
world
of
woe
bowled
over
him
*punct* .
*break*
yet
even
then
beyond
the
reach
of
any
plummet
*punct* ,
out
of
the
belly
of
hell
*punct* ,
when
the
whale
grounded
upon
the
ocean's
utmo
st
bones
*punct* ,
even
then
*punct* ,
god
heard
the
engulphed
*punct* ,
repenting
prophet
when
he
cried
*punct* .
*break*
then
god
spake
unto
the
fish
*punct* ;
and
from
the
shuddering
cold
and
blackness
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
the
whale
came
breeching
up
towards
the
warm
and
pleasant
sun
*punct* ,
and
all
the
delights
of
air
and
earth
*punct* ;
andvomited
out
jonah
upon
the
dry
land
*punct* ;
when
the
word
of
the
lord
came
a
second
time
*punct* ;
and
jonah
*punct* ,
bruised
and
beaten
*punct* ,
his
ears
*punct* ,
like
two
sea-shells
*punct* ,
still
multitudinously
murmuring
of
the
ocean
*punct* ,
jonah
did
the
almighty's
bidding
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
was
that
*punct* ,
shipmates
*punct* ?
*break*
to
preach
the
truth
to
the
face
of
falsehood
*punct* !
*break*
that
was
it
*punct* !
*break*
this
*punct* ,
shipmates
*punct* ,
this
is
that
other
lesson
*punct* ;
and
woe
to
that
pilot
of
the
living
god
who
slights
it
*punct* .
*break*
woe
to
him
whom
this
world
charms
from
gospel
duty
*punct* !
*break*
woe
to
him
who
seeks
to
pour
oil
upon
the
waters
when
god
has
brewed
them
into

*punct* !
*break*
woe
to
him
who
seeks
to
please
rather
than
to
appal
*punct* !
*break*
woe
to
him
whose
good
name
is
more
to
him
than
goodness
*punct* !
*break*
woe
to
him
who
*punct* ,
in
this
world
*punct* ,
courts
not
dishonor
*punct* !
*break*
woe
to
him
who
would
not
be
true
*punct* ,
even
though
to
be
false
were
salvation
*punct* !
*break*
yea
*punct* ,
woe
to
him
who
*punct* ,
as
the
great
pilot
paul
has
it
*punct* ,
while
preaching
to
others
is
himself
a
castaway
*punct* !
*break*
he
drooped
and
fell
away
from
himself
for
a
moment
*punct* ;
then
lifting
his
face
to
them
again
*punct* ,
showed
a
deep
joy
in
his
eyes
*punct* ,
as
he
cried
out
with
a
heavenly
enthusiasm,
*punct* ,
but
oh
*punct* !
*break*
is
not
the
main-truck
higher
than
the
kelson
is
low
*punct* ?
*break*
delight
is
to
him
*punct* ,
a
far
*punct* ,
far
upward
*punct* ,
and
inward
delight
*punct* ,
who
against
the
proud
gods
and
commodores
of
this
earth
*punct* ,
ever
stands
forth
his
own
inexorable
self
*punct* .
*break*
delight
is
to
him
whose
strong
arms
yet
support
him
*punct* ,
when
the
ship
of
this
base
treacherous
world
has
gone
down
beneath
him
*punct* .
*break*
delight
is
to
him
*punct* ,
who
gives
no
quarter
in
the
truth
*punct* ,
and
kills
*punct* ,
burns
*punct* ,
and
destroys
all
sin
though
he
pluck
it
out
from
under
the
robes
of
senators
and
judges
*punct* .
*break*
delight,
*punct* ,
top-gallant
delight
is
to
him
*punct* ,
who
acknowledges
no
law
or
lord
*punct* ,
but
the
lord
his
god
*punct* ,
and
is
only
a
patriot
to
heaven
*punct* .
*break*
delight
is
to
him
*punct* ,
whom
all
the
waves
of
the
billows
of
the
seas
of
the
boisterous
mob
can
never
shake
from
this
sure
keel
of
the
ages
*punct* .
*break*
and
eternal
delight
and
deliciousness
will
be
his
*punct* ,
who
coming
to
lay
him
down
*punct* ,
can
say
with
his
final
breath
*punct* ,
o
father!
*punct* ,
chiefly
known
to
me
by
thy
rod
*punct* ,
mortal
or
immortal
*punct* ,
here
i
die
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
striven
to
be
thine
*punct* ,
more
than
to
be
this
world's
*punct* ,
or
mine
own
*punct* .
*break*
yet
this
is
nothing
*punct* ;
i
leave
eternity
to
thee
*punct* ;
for
what
is
man
that
he
should
live
out
the
lifetime
of
his
god
*punct* ?
*break*
he
was
sitting
on
a
bench
before
the
fire
*punct* ,
with
his
feet
on
the
stove
hearth
*punct* ,
and
in
one
hand
was
holding
close
up
to
his
face
that
little
negro
idol
of
his
*punct* ;
peering
hard
into
its
face
*punct* ,
and
with
a
jack-knife
gently
whittling
away
at
its
nose
*punct* ,
meanwhile
humming
to
himself
in
his
heathenish
way
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
then
begin
again
at
the
next
fifty
*punct* ;
seeming
to
commence
at
number
one
each
time
*punct* ,
as
though
he
could
not
count
more
than
fifty
*punct* ,
and
it
was
only
by
such
a
large
number
of
fifties
being
found
together
*punct* ,
that
his
astonishment
at
the
multitude
of
pages
was
excited
*punct* .
*break*
with
much
interest
i
sat
watching
him
*punct* .
*break*
savage
though
he
was
*punct* ,
and
hideously
marred
about
the
face
*punct* ,
at
least
to
my
taste
*punct* ,
his
countenance
yet
had
a
something
in
it
which
was
by
no
means
disagreeable
*punct* .
*break*
you
cannot
hide
the
soul
*punct* .
*break*
through
all
his
unearthly
tattooings
*punct* ,
i
thought
i
saw
the
traces
of
a
simple
honest
heart
*punct* ;
and
in
his
large
*punct* ,
deep
eyes
*punct* ,
fiery
black
and
bold
*punct* ,
there
seemed
tokens
of
a
spirit
that
would
dare
a
thousand
devils
*punct* .
*break*
and
besides
all
this
*punct* ,
there
was
a
certain
lofty
bearing
about
the
pagan
*punct* ,
which
even
his
uncouthness
could
not
altogether
maim
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
like
a
man
who
had
never
cringed
and
never
had
had
a
creditor
*punct* .
*break*
whether
it
was
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
that
his
head
being
shaved
*punct* ,
his
forehead
was
drawn
out
in
freer
and
brighter
relief
*punct* ,
and
looked
more
expansive
than
it
otherwise
would
*punct* ,
this
i
will
not
venture
to
decide
*punct* ;
but
certain
it
was
his
head
was
phrenologically
an
excellent
one
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
seem
ridiculous
*punct* ,
but
it
reminded
me
of
general
washington's
head
*punct* ,
as
seen
in
the
popular
busts
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
the
same
long
regularly
graded
retreating
slope
from
above
the
brows
*punct* ,
which
were
likewise
very
projecting
*punct* ,
like
two
long
promontories
thickly
wooded
on
top
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
was
george
washington
cannibalistically
developed
*punct* .
*break*
whilst
i
was
thus
closely
scanning
him
*punct* ,
half-pretending
meanwhile
to
be
looking
out
at
the
storm
from
the
casement
*punct* ,
he
never
heeded
my
presence
*punct* ,
never
troubled
himself
with
so
much
as
a
single
glance
*punct* ;
but
appeared
wholly
occupied
with
counting
the
pages
of
the
marvellous
book
*punct* .
*break*
but
savages
are
strange
beings
*punct* ;
at
times
you
do
not
know
exactly
how
to
take
them
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
they
are
overawing
*punct* ;
their
calm
self-collectedness
of
simplicity
seems
a
socratic
wisdom
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
noticed
also
that
queequeg
never
consorted
at
all
*punct* ,
or
but
very
little
*punct* ,
with
the
other
seamen
in
the
inn
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
no
advances
whatever
*punct* ;
appeared
to
have
no
desire
to
enlarge
the
circle
of
his
acquaintances
*punct* .
*break*
all
this
struck
me
as
mighty
singular
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
upon
second
thoughts
*punct* ,
there
was
something
almost
sublime
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
here
was
a
man
some
twenty
thousand
miles
from
home
*punct* ,
by
the
way
of
cape
horn
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
which
was
the
only
way
he
could
get
there
*punct* ,
thrown
among
people
as
strange
to
him
as
though
he
were
in
the
planet
jupiter
*punct* ;
and
yet
he
seemed
entirely
at
his
ease
*punct* ;
preserving
the
utmost
serenity
*punct* ;
content
with
his
own
companionship
*punct* ;
always
equal
to
himself
*punct* .
*break*
surely
this
was
a
touch
of
fine
philosophy
*punct* ;
though
no
doubt
he
had
never
heard
there
was
such
a
thing
as
that
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
to
be
true
philosophers
*punct* ,
we
mortals
should
not
be
conscious
of
so
living
or
so
striving
*punct* .
*break*
so
soon
as
i
hear
that
such
or
such
a
man
gives
himself
out
for
a
philosopher
*punct* ,
i
conclude
that
*punct* ,
like
the
dyspeptic
old
woman
*punct* ,
he
must
have
broken
his
digester
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
sat
there
in
that
now
lonely
room
*punct* ;
the
fire
burning
low
*punct* ,
in
that
mild
stage
when
*punct* ,
after
its
first
intensity
has
warmed
the
air
*punct* ,
it
then
only
glows
to
be
looked
at
*punct* ;
the
evening
shades
and
phantoms
gathering
round
the
casements
*punct* ,
and
peering
in
upon
us
silent
*punct* ,
solitary
twain
*punct* ;
the
storm
booming
without
in
solemn
swells
*punct* ;
i
began
to
be
sensible
of
strange
feelings
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
a
melting
in
me
*punct* .
*break*
no
more
my
splintered
heart
and
maddened
hand
were
turned
against
the
wolfish
world
*punct* .
*break*
this
soothing
savage
had
redeemed
it
*punct* .
*break*
there
he
sat
*punct* ,
his
very
indifference
speaking
a
nature
in
which
there
lurked
no
civilized
hypocrisies
and
bland
deceits
*punct* .
*break*
wild
he
was
*punct* ;
a
very
sight
of
sights
to
see
*punct* ;
yet
i
began
to
feel
myself
mysteriously
drawn
towards
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
those
same
things
that
would
have
repelled
most
others
*punct* ,
they
were
the
very
magnets
that
thus
drew
me
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
try
a
pagan
friend
*punct* ,
thought
i
*punct* ,
since
christian
kindness
has
proved
but
hollow
courtesy
*punct* .
*break*
i
drew
my
bench
near
him
*punct* ,
and
made
some
friendly
signs
and
hints
*punct* ,
doing
my
best
to
talk
with
him
meanwhile
*punct* .
*break*
i
told
him
yes
*punct* ;
whereat
i
thought
he
looked
pleased
*punct* ,
perhaps
a
little
complimented
*punct* .
*break*
we
then
turned
over
the
book
together
*punct* ,
and
i
endeavored
to
explain
to
him
the
purpose
of
the
printing
*punct* ,
and
the
meaning
of
the
few
pictures
that
were
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
thus
i
soon
engaged
his
interest
*punct* ;
and
from
that
we
went
to
jabbering
the
best
we
could
about
the
various
outer
sights
to
be
seen
in
this
famous
town
*punct* .
*break*
soon
i
proposed
a
social
smoke
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
producing
his
pouch
and
tomahawk
*punct* ,
he
quietly
offered
me
a
puff
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
we
sat
exchanging
puffs
from
that
wild
pipe
of
his
*punct* ,
and
keeping
it
regularly
passing
between
us
*punct* .
*break*
if
there
yet
lurked
any
ice
of
indifference
towards
me
in
the
pagan's
breast
*punct* ,
this
pleasant
*punct* ,
genial
smoke
we
had
*punct* ,
soon
thawed
it
out
*punct* ,
and
left
us
cronies
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
to
take
to
me
quite
as
naturally
and
unbiddenly
as
i
to
him
*punct* ;
and
when
our
smoke
was
over
*punct* ,
he
pressed
his
forehead
against
mine
*punct* ,
clasped
me
round
the
waist
*punct* ,
and
said
that
henceforth
we
were
married
*punct* ;
meaning
*punct* ,
in
his
country's
phrase
*punct* ,
that
we
were
bosom
friends
*punct* ;
he
would
gladly
die
for
me
*punct* ,
if
need
should
be
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
countryman
*punct* ,
this
sudden
flame
of
friendship
would
have
seemed
far
too
premature
*punct* ,
a
thing
to
be
much
distrusted
*punct* ;
but
in
this
simple
savage
those
old
rules
would
not
apply
*punct* .
*break*
after
supper
*punct* ,
and
another
social
chat
and
smoke
*punct* ,
we
went
to
our
room
together
*punct* .
*break*
he
made
me
a
present
of
his
embalmed
head
*punct* ;
took
out
his
enormous
tobacco
wallet
*punct* ,
and
groping
under
the
tobacco
*punct* ,
drew
out
some
thirty
dollars
in
silver
*punct* ;
then
spreading
them
on
the
table
*punct* ,
and
mechanically
dividing
them
into
two
equal
portions
*punct* ,
pushed
one
of
them
towards
me
*punct* ,
and
said
it
was
mine
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
going
to
remonstrate
*punct* ;
but
he
silenced
me
by
pouring
them
into
my
trowsers
pockets
*punct* .
*break*
i
let
them
stay
*punct* .
*break*
he
then
went
about
his
evening
prayers
*punct* ,
took
out
his
idol
*punct* ,
and
removed
the
paper
fireboard
*punct* .
*break*
by
certain
signs
and
symptoms
*punct* ,
i
thought
he
seemed
anxious
for
me
to
join
him
*punct* ;
but
well
knowing
what
was
to
follow
*punct* ,
i
deliberated
a
moment
whether
*punct* ,
in
case
he
invited
me
*punct* ,
i
would
comply
or
otherwise
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
a
good
christian
*punct* ;
born
and
bred
in
the
bosom
of
the
infallible
presbyterian
church
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
is
worship
*punct* ?
*break*
do
you
suppose
now
*punct* ,
ishmael
*punct* ,
that
the
magnanimous
god
of
heaven
and
earth
*punct* ,
pagans
and
all
included
*punct* ,
can
possibly
be
jealous
of
an
insignificant
bit
of
black
wood
*punct* ?
*break*
but
what
is
worship?
*punct* ,
to
do
the
will
of
god
*punct* ,
that
is
worship
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
is
the
will
of
god?
*punct* ,
to
do
to
my
fellow
man
what
i
would
have
my
fellow
man
to
do
to
me
*punct* ,
that
is
the
will
of
god
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
queequeg
is
my
fellow
man
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
do
i
wish
that
this
queequeg
would
do
to
me
*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
unite
with
me
in
my
particular
presbyterian
form
of
worship
*punct* .
*break*
consequently
*punct* ,
i
must
then
unite
with
him
in
his
*punct* ;
ergo
*punct* ,
i
must
turn
idolator
*punct* .
*break*
so
i
kindled
the
shavings
*punct* ;
helped
prop
up
the
innocent
little
idol
*punct* ;
offered
him
burnt
biscuit
with
queequeg
*punct* ;
salamed
before
him
twice
or
thrice
*punct* ;
kissed
his
nose
*punct* ;
and
that
done
*punct* ,
we
undressed
and
went
to
bed
*punct* ,
at
peace
with
our
own
consciences
and
all
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
did
not
go
to
sleep
without
some
little
chat
*punct* .
*break*
how
it
is
i
know
not
*punct* ;
but
there
is
no
place
like
a
bed
for
confidential
disclosures
between
friends
*punct* .
*break*
man
and
wife
*punct* ,
they
say
*punct* ,
there
open
the
very
bottom
of
their
souls
to
each
other
*punct* ;
and
some
old
couples
often
lie
and
chat
over
old
times
till
nearly
morning
*punct* .
*break*
we
felt
very
nice
and
snug
*punct* ,
the
more
so
since
it
was
so
chilly
out
of
doors
*punct* ;
indeed
out
of
bed-clothes
too
*punct* ,
seeing
that
there
was
no
fire
in
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
the
more
so
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
because
truly
to
enjoy
bodily
warmth
*punct* ,
some
small
part
of
you
must
be
cold
*punct* ,
for
there
is
no
quality
in
this
world
that
is
not
what
it
is
merely
by
contrast
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
exists
in
itself
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
flatter
yourself
that
you
are
all
over
comfortable
*punct* ,
and
have
been
so
a
long
time
*punct* ,
then
you
cannot
be
said
to
be
comfortable
any
more
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
*punct* ,
like
queequeg
and
me
in
the
bed
*punct* ,
the
tip
of
your
nose
or
the
crown
of
your
head
be
slightly
chilled
*punct* ,
why
then
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
in
the
general
consciousness
you
feel
most
delightfully
and
unmistakably
warm
*punct* .
*break*
for
this
reason
a
sleeping
apartment
should
never
be
furnished
with
a
fire
*punct* ,
which
is
one
of
the
luxurious
discomforts
of
the
rich
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
height
of
this
sort
of
deliciousness
is
to
have
nothing
but
the
blanket
between
you
and
your
snugness
and
the
cold
of
the
outer
air
*punct* .
*break*
then
there
you
lie
like
the
one
warm
spark
in
the
heart
of
an
arctic
crystal
*punct* .
*break*
we
had
been
sitting
in
this
crouching
manner
for
some
time
*punct* ,
when
all
at
once
i
thought
i
would
open
my
eyes
*punct* ;
for
when
between
sheets
*punct* ,
whether
by
day
or
by
night
*punct* ,
and
whether
asleep
or
awake
*punct* ,
i
have
a
way
of
always
keeping
my
eyes
shut
*punct* ,
in
order
the
more
to
concentrate
the
snugness
of
being
in
bed
*punct* .
*break*
because
no
man
can
ever
feel
his
own
identity
aright
except
his
eyes
be
closed
*punct* ;
as
if
darkness
were
indeed
the
proper
element
of
our
essences
*punct* ,
though
light
be
more
congenial
to
our
clayey
part
*punct* .
*break*
upon
opening
my
eyes
then
*punct* ,
and
coming
out
of
my
own
pleasant
and
self-created
darkness
into
the
imposed
and
coarse
outer
gloom
of
the
unilluminated
twelve-o'clock-at-night
*punct* ,
i
experienced
a
disagreeable
revulsion
*punct* .
*break*
nor
did
i
at
all
object
to
the
hint
from
queequeg
that
perhaps
it
were
best
to
strike
a
light
*punct* ,
seeing
that
we
were
so
wide
awake
*punct* ;
and
besides
he
felt
a
strong
desire
to
have
a
few
quiet
puffs
from
his
tomahawk
*punct* .
*break*
for
now
i
liked
nothing
better
than
to
have
queequeg
smoking
by
me
*punct* ,
even
in
bed
*punct* ,
because
he
seemed
to
be
full
of
such
serene
household
joy
then
*punct* .
*break*
i
no
more
felt
unduly
concerned
for
the
landlord's
policy
of
insurance
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
only
alive
to
the
condensed
confidential
comfortableness
of
sharing
a
pipe
and
a
blanket
with
a
real
friend
*punct* .
*break*
with
our
shaggy
jackets
drawn
about
our
shoulders
*punct* ,
we
now
passed
the
tomahawk
from
one
to
the
other
*punct* ,
till
slowly
there
grew
over
us
a
blue
hanging
tester
of
smoke
*punct* ,
illuminated
by
the
flame
of
the
new-lit
lamp
*punct* .
*break*
whether
it
was
that
this
undulating
tester
rolled
the
savage
away
to
far
distant
scenes
*punct* ,
i
know
not
*punct* ,
but
he
now
spoke
of
his
native
island
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
eager
to
hear
his
history
*punct* ,
i
begged
him
to
go
on
and
tell
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
gladly
complied
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
down
in
any
map
*punct* ;
true
places
never
are
*punct* .
*break*
when
a
new-hatched
savage
running
wild
about
his
native
woodlands
in
a
grass
clout
*punct* ,
followed
by
the
nibbling
goats
*punct* ,
as
if
he
were
a
green
sapling
*punct* ;
even
then
*punct* ,
in
queequeg's
ambitious
soul
*punct* ,
lurked
a
strong
desire
to
see
something
more
of
christendom
than
a
specimen
whaler
or
two
*punct* .
*break*
his
father
was
a
high
chief
*punct* ,
a
king
*punct* ;
his
uncle
a
high
priest
*punct* ;
and
on
the
maternal
side
he
boasted
aunts
who
were
the
wives
of
unconquerable
warriors
*punct* .
*break*
a
sag
harbor
ship
visited
his
father's
bay
*punct* ,
and
queequeg
sought
a
passage
to
christian
lands
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
ship
*punct* ,
having
her
full
complement
of
seamen
*punct* ,
spurned
his
suit
*punct* ;
and
not
all
the
king
his
father's
influence
could
prevail
*punct* .
*break*
but
queequeg
vowed
a
vow
*punct* .
*break*
alone
in
his
canoe
*punct* ,
he
paddled
off
to
a
distant
strait
*punct* ,
which
he
knew
the
ship
must
pass
through
when
she
quitted
the
island
*punct* .
*break*
on
one
side
was
a
coral
reef
*punct* ;
on
the
other
a
low
tongue
of
land
*punct* ,
covered
with
mangrove
thickets
that
grew
out
into
the
water
*punct* .
*break*
hiding
his
canoe
*punct* ,
still
afloat
*punct* ,
among
these
thickets
*punct* ,
with
its
prow
seaward
*punct* ,
he
sat
down
in
the
stern
*punct* ,
paddle
low
in
hand
*punct* ;
and
when
the
ship
was
gliding
by
*punct* ,
like
a
flash
he
darted
out
*punct* ;
gained
her
side
*punct* ;
with
one
backward
dash
of
his
foot
capsized
and
sank
his
canoe
*punct* ;
climbed
up
the
chains
*punct* ;
and
throwing
himself
at
full
length
upon
the
deck
*punct* ,
grappled
a
ringbolt
there
*punct* ,
and
swore
not
to
let
it
go
*punct* ,
though
hacked
in
pieces
*punct* .
*break*
in
vain
the
captain
threatened
to
throw
him
overboard
*punct* ;
suspended
a
cutlass
over
his
naked
wrists
*punct* ;
queequeg
was
the
son
of
a
king
*punct* ,
and
queequeg
budged
not
*punct* .
*break*
struck
by
his
desperate
dauntlessness
*punct* ,
and
his
wild
desire
to
visit
christendom
*punct* ,
the
captain
at
last
relented
*punct* ,
and
told
him
he
might
make
himself
at
home
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
fine
young
savage
*punct* ,
this
sea
prince
of
wales
*punct* ,
never
saw
the
captain's
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
they
put
him
down
among
the
sailors
*punct* ,
and
made
a
whaleman
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
like
czar
peter
content
to
toil
in
the
shipyards
of
foreign
cities
*punct* ,
queequeg
disdained
no
seeming
ignominy
*punct* ,
if
thereby
he
might
happily
gain
the
power
of
enlightening
his
untutored
countrymen
*punct* .
*break*
for
at
bottom
*punct* ,
so
he
told
me
*punct* ,
he
was
actuated
by
a
profound
desire
to
learn
among
the
christians
*punct* ,
the
arts
whereby
to
make
his
people
still
happier
than
they
were
*punct* ;
and
more
than
that
*punct* ,
still
better
than
they
were
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
alas
*punct* !
*break*
the
practices
of
whalemen
soon
convinced
him
that
even
christians
could
be
both
miserable
and
wicked
*punct* ;
infinitely
more
so
*punct* ,
than
all
his
father's
heathens
*punct* .
*break*
arrived
at
last
in
old
sag
harbor
*punct* ;
and
seeing
what
the
sailors
did
there
*punct* ;
and
then
going
on
to
nantucket
*punct* ,
and
seeing
how
they
spent
their
wages
in
that
place
also
*punct* ,
poor
queequeg
gave
it
up
for
lost
*punct* .
*break*
hence
the
queer
ways
about
him
*punct* ,
though
now
some
time
from
home
*punct* .
*break*
by
hints
*punct* ,
i
asked
him
whether
he
did
not
propose
going
back
*punct* ,
and
having
a
coronation
*punct* ;
since
he
might
now
consider
his
father
dead
and
gone
*punct* ,
he
being
very
old
and
feeble
at
the
last
accounts
*punct* .
*break*
he
answered
no
*punct* ,
not
yet
*punct* ;
and
added
that
he
was
fearful
christianity
*punct* ,
or
rather
christians
*punct* ,
had
unfitted
him
for
ascending
the
pure
and
undefiled
throne
of
thirty
pagan
kings
before
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
by
and
by
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
he
would
return,
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
he
felt
himself
baptized
again
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
nonce
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
he
proposed
to
sail
about
*punct* ,
and
sow
his
wild
oats
in
all
four
oceans
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
made
a
harpooneer
of
him
*punct* ,
and
that
barbed
iron
was
in
lieu
of
a
sceptre
now
*punct* .
*break*
i
asked
him
what
might
be
his
immediate
purpose
*punct* ,
touching
his
future
movements
*punct* .
*break*
he
answered
*punct* ,
to
go
to
sea
again
*punct* ,
in
his
old
vocation
*punct* .
*break*
upon
this
*punct* ,
i
told
him
that
whaling
was
my
own
design
*punct* ,
and
informed
him
of
my
intention
to
sail
out
of
nantucket
*punct* ,
as
being
the
most
promising
port
for
an
adventurous
whaleman
to
embark
from
*punct* .
*break*
he
at
once
resolved
to
accompany
me
to
that
island
*punct* ,
ship
aboard
the
same
vessel
*punct* ,
get
into
the
same
watch
*punct* ,
the
same
boat
*punct* ,
the
same
mess
with
me
*punct* ,
in
short
to
share
my
every
hap
*punct* ;
with
both
my
hands
in
his
*punct* ,
boldly
dip
into
the
potluck
of
both
worlds
*punct* .
*break*
to
all
this
i
joyously
assented
*punct* ;
for
besides
the
affection
i
now
felt
for
queequeg
*punct* ,
he
was
an
experienced
harpooneer
*punct* ,
and
as
such
*punct* ,
could
not
fail
to
be
of
great
usefulness
to
one
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
like
me
*punct* ,
was
wholly
ignorant
of
the
mysteries
of
whaling
*punct* ,
though
well
acquainted
with
the
sea
*punct* ,
as
known
to
merchant
seamen
*punct* .
*break*
the
grinning
landlord
*punct* ,
as
well
as
the
boarders
*punct* ,
seemed
amazingly
tickled
at
the
sudden
friendship
which
had
sprung
up
between
me
and
queequeg
*punct* ,
especially
as
peter
coffin's
cock
and
bull
stories
about
him
had
previously
so
much
alarmed
me
concerning
the
very
person
whom
i
now
companied
with
*punct* .
*break*
we
borrowed
a
wheelbarrow
*punct* ,
and
embarking
our
things
*punct* ,
including
my
own
poor
carpet-bag
*punct* ,
and
queequeg's
canvas
sack
and
hammock
*punct* ,
away
we
went
down
to
the
moss
*punct* ,
the
little
nantucket
packet
schooner
moored
at
the
wharf
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
were
going
along
the
people
stared
*punct* ;
not
at
queequeg
so
much
*punct* ,
for
they
were
used
to
seeing
cannibals
like
him
in
their
streets,
*punct* ,
but
at
seeing
him
and
me
upon
such
confidential
terms
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
heeded
them
not
*punct* ,
going
along
wheeling
the
barrow
by
turns
*punct* ,
and
queequeg
now
and
then
stopping
to
adjust
the
sheath
on
his
harpoon
barbs
*punct* .
*break*
i
asked
him
why
he
carried
such
a
troublesome
thing
with
him
ashore
*punct* ,
and
whether
all
whaling
ships
did
not
find
their
own
harpoons
*punct* .
*break*
to
this
*punct* ,
in
substance
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
that
though
what
i
hinted
was
true
enough
*punct* ,
yet
he
had
a
particular
affection
for
his
own
harpoon
*punct* ,
because
it
was
of
assured
stuff
*punct* ,
well
tried
in
many
a
mortal
combat
*punct* ,
and
deeply
intimate
with
the
hearts
of
whales
*punct* .
*break*
in
short
*punct* ,
like
many
inland
reapers
and
mowers
*punct* ,
who
go
into
the
farmers
meadows
armed
with
their
own
scythes
*punct* ,
though
in
no
wise
obliged
to
furnished
them
*punct* ,
even
so
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
for
his
own
private
reasons
*punct* ,
preferred
his
own
harpoon
*punct* .
*break*
shifting
the
barrow
from
my
hand
to
his
*punct* ,
he
told
me
a
funny
story
about
the
first
wheelbarrow
he
had
ever
seen
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
in
sag
harbor
*punct* .
*break*
not
to
seem
ignorant
about
the
thing
*punct* ,
though
in
truth
he
was
entirely
so
*punct* ,
concerning
the
precise
way
in
which
to
manage
the
barrow
*punct* ,
queequeg
puts
his
chest
upon
it
*punct* ;
lashes
it
fast
*punct* ;
and
then
shoulders
the
barrow
and
marches
up
the
wharf
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
you
might
have
known
better
than
that
*punct* ,
one
would
think
*punct* .
*break*
didn't
the
people
laugh
*punct* ?
*break*
upon
this
*punct* ,
he
told
me
another
story
*punct* .
*break*
the
people
of
his
island
of
rokovoko
*punct* ,
it
seems
*punct* ,
at
their
wedding
feasts
express
the
fragrant
water
of
young
cocoanuts
into
a
large
stained
calabash
like
a
punchbowl
*punct* ;
and
this
punchbowl
always
forms
the
great
central
ornament
on
the
braided
mat
where
the
feast
is
held
*punct* .
*break*
now
a
certain
grand
merchant
ship
once
touched
at
rokovoko
*punct* ,
and
its
commander
*punct* ,
from
all
accounts
*punct* ,
a
very
stately
punctilious
gentleman
*punct* ,
at
least
for
a
sea
captain
*punct* ,
this
commander
was
invited
to
the
wedding
feast
of
queequeg's
sister
*punct* ,
a
pretty
young
princess
just
turned
of
ten
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ;
when
all
the
wedding
guests
were
assembled
at
the
bride's
bamboo
cottage
*punct* ,
this
captain
marches
in
*punct* ,
and
being
assigned
the
post
of
honor
*punct* ,
placed
himself
over
against
the
punchbowl
*punct* ,
and
between
the
high
priest
and
his
majesty
the
king
*punct* ,
queequeg's
father
*punct* .
*break*
grace
being
said,
*punct* ,
for
those
people
have
their
grace
as
well
as
we
*punct* ,
though
queequeg
told
me
that
unlike
us
*punct* ,
who
at
such
times
look
downwards
to
our
platters
*punct* ,
they
*punct* ,
on
the
contrary
*punct* ,
copying
the
ducks
*punct* ,
glance
upwards
to
the
great
giver
of
all
feasts
*punct* ,
grace
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
being
said
*punct* ,
the
high
priest
opens
the
banquet
by
the
immemorial
ceremony
of
the
island
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
dipping
his
consecrated
and
consecrating
fingers
into
the
bowl
before
the
blessed
beverage
circulates
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
himself
placed
next
the
priest
*punct* ,
and
noting
the
ceremony
*punct* ,
and
thinking
himself
*punct* ,
being
captain
of
a
ship
*punct* ,
as
having
plain
precedence
over
a
mere
island
king
*punct* ,
especially
in
the
king's
own
house
*punct* ,
the
captain
coolly
proceeds
to
wash
his
hands
in
the
punch
bowl;
*punct* ,
taking
it
i
suppose
for
a
huge
finger-glass
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
said
queequeg
*punct* ,
what
you
tink
now,
*punct* ,
didn't
our
people
laugh
*punct* ?
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
passage
paid
*punct* ,
and
luggage
safe
*punct* ,
we
stood
on
board
the
schooner
*punct* .
*break*
hoisting
sail
*punct* ,
it
glided
down
the
acushnet
river
*punct* .
*break*
huge
hills
and
mountains
of
casks
on
casks
were
piled
upon
her
wharves
*punct* ,
and
side
by
side
the
world-wandering
whale
ships
lay
silent
and
safely
moored
at
last
*punct* ;
while
from
others
came
a
sound
of
carpenters
and
coopers
*punct* ,
with
blended
noises
of
fires
and
forges
to
melt
the
pitch
*punct* ,
all
betokening
that
new
cruises
were
on
the
start
*punct* ;
that
one
most
perilous
and
long
voyage
ended
*punct* ,
only
begins
a
second
*punct* ;
and
a
second
ended
*punct* ,
only
begins
a
third
*punct* ,
and
so
on
*punct* ,
for
ever
and
for
aye
*punct* .
*break*
such
is
the
endlessness
*punct* ,
yea
*punct* ,
the
intolerableness
of
all
earthly
effort
*punct* .
*break*
gaining
the
more
open
water
*punct* ,
the
bracing
breeze
waxed
fresh
*punct* ;
the
little
moss
tossed
the
quick
foam
from
her
bows
*punct* ,
as
a
young
colt
his
snortings
*punct* .
*break*
how
i
snuffed
that
tartar
air!
*punct* ,
how
i
spurned
that
turnpike
earth!
*punct* ,
that
common
highway
all
over
dented
with
the
marks
of
slavish
heels
and
hoofs
*punct* ;
and
turned
me
to
admire
the
magnanimity
of
the
sea
which
will
permit
no
records
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
same
foam-fountain
*punct* ,
queequeg
seemed
to
drink
and
reel
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
his
dusky
nostrils
swelled
apart
*punct* ;
he
showed
his
filed
and
pointed
teeth
*punct* .
*break*
on
*punct* ,
on
we
flew
*punct* ,
and
our
offing
gained
*punct* ,
the
moss
did
homage
to
the
blast
*punct* ;
ducked
and
dived
her
brows
as
a
slave
before
the
sultan
*punct* .
*break*
sideways
leaning
*punct* ,
we
sideways
darted
*punct* ;
every
ropeyarn
tingling
like
a
wire
*punct* ;
the
two
tall
masts
buckling
like
indian
canes
in
land
tornadoes
*punct* .
*break*
so
full
of
this
reeling
scene
were
we
*punct* ,
as
we
stood
by
the
plunging
bowsprit
*punct* ,
that
for
some
time
we
did
not
notice
the
jeering
glances
of
the
passengers
*punct* ,
a
lubber-like
assembly
*punct* ,
who
marvelled
that
two
fellow
beings
should
be
so
companionable
*punct* ;
as
though
a
white
man
were
anything
more
dignified
than
a
whitewashed
negro
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
were
some
boobies
and
bumpkins
there
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
by
their
intense
greenness
*punct* ,
must
have
come
from
the
heart
and
centre
of
all
verdure
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
caught
one
of
these
young
saplings
mimicking
him
behind
his
back
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
the
bumpkin's
hour
of
doom
was
come
*punct* .
*break*
yelled
the
bumpkin
*punct* ,
running
towards
that
officer
*punct* ;
capting
*punct* ,
capting
*punct* ,
here's
the
devil
*punct* .
*break*
hallo
*punct* ,
you
sir
*punct* ,
cried
the
captain
*punct* ,
a
gaunt
rib
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
stalking
up
to
queequeg
*punct* ,
what
in
thunder
do
you
mean
by
that
*punct* ?
*break*
don't
you
know
you
might
have
killed
that
chap
*punct* ?
*break*
what
him
say
*punct* ?
*break*
said
queequeg
*punct* ,
as
he
mildly
turned
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
he
say
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
that
you
came
near
kill-e
that
man
there
*punct* ,
pointing
to
the
still
shivering
greenhorn
*punct* .
*break*
kill-e
*punct* ,
cried
queequeg
*punct* ,
twisting
his
tattooed
face
into
an
unearthly
expression
of
disdain
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* !
*break*
him
bevy
small-e
fish-e
*punct* ;
queequeg
no
kill-e
so
small-e
fish-e
*punct* ;
queequeg
kill-e
big
whale
*punct* !
*break*
look
you
*punct* ,
roared
the
captain
*punct* ,
i'll
kill-e
you
*punct* ,
you
cannibal
*punct* ,
if
you
try
any
more
of
your
tricks
aboard
here
*punct* ;
so
mind
your
eye
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
so
happened
just
then
*punct* ,
that
it
was
high
time
for
the
captain
to
mind
his
own
eye
*punct* .
*break*
the
prodigious
strain
upon
the
main-sail
had
parted
the
weather-sheet
*punct* ,
and
the
tremendous
boom
was
now
flying
from
side
to
side
*punct* ,
completely
sweeping
the
entire
after
part
of
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
the
poor
fellow
whom
queequeg
had
handled
so
roughly
*punct* ,
was
swept
overboard
*punct* ;
all
hands
were
in
a
panic
*punct* ;
and
to
attempt
snatching
at
the
boom
to
stay
it
*punct* ,
seemed
madness
*punct* .
*break*
it
flew
from
right
to
left
*punct* ,
and
back
again
*punct* ,
almost
in
one
ticking
of
a
watch
*punct* ,
and
every
instant
seemed
on
the
point
of
snapping
into
splinters
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
was
done
*punct* ,
and
nothing
seemed
capable
of
being
done
*punct* ;
those
on
deck
rushed
towards
the
bows
*punct* ,
and
stood
eyeing
the
boom
as
if
it
were
the
lower
jaw
of
an
exasperated
whale
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
midst
of
this
consternation
*punct* ,
queequeg
dropped
deftly
to
his
knees
*punct* ,
and
crawling
under
the
path
of
the
boom
*punct* ,
whipped
hold
of
a
rope
*punct* ,
secured
one
end
to
the
bulwarks
*punct* ,
and
then
flinging
the
other
like
a
lasso
*punct* ,
caught
it
round
the
boom
as
it
swept
over
his
head
*punct* ,
and
at
the
next
jerk
*punct* ,
the
spar
was
that
way
trapped
*punct* ,
and
all
was
safe
*punct* .
*break*
the
schooner
was
run
into
the
wind
*punct* ,
and
while
the
hands
were
clearing
away
the
stern
boat
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
stripped
to
the
waist
*punct* ,
darted
from
the
side
with
a
long
living
arc
of
a
leap
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
at
the
grand
and
glorious
fellow
*punct* ,
but
saw
no
one
to
be
saved
*punct* .
*break*
the
greenhorn
had
gone
down
*punct* .
*break*
shooting
himself
perpendicularly
from
the
water
*punct* ,
queequeg
now
took
an
instant's
glance
around
him
*punct* ,
and
seeming
to
see
just
how
matters
were
*punct* ,
dived
down
and
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
minutes
more
*punct* ,
and
he
rose
again
*punct* ,
one
arm
still
striking
out
*punct* ,
and
with
the
other
dragging
a
lifeless
form
*punct* .
*break*
the
boat
soon
picked
them
up
*punct* .
*break*
the
poor
bumpkin
was
restored
*punct* .
*break*
all
hands
voted
queequeg
a
noble
trump
*punct* ;
the
captain
begged
his
pardon
*punct* .
*break*
from
that
hour
i
clove
to
queequeg
like
a
barnacle
*punct* ;
yea
*punct* ,
till
poor
queequeg
took
his
last
long
dive
*punct* .
*break*
was
there
ever
such
unconsciousness
*punct* ?
*break*
he
did
not
seem
to
think
that
he
at
all
deserved
a
medal
from
the
humane
and
magnanimous
societies
*punct* .
*break*
he
only
asked
for
water
*punct* ,
fresh
water
*punct* ,
something
to
wipe
the
brine
off
*punct* ;
that
done
*punct* ,
he
put
on
dry
clothes
*punct* ,
lighted
his
pipe
*punct* ,
and
leaning
against
the
bulwarks
*punct* ,
and
mildly
eyeing
those
around
him
*punct* ,
seemed
to
be
saying
to
himself
*punct* ,
it's
a
mutual
*punct* ,
joint-stock
world
*punct* ,
in
all
meridians
*punct* .
*break*
take
out
your
map
and
look
at
it
*punct* .
*break*
see
what
a
real
corner
of
the
world
it
occupies
*punct* ;
how
it
stands
there
*punct* ,
away
off
shore
*punct* ,
more
lonely
than
the
eddystone
lighthouse
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
it
*punct* ,
a
mere
hillock
*punct* ,
and
elbow
of
sand
*punct* ;
all
beach
*punct* ,
without
a
background
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
more
sand
there
than
you
would
use
in
twenty
years
as
a
substitute
for
blotting
paper
*punct* .
*break*
but
these
extravaganzas
only
show
that
nantucket
is
no
illinois
*punct* .
*break*
look
now
at
the
wondrous
traditional
story
of
how
this
island
was
settled
by
the
red-men
*punct* .
*break*
thus
goes
the
legend
*punct* .
*break*
in
olden
times
an
eagle
swooped
down
upon
the
new
england
coast
*punct* ,
and
carried
off
an
infant
indian
in
his
talons
*punct* .
*break*
with
loud
lament
the
parents
saw
their
child
borne
out
of
sight
over
the
wide
waters
*punct* .
*break*
they
resolved
to
follow
in
the
same
direction
*punct* .
*break*
setting
out
in
their
canoes
*punct* ,
after
a
perilous
passage
they
discovered
the
island
*punct* ,
and
there
they
found
an
empty
ivory
casket,
*punct* ,
the
poor
little
indian's
skeleton
*punct* .
*break*
what
wonder
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
that
these
nantucketers
*punct* ,
born
on
a
beach
*punct* ,
should
take
to
the
sea
for
a
livelihood
*punct* !
*break*
they
first
caught
crabs
and
quohogs
in
the
sand
*punct* ;
grown
bolder
*punct* ,
they
waded
out
with
nets
for
mackerel
*punct* ;
more
experienced
*punct* ,
they
pushed
off
in
boats
and
captured
cod
*punct* ;
and
at
last
*punct* ,
launching
a
navy
of
great
ships
on
the
sea
*punct* ,
explored
this
watery
world
*punct* ;
put
an
incessant
belt
of
circumnavigations
round
it
*punct* ;
peeped
in
at
behring's
straits
*punct* ;
and
in
all
seasons
and
all
oceans
declared
everlasting
war
with
the
mightiest
animated
mass
that
has
survived
the
flood
*punct* ;
most
monstrous
and
most
mountainous
*punct* !
*break*
that
himmalehan
*punct* ,
salt-sea
mastodon
*punct* ,
clothed
with
such
portentousness
of
unconscious
power
*punct* ,
that
his
very
panics
are
more
to
be
dreaded
than
his
most
fearless
and
malicious
assaults
*punct* !
*break*
let
america
add
mexico
to
texas
*punct* ,
and
pile
cuba
upon
canada
*punct* ;
let
the
english
overswarm
all
india
*punct* ,
and
hang
out
their
blazing
banner
from
the
sun
*punct* ;
two
thirds
of
this
terraqueous
globe
are
the
nantucketer's
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
sea
is
his
*punct* ;
he
owns
it
*punct* ,
as
emperors
own
empires
*punct* ;
other
seamen
having
but
a
right
of
way
through
it
*punct* .
*break*
merchant
ships
are
but
extension
bridges
*punct* ;
armed
ones
but
floating
forts
*punct* ;
even
pirates
and
privateers
*punct* ,
though
following
the
sea
as
highwaymen
the
road
*punct* ,
they
but
plunder
other
ships
*punct* ,
other
fragments
of
the
land
like
themselves
*punct* ,
without
seeking
to
draw
their
living
from
the
bottomless
deep
itself
*punct* .
*break*
the
nantucketer
*punct* ,
he
alone
resides
and
riots
on
the
sea
*punct* ;
he
alone
*punct* ,
in
bible
language
*punct* ,
goes
down
to
it
in
ships
*punct* ;
to
and
fro
ploughing
it
as
his
own
special
plantation
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
his
home
*punct* ;
there
lies
his
business
*punct* ,
which
a
noah's
flood
would
not
interrupt
*punct* ,
though
it
overwhelmed
all
the
millions
in
china
*punct* .
*break*
he
lives
on
the
sea
*punct* ,
as
prairie
cocks
in
the
prairie
*punct* ;
he
hides
among
the
waves
*punct* ,
he
climbs
them
as
chamois
hunters
climb
the
alps
*punct* .
*break*
for
years
he
knows
not
the
land
*punct* ;
so
that
when
he
comes
to
it
at
last
*punct* ,
it
smells
like
another
world
*punct* ,
more
strangely
than
the
moon
would
to
an
earthsman
*punct* .
*break*
in
short
*punct* ,
he
plainly
hinted
that
we
could
not
possibly
do
better
than
try
pot-luck
at
the
try
pots
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
directions
he
had
given
us
about
keeping
a
yellow
warehouse
on
our
starboard
hand
till
we
opened
a
white
church
to
the
larboard
*punct* ,
and
then
keeping
that
on
the
larboard
hand
till
we
made
a
corner
three
points
to
the
starboard
*punct* ,
and
that
done
*punct* ,
then
ask
the
first
man
we
met
where
the
place
was
*punct* :
these
crooked
directions
of
his
very
much
puzzled
us
at
first
*punct* ,
especially
as
*punct* ,
at
the
outset
*punct* ,
queequeg
insisted
that
the
yellow
warehouse
*punct* ,
our
first
point
of
departure
*punct* ,
must
be
left
on
the
larboard
hand
*punct* ,
whereas
i
had
understood
peter
coffin
to
say
it
was
on
the
starboard
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
by
dint
of
beating
about
a
little
in
the
dark
*punct* ,
and
now
and
then
knocking
up
a
peaceable
inhabitant
to
inquire
the
way
*punct* ,
we
at
last
came
to
something
which
there
was
no
mistaking
*punct* .
*break*
two
enormous
wooden
pots
painted
black
*punct* ,
and
suspended
by
asses
ears
*punct* ,
swung
from
the
cross-trees
of
an
old
top-mast
*punct* ,
planted
in
front
of
an
old
doorway
*punct* .
*break*
the
horns
of
the
cross-trees
were
sawed
off
on
the
other
side
*punct* ,
so
that
this
old
top-mast
looked
not
a
little
like
a
gallows
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
i
was
over
sensitive
to
such
impressions
at
the
time
*punct* ,
but
i
could
not
help
staring
at
this
gallows
with
a
vague
misgiving
*punct* .
*break*
a
sort
of
crick
was
in
my
neck
as
i
gazed
up
to
the
two
remaining
horns
*punct* ;
yes
*punct* ,
two
of
them
*punct* ,
one
for
queequeg
*punct* ,
and
one
for
me
*punct* .
*break*
it's
ominous
*punct* ,
thinks
i
*punct* .
*break*
a
coffin
my
innkeeper
upon
landing
in
my
first
whaling
port
*punct* ;
tombstones
staring
at
me
in
the
whalemen's
chapel
*punct* ;
and
here
a
gallows
*punct* !
*break*
and
a
pair
of
prodigious
black
pots
too
*punct* !
*break*
are
these
last
throwing
out
oblique
hints
touching
tophet
*punct* ?
*break*
i
was
called
from
these
reflections
by
the
sight
of
a
freckled
woman
with
yellow
hair
and
a
yellow
gown
*punct* ,
standing
in
the
porch
of
the
inn
*punct* ,
under
a
dull
red
lamp
swinging
there
*punct* ,
that
looked
much
like
an
injured
eye
*punct* ,
and
carrying
on
a
brisk
scolding
with
a
man
in
a
purple
woollen
shirt
*punct* .
*break*
get
along
with
ye
*punct* ,
said
she
to
the
man
*punct* ,
or
i'll
be
combing
ye
*punct* !
*break*
come
on
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
all
right
*punct* .
*break*
upon
making
known
our
desires
for
a
supper
and
a
bed
*punct* ,
mrs.
hussey
*punct* ,
postponing
further
scolding
for
the
present
*punct* ,
ushered
us
into
a
little
room
*punct* ,
and
seating
us
at
a
table
spread
with
the
relics
of
a
recently
concluded
repast
*punct* ,
turned
round
to
us
and
said
*punct* ,
clam
or
cod
*punct* ?
*break*
what's
that
about
cods
*punct* ,
ma'am
*punct* ?
*break*
said
i
*punct* ,
with
much
politeness
*punct* .
*break*
clam
or
cod
*punct* ?
*break*
a
clam
for
supper
*punct* ?
*break*
a
cold
clam
*punct* ;
is
that
what
you
mean
*punct* ,
mrs.
hussey
*punct* ?
*break*
says
i
*punct* ;
but
that's
a
rather
cold
and
clammy
reception
in
the
winter
time
*punct* ,
ain't
it
*punct* ,
mrs
hussey
*punct* ?
*break*
but
being
in
a
great
hurry
to
resume
scolding
the
man
in
the
purple
shirt
*punct* ,
who
was
waiting
for
it
in
the
entry
*punct* ,
and
seeming
to
hear
nothing
but
the
word
clam
*punct* ,
mrs.
hussey
hurried
towards
an
open
door
leading
to
the
kitchen
*punct* ,
and
bawling
out
clam
for
two
*punct* ,
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
do
you
think
that
we
can
make
out
a
supper
for
us
both
on
one
clam
*punct* ?
*break*
however
*punct* ,
a
warm
savory
steam
from
the
kitchen
served
to
belie
the
apparently
cheerless
prospect
before
us
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
that
smoking
chowder
came
in
*punct* ,
the
mystery
was
delightfully
explained
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
sweet
friends
*punct* !
*break*
hearken
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
made
of
small
juicy
clams
*punct* ,
scarcely
bigger
than
hazel
nuts
*punct* ,
mixed
with
pounded
ship
biscuit
*punct* ,
and
salted
pork
cut
up
into
little
flakes
*punct* ;
the
whole
enriched
with
butter
*punct* ,
and
plentifully
seasoned
with
pepper
and
salt
*punct* .
*break*
our
appetites
being
sharpened
by
the
frosty
voyage
*punct* ,
and
in
particular
*punct* ,
queequeg
seeing
his
favorite
fishing
food
before
him
*punct* ,
and
the
chowder
being
surpassingly
excellent
*punct* ,
we
despatched
it
with
great
expedition
*punct* :
when
leaning
back
a
moment
and
bethinking
me
of
mrs.
hussey's
clam
and
cod
announcement
*punct* ,
i
thought
i
would
try
a
little
experiment
*punct* .
*break*
stepping
to
the
kitchen
door
*punct* ,
i
uttered
the
word
cod
with
great
emphasis
*punct* ,
and
resumed
my
seat
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
few
moments
the
savory
steam
came
forth
again
*punct* ,
but
with
a
different
flavor
*punct* ,
and
in
good
time
a
fine
cod-chowder
was
placed
before
us
*punct* .
*break*
what's
that
stultifying
saying
about
chowder-headed
people
*punct* ?
*break*
but
look
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
ain't
that
a
live
eel
in
your
bowl
*punct* ?
*break*
where's
your
harpoon
*punct* ?
*break*
fishiest
of
all
fishy
places
was
the
try
pots
*punct* ,
which
well
deserved
its
name
*punct* ;
for
the
pots
there
were
always
boiling
chowders
*punct* .
*break*
chowder
for
breakfast
*punct* ,
and
chowder
for
dinner
*punct* ,
and
chowder
for
supper
*punct* ,
till
you
began
to
look
for
fish-bones
coming
through
your
clothes
*punct* .
*break*
the
area
before
the
house
was
paved
with
clam-shells
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
hussey
wore
a
polished
necklace
of
codfish
vertebra
*punct* ;
and
hosea
hussey
had
his
account
books
bound
in
superior
old
shark-skin
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
fishy
flavor
to
the
milk
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
which
i
could
not
at
all
account
for
*punct* ,
till
one
morning
happening
to
take
a
stroll
along
the
beach
among
some
fishermen's
boats
*punct* ,
i
saw
hosea's
brindled
cow
feeding
on
fish
remnants
*punct* ,
and
marching
along
the
sand
with
each
foot
in
a
cod's
decapitated
head
*punct* ,
looking
very
slip-shod
*punct* ,
i
assure
ye
*punct* .
*break*
supper
concluded
*punct* ,
we
received
a
lamp
*punct* ,
and
directions
from
mrs.
hussey
concerning
the
nearest
way
to
bed
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
queequeg
was
about
to
precede
me
up
the
stairs
*punct* ,
the
lady
reached
forth
her
arm
*punct* ,
and
demanded
his
harpoon
*punct* ;
she
allowed
no
harpoon
in
her
chambers
*punct* .
*break*
said
i
*punct* ;
every
true
whaleman
sleeps
with
his
harpoon
*punct* ,
but
why
not
*punct* ?
*break*
because
it's
dangerous
*punct* ,
says
she
*punct* .
*break*
ever
since
young
stiggs
coming
from
that
unfort'nt
v'y'ge
of
his
*punct* ,
when
he
was
gone
four
years
and
a
half
*punct* ,
with
only
three
barrels
of
ile
*punct* ,
was
found
dead
in
my
first
floor
back
*punct* ,
with
his
harpoon
in
his
side
*punct* ;
ever
since
then
i
allow
no
boarders
to
take
sich
dangerous
weepons
in
their
rooms
at
night
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
mr.
queequeg
*punct* ,
for
she
had
learned
his
name
*punct* ,
i
will
just
take
this
here
iron
*punct* ,
and
keep
it
for
you
till
morning
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
chowder
*punct* ;
clam
or
cod
to-morrow
for
breakfast
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ?
*break*
but
to
my
surprise
and
no
small
concern
*punct* ,
queequeg
now
gave
me
to
understand
*punct* ,
that
he
had
been
diligently
consulting
yojo
*punct* ,
the
name
of
his
black
little
god
*punct* ,
and
yojo
had
told
him
two
or
three
times
over
*punct* ,
and
strongly
insisted
upon
it
everyway
*punct* ,
that
instead
of
our
going
together
among
the
whaling-fleet
in
harbor
*punct* ,
and
in
concert
selecting
our
craft
*punct* ;
instead
of
this
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
yojo
earnestly
enjoined
that
the
selection
of
the
ship
should
rest
wholly
with
me
*punct* ,
inasmuch
as
yojo
purposed
befriending
us
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
in
order
to
do
so
*punct* ,
had
already
pitched
upon
a
vessel
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
if
left
to
myself
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
ishmael
*punct* ,
should
infallibly
light
upon
*punct* ,
for
all
the
world
as
though
it
had
turned
out
by
chance
*punct* ;
and
in
that
vessel
i
must
immediately
ship
myself
*punct* ,
for
the
present
irrespective
of
queequeg
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
forgotten
to
mention
that
*punct* ,
in
many
things
*punct* ,
queequeg
placed
great
confidence
in
the
excellence
of
yojo's
judgment
and
surprising
forecast
of
things
*punct* ;
and
cherished
yojo
with
considerable
esteem
*punct* ,
as
a
rather
good
sort
of
god
*punct* ,
who
perhaps
meant
well
enough
upon
the
whole
*punct* ,
but
in
all
cases
did
not
succeed
in
his
benevolent
designs
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
this
plan
of
queequeg's
*punct* ,
or
rather
yojo's
*punct* ,
touching
the
selection
of
our
craft
*punct* ;
i
did
not
like
that
plan
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
not
a
little
relied
on
queequeg's
sagacity
to
point
out
the
whaler
best
fitted
to
carry
us
and
our
fortunes
securely
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
all
my
remonstrances
produced
no
effect
upon
queequeg
*punct* ,
i
was
obliged
to
acquiesce
*punct* ;
and
accordingly
prepared
to
set
about
this
business
with
a
determined
rushing
sort
of
energy
and
vigor
*punct* ,
that
should
quickly
settle
that
trifling
little
affair
*punct* .
*break*
after
much
prolonged
sauntering
and
many
random
inquiries
*punct* ,
i
learnt
that
there
were
three
ships
up
for
three-years
voyages
*punct* ,
the
devil-dam
the
tit-bit
*punct* ,
and
the
pequod
*punct* .
*break*
devil
*punct* -
dam
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
the
origin
of
*punct* ;
tit-bit
is
obvious
*punct* ;
pequod
*punct* ,
you
will
no
doubt
remember
*punct* ,
was
the
name
of
a
celebrated
tribe
of
massachusetts
indians
*punct* ,
now
extinct
as
the
ancient
medes
*punct* .
*break*
i
peered
and
pryed
about
the
devil-dam
*punct* ;
from
her
*punct* ,
hopped
over
to
the
tit-bit
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
finally
*punct* ,
going
on
board
the
pequod
*punct* ,
looked
around
her
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
and
then
decided
that
this
was
the
very
ship
for
us
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
have
seen
many
a
quaint
craft
in
your
day
*punct* ,
for
aught
i
know;
*punct* ,
squared-toed
luggers
*punct* ;
mountainous
japanese
junks
*punct* ;
butter-box
galliots
*punct* ,
and
what
not
*punct* ;
but
take
my
word
for
it
*punct* ,
you
never
saw
such
a
rare
old
craft
as
this
same
rare
old
pequod
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
a
ship
of
the
old
school
*punct* ,
rather
small
if
anything
*punct* ;
with
an
old
fashioned
claw-footed
look
about
her
*punct* .
*break*
long
seasoned
and
weather-stained
in
the
typhoons
and
calms
of
all
four
oceans
*punct* ,
her
old
hull's
complexion
was
darkened
like
a
french
grenadier's
*punct* ,
who
has
alike
fought
in
egypt
and
siberia
*punct* .
*break*
her
venerable
bows
looked
bearded
*punct* .
*break*
her
masts
*punct* ,
cut
somewhere
on
the
coast
of
japan
*punct* ,
where
her
original
ones
were
lost
overboard
in
a
gale
*punct* ,
her
masts
stood
stiffly
up
like
the
spines
of
the
three
old
kings
of
cologne
*punct* .
*break*
her
ancient
decks
were
worn
and
wrinkled
*punct* ,
like
the
pilgrim-worshipped
flag-stone
in
canterbury
cathedral
where
beckett
bled
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
all
these
her
old
antiquities
*punct* ,
were
added
new
and
marvellous
features
*punct* ,
pertaining
to
the
wild
business
that
for
more
than
half
a
century
she
had
followed
*punct* .
*break*
old
captain
peleg
*punct* ,
many
years
her
chief-mate
*punct* ,
before
he
commanded
another
vessel
of
his
own
*punct* ,
and
now
a
retired
seaman
*punct* ,
and
one
of
the
principal
owners
of
the
pequod,
*punct* ,
this
old
peleg
*punct* ,
during
the
term
of
his
chief-mateship
*punct* ,
had
built
upon
her
original
grotesqueness
*punct* ,
and
inlaid
it
*punct* ,
all
over
*punct* ,
with
a
quaintness
both
of
material
and
device
*punct* ,
unmatched
by
anything
except
it
be
thorkill-hake's
carved
buckler
or
bedstead
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
a
thing
of
trophies
*punct* .
*break*
a
cannibal
of
a
craft
*punct* ,
tricking
herself
forth
in
the
chased
bones
of
her
enemies
*punct* .
*break*
all
round
*punct* ,
her
unpanelled
*punct* ,
open
bulwarks
were
garnished
like
one
continuous
jaw
*punct* ,
with
the
long
sharp
teeth
of
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
inserted
there
for
pins
*punct* ,
to
fasten
her
old
hempen
thews
and
tendons
to
*punct* .
*break*
those
thews
ran
not
through
base
blocks
of
land
wood
*punct* ,
but
deftly
travelled
over
sheaves
of
sea-ivory
*punct* .
*break*
scorning
a
turnstile
wheel
at
her
reverend
helm
*punct* ,
she
sported
there
a
tiller
*punct* ;
and
that
tiller
was
in
one
mass
*punct* ,
curiously
carved
from
the
long
narrow
lower
jaw
of
her
hereditary
foe
*punct* .
*break*
the
helmsman
who
steered
by
that
tiller
in
a
tempest
*punct* ,
felt
like
the
tartar
*punct* ,
when
he
holds
back
his
fiery
steed
by
clutching
its
jaw
*punct* .
*break*
a
noble
craft
*punct* ,
but
somehow
a
most
melancholy
*punct* !
*break*
all
noble
things
are
touched
with
that
*punct* .
*break*
now
when
i
looked
about
the
quarter-deck
*punct* ,
for
some
one
having
authority
*punct* ,
in
order
to
propose
myself
as
a
candidate
for
the
voyage
*punct* ,
at
first
i
saw
nobody
*punct* ;
but
i
could
not
well
overlook
a
strange
sort
of
tent
*punct* ,
or
rather
wigwam
*punct* ,
pitched
a
little
behind
the
main-mast
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
only
a
temporary
erection
used
in
port
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
of
a
conical
shape
*punct* ,
some
ten
feet
high
*punct* ;
consisting
of
the
long
*punct* ,
huge
slabs
of
limber
black
bone
taken
from
the
middle
and
highest
part
of
the
jaws
of
the
right-whale
*punct* .
*break*
planted
with
their
broad
ends
on
the
deck
*punct* ,
a
circle
of
these
slabs
laced
together
*punct* ,
mutually
sloped
towards
each
other
*punct* ,
and
at
the
apex
united
in
a
tufted
point
*punct* ,
where
the
loose
hairy
fibres
waved
to
and
fro
like
a
top-knot
on
some
old
pottowotamie
sachem's
head
*punct* .
*break*
a
triangular
opening
faced
towards
the
bows
of
the
ship
*punct* ,
so
that
the
insider
commanded
a
complete
view
forward
*punct* .
*break*
and
half
concealed
in
this
queer
tenement
*punct* ,
i
at
length
found
one
who
by
his
aspect
seemed
to
have
authority
*punct* ;
and
who
*punct* ,
it
being
noon
*punct* ,
and
the
ship's
work
suspended
*punct* ,
was
now
enjoying
respite
from
the
burden
of
command
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
seated
on
an
old-fashioned
oaken
chair
*punct* ,
wriggling
all
over
with
curious
carving
*punct* ;
and
the
bottom
of
which
was
formed
of
a
stout
interlacing
of
the
same
elastic
stuff
of
which
the
wigwam
was
constructed
*punct* .
*break*
such
eye-wrinkles
are
very
effectual
in
a
scowl
*punct* .
*break*
is
this
the
captain
of
the
pequod
*punct* ?
*break*
said
i
*punct* ,
advancing
to
the
door
of
the
tent
*punct* .
*break*
supposing
it
be
the
captain
of
the
pequod
*punct* ,
what
dost
thou
want
of
him
*punct* ?
*break*
i
was
thinking
of
shipping
*punct* .
*break*
thou
wast
*punct* ,
wast
thou
*punct* ?
*break*
i
see
thou
are
no
nantucketer
*punct* ,
ever
been
in
a
stove
boat
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
i
never
have
*punct* .
*break*
dost
know
nothing
at
all
about
whaling
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
nothing
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
but
i
have
no
doubt
i
shall
soon
learn
*punct* .
*break*
i've
been
several
voyages
in
the
merchant
service
*punct* ,
and
i
think
that
*punct* ,
merchant
service
be
damned
*punct* .
*break*
talk
not
that
lingo
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
dost
see
that
leg?
*punct* ,
i'll
take
that
leg
away
from
thy
stern
*punct* ,
if
ever
thou
talkest
of
the
marchant
service
to
me
again
*punct* .
*break*
marchant
service
indeed
*punct* !
*break*
i
suppose
now
ye
feel
considerable
proud
of
having
served
in
those
marchant
ships
*punct* .
*break*
man
*punct* ,
what
makes
thee
want
to
go
a
whaling
*punct* ,
eh?
*punct* ,
it
looks
a
little
suspicious
*punct* ,
don't
it
*punct* ,
eh?
*punct* ,
hast
not
been
a
pirate
*punct* ,
hast
thou?
*punct* ,
didst
not
rob
thy
last
captain
*punct* ,
didst
thou?
*punct* ,
dost
not
think
of
murdering
the
officers
when
thou
gettest
to
sea
*punct* ?
*break*
i
protested
my
innocence
of
these
things
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
that
under
the
mask
of
these
half
humorous
inuendoes
*punct* ,
this
old
seaman
*punct* ,
as
an
insulated
quakerish
nantucketer
*punct* ,
was
full
of
his
insular
prejudices
*punct* ,
and
rather
distrustful
of
all
aliens
*punct* ,
unless
they
hailed
from
cape
cod
or
the
vineyard
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
takes
thee
a-whaling
*punct* ?
*break*
i
want
to
know
that
before
i
think
of
shipping
ye
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
i
want
to
see
what
whaling
is
*punct* .
*break*
i
want
to
see
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
want
to
see
what
whaling
is
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
have
ye
clapped
eye
on
captain
ahab
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
i
thought
so
*punct* .
*break*
captain
ahab
is
the
captain
of
this
ship
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
mistaken
then
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
i
was
speaking
to
the
captain
himself
*punct* .
*break*
thou
art
speaking
to
captain
peleg
*punct* ,
that's
who
ye
are
speaking
to
*punct* ,
young
man
*punct* .
*break*
it
belongs
to
me
and
captain
bildad
to
see
the
pequod
fitted
out
for
the
voyage
*punct* ,
and
supplied
with
all
her
needs
*punct* ,
including
crew
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
part
owners
and
agents
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
i
was
going
to
say
*punct* ,
if
thou
wantest
to
know
what
whaling
is
*punct* ,
as
thou
tellest
ye
do
*punct* ,
i
can
put
ye
in
a
way
of
finding
it
out
before
ye
bind
yourself
to
it
*punct* ,
past
backing
out
*punct* .
*break*
clap
eye
on
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
young
man
*punct* ,
and
thou
wilt
find
that
he
has
only
one
leg
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
mean
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
was
the
other
one
lost
by
a
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
lost
by
a
whale
*punct* !
*break*
young
man
*punct* ,
come
nearer
to
me
*punct* :
it
was
devoured
*punct* ,
chewed
up
*punct* ,
crunched
by
the
monstrousest
parmacetty
that
ever
chipped
a
boat!
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* ,
ah
*punct* !
*break*
i
was
a
little
alarmed
by
his
energy
*punct* ,
perhaps
also
a
little
touched
at
the
hearty
grief
in
his
concluding
exclamation
*punct* ,
but
said
as
calmly
as
i
could
*punct* ,
what
you
say
is
no
doubt
true
enough
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
but
how
could
i
know
there
was
any
peculiar
ferocity
in
that
particular
whale
*punct* ,
though
indeed
i
might
have
inferred
as
much
from
the
simple
fact
of
the
accident
*punct* .
*break*
look
ye
now
*punct* ,
young
man
*punct* ,
thy
lungs
are
a
sort
of
soft
*punct* ,
d'ye
see
*punct* ;
thou
dost
not
talk
shark
a
bit
*punct* .
*break*
sure
*punct* ,
ye've
been
to
sea
before
now
*punct* ;
sure
of
that
*punct* ?
*break*
sir
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
i
thought
i
told
you
that
i
had
been
four
voyages
in
the
merchant
*punct* ,
hard
down
out
of
that
*punct* !
*break*
mind
what
i
said
about
the
marchant
service
*punct* ,
don't
aggravate
me
*punct* ,
i
won't
have
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
let
us
understand
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
given
thee
a
hint
about
what
whaling
is
*punct* ;
do
ye
yet
feel
inclined
for
it
*punct* ?
*break*
i
do
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
art
thou
the
man
to
pitch
a
harpoon
down
a
live
whale's
throat
*punct* ,
and
then
jump
after
it
*punct* ?
*break*
answer
*punct* ,
quick
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
if
it
should
be
positively
indispensable
to
do
so
*punct* ;
not
to
be
got
rid
of
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ;
which
i
don't
take
to
be
the
fact
*punct* .
*break*
was
not
that
what
ye
said
*punct* ?
*break*
i
thought
so
*punct* .
*break*
well
then
*punct* ,
just
step
forward
there
*punct* ,
and
take
a
peep
over
the
weather-bow
*punct* ,
and
then
back
to
me
and
tell
me
what
ye
see
there
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
i
stood
a
little
puzzled
by
this
curious
request
*punct* ,
not
knowing
exactly
how
to
take
it
*punct* ,
whether
humorously
or
in
earnest
*punct* .
*break*
but
concentrating
all
his
crow's
feet
into
one
scowl
*punct* ,
captain
peleg
started
me
on
the
errand
*punct* .
*break*
going
forward
and
glancing
over
the
weather
bow
*punct* ,
i
perceived
that
the
ship
swinging
to
her
anchor
with
the
flood-tide
*punct* ,
was
now
obliquely
pointing
towards
the
open
ocean
*punct* .
*break*
the
prospect
was
unlimited
*punct* ,
but
exceedingly
monotonous
and
forbidding
*punct* ;
not
the
slightest
variety
that
i
could
see
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
what's
the
report
*punct* ?
*break*
said
peleg
when
i
came
back
*punct* ;
what
did
ye
see
*punct* ?
*break*
not
much
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* ,
nothing
but
water
*punct* ;
considerable
horizon
though
*punct* ,
and
there's
a
squall
coming
up
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
what
dost
thou
think
then
of
seeing
the
world
*punct* ?
*break*
do
ye
wish
to
go
round
cape
horn
to
see
any
more
of
it
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
can't
ye
see
the
world
where
you
stand
*punct* ?
*break*
i
was
a
little
staggered
*punct* ,
but
go
a-whaling
i
must
*punct* ,
and
i
would
*punct* ;
and
the
pequod
was
as
good
a
ship
as
any
*punct* ,
i
thought
the
best
*punct* ,
and
all
this
i
now
repeated
to
peleg
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
me
so
determined
*punct* ,
he
expressed
his
willingness
to
ship
me
*punct* .
*break*
and
thou
mayest
as
well
sign
the
papers
right
off
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* ,
come
along
with
ye
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
saying
*punct* ,
he
led
the
way
below
deck
into
the
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
seated
on
the
transom
was
what
seemed
to
me
a
most
uncommon
and
surprising
figure
*punct* .
*break*
it
turned
out
to
be
captain
bildad
*punct* ,
who
along
with
captain
peleg
was
one
of
the
largest
owners
of
the
vessel
*punct* ;
the
other
shares
*punct* ,
as
is
sometimes
the
case
in
these
ports
*punct* ,
being
held
by
a
crowd
of
old
annuitants
*punct* ;
widows
*punct* ,
fatherless
children
*punct* ,
and
chancery
wards
*punct* ;
each
owning
about
the
value
of
a
timber
head
*punct* ,
or
a
foot
of
plank
*punct* ,
or
a
nail
or
two
in
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
people
in
nantucket
invest
their
money
in
whaling
vessels
*punct* ,
the
same
way
that
you
do
yours
in
approved
state
stocks
bringing
in
good
interest
*punct* .
*break*
for
some
of
these
same
quakers
are
the
most
sanguinary
of
all
sailors
and
whale-hunters
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
fighting
quakers
*punct* ;
they
are
quakers
with
a
vengeance
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
there
are
instances
among
them
of
men
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
named
with
scripture
names
*punct* ,
a
singularly
common
fashion
on
the
island
*punct* ,
and
in
childhood
naturally
imbibing
the
stately
dramatic
thee
and
thou
of
the
quaker
idiom
*punct* ;
still
*punct* ,
from
the
audacious
*punct* ,
daring
*punct* ,
and
boundless
adventure
of
their
subsequent
lives
*punct* ,
strangely
blend
with
these
unoutgrown
peculiarities
*punct* ,
a
thousand
bold
dashes
of
character
*punct* ,
not
unworthy
a
scandinavian
sea-king
*punct* ,
or
a
poetical
pagan
roman
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
these
things
unite
in
a
man
of
greatly
superior
natural
force
*punct* ,
with
a
globular
brain
and
a
ponderous
heart
*punct* ;
who
has
also
by
the
stillness
and
seclusion
of
many
long
night-watches
in
the
remotest
waters
*punct* ,
and
beneath
constellations
never
seen
here
at
the
north
*punct* ,
been
led
to
think
untraditionally
and
independently
*punct* ;
receiving
all
nature's
sweet
or
savage
impressions
fresh
from
her
own
virgin
voluntary
and
confiding
breast
*punct* ,
and
thereby
chiefly
*punct* ,
but
with
some
help
from
accidental
advantages
*punct* ,
to
learn
a
bold
and
nervous
lofty
language
*punct* ,
that
man
makes
one
in
a
whole
nation's
census
*punct* ,
a
mighty
pageant
creature
*punct* ,
formed
for
noble
tragedies
*punct* .
*break*
nor
will
it
at
all
detract
from
him
*punct* ,
dramatically
regarded
*punct* ,
if
either
by
birth
or
other
circumstances
*punct* ,
he
have
what
seems
a
half
wilful
overruling
morbidness
at
the
bottom
of
his
nature
*punct* .
*break*
for
all
men
tragically
great
are
made
so
through
a
certain
morbidness
*punct* .
*break*
be
sure
of
this
*punct* ,
o
young
ambition
*punct* ,
all
mortal
greatness
is
but
disease
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
yet
we
have
not
to
do
with
such
an
one
*punct* ,
but
with
quite
another
*punct* ;
and
still
a
man
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
if
indeed
peculiar
*punct* ,
it
only
results
again
from
another
phase
of
the
quaker
*punct* ,
modified
by
individual
circumstances
*punct* .
*break*
like
captain
peleg
*punct* ,
captain
bildad
was
a
well-to-do
*punct* ,
retired
whaleman
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
for
all
this
immutableness
*punct* ,
was
there
some
lack
of
common
consistency
about
worthy
captain
bildad
*punct* .
*break*
though
refusing
*punct* ,
from
conscientious
scruples
*punct* ,
to
bear
arms
against
land
invaders
*punct* ,
yet
himself
had
illimitably
invaded
the
atlantic
and
pacific
*punct* ;
and
though
a
sworn
foe
to
human
bloodshed
*punct* ,
yet
had
he
in
his
straight-bodied
coat
*punct* ,
spilled
tuns
upon
tuns
of
leviathan
gore
*punct* .
*break*
how
now
in
the
contemplative
evening
of
his
days
*punct* ,
the
pious
bildad
reconciled
these
things
in
the
reminiscence
*punct* ,
i
do
not
know
*punct* ;
but
it
did
not
seem
to
concern
him
much
*punct* ,
and
very
probably
he
had
long
since
come
to
the
sage
and
sensible
conclusion
that
a
man's
religion
is
one
thing
*punct* ,
and
this
practical
world
quite
another
*punct* .
*break*
this
world
pays
dividends
*punct* .
*break*
rising
from
a
little
cabin-boy
in
short
clothes
of
the
drabbest
drab
*punct* ,
to
a
harpooneer
in
a
broad
shad-bellied
waistcoat
*punct* ;
from
that
becoming
boat-header
*punct* ,
chief-mate
*punct* ,
and
captain
*punct* ,
and
finally
a
ship-owner
*punct* ;
bildad
*punct* ,
as
i
hinted
before
*punct* ,
had
concluded
his
adventurous
career
by
wholly
retiring
from
active
life
at
the
goodly
age
of
sixty
*punct* ,
and
dedicating
his
remaining
days
to
the
quiet
receiving
of
his
well-earned
income
*punct* .
*break*
now
bildad
*punct* ,
i
am
sorry
to
say
*punct* ,
had
the
reputation
of
being
an
incorrigible
old
hunks
*punct* ,
and
in
his
sea-going
days
*punct* ,
a
bitter
*punct* ,
hard
task-master
*punct* .
*break*
they
told
me
in
nantucket
*punct* ,
though
it
certainly
seems
a
curious
story
*punct* ,
that
when
he
sailed
the
old
categut
whaleman
*punct* ,
his
crew
*punct* ,
upon
arriving
home
*punct* ,
were
mostly
all
carried
ashore
to
the
hospital
*punct* ,
sore
exhausted
and
worn
out
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
pious
man
*punct* ,
especially
for
a
quaker
*punct* ,
he
was
certainly
rather
hard-hearted
to
say
the
least
*punct* .
*break*
he
never
used
to
swear
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
at
his
men
*punct* ,
they
said
*punct* ;
but
somehow
he
got
an
inordinate
quantity
of
cruel
*punct* ,
unmitigated
hard
work
out
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
when
bildad
was
a
chief-mate
*punct* ,
to
have
his
drab-colored
eye
intently
looking
at
you
*punct* ,
made
you
feel
completely
nervous
*punct* ,
till
you
could
clutch
something
*punct* ,
a
hammer
or
a
marling-spike
*punct* ,
and
go
to
work
like
mad
*punct* ,
at
something
or
other
*punct* ,
never
mind
what
*punct* .
*break*
his
own
person
was
the
exact
embodiment
of
his
utilitarian
character
*punct* .
*break*
on
his
long
*punct* ,
gaunt
body
*punct* ,
he
carried
no
spare
flesh
*punct* ,
no
superfluous
beard
*punct* ,
his
chin
having
a
soft
*punct* ,
economical
nap
to
it
*punct* ,
like
the
worn
nap
of
his
broad-brimmed
hat
*punct* .
*break*
such
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
was
the
person
that
i
saw
seated
on
the
transom
when
i
followed
captain
peleg
down
into
the
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
the
space
between
the
decks
was
small
*punct* ;
and
there
*punct* ,
bolt-upright
*punct* ,
sat
old
bildad
*punct* ,
who
always
sat
so
*punct* ,
and
never
leaned
*punct* ,
and
this
to
save
his
coat
tails
*punct* .
*break*
his
broad-brim
was
placed
beside
him
*punct* ;
his
legs
were
stiffly
crossed
*punct* ;
his
drab
vesture
was
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
*punct* ;
and
spectacles
on
nose
*punct* ,
he
seemed
absorbed
in
reading
from
a
ponderous
volume
*punct* .
*break*
bildad
*punct* ,
cried
captain
peleg
*punct* ,
at
it
again
*punct* ,
bildad
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
ye
have
been
studying
those
scriptures
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
for
the
last
thirty
years
*punct* ,
to
my
certain
knowledge
*punct* .
*break*
how
far
ye
got
*punct* ,
bildad
*punct* ?
*break*
as
if
long
habituated
to
such
profane
talk
from
his
old
shipmate
*punct* ,
bildad
*punct* ,
without
noticing
his
present
irreverence
*punct* ,
quietly
looked
up
*punct* ,
and
seeing
me
*punct* ,
glanced
again
inquiringly
towards
peleg
*punct* .
*break*
he
says
he's
our
man
*punct* ,
bildad
*punct* ,
said
peleg
*punct* ,
he
wants
to
ship
*punct* .
*break*
said
bildad
*punct* ,
in
a
hollow
tone
*punct* ,
and
turning
round
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
dost
*punct* ,
said
i
unconsciously
*punct* ,
he
was
so
intense
a
quaker
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
ye
think
of
him
*punct* ,
bildad
*punct* ?
*break*
he'll
do
*punct* ,
said
bildad
*punct* ,
eyeing
me
*punct* ,
and
then
went
on
spelling
away
at
his
book
in
a
mumbling
tone
quite
audible
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
him
the
queerest
old
quaker
i
ever
saw
*punct* ,
especially
as
peleg
*punct* ,
his
friend
and
old
shipmate
*punct* ,
seemed
such
a
blusterer
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
said
nothing
*punct* ,
only
looking
round
me
sharply
*punct* .
*break*
peleg
now
threw
open
a
chest
*punct* ,
and
drawing
forth
the
ship's
articles
*punct* ,
placed
pen
and
ink
before
him
*punct* ,
and
seated
himself
at
a
little
table
*punct* .
*break*
i
began
to
think
it
was
high
time
to
settle
with
myself
at
what
terms
i
would
be
willing
to
engage
for
the
voyage
*punct* .
*break*
and
though
the
275th
lay
was
what
they
call
a
rather
long
lay
*punct* ,
yet
it
was
better
than
nothing
*punct* ;
and
if
we
had
a
lucky
voyage
*punct* ,
might
pretty
nearly
pay
for
the
clothing
i
would
wear
out
on
it
*punct* ,
not
to
speak
of
my
three
years
beef
and
board
*punct* ,
for
which
i
would
not
have
to
pay
one
stiver
*punct* .
*break*
it
might
be
thought
that
this
was
a
poor
way
to
accumulate
a
princely
fortune
*punct* ,
and
so
it
was
*punct* ,
a
very
poor
way
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
am
one
of
those
that
never
take
on
about
princely
fortunes
*punct* ,
and
am
quite
content
if
the
world
is
ready
to
board
and
lodge
me
*punct* ,
while
i
am
putting
up
at
this
grim
sign
of
the
thunder
cloud
*punct* .
*break*
upon
the
whole
*punct* ,
i
thought
that
the
275th
lay
would
be
about
the
fair
thing
*punct* ,
but
would
not
have
been
surprised
had
i
been
offered
the
200th
*punct* ,
considering
i
was
of
a
broad-shouldered
make
*punct* .
*break*
but
one
thing
*punct* ,
nevertheless
*punct* ,
that
made
me
a
little
distrustful
about
receiving
a
generous
share
of
the
profits
was
this
*punct* :
ashore
*punct* ,
i
had
heard
something
of
both
captain
peleg
and
his
unaccountable
old
crony
bildad
*punct* ;
how
that
they
being
the
principal
proprietors
of
the
pequod
*punct* ,
therefore
the
other
and
more
inconsiderable
and
scattered
owners
*punct* ,
left
nearly
the
whole
management
of
the
ship's
affairs
to
these
two
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
did
not
know
but
what
the
stingy
old
bildad
might
have
a
mighty
deal
to
say
about
shipping
hands
*punct* ,
especially
as
i
now
found
him
on
board
the
pequod
*punct* ,
quite
at
home
there
in
the
cabin
*punct* ,
and
reading
his
bible
as
if
at
his
own
fireside
*punct* .
*break*
now
while
peleg
was
vainly
trying
to
mend
a
pen
with
his
jack-knife
*punct* ,
old
bildad
*punct* ,
to
my
no
small
surprise
*punct* ,
considering
that
he
was
such
an
interested
party
in
these
proceedings
*punct* ;
bildad
never
heeded
us
*punct* ,
but
went
on
mumbling
to
himself
out
of
his
book
*punct* ,
lay
not
up
for
yourselves
treasures
upon
earth
*punct* ,
where
moth
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
captain
bildad
*punct* ,
interrupted
peleg
*punct* ,
what
d'ye
say
*punct* ,
what
lay
shall
we
give
this
young
man
*punct* ?
*break*
the
seven
hundred
and
seventy-seventh
*punct* !
*break*
well
*punct* ,
old
bildad
*punct* ,
you
are
determined
that
i
*punct* ,
for
one
*punct* ,
shall
not
lay
up
many
lays
here
below
*punct* ,
where
moth
and
rust
do
corrupt
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
an
exceedingly
long
lay
that
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ;
and
though
from
the
magnitude
of
the
figure
it
might
at
first
deceive
a
landsman
*punct* ,
yet
the
slightest
consideration
will
show
that
though
seven
hundred
and
seventy-seven
is
a
pretty
large
number
*punct* ,
yet
*punct* ,
when
you
come
to
make
a
teenth
of
it
*punct* ,
you
will
then
see
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
that
the
seven
hundred
and
seventy-seventh
part
of
a
farthing
is
a
good
deal
less
than
seven
hundred
and
seventy-seven
gold
doubloons
*punct* ;
and
so
i
thought
at
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
blast
your
eyes
*punct* ,
bildad
*punct* ,
cried
peleg
*punct* ,
thou
dost
not
want
to
swindle
this
young
man
*punct* !
*break*
he
must
have
more
than
that
*punct* .
*break*
seven
hundred
and
seventy-seventh
*punct* ,
again
said
bildad
*punct* ,
without
lifting
his
eyes
*punct* ;
and
then
went
on
mumbling
*punct* ,
for
where
your
treasure
is
*punct* ,
there
will
your
heart
be
also
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
going
to
put
him
down
for
the
three
hundredth
*punct* ,
said
peleg
*punct* ,
do
ye
hear
that
*punct* ,
bildad
*punct* !
*break*
the
three
hundredth
lay
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* .
*break*
bildad
laid
down
his
book
*punct* ,
and
turning
solemnly
towards
him
said
*punct* ,
captain
peleg
*punct* ,
thou
hast
a
generous
heart
*punct* ;
but
thou
must
consider
the
duty
thou
owest
to
the
other
owners
of
this
ship
*punct* ,
widows
and
orphans
*punct* ,
many
of
them
*punct* ,
and
that
if
we
too
abundantly
reward
the
labors
of
this
young
man
*punct* ,
we
may
be
taking
the
bread
from
those
widows
and
those
orphans
*punct* .
*break*
the
seven
hundred
and
seventy-seventh
lay
*punct* ,
captain
peleg
*punct* .
*break*
roared
peleg
*punct* ,
starting
up
and
clattering
about
the
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
blast
ye
*punct* ,
captain
bildad
*punct* ,
if
i
had
followed
thy
advice
in
these
matters
*punct* ,
i
would
afore
now
had
a
conscience
to
lug
about
that
would
be
heavy
enough
to
founder
the
largest
ship
that
ever
sailed
round
cape
horn
*punct* .
*break*
ye
insult
me
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ;
past
all
natural
bearing
*punct* ,
ye
insult
me
*punct* .
*break*
it's
an
all-fired
outrage
to
tell
any
human
creature
that
he's
bound
to
hell
*punct* .
*break*
flukes
and
flames
*punct* !
*break*
bildad
*punct* ,
say
that
again
to
me
*punct* ,
and
start
my
soul-bolts
*punct* ,
but
i'll
*punct* ,
i'll
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
i'll
swallow
a
live
goat
with
all
his
hair
and
horns
on
*punct* .
*break*
out
of
the
cabin
*punct* ,
ye
canting
*punct* ,
drab-colored
son
of
a
wooden
gun
*punct* ,
a
straight
wake
with
ye
*punct* !
*break*
as
he
thundered
out
this
he
made
a
rush
at
bildad
*punct* ,
but
with
a
marvellous
oblique
*punct* ,
sliding
celerity
*punct* ,
bildad
for
that
time
eluded
him
*punct* .
*break*
alarmed
at
this
terrible
outburst
between
the
two
principal
and
responsible
owners
of
the
ship
*punct* ,
and
feeling
half
a
mind
to
give
up
all
idea
of
sailing
in
a
vessel
so
questionably
owned
and
temporarily
commanded
*punct* ,
i
stepped
aside
from
the
door
to
give
egress
to
bildad
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
i
made
no
doubt
*punct* ,
was
all
eagerness
to
vanish
from
before
the
awakened
wrath
of
peleg
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
my
astonishment
*punct* ,
he
sat
down
again
on
the
transom
very
quietly
*punct* ,
and
seemed
to
have
not
the
slightest
intention
of
withdrawing
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
quite
used
to
impenitent
peleg
and
his
ways
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
peleg
*punct* ,
after
letting
off
his
rage
as
he
had
*punct* ,
there
seemed
no
more
left
in
him
*punct* ,
and
he
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
sat
down
like
a
lamb
*punct* ,
though
he
twitched
a
little
as
if
still
nervously
agitated
*punct* .
*break*
he
whistled
at
last
*punct* ,
the
squall's
gone
off
to
leeward
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* .
*break*
bildad
*punct* ,
thou
used
to
be
good
at
sharpening
a
lance
*punct* ,
mend
that
pen
*punct* ,
will
ye
*punct* .
*break*
my
jack-knife
here
needs
the
grindstone
*punct* .
*break*
that's
he
*punct* ;
thank
ye
*punct* ,
bildad
*punct* .
*break*
now
then
*punct* ,
my
young
man
*punct* ,
ishmael's
thy
name
*punct* ,
didn't
ye
say
*punct* ?
*break*
well
then
*punct* ,
down
ye
go
here
*punct* ,
ishmael
*punct* ,
for
the
three
hundredth
lay
*punct* .
*break*
captain
peleg
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
i
have
a
friend
with
me
who
wants
to
ship
too
*punct* ,
shall
i
bring
him
down
to-morrow
*punct* ?
*break*
to
be
sure
*punct* ,
said
peleg
*punct* .
*break*
fetch
him
along
*punct* ,
and
we'll
look
at
him
*punct* .
*break*
what
lay
does
he
want
*punct* ?
*break*
groaned
bildad
*punct* ,
glancing
up
from
the
book
in
which
he
had
again
been
burying
himself
*punct* .
*break*
never
thee
mind
about
that
*punct* ,
bildad
*punct* ,
said
peleg
*punct* .
*break*
has
he
ever
whaled
it
any
*punct* ?
*break*
turning
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
killed
more
whales
than
i
can
count
*punct* ,
captain
peleg
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
had
not
proceeded
far
*punct* ,
when
i
began
to
bethink
me
that
the
captain
with
whom
i
was
to
sail
yet
remained
unseen
by
me
*punct* ;
though
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
in
many
cases
*punct* ,
a
whale-ship
will
be
completely
fitted
out
*punct* ,
and
receive
all
her
crew
on
board
*punct* ,
ere
the
captain
makes
himself
visible
by
arriving
to
take
command
*punct* ;
for
sometimes
these
voyages
are
so
prolonged
*punct* ,
and
the
shore
intervals
at
home
so
exceedingly
brief
*punct* ,
that
if
the
captain
have
a
family
*punct* ,
or
any
absorbing
concernment
of
that
sort
*punct* ,
he
does
not
trouble
himself
much
about
his
ship
in
port
*punct* ,
but
leaves
her
to
the
owners
till
all
is
ready
for
sea
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
it
is
always
as
well
to
have
a
look
at
him
before
irrevocably
committing
yourself
into
his
hands
*punct* .
*break*
turning
back
i
accosted
captain
peleg
*punct* ,
inquiring
where
captain
ahab
was
to
be
found
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
dost
thou
want
of
captain
ahab
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
all
right
enough
*punct* ;
thou
art
shipped
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
but
i
should
like
to
see
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
don't
think
thou
wilt
be
able
to
at
present
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
exactly
what's
the
matter
with
him
*punct* ;
but
he
keeps
close
inside
the
house
*punct* ;
a
sort
of
sick
*punct* ,
and
yet
he
don't
look
so
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
he
ain't
sick
*punct* ;
but
no
*punct* ,
he
isn't
well
either
*punct* .
*break*
any
how
*punct* ,
young
man
*punct* ,
he
won't
always
see
me
*punct* ,
so
i
don't
suppose
he
will
thee
*punct* .
*break*
he's
a
queer
man
*punct* ,
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
so
some
think
*punct* ,
but
a
good
one
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
thou'lt
like
him
well
enough
*punct* ;
no
fear
*punct* ,
no
fear
*punct* .
*break*
he's
a
grand
*punct* ,
ungodly
*punct* ,
god-like
man
*punct* ,
captain
ahab
*punct* ;
doesn't
speak
much
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
when
he
does
speak
*punct* ,
then
you
may
well
listen
*punct* .
*break*
mark
ye
*punct* ,
be
forewarned
*punct* ;
ahab's
above
the
common
*punct* ;
ahab's
been
in
colleges
*punct* ,
as
well
as
mong
the
cannibals
*punct* ;
been
used
to
deeper
wonders
than
the
waves
*punct* ;
fixed
his
fiery
lance
in
mightier
stranger
foes
than
whales
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
the
keenest
and
the
surest
that
out
of
all
our
isle
*punct* !
*break*
he
ain't
captain
bildad
*punct* ;
no
*punct* ,
and
he
ain't
captain
peleg
*punct* ;
he's
ahab
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* ;
and
ahab
of
old
*punct* ,
thou
knowest
*punct* ,
was
a
crowned
king
*punct* !
*break*
and
a
very
vile
one
*punct* .
*break*
when
that
wicked
king
was
slain
*punct* ,
the
dogs
*punct* ,
did
they
not
lick
his
blood
*punct* ?
*break*
look
ye
*punct* ,
lad
*punct* ;
never
say
that
on
board
the
pequod
*punct* .
*break*
never
say
it
anywhere
*punct* .
*break*
captain
ahab
did
not
name
himself
*punct* .
*break*
twas
a
foolish
*punct* ,
ignorant
whim
of
his
crazy
*punct* ,
widowed
mother
*punct* ,
who
died
when
he
was
only
a
twelvemonth
old
*punct* .
*break*
and
yet
the
old
squaw
tistig
*punct* ,
at
gayhead
*punct* ,
said
that
the
name
would
somehow
prove
prophetic
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
other
fools
like
her
may
tell
thee
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
i
wish
to
warn
thee
*punct* .
*break*
it's
a
lie
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
captain
ahab
well
*punct* ;
i've
sailed
with
him
as
mate
years
ago
*punct* ;
i
know
what
he
is
*punct* ,
a
good
man
*punct* ,
not
a
pious
*punct* ,
good
man
*punct* ,
like
bildad
*punct* ,
but
a
swearing
good
man
*punct* ,
something
like
me
*punct* ,
only
there's
a
good
deal
more
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
i
know
that
he
was
never
very
jolly
*punct* ;
and
i
know
that
on
the
passage
home
*punct* ,
he
was
a
little
out
of
his
mind
for
a
spell
*punct* ;
but
it
was
the
sharp
shooting
pains
in
his
bleeding
stump
that
brought
that
about
*punct* ,
as
any
one
might
see
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
that
ever
since
he
lost
his
leg
last
voyage
by
that
accursed
whale
*punct* ,
he's
been
a
kind
of
moody
*punct* ,
desperate
moody
*punct* ,
and
savage
sometimes
*punct* ;
but
that
will
all
pass
off
*punct* .
*break*
and
once
for
all
*punct* ,
let
me
tell
thee
and
assure
thee
*punct* ,
young
man
*punct* ,
it's
better
to
sail
with
a
moody
good
captain
than
a
laughing
bad
one
*punct* .
*break*
so
good-bye
to
thee
*punct* ,
and
wrong
not
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
because
he
happens
to
have
a
wicked
name
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
my
boy
*punct* ,
he
has
a
wife
*punct* ,
not
three
voyages
wedded
*punct* ,
a
sweet
*punct* ,
resigned
girl
*punct* .
*break*
think
of
that
*punct* ;
by
that
sweet
girl
that
old
man
has
a
child
*punct* :
hold
ye
then
there
can
be
any
utter
*punct* ,
hopeless
harm
in
ahab
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
my
lad
*punct* ;
stricken
*punct* ,
blasted
*punct* ,
if
he
be
*punct* ,
ahab
has
his
humanities
*punct* !
*break*
as
i
walked
away
*punct* ,
i
was
full
of
thoughtfulness
*punct* ;
what
had
been
incidentally
revealed
to
me
of
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
filled
me
with
a
certain
wild
vagueness
of
painfulness
concerning
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
somehow
*punct* ,
at
the
time
*punct* ,
i
felt
a
sympathy
and
a
sorrow
for
him
*punct* ,
but
for
i
don't
know
what
*punct* ,
unless
it
was
the
cruel
loss
of
his
leg
*punct* .
*break*
and
yet
i
also
felt
a
strange
awe
of
him
*punct* ;
but
that
sort
of
awe
*punct* ,
which
i
cannot
at
all
describe
*punct* ,
was
not
exactly
awe
*punct* ;
i
do
not
know
what
it
was
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
felt
it
*punct* ;
and
it
did
not
disincline
me
towards
him
*punct* ;
though
i
felt
impatience
at
what
seemed
like
mystery
in
him
*punct* ,
so
imperfectly
as
he
was
known
to
me
then
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
*punct* ,
we
good
presbyterian
christians
should
be
charitable
in
these
things
*punct* ,
and
not
fancy
ourselves
so
vastly
superior
to
other
mortals
*punct* ,
pagans
and
what
not
*punct* ,
because
of
their
half-crazy
conceits
on
these
subjects
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
queequeg
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
certainly
entertaining
the
most
absurd
notions
about
yojo
and
his
ramadan;
*punct* ,
but
what
of
that
*punct* ?
*break*
queequeg
thought
he
knew
what
he
was
about
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ;
he
seemed
to
be
content
*punct* ;
and
there
let
him
rest
*punct* .
*break*
all
our
arguing
with
him
would
not
avail
*punct* ;
let
him
be
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* :
and
heaven
have
mercy
on
us
all
*punct* ,
presbyterians
and
pagans
alike
*punct* ,
for
we
are
all
somehow
dreadfully
cracked
about
the
head
*punct* ,
and
sadly
need
mending
*punct* .
*break*
towards
evening
*punct* ,
when
i
felt
assured
that
all
his
performances
and
rituals
must
be
over
*punct* ,
i
went
up
to
his
room
and
knocked
at
the
door
*punct* ;
but
no
answer
*punct* .
*break*
i
tried
to
open
it
*punct* ,
but
it
was
fastened
inside
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
*punct* ,
said
i
softly
through
the
key-hole:
*punct* ,
all
silent
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* !
*break*
why
don't
you
speak
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
i
*punct* ,
ishmael
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
remained
still
as
before
*punct* .
*break*
i
began
to
grow
alarmed
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
allowed
him
such
abundant
time
*punct* ;
i
thought
he
might
have
had
an
apoplectic
fit
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
through
the
key-hole
*punct* ;
but
the
door
opening
into
an
odd
corner
of
the
room
*punct* ,
the
key-hole
prospect
was
but
a
crooked
and
sinister
one
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
surprised
to
behold
resting
against
the
wall
the
wooden
shaft
of
queequeg's
harpoon
*punct* ,
which
the
landlady
the
evening
previous
had
taken
from
him
*punct* ,
before
our
mounting
to
the
chamber
*punct* .
*break*
that's
strange
*punct* ,
thought
i
*punct* ;
but
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
since
the
harpoon
stands
yonder
*punct* ,
and
he
seldom
or
never
goes
abroad
without
it
*punct* ,
therefore
he
must
be
inside
here
*punct* ,
and
no
possible
mistake
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg!
*punct* ,
queequeg!
*punct* ,
all
still
*punct* .
*break*
something
must
have
happened
*punct* .
*break*
i
tried
to
burst
open
the
door
*punct* ;
but
it
stubbornly
resisted
*punct* .
*break*
running
down
stairs
*punct* ,
i
quickly
stated
my
suspicions
to
the
first
person
i
met
*punct* ,
the
chambermaid
*punct* .
*break*
she
cried
*punct* ,
i
thought
something
must
be
the
matter
*punct* .
*break*
i
went
to
make
the
bed
after
breakfast
*punct* ,
and
the
door
was
locked
*punct* ;
and
not
a
mouse
to
be
heard
*punct* ;
and
it's
been
just
so
silent
ever
since
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
thought
*punct* ,
may
be
*punct* ,
you
had
both
gone
off
and
locked
your
baggage
in
for
safe
keeping
*punct* .
*break*
la
*punct* ,
ma'am!
*punct* ,
mistress
*punct* !
*break*
apoplexy!
*punct* ,
and
with
these
cries
*punct* ,
she
ran
towards
the
kitchen
*punct* ,
i
following
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
hussey
soon
appeared
*punct* ,
with
a
mustard-pot
in
one
hand
and
a
vinegar-cruet
in
the
other
*punct* ,
having
just
broken
away
from
the
occupation
of
attending
to
the
castors
*punct* ,
and
scolding
her
little
black
boy
meantime
*punct* .
*break*
cried
i
*punct* ,
which
way
to
it
*punct* ?
*break*
run
for
god's
sake
*punct* ,
and
fetch
something
to
pry
open
the
door
*punct* ,
the
axe!
*punct* ,
the
axe
*punct* !
*break*
he's
had
a
stroke
*punct* ;
depend
upon
it!
*punct* ,
and
so
saying
i
was
unmethodically
rushing
up
stairs
again
empty-handed
*punct* ,
when
mrs.
hussey
interposed
the
mustard-pot
and
vinegar-cruet
*punct* ,
and
the
entire
castor
of
her
countenance
*punct* .
*break*
what's
the
matter
with
you
*punct* ,
young
man
*punct* ?
*break*
get
the
axe
*punct* !
*break*
for
god's
sake
*punct* ,
run
for
the
doctor
*punct* ,
some
one
*punct* ,
while
i
pry
it
open
*punct* !
*break*
look
here
*punct* ,
said
the
landlady
*punct* ,
quickly
putting
down
the
vinegar-cruet
*punct* ,
so
as
to
have
one
hand
free
*punct* ;
look
here
*punct* ;
are
you
talking
about
prying
open
any
of
my
doors?
*punct* ,
and
with
that
she
seized
my
arm
*punct* .
*break*
what's
the
matter
with
you
*punct* ?
*break*
what's
the
matter
with
you
*punct* ,
shipmate
*punct* ?
*break*
in
as
calm
*punct* ,
but
rapid
a
manner
as
possible
*punct* ,
i
gave
her
to
understand
the
whole
case
*punct* .
*break*
i
haven't
seen
it
since
i
put
it
there
*punct* .
*break*
running
to
a
little
closet
under
the
landing
of
the
stairs
*punct* ,
she
glanced
in
*punct* ,
and
returning
*punct* ,
told
me
that
queequeg's
harpoon
was
missing
*punct* .
*break*
he's
killed
himself
*punct* ,
she
cried
*punct* .
*break*
it's
unfort'nate
stiggs
done
over
again
*punct* ,
there
goes
another
counterpane
*punct* ,
god
pity
his
poor
mother!
*punct* ,
it
will
be
the
ruin
of
my
house
*punct* .
*break*
has
the
poor
lad
a
sister
*punct* ?
*break*
where's
that
girl?
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ,
betty
*punct* ,
go
to
snarles
the
painter
*punct* ,
and
tell
him
to
paint
me
a
sign
*punct* ,
with
*punct* ,
no
suicides
permitted
here
*punct* ,
and
no
smoking
in
the
parlor;
*punct* ,
might
as
well
kill
both
birds
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
the
lord
be
merciful
to
his
ghost
*punct* !
*break*
what's
that
noise
there
*punct* ?
*break*
you
*punct* ,
young
man
*punct* ,
avast
there
*punct* !
*break*
and
running
up
after
me
*punct* ,
she
caught
me
as
i
was
again
trying
to
force
open
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
i
won't
allow
it
*punct* ;
i
won't
have
my
premises
spoiled
*punct* .
*break*
go
for
the
locksmith
*punct* ,
there's
one
about
a
mile
from
here
*punct* .
*break*
putting
her
hand
in
her
side-pocket
*punct* ,
here's
a
key
that'll
fit
*punct* ,
i
guess
*punct* ;
let's
see
*punct* .
*break*
and
with
that
*punct* ,
she
turned
it
in
the
lock
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
alas
*punct* !
*break*
queequeg's
supplemental
bolt
remained
unwithdrawn
within
*punct* .
*break*
have
to
burst
it
open
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
and
was
running
down
the
entry
a
little
*punct* ,
for
a
good
start
*punct* ,
when
the
landlady
caught
at
me
*punct* ,
again
vowing
i
should
not
break
down
her
premises
*punct* ;
but
i
tore
from
her
*punct* ,
and
with
a
sudden
bodily
rush
dashed
myself
full
against
the
mark
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
prodigious
noise
the
door
flew
open
*punct* ,
and
the
knob
slamming
against
the
wall
*punct* ,
sent
the
plaster
to
the
ceiling
*punct* ;
and
there
*punct* ,
good
heavens
*punct* !
*break*
there
sat
queequeg
*punct* ,
altogether
cool
and
self-collected
*punct* ;
right
in
the
middle
of
the
room
*punct* ;
squatting
on
his
hams
*punct* ,
and
holding
yojo
on
top
of
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
neither
one
way
nor
the
other
way
*punct* ,
but
sat
like
a
carved
image
with
scarce
a
sign
of
active
life
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
going
up
to
him
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
what's
the
matter
with
you
*punct* ?
*break*
he
hain't
been
a
sittin
so
all
day
*punct* ,
has
he
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
landlady
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
hussey
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
he's
alive
at
all
events
*punct* ;
so
leave
us
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* ,
and
i
will
see
to
this
strange
affair
myself
*punct* .
*break*
closing
the
door
upon
the
landlady
*punct* ,
i
endeavored
to
prevail
upon
queequeg
to
take
a
chair
*punct* ;
but
in
vain
*punct* .
*break*
there
he
sat
*punct* ;
and
all
he
could
do
*punct* ,
for
all
my
polite
arts
and
blandishments
*punct* ,
he
would
not
move
a
peg
*punct* ,
nor
say
a
single
word
*punct* ,
nor
even
look
at
me
*punct* ,
nor
notice
my
presence
in
any
the
slightest
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
wonder
*punct* ,
thought
i
*punct* ,
if
this
can
possibly
be
a
part
of
his
ramadan
*punct* ;
do
they
fast
on
their
hams
that
way
in
his
native
island
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
be
so
*punct* ;
yes
*punct* ,
it's
part
of
his
creed
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ;
well
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
let
him
rest
*punct* ;
he'll
get
up
sooner
or
later
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
it
can't
last
for
ever
*punct* ,
thank
god
*punct* ,
and
his
ramadan
only
comes
once
a
year
*punct* ;
and
i
don't
believe
it's
very
punctual
then
*punct* .
*break*
i
went
down
to
supper
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
*punct* ;
there
he
was
just
where
i
had
left
him
*punct* ;
he
had
not
stirred
an
inch
*punct* .
*break*
i
began
to
grow
vexed
with
him
*punct* ;
it
seemed
so
downright
senseless
and
insane
to
be
sitting
there
all
day
and
half
the
night
on
his
hams
in
a
cold
room
*punct* ,
holding
a
piece
of
wood
on
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
for
heaven's
sake
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
get
up
and
shake
yourself
*punct* ;
get
up
and
have
some
supper
*punct* .
*break*
you'll
starve
*punct* ;
you'll
kill
yourself
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* .
*break*
but
not
a
word
did
he
reply
*punct* .
*break*
despairing
of
him
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
i
determined
to
go
to
bed
and
to
sleep
*punct* ;
and
no
doubt
*punct* ,
before
a
great
while
*punct* ,
he
would
follow
me
*punct* .
*break*
but
previous
to
turning
in
*punct* ,
i
took
my
heavy
bearskin
jacket
*punct* ,
and
threw
it
over
him
*punct* ,
as
it
promised
to
be
a
very
cold
night
*punct* ;
and
he
had
nothing
but
his
ordinary
round
jacket
on
*punct* .
*break*
for
some
time
*punct* ,
do
all
i
would
*punct* ,
i
could
not
get
into
the
faintest
doze
*punct* .
*break*
think
of
it
*punct* ;
sleeping
all
night
in
the
same
room
with
a
wide
awake
pagan
on
his
hams
in
this
dreary
*punct* ,
unaccountable
ramadan
*punct* !
*break*
but
somehow
i
dropped
off
at
last
*punct* ,
and
knew
nothing
more
till
break
of
day
*punct* ;
when
*punct* ,
looking
over
the
bedside
*punct* ,
there
squatted
queequeg
*punct* ,
as
if
he
had
been
screwed
down
to
the
floor
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
soon
as
the
first
glimpse
of
sun
entered
the
window
*punct* ,
up
he
got
*punct* ,
with
stiff
and
grating
joints
*punct* ,
but
with
a
cheerful
look
*punct* ;
limped
towards
me
where
i
lay
*punct* ;
pressed
his
forehead
again
against
mine
*punct* ;
and
said
his
ramadan
was
over
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
as
i
before
hinted
*punct* ,
i
have
no
objection
to
any
person's
religion
*punct* ,
be
it
what
it
may
*punct* ,
so
long
as
that
person
does
not
kill
or
insult
any
other
person
*punct* ,
because
that
other
person
don't
believe
it
also
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
a
man's
religion
becomes
really
frantic
*punct* ;
when
it
is
a
positive
torment
to
him
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
in
fine
*punct* ,
makes
this
earth
of
ours
an
uncomfortable
inn
to
lodge
in
*punct* ;
then
i
think
it
high
time
to
take
that
individual
aside
and
argue
the
point
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
just
so
i
now
did
with
queequeg
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
get
into
bed
now
*punct* ,
and
lie
and
listen
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
then
went
on
*punct* ,
beginning
with
the
rise
and
progress
of
the
primitive
religions
*punct* ,
and
coming
down
to
the
various
religions
of
the
present
time
*punct* ,
during
which
time
i
labored
to
show
queequeg
that
all
these
lents
*punct* ,
ramadans
*punct* ,
and
prolonged
ham-squattings
in
cold
*punct* ,
cheerless
rooms
were
stark
nonsense
*punct* ;
bad
for
the
health
*punct* ;
useless
for
the
soul
*punct* ;
opposed
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
to
the
obvious
laws
of
hygiene
and
common
sense
*punct* .
*break*
i
told
him
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
that
he
being
in
other
things
such
an
extremely
sensible
and
sagacious
savage
*punct* ,
it
pained
me
*punct* ,
very
badly
pained
me
*punct* ,
to
see
him
now
so
deplorably
foolish
about
this
ridiculous
ramadan
of
his
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
argued
i
*punct* ,
fasting
makes
the
body
cave
in
*punct* ;
hence
the
spirit
caves
in
*punct* ;
and
all
thoughts
born
of
a
fast
must
necessarily
be
half-starved
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
the
reason
why
most
dyspeptic
religionists
cherish
such
melancholy
notions
about
their
hereafters
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
no
*punct* ;
only
upon
one
memorable
occasion
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
after
a
great
feast
given
by
his
father
the
king
*punct* ,
on
the
gaining
of
a
great
battle
wherein
fifty
of
the
enemy
had
been
killed
by
about
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
*punct* ,
and
all
cooked
and
eaten
that
very
evening
*punct* .
*break*
no
more
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
shuddering
*punct* ;
that
will
do
*punct* ;
for
i
knew
the
inferences
without
his
further
hinting
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
seen
a
sailor
who
had
visited
that
very
island
*punct* ,
and
he
told
me
that
it
was
the
custom
*punct* ,
when
a
great
battle
had
been
gained
there
*punct* ,
to
barbecue
all
the
slain
in
the
yard
or
garden
of
the
victor
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
one
by
one
*punct* ,
they
were
placed
in
great
wooden
trenchers
*punct* ,
and
garnished
round
like
a
pilau
*punct* ,
with
breadfruit
and
cocoanuts
*punct* ;
and
with
some
parsley
in
their
mouths
*punct* ,
were
sent
round
with
the
victor's
compliments
to
all
his
friends
*punct* ,
just
as
though
these
presents
were
so
many
christmas
turkeys
*punct* .
*break*
after
all
*punct* ,
i
do
not
think
that
my
remarks
about
religion
made
much
impression
upon
queequeg
*punct* .
*break*
because
*punct* ,
in
the
first
place
*punct* ,
he
somehow
seemed
dull
of
hearing
on
that
important
subject
*punct* ,
unless
considered
from
his
own
point
of
view
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
in
the
second
place
*punct* ,
he
did
not
more
than
one
third
understand
me
*punct* ,
couch
my
ideas
simply
as
i
would
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
finally
*punct* ,
he
no
doubt
thought
he
knew
a
good
deal
more
about
the
true
religion
than
i
did
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
at
me
with
a
sort
of
condescending
concern
and
compassion
*punct* ,
as
though
he
thought
it
a
great
pity
that
such
a
sensible
young
man
should
be
so
hopelessly
lost
to
evangelical
pagan
piety
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
mean
by
that
*punct* ,
captain
peleg
*punct* ?
*break*
said
i
*punct* ,
now
jumping
on
the
bulwarks
*punct* ,
and
leaving
my
comrade
standing
on
the
wharf
*punct* .
*break*
i
mean
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* ,
he
must
show
his
papers
*punct* .
*break*
yea
*punct* ,
said
captain
bildad
in
his
hollow
voice
*punct* ,
sticking
his
head
from
behind
peleg's
*punct* ,
out
of
the
wigwam
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
show
that
he's
converted
*punct* .
*break*
son
of
darkness
*punct* ,
he
added
*punct* ,
turning
to
queequeg
*punct* ,
art
thou
at
present
in
communion
with
any
christian
church
*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
he's
a
member
of
the
first
congregational
church
*punct* .
*break*
here
be
it
said
*punct* ,
that
many
tattooed
savages
sailing
in
nantucket
ships
at
last
come
to
be
converted
into
the
churches
*punct* .
*break*
first
congregational
church
*punct* ,
cried
bildad
*punct* ,
what
*punct* !
*break*
that
worships
in
deacon
deuteronomy
coleman's
meeting-house
*punct* ?
*break*
and
so
saying
*punct* ,
taking
out
his
spectacles
*punct* ,
he
rubbed
them
with
his
great
yellow
bandana
handkerchief
*punct* ,
and
putting
them
on
very
carefully
*punct* ,
came
out
of
the
wigwam
*punct* ,
and
leaning
stiffly
over
the
bulwarks
*punct* ,
took
a
good
long
look
at
queequeg
*punct* .
*break*
how
long
hath
he
been
a
member
*punct* ?
*break*
he
then
said
*punct* ,
turning
to
me
*punct* ;
not
very
long
*punct* ,
i
rather
guess
*punct* ,
young
man
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
said
peleg
*punct* ,
and
he
hasn't
been
baptized
right
either
*punct* ,
or
it
would
have
washed
some
of
that
devil's
blue
off
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
do
tell
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
cried
bildad
*punct* ,
is
this
philistine
a
regular
member
of
deacon
deuteronomy's
meeting
*punct* ?
*break*
he
is
a
deacon
himself
*punct* ,
queequeg
is
*punct* .
*break*
young
man
*punct* ,
said
bildad
sternly
*punct* ,
thou
art
skylarking
with
me
*punct* ,
explain
thyself
*punct* ,
thou
young
hittite
*punct* .
*break*
what
church
dost
thee
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
finding
myself
thus
hard
pushed
*punct* ,
i
replied
*punct* .
*break*
i
mean
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
the
same
ancient
catholic
church
to
which
you
and
i
*punct* ,
and
captain
peleg
there
*punct* ,
and
queequeg
here
*punct* ,
and
all
of
us
*punct* ,
and
every
mother's
son
and
soul
of
us
belong
*punct* ;
the
great
and
everlasting
first
congregation
of
this
whole
worshipping
world
*punct* ;
we
all
belong
to
that
*punct* ;
only
some
of
us
cherish
some
queer
crotchets
noways
touching
the
grand
belief
*punct* ;
in
that
we
all
join
hands
*punct* .
*break*
splice
*punct* ,
thou
mean'st
splice
hands
*punct* ,
cried
peleg
*punct* ,
drawing
nearer
*punct* .
*break*
young
man
*punct* ,
you'd
better
ship
for
a
missionary
*punct* ,
instead
of
a
fore-mast
hand
*punct* ;
i
never
heard
a
better
sermon
*punct* .
*break*
deacon
deuteronomy
*punct* ,
why
father
mapple
himself
couldn't
beat
it
*punct* ,
and
he's
reckoned
something
*punct* .
*break*
come
aboard
*punct* ,
come
aboard
*punct* ;
never
mind
about
the
papers
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
*punct* ,
tell
quohog
there
*punct* ,
what's
that
you
call
him
*punct* ?
*break*
tell
quohog
to
step
along
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
great
anchor
*punct* ,
what
a
harpoon
he's
got
there
*punct* !
*break*
looks
like
good
stuff
that
*punct* ;
and
he
handles
it
about
right
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
*punct* ,
quohog
*punct* ,
or
whatever
your
name
is
*punct* ,
did
you
ever
stand
in
the
head
of
a
whale-boat
*punct* ?
*break*
did
you
ever
strike
a
fish
*punct* ?
*break*
without
saying
a
word
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
in
his
wild
sort
of
way
*punct* ,
jumped
upon
the
bulwarks
*punct* ,
from
thence
into
the
bows
of
one
of
the
whale-boats
hanging
to
the
side
*punct* ;
and
then
bracing
his
left
knee
*punct* ,
and
poising
his
harpoon
*punct* ,
cried
out
in
some
such
way
as
this:
*punct* ,
cap'ain
*punct* ,
you
see
him
small
drop
tar
on
water
dere
*punct* ?
*break*
you
see
him
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
spose
him
one
whale
eye
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
den
*punct* !
*break*
and
taking
sharp
aim
at
it
*punct* ,
he
darted
the
iron
right
over
old
bildad's
broad
brim
*punct* ,
clean
across
the
ship's
decks
*punct* ,
and
struck
the
glistening
tar
spot
out
of
sight
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
said
queequeg
*punct* ,
quietly
hauling
in
the
line
*punct* ,
spos-ee
him
whale-e
eye
*punct* ;
why
*punct* ,
dad
whale
dead
*punct* .
*break*
quick
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
you
bildad
*punct* ,
and
get
the
ship's
papers
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
have
hedgehog
there
*punct* ,
i
mean
quohog
*punct* ,
in
one
of
our
boats
*punct* .
*break*
look
ye
*punct* ,
quohog
*punct* ,
we'll
give
ye
the
ninetieth
lay
*punct* ,
and
that's
more
than
ever
was
given
a
harpooneer
yet
out
of
nantucket
*punct* .
*break*
so
down
we
went
into
the
cabin
*punct* ,
and
to
my
great
joy
queequeg
was
soon
enrolled
among
the
same
ship's
company
to
which
i
myself
belonged
*punct* .
*break*
when
all
preliminaries
were
over
and
peleg
had
got
everything
ready
for
signing
*punct* ,
he
turned
to
me
and
said
*punct* ,
i
guess
quohog
there
don't
know
how
to
write
*punct* ,
does
he
*punct* ?
*break*
i
say
*punct* ,
quohog
*punct* ,
blast
ye
*punct* !
*break*
dost
thou
sign
thy
name
or
make
thy
mark
*punct* ?
*break*
but
at
this
question
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
who
had
twice
or
thrice
before
taken
part
in
similar
ceremonies
*punct* ,
looked
no
ways
abashed
*punct* ;
but
taking
the
offered
pen
*punct* ,
copied
upon
the
paper
*punct* ,
in
the
proper
place
*punct* ,
an
exact
counterpart
of
a
queer
round
figure
which
was
tattooed
upon
his
arm
*punct* ;
so
that
through
captain
peleg's
obstinate
mistake
touching
his
appellative
*punct* ,
it
stood
something
like
this:
*punct* ,
quohog
his
mark
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
captain
bildad
sat
earnestly
and
steadfastly
eyeing
queequeg
*punct* ,
and
at
last
rising
solemnly
and
fumbling
in
the
huge
pockets
of
his
broad-skirted
drab
coat
*punct* ,
took
out
a
bundle
of
tracts
*punct* ,
and
selecting
one
entitled
the
latter
day
coming
*punct* ;
or
no
time
to
lose
*punct* ,
placed
it
in
queequeg's
hands
*punct* ,
and
then
grasping
them
and
the
book
with
both
his
*punct* ,
looked
earnestly
into
his
eyes
*punct* ,
and
said
*punct* ,
son
of
darkness
*punct* ,
i
must
do
my
duty
by
thee
*punct* ;
i
am
part
owner
of
this
ship
*punct* ,
and
feel
concerned
for
the
souls
of
all
its
crew
*punct* ;
if
thou
still
clingest
to
thy
pagan
ways
*punct* ,
which
i
sadly
fear
*punct* ,
i
beseech
thee
*punct* ,
remain
not
for
aye
a
belial
bondsman
*punct* .
*break*
spurn
the
idol
bell
*punct* ,
and
the
hideous
dragon
*punct* ;
turn
from
the
wrath
to
come
*punct* ;
mind
thine
eye
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ;
oh
*punct* !
*break*
steer
clear
of
the
fiery
pit
*punct* !
*break*
something
of
the
salt
sea
yet
lingered
in
old
bildad's
language
*punct* ,
heterogeneously
mixed
with
scriptural
and
domestic
phrases
*punct* .
*break*
pious
harpooneers
never
make
good
voyagers
*punct* ,
it
takes
the
shark
out
of
em
*punct* ;
no
harpooneer
is
worth
a
straw
who
aint
pretty
sharkish
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
young
nat
swaine
*punct* ,
once
the
bravest
boat-header
out
of
all
nantucket
and
the
vineyard
*punct* ;
he
joined
the
meeting
*punct* ,
and
never
came
to
good
*punct* .
*break*
he
got
so
frightened
about
his
plaguy
soul
*punct* ,
that
he
shrinked
and
sheered
away
from
whales
*punct* ,
for
fear
of
after-claps
in
case
he
got
stove
and
went
to
davy
jones
*punct* .
*break*
said
bildad
*punct* ,
lifting
his
eyes
and
hands
*punct* ,
thou
thyself
*punct* ,
as
i
myself
*punct* ,
hast
seen
many
a
perilous
time
*punct* ;
thou
knowest
*punct* ,
peleg
*punct* ,
what
it
is
to
have
the
fear
of
death
*punct* ;
how
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
can'st
thou
prate
in
this
ungodly
guise
*punct* .
*break*
thou
beliest
thine
own
heart
*punct* ,
peleg
*punct* .
*break*
tell
me
*punct* ,
when
this
same
pequod
here
had
her
three
masts
overboard
in
that
typhoon
on
japan
*punct* ,
that
same
voyage
when
thou
went
mate
with
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
did'st
thou
not
think
of
death
and
the
judgment
then
*punct* ?
*break*
hear
him
*punct* ,
hear
him
now
*punct* ,
cried
peleg
*punct* ,
marching
across
the
cabin
*punct* ,
and
thrusting
his
hands
far
down
into
his
pockets,
*punct* ,
hear
him
*punct* ,
all
of
ye
*punct* .
*break*
think
of
that
*punct* !
*break*
when
every
moment
we
thought
the
ship
would
sink
*punct* !
*break*
death
and
the
judgment
then
*punct* ?
*break*
with
all
three
masts
making
such
an
everlasting
thundering
against
the
side
*punct* ;
and
every
sea
breaking
over
us
*punct* ,
fore
and
aft
*punct* .
*break*
think
of
death
and
the
judgment
then
*punct* ?
*break*
no
time
to
think
about
death
then
*punct* .
*break*
life
was
what
captain
ahab
and
i
was
thinking
of
*punct* ;
and
how
to
save
all
hands
*punct* ,
how
to
rig
jury-masts
*punct* ,
how
to
get
into
the
nearest
port
*punct* ;
that
was
what
i
was
thinking
of
*punct* .
*break*
bildad
said
no
more
*punct* ,
but
buttoning
up
his
coat
*punct* ,
stalked
on
deck
*punct* ,
where
we
followed
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
he
stood
*punct* ,
very
quietly
overlooking
some
sail-makers
who
were
mending
a
top-sail
in
the
waist
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
and
i
had
just
left
the
pequod
*punct* ,
and
were
sauntering
away
from
the
water
*punct* ,
for
the
moment
each
occupied
with
his
own
thoughts
*punct* ,
when
the
above
words
were
put
to
us
by
a
stranger
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
pausing
before
us
*punct* ,
levelled
his
massive
forefinger
at
the
vessel
in
question
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
but
shabbily
apparelled
in
faded
jacket
and
patched
trowsers
*punct* ;
a
rag
of
a
black
handkerchief
investing
his
neck
*punct* .
*break*
a
confluent
small-pox
had
in
all
directions
flowed
over
his
face
*punct* ,
and
left
it
like
the
complicated
ribbed
bed
of
a
torrent
*punct* ,
when
the
rushing
waters
have
been
dried
up
*punct* .
*break*
have
ye
shipped
in
her
*punct* ?
*break*
you
mean
the
ship
pequod
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
trying
to
gain
a
little
more
time
for
an
uninterrupted
look
at
him
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
the
pequod
*punct* ,
that
ship
there
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
drawing
back
his
whole
arm
*punct* ,
and
then
rapidly
shoving
it
straight
out
from
him
*punct* ,
with
the
fixed
bayonet
of
his
pointed
finger
darted
full
at
the
object
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
we
have
just
signed
the
articles
*punct* .
*break*
anything
down
there
about
your
souls
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
perhaps
you
hav'n't
got
any
*punct* ,
he
said
quickly
*punct* .
*break*
no
matter
though
*punct* ,
i
know
many
chaps
that
hav'n't
got
any,
*punct* ,
good
luck
to
em
*punct* ;
and
they
are
all
the
better
off
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
a
soul's
a
sort
of
a
fifth
wheel
to
a
wagon
*punct* .
*break*
what
are
you
jabbering
about
*punct* ,
shipmate
*punct* ?
*break*
he's
got
enough
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
to
make
up
for
all
deficiencies
of
that
sort
in
other
chaps
*punct* ,
abruptly
said
the
stranger
*punct* ,
placing
a
nervous
emphasis
upon
the
word
he
*punct* .
*break*
cried
the
stranger
*punct* .
*break*
ye
said
true
*punct* ,
ye
hav'n't
seen
old
thunder
yet
*punct* ,
have
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
who's
old
thunder
*punct* ?
*break*
said
i
*punct* ,
again
riveted
with
the
insane
earnestness
of
his
manner
*punct* .
*break*
the
captain
of
our
ship
*punct* ,
the
pequod
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
among
some
of
us
old
sailor
chaps
*punct* ,
he
goes
by
that
name
*punct* .
*break*
ye
hav'n't
seen
him
yet
*punct* ,
have
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
we
hav'n't
*punct* .
*break*
he's
sick
they
say
*punct* ,
but
is
getting
better
*punct* ,
and
will
be
all
right
again
before
long
*punct* .
*break*
all
right
again
before
long
*punct* !
*break*
laughed
the
stranger
*punct* ,
with
a
solemnly
derisive
sort
of
laugh
*punct* .
*break*
look
ye
*punct* ;
when
captain
ahab
is
all
right
*punct* ,
then
this
left
arm
of
mine
will
be
all
right
*punct* ;
not
before
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
know
about
him
*punct* ?
*break*
what
did
they
tell
you
about
him
*punct* ?
*break*
they
didn't
tell
much
of
anything
about
him
*punct* ;
only
i've
heard
that
he's
a
good
whale-hunter
*punct* ,
and
a
good
captain
to
his
crew
*punct* .
*break*
that's
true
*punct* ,
that's
true
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
both
true
enough
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
must
jump
when
he
gives
an
order
*punct* .
*break*
step
and
growl
*punct* ;
growl
and
go
*punct* ,
that's
the
word
with
captain
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
but
nothing
about
that
thing
that
happened
to
him
off
cape
horn
*punct* ,
long
ago
*punct* ,
when
he
lay
like
dead
for
three
days
and
nights
*punct* ;
nothing
about
that
deadly
skrimmage
with
the
spaniard
afore
the
altar
in
santa?
*punct* ,
heard
nothing
about
that
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
nothing
about
the
silver
calabash
he
spat
into
*punct* ?
*break*
and
nothing
about
his
losing
his
leg
last
voyage
*punct* ,
according
to
the
prophecy
*punct* .
*break*
didn't
ye
hear
a
word
about
them
matters
and
something
more
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
don't
think
ye
did
*punct* ;
how
could
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
who
knows
it
*punct* ?
*break*
not
all
nantucket
*punct* ,
i
guess
*punct* .
*break*
but
hows'ever
*punct* ,
mayhap
*punct* ,
ye've
heard
tell
about
the
leg
*punct* ,
and
how
he
lost
it
*punct* ;
aye
*punct* ,
ye
have
heard
of
that
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
*punct* .
*break*
oh
yes
*punct* ,
that
every
one
knows
a'most
*punct* ,
i
mean
they
know
he's
only
one
leg
*punct* ;
and
that
a
parmacetti
took
the
other
off
*punct* .
*break*
my
friend
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
what
all
this
gibberish
of
yours
is
about
*punct* ,
i
don't
know
*punct* ,
and
i
don't
much
care
*punct* ;
for
it
seems
to
me
that
you
must
be
a
little
damaged
in
the
head
*punct* .
*break*
with
finger
pointed
and
eye
levelled
at
the
pequod
*punct* ,
the
beggar-like
stranger
stood
a
moment
*punct* ,
as
if
in
a
troubled
reverie
*punct* ;
then
starting
a
little
*punct* ,
turned
and
said:
*punct* ,
ye've
shipped
*punct* ,
have
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
names
down
on
the
papers
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
what's
signed
*punct* ,
is
signed
*punct* ;
and
what's
to
be
*punct* ,
will
be
*punct* ;
and
then
again
*punct* ,
perhaps
it
wont
be
*punct* ,
after
all
*punct* .
*break*
any
how
*punct* ,
it's
all
fixed
and
arranged
a'ready
*punct* ;
and
some
sailors
or
other
must
go
with
him
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ;
as
well
these
as
any
other
men
*punct* ,
god
pity
em
*punct* !
*break*
morning
to
ye
*punct* ,
shipmates
*punct* ,
morning
*punct* ;
the
ineffable
heavens
bless
ye
*punct* ;
i'm
sorry
i
stopped
ye
*punct* .
*break*
look
here
*punct* ,
friend
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
if
you
have
anything
important
to
tell
us
*punct* ,
out
with
it
*punct* ;
but
if
you
are
only
trying
to
bamboozle
us
*punct* ,
you
are
mistaken
in
your
game
*punct* ;
that's
all
i
have
to
say
*punct* .
*break*
and
it's
said
very
well
*punct* ,
and
i
like
to
hear
a
chap
talk
up
that
way
*punct* ;
you
are
just
the
man
for
him
*punct* ,
the
likes
of
ye
*punct* .
*break*
morning
to
ye
*punct* ,
shipmates
*punct* ,
morning
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
when
ye
get
there
*punct* ,
tell
em
i've
concluded
not
to
make
one
of
em
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
my
dear
fellow
*punct* ,
you
can't
fool
us
that
way
*punct* ,
you
can't
fool
us
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
for
a
man
to
look
as
if
he
had
a
great
secret
in
him
*punct* .
*break*
morning
to
ye
*punct* ,
shipmates
*punct* ,
morning
*punct* .
*break*
morning
it
is
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* .
*break*
come
along
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
let's
leave
this
crazy
man
*punct* .
*break*
but
stop
*punct* ,
tell
me
your
name
*punct* ,
will
you
*punct* ?
*break*
thought
i
*punct* ,
and
we
walked
away
*punct* ,
both
commenting
*punct* ,
after
each
other's
fashion
*punct* ,
upon
this
ragged
old
sailor
*punct* ;
and
agreed
that
he
was
nothing
but
a
humbug
*punct* ,
trying
to
be
a
bugbear
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
had
not
gone
perhaps
above
a
hundred
yards
*punct* ,
when
chancing
to
turn
a
corner
*punct* ,
and
looking
back
as
i
did
so
*punct* ,
who
should
be
seen
but
elijah
following
us
*punct* ,
though
at
a
distance
*punct* .
*break*
somehow
*punct* ,
the
sight
of
him
struck
me
so
*punct* ,
that
i
said
nothing
to
queequeg
of
his
being
behind
*punct* ,
but
passed
on
with
my
comrade
*punct* ,
anxious
to
see
whether
the
stranger
would
turn
the
same
corner
that
we
did
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
*punct* ;
and
then
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
dogging
us
*punct* ,
but
with
what
intent
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
imagine
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
resolved
to
satisfy
myself
whether
this
ragged
elijah
was
really
dogging
us
or
not
*punct* ,
and
with
that
intent
crossed
the
way
with
queequeg
*punct* ,
and
on
that
side
of
it
retraced
our
steps
*punct* .
*break*
but
elijah
passed
on
*punct* ,
without
seeming
to
notice
us
*punct* .
*break*
not
only
were
the
old
sails
being
mended
*punct* ,
but
new
sails
were
coming
on
board
*punct* ,
and
bolts
of
canvas
*punct* ,
and
coils
of
rigging
*punct* ;
in
short
*punct* ,
everything
betokened
that
the
ship's
preparations
were
hurrying
to
a
close
*punct* .
*break*
captain
peleg
seldom
or
never
went
ashore
*punct* ,
but
sat
in
his
wigwam
keeping
a
sharp
look-out
upon
the
hands
*punct* :
bildad
did
all
the
purchasing
and
providing
at
the
stores
*punct* ;
and
the
men
employed
in
the
hold
and
on
the
rigging
were
working
till
long
after
night-fall
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
day
following
queequeg's
signing
the
articles
*punct* ,
word
was
given
at
all
the
inns
where
the
ship's
company
were
stopping
*punct* ,
that
their
chests
must
be
on
board
before
night
*punct* ,
for
there
was
no
telling
how
soon
the
vessel
might
be
sailing
*punct* .
*break*
so
queequeg
and
i
got
down
our
traps
*punct* ,
resolving
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
to
sleep
ashore
till
the
last
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
seems
they
always
give
very
long
notice
in
these
cases
*punct* ,
and
the
ship
did
not
sail
for
several
days
*punct* .
*break*
every
one
knows
what
a
multitude
of
things
*punct* ,
beds
*punct* ,
sauce-pans
*punct* ,
knives
and
forks
*punct* ,
shovels
and
tongs
*punct* ,
napkins
*punct* ,
nut-crackers
*punct* ,
and
what
not
*punct* ,
are
indispensable
to
the
business
of
housekeeping
*punct* .
*break*
just
so
with
whaling
*punct* ,
which
necessitates
a
three-years
housekeeping
upon
the
wide
ocean
*punct* ,
far
from
all
grocers
*punct* ,
costermongers
*punct* ,
doctors
*punct* ,
bakers
*punct* ,
and
bankers
*punct* .
*break*
and
though
this
also
holds
true
of
merchant
vessels
*punct* ,
yet
not
by
any
means
to
the
same
extent
as
with
whalemen
*punct* .
*break*
for
besides
the
great
length
of
the
whaling
voyage
*punct* ,
the
numerous
articles
peculiar
to
the
prosecution
of
the
fishery
*punct* ,
and
the
impossibility
of
replacing
them
at
the
remote
harbors
usually
frequented
*punct* ,
it
must
be
remembered
*punct* ,
that
of
all
ships
*punct* ,
whaling
vessels
are
the
most
exposed
to
accidents
of
all
kinds
*punct* ,
and
especially
to
the
destruction
and
loss
of
the
very
things
upon
which
the
success
of
the
voyage
most
depends
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
the
spare
boats
*punct* ,
spare
spars
*punct* ,
and
spare
lines
and
harpoons
*punct* ,
and
spare
everythings
*punct* ,
almost
*punct* ,
but
a
spare
captain
and
duplicate
ship
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
period
of
our
arrival
at
the
island
*punct* ,
the
heaviest
storage
of
the
pequod
had
been
almost
completed
*punct* ;
comprising
her
beef
*punct* ,
bread
*punct* ,
water
*punct* ,
fuel
*punct* ,
and
iron
hoops
and
staves
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
before
hinted
*punct* ,
for
some
time
there
was
a
continual
fetching
and
carrying
on
board
of
divers
odds
and
ends
of
things
*punct* ,
both
large
and
small
*punct* .
*break*
chief
among
those
who
did
this
fetching
and
carrying
was
captain
bildad's
sister
*punct* ,
a
lean
old
lady
of
a
most
determined
and
indefatigable
spirit
*punct* ,
but
withal
very
kindhearted
*punct* ,
who
seemed
resolved
that
*punct* ,
if
she
could
help
it
*punct* ,
nothing
should
be
found
wanting
in
the
pequod
*punct* ,
after
once
fairly
getting
to
sea
*punct* .
*break*
at
one
time
she
would
come
on
board
with
a
jar
of
pickles
for
the
steward's
pantry
*punct* ;
another
time
with
a
bunch
of
quills
for
the
chief
mate's
desk
*punct* ,
where
he
kept
his
log
*punct* ;
a
third
time
with
a
roll
of
flannel
for
the
small
of
some
one's
rheumatic
back
*punct* .
*break*
never
did
any
woman
better
deserve
her
name
*punct* ,
which
was
charity
*punct* ,
aunt
charity
*punct* ,
as
everybody
called
her
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
was
startling
to
see
this
excellent
hearted
quakeress
coming
on
board
*punct* ,
as
she
did
the
last
day
*punct* ,
with
a
long
oil-ladle
in
one
hand
*punct* ,
and
a
still
longer
whaling
lance
in
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
nor
was
bildad
himself
nor
captain
peleg
at
all
backward
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
bildad
*punct* ,
he
carried
about
with
him
a
long
list
of
the
articles
needed
*punct* ,
and
at
every
fresh
arrival
*punct* ,
down
went
his
mark
opposite
that
article
upon
the
paper
*punct* .
*break*
every
once
and
a
while
peleg
came
hobbling
out
of
his
whalebone
den
*punct* ,
roaring
at
the
men
down
the
hatchways
*punct* ,
roaring
up
to
the
riggers
at
the
mast-head
*punct* ,
and
then
concluded
by
roaring
back
into
his
wigwam
*punct* .
*break*
during
these
days
of
preparation
*punct* ,
queequeg
and
i
often
visited
the
craft
*punct* ,
and
as
often
i
asked
about
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
and
how
he
was
*punct* ,
and
when
he
was
going
to
come
on
board
his
ship
*punct* .
*break*
to
these
questions
they
would
answer
*punct* ,
that
he
was
getting
better
and
better
*punct* ,
and
was
expected
aboard
every
day
*punct* ;
meantime
*punct* ,
the
two
captains
*punct* ,
peleg
and
bildad
*punct* ,
could
attend
to
everything
necessary
to
fit
the
vessel
for
the
voyage
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
had
been
downright
honest
with
myself
*punct* ,
i
would
have
seen
very
plainly
in
my
heart
that
i
did
but
half
fancy
being
committed
this
way
to
so
long
a
voyage
*punct* ,
without
once
laying
my
eyes
on
the
man
who
was
to
be
the
absolute
dictator
of
it
*punct* ,
so
soon
as
the
ship
sailed
out
upon
the
open
sea
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
a
man
suspects
any
wrong
*punct* ,
it
sometimes
happens
that
if
he
be
already
involved
in
the
matter
*punct* ,
he
insensibly
strives
to
cover
up
his
suspicions
even
from
himself
*punct* .
*break*
and
much
this
way
it
was
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
said
nothing
*punct* ,
and
tried
to
think
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
it
was
given
out
that
some
time
next
day
the
ship
would
certainly
sail
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
some
sailors
running
ahead
there
*punct* ,
if
i
see
right
*punct* ,
said
i
to
queequeg
*punct* ,
it
can't
be
shadows
*punct* ;
she's
off
by
sunrise
*punct* ,
i
guess
*punct* ;
come
on
*punct* !
*break*
cried
a
voice
*punct* ,
whose
owner
at
the
same
time
coming
close
behind
us
*punct* ,
laid
a
hand
upon
both
our
shoulders
*punct* ,
and
then
insinuating
himself
between
us
*punct* ,
stood
stooping
forward
a
little
*punct* ,
in
the
uncertain
twilight
*punct* ,
strangely
peering
from
queequeg
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
elijah
*punct* .
*break*
hands
off
*punct* ,
will
you
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* .
*break*
lookee
here
*punct* ,
said
queequeg
*punct* ,
shaking
himself
*punct* ,
go
way
*punct* !
*break*
aint
going
aboard
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
we
are
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
but
what
business
is
that
of
yours
*punct* ?
*break*
do
you
know
*punct* ,
mr.
elijah
*punct* ,
that
i
consider
you
a
little
impertinent
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ;
i
wasn't
aware
of
that
*punct* ,
said
elijah
*punct* ,
slowly
and
wonderingly
looking
from
me
to
queequeg
*punct* ,
with
the
most
unaccountable
glances
*punct* .
*break*
elijah
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
you
will
oblige
my
friend
and
me
by
withdrawing
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
going
to
the
indian
and
pacific
oceans
*punct* ,
and
would
prefer
not
to
be
detained
*punct* .
*break*
ye
be
*punct* ,
be
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
coming
back
afore
breakfast
*punct* ?
*break*
he's
cracked
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
come
on
*punct* .
*break*
cried
stationary
elijah
*punct* ,
hailing
us
when
we
had
removed
a
few
paces
*punct* .
*break*
never
mind
him
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
come
on
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
stole
up
to
us
again
*punct* ,
and
suddenly
clapping
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
did
ye
see
anything
looking
like
men
going
towards
that
ship
a
while
ago
*punct* ?
*break*
very
dim
*punct* ,
very
dim
*punct* ,
said
elijah
*punct* .
*break*
morning
to
ye
*punct* .
*break*
once
more
we
quitted
him
*punct* ;
but
once
more
he
came
softly
after
us
*punct* ;
and
touching
my
shoulder
again
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
see
if
you
can
find
em
now
*punct* ,
will
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
morning
to
ye
*punct* !
*break*
morning
to
ye
*punct* !
*break*
he
rejoined
*punct* ,
again
moving
off
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
going
to
warn
ye
against
*punct* ,
but
never
mind
*punct* ,
never
mind
*punct* ,
it's
all
one
*punct* ,
all
in
the
family
too;
*punct* ,
sharp
frost
this
morning
*punct* ,
ain't
it
*punct* ?
*break*
good
bye
to
ye
*punct* .
*break*
shan't
see
ye
again
very
soon
*punct* ,
i
guess
*punct* ;
unless
it's
before
the
grand
jury
*punct* .
*break*
and
with
these
cracked
words
he
finally
departed
*punct* ,
leaving
me
*punct* ,
for
the
moment
*punct* ,
in
no
small
wonderment
at
his
frantic
impudence
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
stepping
on
board
the
pequod
*punct* ,
we
found
everything
in
profound
quiet
*punct* ,
not
a
soul
moving
*punct* .
*break*
the
cabin
entrance
was
locked
within
*punct* ;
the
hatches
were
all
on
*punct* ,
and
lumbered
with
coils
of
rigging
*punct* .
*break*
going
forward
to
the
forecastle
*punct* ,
we
found
the
slide
of
the
scuttle
open
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
a
light
*punct* ,
we
went
down
*punct* ,
and
found
only
an
old
rigger
there
*punct* ,
wrapped
in
a
tattered
pea-jacket
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
thrown
at
whole
length
upon
two
chests
*punct* ,
his
face
downwards
and
inclosed
in
his
folded
arms
*punct* .
*break*
the
profoundest
slumber
slept
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
those
sailors
we
saw
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
where
can
they
have
gone
to
*punct* ?
*break*
said
i
*punct* ,
looking
dubiously
at
the
sleeper
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
seemed
that
*punct* ,
when
on
the
wharf
*punct* ,
queequeg
had
not
at
all
noticed
what
i
now
alluded
to
*punct* ;
hence
i
would
have
thought
myself
to
have
been
optically
deceived
in
that
matter
*punct* ,
were
it
not
for
elijah's
otherwise
inexplicable
question
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
beat
the
thing
down
*punct* ;
and
again
marking
the
sleeper
*punct* ,
jocularly
hinted
to
queequeg
that
perhaps
we
had
best
sit
up
with
the
body
*punct* ;
telling
him
to
establish
himself
accordingly
*punct* .
*break*
he
put
his
hand
upon
the
sleeper's
rear
*punct* ,
as
though
feeling
if
it
was
soft
enough
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
without
more
ado
*punct* ,
sat
quietly
down
there
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
*punct* ,
don't
sit
there
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* .
*break*
perry
dood
seat
*punct* ,
said
queequeg
*punct* ,
my
country
way
*punct* ;
won't
hurt
him
face
*punct* .
*break*
said
i
*punct* ,
call
that
his
face
*punct* ?
*break*
get
off
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* !
*break*
look
*punct* ,
he'll
twitch
you
off
soon
*punct* .
*break*
i
wonder
he
don't
wake
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
removed
himself
to
just
beyond
the
head
of
the
sleeper
*punct* ,
and
lighted
his
tomahawk
pipe
*punct* .
*break*
i
sat
at
the
feet
*punct* .
*break*
we
kept
the
pipe
passing
over
the
sleeper
*punct* ,
from
one
to
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
*punct* ,
upon
questioning
him
in
his
broken
fashion
*punct* ,
queequeg
gave
me
to
understand
that
*punct* ,
in
his
land
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
absence
of
settees
and
sofas
of
all
sorts
*punct* ,
the
king
*punct* ,
chiefs
*punct* ,
and
great
people
generally
*punct* ,
were
in
the
custom
of
fattening
some
of
the
lower
orders
for
ottomans
*punct* ;
and
to
furnish
a
house
comfortably
in
that
respect
*punct* ,
you
had
only
to
buy
up
eight
or
ten
lazy
fellows
*punct* ,
and
lay
them
round
in
the
piers
and
alcoves
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
it
was
very
convenient
on
an
excursion
*punct* ;
much
better
than
those
garden-chairs
which
are
convertible
into
walking-sticks
*punct* ;
upon
occasion
*punct* ,
a
chief
calling
his
attendant
*punct* ,
and
desiring
him
to
make
a
settee
of
himself
under
a
spreading
tree
*punct* ,
perhaps
in
some
damp
marshy
place
*punct* .
*break*
while
narrating
these
things
*punct* ,
every
time
queequeg
received
the
tomahawk
from
me
*punct* ,
he
flourished
the
hatchet-side
of
it
over
the
sleeper's
head
*punct* .
*break*
what's
that
for
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ?
*break*
perry
easy
*punct* ,
kill-e
*punct* ;
oh
*punct* !
*break*
he
was
going
on
with
some
wild
reminiscences
about
his
tomahawk-pipe
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
it
seemed
*punct* ,
had
in
its
two
uses
both
brained
his
foes
and
soothed
his
soul
*punct* ,
when
we
were
directly
attracted
to
the
sleeping
rigger
*punct* .
*break*
the
strong
vapor
now
completely
filling
the
contracted
hole
*punct* ,
it
began
to
tell
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
breathed
with
a
sort
of
muffledness
*punct* ;
then
seemed
troubled
in
the
nose
*punct* ;
then
revolved
over
once
or
twice
*punct* ;
then
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
he
breathed
at
last
*punct* ,
who
be
ye
smokers
*punct* ?
*break*
shipped
men
*punct* ,
answered
i
*punct* ,
when
does
she
sail
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
ye
are
going
in
her
*punct* ,
be
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
she
sails
to-day
*punct* .
*break*
the
captain
came
aboard
last
night
*punct* .
*break*
what
captain?
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* ?
*break*
who
but
him
indeed
*punct* ?
*break*
starbuck's
astir
*punct* ,
said
the
rigger
*punct* .
*break*
he's
a
lively
chief
mate
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ;
good
man
*punct* ,
and
a
pious
*punct* ;
but
all
alive
now
*punct* ,
i
must
turn
to
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
saying
he
went
on
deck
*punct* ,
and
we
followed
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
now
clear
sunrise
*punct* .
*break*
soon
the
crew
came
on
board
in
twos
and
threes
*punct* ;
the
riggers
bestirred
themselves
*punct* ;
the
mates
were
actively
engaged
*punct* ;
and
several
of
the
shore
people
were
busy
in
bringing
various
last
things
on
board
*punct* .
*break*
captain
ahab
is
all
ready
*punct* ,
just
spoke
to
him
*punct* ,
nothing
more
to
be
got
from
shore
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
call
all
hands
*punct* ,
then
*punct* .
*break*
muster
em
aft
here
*punct* ,
blast
em
*punct* !
*break*
no
need
of
profane
words
*punct* ,
however
great
the
hurry
*punct* ,
peleg
*punct* ,
said
bildad
*punct* ,
but
away
with
thee
*punct* ,
friend
starbuck
*punct* ,
and
do
our
bidding
*punct* .
*break*
here
upon
the
very
point
of
starting
for
the
voyage
*punct* ,
captain
peleg
and
captain
bildad
were
going
it
with
a
high
hand
on
the
quarter-deck
*punct* ,
just
as
if
they
were
to
be
joint-commanders
at
sea
*punct* ,
as
well
as
to
all
appearances
in
port
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
as
for
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
no
sign
of
him
was
yet
to
be
seen
*punct* ;
only
*punct* ,
they
said
he
was
in
the
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
as
that
was
not
at
all
his
proper
business
*punct* ,
but
the
pilot's
*punct* ;
and
as
he
was
not
yet
completely
recovered
*punct* ,
so
they
said
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
captain
ahab
stayed
below
*punct* .
*break*
and
all
this
seemed
natural
enough
*punct* ;
especially
as
in
the
merchant
service
many
captains
never
show
themselves
on
deck
for
a
considerable
time
after
heaving
up
the
anchor
*punct* ,
but
remain
over
the
cabin
table
*punct* ,
having
a
farewell
merrymaking
with
their
shore
friends
*punct* ,
before
they
quit
the
ship
for
good
with
the
pilot
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
was
not
much
chance
to
think
over
the
matter
*punct* ,
for
captain
peleg
was
now
all
alive
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
to
do
most
of
the
talking
and
commanding
*punct* ,
and
not
bildad
*punct* .
*break*
aft
here
*punct* ,
ye
sons
of
bachelors
*punct* ,
he
cried
*punct* ,
as
the
sailors
lingered
at
the
main-mast
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ,
drive
em
aft
*punct* .
*break*
strike
the
tent
there!
*punct* ,
was
the
next
order
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
hinted
before
*punct* ,
this
whalebone
marquee
was
never
pitched
except
in
port
*punct* ;
and
on
board
the
pequod
*punct* ,
for
thirty
years
*punct* ,
the
order
to
strike
the
tent
was
well
known
to
be
the
next
thing
to
heaving
up
the
anchor
*punct* .
*break*
man
the
capstan
*punct* !
*break*
blood
and
thunder!
*punct* ,
jump!
*punct* ,
was
the
next
command
*punct* ,
and
the
crew
sprang
for
the
handspikes
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
getting
under
weigh
*punct* ,
the
station
generally
occupied
by
the
pilot
is
the
forward
part
of
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
and
here
bildad
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
with
peleg
*punct* ,
be
it
known
*punct* ,
in
addition
to
his
other
offices
*punct* ,
was
one
of
the
licensed
pilots
of
the
port
*punct* ,
he
being
suspected
to
have
got
himself
made
a
pilot
in
order
to
save
the
nantucket
pilot-fee
to
all
the
ships
he
was
concerned
in
*punct* ,
for
he
never
piloted
any
other
craft
*punct* ,
bildad
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
might
now
be
seen
actively
engaged
in
looking
over
the
bows
for
the
approaching
anchor
*punct* ,
and
at
intervals
singing
what
seemed
a
dismal
stave
of
psalmody
*punct* ,
to
cheer
the
hands
at
the
windlass
*punct* ,
who
roared
forth
some
sort
of
a
chorus
about
the
girls
in
booble
alley
*punct* ,
with
hearty
good
will
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
not
three
days
previous
*punct* ,
bildad
had
told
them
that
no
profane
songs
would
be
allowed
on
board
the
pequod
*punct* ,
particularly
in
getting
under
weigh
*punct* ;
and
charity
*punct* ,
his
sister
*punct* ,
had
placed
a
small
choice
copy
of
watts
in
each
seaman's
berth
*punct* .
*break*
i
almost
thought
he
would
sink
the
ship
before
the
anchor
could
be
got
up
*punct* ;
involuntarily
i
paused
on
my
handspike
*punct* ,
and
told
queequeg
to
do
the
same
*punct* ,
thinking
of
the
perils
we
both
ran
*punct* ,
in
starting
on
the
voyage
with
such
a
devil
for
a
pilot
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
comforting
myself
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
with
the
thought
that
in
pious
bildad
might
be
found
some
salvation
*punct* ,
spite
of
his
seven
hundred
and
seventy-seventh
lay
*punct* ;
when
i
felt
a
sudden
sharp
poke
in
my
rear
*punct* ,
and
turning
round
*punct* ,
was
horrified
at
the
apparition
of
captain
peleg
in
the
act
of
withdrawing
his
leg
from
my
immediate
vicinity
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
my
first
kick
*punct* .
*break*
is
that
the
way
they
heave
in
the
marchant
service
*punct* ?
*break*
spring
*punct* ,
thou
sheep-head
*punct* ;
spring
*punct* ,
and
break
thy
backbone
*punct* !
*break*
why
don't
ye
spring
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
all
of
ye
*punct* ,
spring
*punct* !
*break*
spring
*punct* ,
thou
chap
with
the
red
whiskers
*punct* ;
spring
there
*punct* ,
scotchcap
*punct* ;
spring
*punct* ,
thou
green
pants
*punct* .
*break*
spring
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
all
of
ye
*punct* ,
and
spring
your
eyes
out
*punct* !
*break*
and
so
saying
*punct* ,
he
moved
along
the
windlass
*punct* ,
here
and
there
using
his
leg
very
freely
*punct* ,
while
imperturbable
bildad
kept
leading
off
with
his
psalmody
*punct* .
*break*
thinks
i
*punct* ,
captain
peleg
must
have
been
drinking
something
to-day
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
the
anchor
was
up
*punct* ,
the
sails
were
set
*punct* ,
and
off
we
glided
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
short
*punct* ,
cold
christmas
*punct* ;
and
as
the
short
northern
day
merged
into
night
*punct* ,
we
found
ourselves
almost
broad
upon
the
wintry
ocean
*punct* ,
whose
freezing
spray
cased
us
in
ice
*punct* ,
as
in
polished
armor
*punct* .
*break*
the
long
rows
of
teeth
on
the
bulwarks
glistened
in
the
moonlight
*punct* ;
and
like
the
white
ivory
tusks
of
some
huge
elephant
*punct* ,
vast
curving
icicles
depended
from
the
bows
*punct* .
*break*
lank
bildad
*punct* ,
as
pilot
*punct* ,
headed
the
first
watch
*punct* ,
and
ever
and
anon
*punct* ,
as
the
old
craft
deep
dived
into
the
green
seas
*punct* ,
and
sent
the
shivering
frost
all
over
her
*punct* ,
and
the
winds
howled
*punct* ,
and
the
cordage
rang
*punct* ,
his
steady
notes
were
heard,
*punct* ,
sweet
fields
beyond
the
swelling
flood
*punct* ,
stand
dressed
in
living
green
*punct* .
*break*
so
to
the
jews
old
canaan
stood
*punct* ,
while
jordan
rolled
between
*punct* .
*break*
never
did
those
sweet
words
sound
more
sweetly
to
me
than
then
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
full
of
hope
and
fruition
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
we
gained
such
an
offing
*punct* ,
that
the
two
pilots
were
needed
no
longer
*punct* .
*break*
the
stout
sail-boat
that
had
accompanied
us
began
ranging
alongside
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
curious
and
not
unpleasing
*punct* ,
how
peleg
and
bildad
were
affected
at
this
juncture
*punct* ,
especially
captain
bildad
*punct* .
*break*
for
loath
to
depart
*punct* ,
yet
*punct* ;
very
loath
to
leave
*punct* ,
for
good
*punct* ,
a
ship
bound
on
so
long
and
perilous
a
voyage
*punct* ,
beyond
both
stormy
capes
*punct* ;
a
ship
in
which
some
thousands
of
his
hard
earned
dollars
were
invested
*punct* ;
a
ship
*punct* ,
in
which
an
old
shipmate
sailed
as
captain
*punct* ;
a
man
almost
as
old
as
he
*punct* ,
once
more
starting
to
encounter
all
the
terrors
of
the
pitiless
jaw
*punct* ;
loath
to
say
good-bye
to
a
thing
so
every
way
brimful
of
every
interest
to
him,
*punct* ,
poor
old
bildad
lingered
long
*punct* ;
paced
the
deck
with
anxious
strides
ran
down
into
the
cabin
to
speak
another
farewell
word
there
*punct* ;
again
came
on
deck
*punct* ,
and
looked
to
windward
*punct* ;
looked
towards
the
wide
and
endless
waters
*punct* ,
only
bounded
by
the
far-off
unseen
eastern
continents
*punct* ;
looked
towards
the
land
*punct* ,
looked
aloft
*punct* ;
looked
right
and
left
*punct* ;
looked
everywhere
and
nowhere
*punct* ;
and
at
last
*punct* ,
mechanically
coiling
a
rope
upon
its
pin
*punct* ,
convulsively
grasped
stout
peleg
by
the
hand
*punct* ,
and
holding
up
a
lantern
*punct* ,
for
a
moment
stood
gazing
heroically
in
his
face
*punct* ,
as
much
as
to
say
*punct* ,
nevertheless
*punct* ,
friend
peleg
*punct* ,
i
can
stand
it
*punct* ;
yes
*punct* ,
i
can
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
peleg
himself
*punct* ,
he
took
it
more
like
a
philosopher
*punct* ;
but
for
all
his
philosophy
*punct* ,
there
was
a
tear
twinkling
in
his
eye
*punct* ,
when
the
lantern
came
too
near
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
did
not
a
little
run
from
cabin
to
deck
*punct* ,
now
a
word
below
*punct* ,
and
now
a
word
with
starbuck
*punct* ,
the
chief
mate
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
at
last
*punct* ,
he
turned
to
his
comrade
*punct* ,
with
a
final
sort
of
look
about
him,
*punct* ,
captain
bildad
*punct* ,
come
*punct* ,
old
shipmate
*punct* ,
we
must
go
*punct* .
*break*
back
the
main-yard
there
*punct* !
*break*
stand
by
to
come
close
alongside
*punct* ,
now
*punct* !
*break*
careful
*punct* ,
careful!
*punct* ,
come
*punct* ,
bildad
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* ,
say
your
last
*punct* .
*break*
hurrah
and
away
*punct* !
*break*
god
bless
ye
*punct* ,
and
have
ye
in
his
holy
keeping
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
murmured
old
bildad
*punct* ,
almost
incoherently
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
ye'll
have
fine
weather
now
*punct* ,
so
that
captain
ahab
may
soon
be
moving
among
ye
*punct* ,
a
pleasant
sun
is
all
he
needs
*punct* ,
and
ye'll
have
plenty
of
them
in
the
tropic
voyage
ye
go
*punct* .
*break*
be
careful
in
the
hunt
*punct* ,
ye
mates
*punct* .
*break*
don't
stave
the
boats
needlessly
*punct* ,
ye
harpooneers
*punct* ;
good
white
cedar
plank
is
raised
full
three
per
cent
*punct* .
*break*
within
the
year
*punct* .
*break*
don't
forget
your
prayers
*punct* ,
either
*punct* .
*break*
mr
starbuck
*punct* ,
mind
that
cooper
don't
waste
the
spare
staves
*punct* .
*break*
the
sail-needles
are
in
the
green
locker
*punct* !
*break*
don't
whale
it
too
much
a
lord's
days
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ;
but
don't
miss
a
fair
chance
either
*punct* ,
that's
rejecting
heaven's
good
gifts
*punct* .
*break*
have
an
eye
to
the
molasses
tierce
*punct* ,
mr.
stubb
*punct* ;
it
was
a
little
leaky
*punct* ,
i
thought
*punct* .
*break*
if
ye
touch
at
the
islands
*punct* ,
mr.
flask
*punct* ,
beware
of
fornication
*punct* .
*break*
good-bye
*punct* ,
good-bye
*punct* !
*break*
don't
keep
that
cheese
too
long
down
in
the
hold
*punct* ,
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ;
it'll
spoil
*punct* .
*break*
be
careful
with
the
butter
*punct* ,
twenty
cents
the
pound
it
was
*punct* ,
and
mind
ye
*punct* ,
if
*punct* ,
come
*punct* ,
come
*punct* ,
captain
bildad
*punct* ;
stop
palavering,
*punct* ,
away
*punct* !
*break*
and
with
that
*punct* ,
peleg
hurried
him
over
the
side
*punct* ,
and
both
dropt
into
the
boat
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
with
sympathetic
awe
and
fearfulness
upon
the
man
*punct* ,
who
in
mid-winter
just
landed
from
a
four
years
dangerous
voyage
*punct* ,
could
so
unrestingly
push
off
again
for
still
another
tempestuous
term
*punct* .
*break*
the
land
seemed
scorching
to
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
wonderfullest
things
are
ever
the
unmentionable
*punct* ;
deep
memories
yield
no
epitaphs
*punct* ;
this
six-inch
chapter
is
the
stoneless
grave
of
bulkington
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
only
say
that
it
fared
with
him
as
with
the
storm-tossed
ship
*punct* ,
that
miserably
drives
along
the
leeward
land
*punct* .
*break*
the
port
would
fain
give
succor
*punct* ;
the
port
is
pitiful
*punct* ;
in
the
port
is
safety
*punct* ,
comfort
*punct* ,
hearthstone
*punct* ,
supper
*punct* ,
warm
blankets
*punct* ,
friends
*punct* ,
all
that's
kind
to
our
mortalities
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
that
gale
*punct* ,
the
port
*punct* ,
the
land
*punct* ,
is
that
ship's
direst
jeopardy
*punct* ;
she
must
fly
all
hospitality
*punct* ;
one
touch
of
land
*punct* ,
though
it
but
graze
the
keel
*punct* ,
would
make
her
shudder
through
and
through
*punct* .
*break*
with
all
her
might
she
crowds
all
sail
off
shore
*punct* ;
in
so
doing
*punct* ,
fights
gainst
the
very
winds
that
fain
would
blow
her
homeward
*punct* ;
seeks
all
the
lashed
sea's
landlessness
again
*punct* ;
for
refuge's
sake
forlornly
rushing
into
peril
*punct* ;
her
only
friend
her
bitterest
foe
*punct* !
*break*
know
ye
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
bulkington
*punct* ?
*break*
glimpses
do
ye
seem
to
see
of
that
mortally
intolerable
truth
*punct* ;
that
all
deep
*punct* ,
earnest
thinking
is
but
the
intrepid
effort
of
the
soul
to
keep
the
open
independence
of
her
sea
*punct* ;
while
the
wildest
winds
of
heaven
and
earth
conspire
to
cast
her
on
the
treacherous
*punct* ,
slavish
shore
*punct* ?
*break*
but
as
in
landlessness
alone
resides
the
highest
truth
*punct* ,
shoreless
*punct* ,
indefinite
as
god
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ,
better
is
it
to
perish
in
that
howling
infinite
*punct* ,
than
be
ingloriously
dashed
upon
the
lee
*punct* ,
even
if
that
were
safety
*punct* !
*break*
for
worm-like
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
who
would
craven
crawl
to
land
*punct* !
*break*
terrors
of
the
terrible
*punct* !
*break*
is
all
this
agony
so
vain
*punct* ?
*break*
take
heart
*punct* ,
take
heart
*punct* ,
o
bulkington
*punct* !
*break*
bear
thee
grimly
*punct* ,
demigod
*punct* !
*break*
up
from
the
spray
of
thy
ocean-perishing
*punct* ,
straight
up
*punct* ,
leaps
thy
apotheosis
*punct* !
*break*
in
the
first
place
*punct* ,
it
may
be
deemed
almost
superfluous
to
establish
the
fact
*punct* ,
that
among
people
at
large
*punct* ,
the
business
of
whaling
is
not
accounted
on
a
level
with
what
are
called
the
liberal
professions
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
sperm
whale
fishery
*punct* ,
to
his
visiting
card
*punct* ,
such
a
procedure
would
be
deemed
pre-eminently
presuming
and
ridiculous
*punct* .
*break*
doubtless
one
leading
reason
why
the
world
declines
honoring
us
whalemen
*punct* ,
is
this
*punct* :
they
think
that
*punct* ,
at
best
*punct* ,
our
vocation
amounts
to
a
butchering
sort
of
business
*punct* ;
and
that
when
actively
engaged
therein
*punct* ,
we
are
surrounded
by
all
manner
of
defilements
*punct* .
*break*
butchers
we
are
*punct* ,
that
is
true
*punct* .
*break*
but
butchers
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
and
butchers
of
the
bloodiest
badge
have
been
all
martial
commanders
whom
the
world
invariably
delights
to
honor
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
for
the
matter
of
the
alleged
uncleanliness
of
our
business
*punct* ,
ye
shall
soon
be
initiated
into
certain
facts
hitherto
pretty
generally
unknown
*punct* ,
and
which
*punct* ,
upon
the
whole
*punct* ,
will
triumphantly
plant
the
sperm
whale-ship
at
least
among
the
cleanliest
things
of
this
tidy
earth
*punct* .
*break*
but
even
granting
the
charge
in
question
to
be
true
*punct* ;
what
disordered
slippery
decks
of
a
whale-ship
are
comparable
to
the
unspeakable
carrion
of
those
battle-fields
from
which
so
many
soldiers
return
to
drink
in
all
ladies
plaudits
*punct* ?
*break*
for
what
are
the
comprehensible
terrors
of
man
compared
with
the
interlinked
terrors
and
wonders
of
god
*punct* !
*break*
but
*punct* ,
though
the
world
scouts
at
us
whale
hunters
*punct* ,
yet
does
it
unwittingly
pay
us
the
profoundest
homage
*punct* ;
yea
*punct* ,
an
all-abounding
adoration
*punct* !
*break*
for
almost
all
the
tapers
*punct* ,
lamps
*punct* ,
and
candles
that
burn
round
the
globe
*punct* ,
burn
*punct* ,
as
before
so
many
shrines
*punct* ,
to
our
glory
*punct* !
*break*
but
look
at
this
matter
in
other
lights
*punct* ;
weigh
it
in
all
sorts
of
scales
*punct* ;
see
what
we
whalemen
are
*punct* ,
and
have
been
*punct* .
*break*
why
did
the
dutch
in
dewitt's
time
have
admirals
of
their
whaling

a

curious
process

seasoning

gone

certain
i

however

that
a

head
is
solemnly
oiled
at

coronation

even
as

can
it
be
*punct* ,
though

that
they
anoint
it
with
a
view

making
its
interior
run
well
*punct* ,
as

anoint

*break*
much
might
be
ruminated
here
*punct* ,
concerning
the
essential
dignity
of
this
regal
process
*punct* ,
because
in
common
life
we
esteem

meanly

contemptibly
a
fellow

anoints
his
hair
*punct* ,

palpably
smells

anointing

*break*
in
truth
*punct* ,
a
mature
man

uses
hair-oil
*punct* ,
unless
medicinally

that
man
has
probably
got
a
quoggy
spot
in

somewhere

*break*
as
a
general
rule
*punct* ,
he
can't
amount
to
much
in
his
totality
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
only
thing
to
be
considered
here
*punct* ,
is
this
*punct* ,
what
kind
of
oil
is
used
at
coronations
*punct* ?
*break*
certainly
it
cannot
be
olive
oil

nor
macassar

what
then
can
it
possibly
be
*punct* ,
but
sperm
oil
in
its
unmanufactured

unpolluted

the
sweetest

*break*
think
of
that

loyal
britons

*break*
he
was
a
long
*punct* ,
earnest
man
*punct* ,
and
though
born
on
an
icy
coast
*punct* ,
seemed
well
adapted
to
endure
hot
latitudes
*punct* ,
his
flesh
being
hard
as
twice-baked
biscuit
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
have
been
born
in
some
time
of
general
drought
and
famine
*punct* ,
or
upon
one
of
those
fast
days
for
which
his
state
is
famous
*punct* .
*break*
only
some
thirty
arid
summers
had
he
seen
*punct* ;
those
summers
had
dried
up
all
his
physical
superfluousness
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
*punct* ,
his
thinness
*punct* ,
so
to
speak
*punct* ,
seemed
no
more
the
token
of
wasting
anxieties
and
cares
*punct* ,
than
it
seemed
the
indication
of
any
bodily
blight
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
merely
the
condensation
of
the
man
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
by
no
means
ill-looking
*punct* ;
quite
the
contrary
*punct* .
*break*
his
pure
tight
skin
was
an
excellent
fit
*punct* ;
and
closely
wrapped
up
in
it
*punct* ,
and
embalmed
with
inner
health
and
strength
*punct* ,
like
a
revivified
egyptian
*punct* ,
this
starbuck
seemed
prepared
to
endure
for
long
ages
to
come
*punct* ,
and
to
endure
always
*punct* ,
as
now
*punct* ;
for
be
it
polar
snow
or
torrid
sun
*punct* ,
like
a
patent
chronometer
*punct* ,
his
interior
vitality
was
warranted
to
do
well
in
all
climates
*punct* .
*break*
looking
into
his
eyes
*punct* ,
you
seemed
to
see
there
the
yet
lingering
images
of
those
thousand-fold
perils
he
had
calmly
confronted
through
life
*punct* .
*break*
a
staid
*punct* ,
steadfast
man
*punct* ,
whose
life
for
the
most
part
was
a
telling
pantomime
of
action
*punct* ,
and
not
a
tame
chapter
of
sounds
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
for
all
his
hardy
sobriety
and
fortitude
*punct* ,
there
were
certain
qualities
in
him
which
at
times
affected
*punct* ,
and
in
some
cases
seemed
well
nigh
to
overbalance
all
the
rest
*punct* .
*break*
uncommonly
conscientious
for
a
seaman
*punct* ,
and
endued
with
a
deep
natural
reverence
*punct* ,
the
wild
watery
loneliness
of
his
life
did
therefore
strongly
incline
him
to
superstition
*punct* ;
but
to
that
sort
of
superstition
*punct* ,
which
in
some
organizations
seems
rather
to
spring
*punct* ,
somehow
*punct* ,
from
intelligence
than
from
ignorance
*punct* .
*break*
outward
portents
and
inward
presentiments
were
his
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
at
times
these
things
bent
the
welded
iron
of
his
soul
*punct* ,
much
more
did
his
far-away
domestic
memories
of
his
young
cape
wife
and
child
*punct* ,
tend
to
bend
him
still
more
from
the
original
ruggedness
of
his
nature
*punct* ,
and
open
him
still
further
to
those
latent
influences
which
*punct* ,
in
some
honest-hearted
men
*punct* ,
restrain
the
gush
of
dare-devil
daring
*punct* ,
so
often
evinced
by
others
in
the
more
perilous
vicissitudes
of
the
fishery
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
have
no
man
in
my
boat
*punct* ,
said
starbuck
*punct* ,
who
is
not
afraid
of
a
whale
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
shall
ere
long
see
what
that
word
careful
precisely
means
when
used
by
a
man
like
stubb
*punct* ,
or
almost
any
other
whale
hunter
*punct* .
*break*
starbuck
was
no
crusader
after
perils
*punct* ;
in
him
courage
was
not
a
sentiment
*punct* ;
but
a
thing
simply
useful
to
him
*punct* ,
and
always
at
hand
upon
all
mortally
practical
occasions
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
he
thought
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
that
in
this
business
of
whaling
*punct* ,
courage
was
one
of
the
great
staple
outfits
of
the
ship
*punct* ,
like
her
beef
and
her
bread
*punct* ,
and
not
to
be
foolishly
wasted
*punct* .
*break*
wherefore
he
had
no
fancy
for
lowering
for
whales
after
sun-down
*punct* ;
nor
for
persisting
in
fighting
a
fish
that
too
much
persisted
in
fighting
him
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
thought
starbuck
*punct* ,
i
am
here
in
this
critical
ocean
to
kill
whales
for
my
living
*punct* ,
and
not
to
be
killed
by
them
for
theirs
*punct* ;
and
that
hundreds
of
men
had
been
so
killed
starbuck
well
knew
*punct* .
*break*
what
doom
was
his
own
father's
*punct* ?
*break*
where
*punct* ,
in
the
bottomless
deeps
*punct* ,
could
he
find
the
torn
limbs
of
his
brother
*punct* ?
*break*
with
memories
like
these
in
him
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
given
to
a
certain
superstitiousness
*punct* ,
as
has
been
said
*punct* ;
the
courage
of
this
starbuck
which
could
*punct* ,
nevertheless
*punct* ,
still
flourish

must
indeed
have
been
extreme

it

reasonable
nature
that
a
man
so
organized
*punct* ,

with
such
terrible
experiences

remembrances
as
he
had
*punct* ;
it
was
not
in
nature
that
these
things
should
fail
in
latently
engendering
an
element
in
him
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
under
suitable
circumstances
*punct* ,
would
break
out
from
its
confinement
*punct* ,
and
burn
all
his
courage
up
*punct* .
*break*
and
brave
as
he
might
be
*punct* ,
it
was
that
sort
of
bravery
chiefly
*punct* ,
visible
in
some
intrepid
men
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
while
generally
abiding
firm
in

whales
*punct* ,

any
of
the
ordinary
irrational
horrors

cannot
withstand
those
more
terrific

more
spiritual
terrors

menace
you

the
complete
abasement
of
poor
starbuck's
fortitude

scarce

the

is
a

most
sorrowful

shocking

expose
the

that
immaculate
manliness
we

within
ourselves

so
far
within
us
*punct* ,
that
it
remains
intact
though
all
the
outer
character

gone

bleeds
with
keenest
anguish
at
the
undraped
spectacle

a
valor-ruined
man

piety

at
such
a
shameful
sight

completely
stifle
her
upbraidings
against
the

*break*

this
august
dignity
i

is
not
the
dignity
of
kings

that
abounding
dignity
which
has
no
robed
investiture
*punct* .
*break*
thou
shalt
see
it
shining
in
the
arm
that
wields
a
pick

drives
a
spike
*punct* ;
that
democratic
dignity
which
*punct* ,
on

radiates
without

*break*
he
was
a
native
of
cape
cod
*punct* ;
and
hence
*punct* ,
according
to
local
usage
*punct* ,
was
called
a
cape-cod-man
*punct* .
*break*
a
happy-go-lucky
*punct* ;
neither
craven
nor
valiant
*punct* ;
taking
perils
as
they
came
with
an
indifferent
air
*punct* ;
and
while
engaged
in
the
most
imminent
crisis
of
the
chase
*punct* ,
toiling
away
*punct* ,
calm
and
collected
as
a
journeyman
joiner
engaged
for
the
year
*punct* .
*break*
good-humored
*punct* ,
easy
*punct* ,
and
careless
*punct* ,
he
presided
over
his
whale-boat
as
if
the
most
deadly
encounter
were
but
a
dinner
*punct* ,
and
his
crew
all
invited
guests
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
as
particular
about
the
comfortable
arrangement
of
his
part
of
the
boat
*punct* ,
as
an
old
stage-driver
is
about
the
snugness
of
his
box
*punct* .
*break*
when
close
to
the
whale
*punct* ,
in
the
very
death-lock
of
the
fight
*punct* ,
he
handled
his
unpitying
lance
coolly
and
off-handedly
*punct* ,
as
a
whistling
tinker
his
hammer
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
hum
over
his
old
rigadig
tunes
while
flank
and
flank
with
the
most
exasperated
monster
*punct* .
*break*
long
usage
had
*punct* ,
for
this
stubb
*punct* ,
converted
the
jaws
of
death
into
an
easy
chair
*punct* .
*break*
what
he
thought
of
death
itself
*punct* ,
there
is
no
telling
*punct* .
*break*
whether
he
ever
thought
of
it
at
all
*punct* ,
might
be
a
question
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
if
he
ever
did
chance
to
cast
his
mind
that
way
after
a
comfortable
dinner
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* ,
like
a
good
sailor
*punct* ,
he
took
it
to
be
a
sort
of
call
of
the
watch
to
tumble
aloft
*punct* ,
and
bestir
themselves
there
*punct* ,
about
something
which
he
would
find
out
when
he
obeyed
the
order
*punct* ,
and
not
sooner
*punct* .
*break*
what
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
with
other
things
*punct* ,
made
stubb
such
an
easygoing
*punct* ,
unfearing
man
*punct* ,
so
cheerily
trudging
off
with
the
burden
of
life
in
a
world
full
of
grave
peddlers
*punct* ,
all
bowed
to
the
ground
with
their
packs
*punct* ;
what
helped
to
bring
about
that
almost
impious
good-humor
of
his
*punct* ;
that
thing
must
have
been
his
pipe
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
like
his
nose
*punct* ,
his
short
*punct* ,
black
little
pipe
was
one
of
the
regular
features
of
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
when
stubb
dressed
*punct* ,
instead
of
first
putting
his
legs
into
his
trowsers
*punct* ,
he
put
his
pipe
into
his
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
this
continual
smoking
must
have
been
one
cause
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
of
his
peculiar
disposition
*punct* ;
for
every
one
knows
that
this
earthly
air
*punct* ,
whether
ashore
or
afloat
*punct* ,
is
terribly
infected
with
the
nameless
miseries
of
the
numberless
mortals
who
have
died
exhaling
it
*punct* ;
and
as
in
time
of
the
cholera
*punct* ,
some
people
go
about
with
a
camphorated
handkerchief
to
their
mouths
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
likewise
*punct* ,
against
all
mortal
tribulations
*punct* ,
stubb's
tobacco
smoke
might
have
operated
as
a
sort
of
disinfecting
agent
*punct* .
*break*
the
third
mate
was
flask
*punct* ,
a
native
of
tisbury
*punct* ,
in
martha's
vineyard
*punct* .
*break*
a
short
*punct* ,
stout
*punct* ,
ruddy
young
fellow
*punct* ,
very
pugnacious
concerning
whales
*punct* ,
who
somehow
seemed
to
think
that
the
great
leviathans
had
personally
and
hereditarily
affronted
him
*punct* ;
and
therefore
it
was
a
sort
of
point
of
honor
with
him
*punct* ,
to
destroy
them
whenever
encountered
*punct* .
*break*
so
utterly
lost
was
he
to
all
sense
of
reverence
for
the
many
marvels
of
their
majestic
bulk
and
mystic
ways
*punct* ;
and
so
dead
to
anything
like
an
apprehension
of
any
possible
danger
from
encountering
them
*punct* ;
that
in
his
poor
opinion
*punct* ,
the
wondrous
whale
was
but
a
species
of
magnified
mouse
*punct* ,
or
at
least
water-rat
*punct* ,
requiring
only
a
little
circumvention
and
some
small
application
of
time
and
trouble
in
order
to
kill
and
boil
*punct* .
*break*
this
ignorant
*punct* ,
unconscious
fearlessness
of
his
made
him
a
little
waggish
in
the
matter
of
whales
*punct* ;
he
followed
these
fish
for
the
fun
of
it
*punct* ;
and
a
three
years
voyage
round
cape
horn
was
only
a
jolly
joke
that
lasted
that
length
of
time
*punct* .
*break*
as
a
carpenter's
nails
are
divided
into
wrought
nails
and
cut
nails
*punct* ;
so
mankind
may
be
similarly
divided
*punct* .
*break*
little
flask
was
one
of
the
wrought
ones
*punct* ;
made
to
clinch
tight
and
last
long
*punct* .
*break*
they
called
him
king-post
on
board
of
the
pequod
*punct* ;
because
*punct* ,
in
form
*punct* ,
he
could
be
well
likened
to
the
short
*punct* ,
square
timber
known
by
that
name
in
arctic
whalers
*punct* ;
and
which
by
the
means
of
many
radiating
side
timbers
inserted
in
it
*punct* ,
served
to
brace
the
ship
against
the
icy
concussions
of
those
battering
seas
*punct* .
*break*
they
it
was
who
by
universal
prescription
commanded
three
of
the
pequod's
boats
as
headsmen
*punct* .
*break*
in
that
grand
order
of
battle
in
which
captain
ahab
would
probably
marshal
his
forces
to
descend
on
the
whales
*punct* ,
these
three
headsmen
were
as
captains
of
companies
*punct* .
*break*
or
*punct* ,
being
armed
with
their
long
keen
whaling
spears
*punct* ,
they
were
as
a
picked
trio
of
lancers
*punct* ;
even
as
the
harpooneers
were
flingers
of
javelins
*punct* .
*break*
and
since
in
this
famous
fishery
*punct* ,
each
mate
or
headsman
*punct* ,
like
a
gothic
knight
of
old
*punct* ,
is
always
accompanied
by
his
boat-steerer
or
harpooneer
*punct* ,
who
in
certain
conjunctures
provides
him
with
a
fresh
lance
*punct* ,
when
the
former
one
has
been
badly
twisted
*punct* ,
or
elbowed
in
the
assault
*punct* ;
and
moreover
*punct* ,
as
there
generally
subsists
between
the
two
*punct* ,
a
close
intimacy
and
friendliness
*punct* ;
it
is
therefore
but
meet
*punct* ,
that
in
this
place
we
set
down
who
the
pequod's
harpooneers
were
*punct* ,
and
to
what
headsman
each
of
them
belonged
*punct* .
*break*
first
of
all
was
queequeg
*punct* ,
whom
starbuck
*punct* ,
the
chief
mate
*punct* ,
had
selected
for
his
squire
*punct* .
*break*
but
queequeg
is
already
known
*punct* .
*break*
next
was
tashtego
*punct* ,
an
unmixed
indian
from
gay
head
*punct* ,
the
most
westerly
promontory
of
martha's
vineyard
*punct* ,
where
there
still
exists
the
last
remnant
of
a
village
of
red
men
*punct* ,
which
has
long
supplied
the
neighboring
island
of
nantucket
with
many
of
her
most
daring
harpooneers
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
fishery
*punct* ,
they
usually
go
by
the
generic
name
of
gay-headers
*punct* .
*break*
tashtego's
long
*punct* ,
lean
*punct* ,
sable
hair
*punct* ,
his
high
cheek
bones
*punct* ,
and
black
rounding
eyes
*punct* ,
for
an
indian
*punct* ,
oriental
in
their
largeness
*punct* ,
but
antarctic
in
their
glittering
expression
*punct* ,
all
this
sufficiently
proclaimed
him
an
inheritor
of
the
unvitiated
blood
of
those
proud
warrior
hunters
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
in
quest
of
the
great
new
england
moose
*punct* ,
had
scoured
*punct* ,
bow
in
hand
*punct* ,
the
aboriginal
forests
of
the
main
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
longer
snuffing
in
the
trail
of
the
wild
beasts
of
the
woodland
*punct* ,
tashtego
now
hunted
in
the
wake
of
the
great
whales
of
the
sea
*punct* ;
the
unerring
harpoon
of
the
son
fitly
replacing
the
infallible
arrow
of
the
sires
*punct* .
*break*
to
look
at
the
tawny
brawn
of
his
lithe
snaky
limbs
*punct* ,
you
would
almost
have
credited
the
superstitions
of
some
of
the
earlier
puritans
*punct* ,
and
half
believed
this
wild
indian
to
be
a
son
of
the
prince
of
the
powers
of
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
tashtego
was
stubb
the
second
mate's
squire
*punct* .
*break*
suspended
from
his
ears
were
two
golden
hoops
*punct* ,
so
large
that
the
sailors
called
them
ring-bolts
*punct* ,
and
would
talk
of
securing
the
top-sail
halyards
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
youth
daggoo
had
voluntarily
shipped
on
board
of
a
whaler
*punct* ,
lying
in
a
lonely
bay
on
his
native
coast
*punct* .
*break*
and
never
having
been
anywhere
in
the
world
but
in
africa
*punct* ,
nantucket
*punct* ,
and
the
pagan
harbors
most
frequented
by
whalemen
*punct* ;
and
having
now
led
for
many
years
the
bold
life
of
the
fishery
in
the
ships
of
owners
uncommonly
heedful
of
what
manner
of
men
they
shipped
*punct* ;
daggoo
retained
all
his
barbaric
virtues
*punct* ,
and
erect
as
a
giraffe
*punct* ,
moved
about
the
decks
in
all
the
pomp
of
six
feet
five
in
his
socks
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
corporeal
humility
in
looking
up
at
him
*punct* ;
and
a
white
man
standing
before
him
seemed
a
white
flag
come
to
beg
truce
of
a
fortress
*punct* .
*break*
curious
to
tell
*punct* ,
this
imperial
negro
*punct* ,
ahasuerus
daggoo
*punct* ,
was
the
squire
of
little
flask
*punct* ,
who
looked
like
a
chess-man
beside
him
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
the
residue
of
the
pequod's
company
*punct* ,
be
it
said
*punct* ,
that
at
the
present
day
not
one
in
two
of
the
many
thousand
men
before
the
mast
employed
in
the
american
whale
fishery
*punct* ,

americans
born
*punct* ,
though
pretty
nearly
all
the
officers
are
*punct* .
*break*
herein
it
is
the
same
with
the
american
whale
fishery
as
with
the
american
army
and
military
and
merchant
navies
*punct* ,
and
the
engineering
forces
employed
in
the
construction
of
the
american
canals
and
railroads
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
because
in
all
these
cases
the
native
american
liberally
provides
the
brains
*punct* ,
the
rest
of
the
world
as
generously
supplying
the
muscles

*break*
no

the
outward

nantucket
whalers
frequently
touch
to
augment
their
crews

hardy

to
the
great
quarter-deck
on
high
*punct* ,
he
was
bid
strike
in
with
angels
*punct* ,
and
beat
his
tambourine
in
glory
*punct* ;
called
a
coward
here
*punct* ,
hailed
a
hero
there
*punct* !
*break*
the
mates
regularly
relieved
each
other
at
the
watches
*punct* ,
and
for
aught
that
could
be
seen
to
the
contrary
*punct* ,
they
seemed
to
be
the
only
commanders
of
the
ship
*punct* ;
only
they
sometimes
issued
from
the
cabin
with
orders
so
sudden
and
peremptory
*punct* ,
that
after
all
it
was
plain
they
but
commanded
vicariously
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
their
supreme
lord
and
dictator
was
there
*punct* ,
though
hitherto
unseen
by
any
eyes
not
permitted
to
penetrate
into
the
now
sacred
retreat
of
the
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
every
time
i
ascended
to
the
deck
from
my
watches
below
*punct* ,
i
instantly
gazed
aft
to
mark
if
any
strange
face
were
visible
*punct* ;
for
my
first
vague
disquietude
touching
the
unknown
captain
*punct* ,
now
in
the
seclusion
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
became
almost
a
perturbation
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
strangely
heightened
at
times
by
the
ragged
elijah's
diabolical
incoherences
uninvitedly
recurring
to
me
*punct* ,
with
a
subtle
energy
i
could
not
have
before
conceived
of
*punct* .
*break*
but
poorly
could
i
withstand
them
*punct* ,
much
as
in
other
moods
i
was
almost
ready
to
smile
at
the
solemn
whimsicalities
of
that
outlandish
prophet
of
the
wharves
*punct* .
*break*
for
though
the
harpooneers
*punct* ,
with
the
great
body
of
the
crew
*punct* ,
were
a
far
more
barbaric
*punct* ,
heathenish
*punct* ,
and
motley
set
than
any
of
the
tame
merchant-ship
companies
which
my
previous
experiences
had
made
me
acquainted
with
*punct* ,
still
i
ascribed
this
*punct* ,
and
rightly
ascribed
it
*punct* ,
to
the
fierce
uniqueness
of
the
very
nature
of
that
wild
scandinavian
vocation
in
which
i
had
so
abandonedly
embarked
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
was
especially
the
aspect
of
the
three
chief
officers
of
the
ship
*punct* ,
the
mates
*punct* ,
which
was
most
forcibly
calculated
to
allay
these
colorless
misgivings
*punct* ,
and
induce
confidence
and
cheerfulness
in
every
presentment
of
the
voyage
*punct* .
*break*
three
better
*punct* ,
more
likely
sea-officers
and
men
*punct* ,
each
in
his
own
different
way
*punct* ,
could
not
readily
be
found
*punct* ,
and
they
were
every
one
of
them
americans
*punct* ;
a
nantucketer
*punct* ,
a
vineyarder
*punct* ,
a
cape
man
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
it
being
christmas
when
the
ship
shot
from
out
her
harbor
*punct* ,
for
a
space
we
had
biting
polar
weather
*punct* ,
though
all
the
time
running
away
from
it
to
the
southward
*punct* ;
and
by
every
degree
and
minute
of
latitude
which
we
sailed
*punct* ,
gradually
leaving
that
merciless
winter
*punct* ,
and
all
its
intolerable
weather
behind
us
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
one
of
those
less
lowering
*punct* ,
but
still
grey
and
gloomy
enough
mornings
of
the
transition
*punct* ,
when
with
a
fair
wind
the
ship
was
rushing
through
the
water
with
a
vindictive
sort
of
leaping
and
melancholy
rapidity
*punct* ,
that
as
i
mounted
to
the
deck
at
the
call
of
the
forenoon
watch
*punct* ,
so
soon
as
i
levelled
my
glance
towards
the
taffrail
*punct* ,
foreboding
shivers
ran
over
me
*punct* .
*break*
reality
outran
apprehension
*punct* ;
captain
ahab
stood
upon
his
quarter-deck
*punct* .
*break*
there
seemed
no
sign
of
common
bodily
illness
about
him
*punct* ,
nor
of
the
recovery
from
any
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
like
a
man
cut
away
from
the
stake
*punct* ,
when
the
fire
has
overrunningly
wasted
all
the
limbs
without
consuming
them
*punct* ,
or
taking
away
one
particle
from
their
compacted
aged
robustness
*punct* .
*break*
his
whole
high
*punct* ,
broad
form
*punct* ,
seemed
made
of
solid
bronze
*punct* ,
and
shaped
in
an
unalterable
mould
*punct* ,
like
cellini's
cast
perseus
*punct* .
*break*
threading
its
way
out
from
among
his
grey
hairs
*punct* ,
and
continuing
right
down
one
side
of
his
tawny
scorched
face
and
neck
*punct* ,
till
it
disappeared
in
his
clothing
*punct* ,
you
saw
a
slender
rod-like
mark
*punct* ,
lividly
whitish
*punct* .
*break*
whether
that
mark
was
born
with
him
*punct* ,
or
whether
it
was
the
scar
left
by
some
desperate
wound
*punct* ,
no
one
could
certainly
say
*punct* .
*break*
by
some
tacit
consent
*punct* ,
throughout
the
voyage
little
or
no
allusion
was
made
to
it
*punct* ,
especially
by
the
mates
*punct* .
*break*
but
once
tashtego's
senior
*punct* ,
an
old
gay-head
indian
among
the
crew
*punct* ,
superstitiously
asserted
that
not
till
he
was
full
forty
years
old
did
ahab
become
that
way
branded
*punct* ,
and
then
it
came
upon
him
*punct* ,
not
in
the
fury
of
any
mortal
fray
*punct* ,
but
in
an
elemental
strife
at
sea
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
this
wild
hint
seemed
inferentially
negatived
*punct* ,
by
what
a
grey
manxman
insinuated
*punct* ,
an
old
sepulchral
man
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
having
never
before
sailed
out
of
nantucket
*punct* ,
had
never
ere
this
laid
eye
upon
wild
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
the
old
sea-traditions
*punct* ,
the
immemorial
credulities
*punct* ,
popularly
invested
this
old
manxman
with
preternatural
powers
of
discernment
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
no
white
sailor
seriously
contradicted
him
when
he
said
that
if
ever
captain
ahab
should
be
tranquilly
laid
out
*punct* ,
which
might
hardly
come
to
pass
*punct* ,
so
he
muttered
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
whoever
should
do
that
last
office
for
the
dead
*punct* ,
would
find
a
birth-mark
on
him
from
crown
to
sole
*punct* .
*break*
so
powerfully
did
the
whole
grim
aspect
of
ahab
affect
me
*punct* ,
and
the
livid
brand
which
streaked
it
*punct* ,
that
for
the
first
few
moments
i
hardly
noted
that
not
a
little
of
this
overbearing
grimness
was
owing
to
the
barbaric
white
leg
upon
which
he
partly
stood
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
previously
come
to
me
that
this
ivory
leg
had
at
sea
been
fashioned
from
the
polished
bone
of
the
sperm
whale's
jaw
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
he
was
dismasted
off
japan
*punct* ,
said
the
old
gay-head
indian
once
*punct* ;
but
like
his
dismasted
craft
*punct* ,
he
shipped
another
mast
without
coming
home
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
a
quiver
of
em
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
struck
with
the
singular
posture
he
maintained
*punct* .
*break*
upon
each
side
of
the
pequod's
quarter
deck
*punct* ,
and
pretty
close
to
the
mizen
shrouds
*punct* ,
there
was
an
auger
hole
*punct* ,
bored
about
half
an
inch
or
so
*punct* ,
into
the
plank
*punct* .
*break*
his
bone
leg
steadied
in
that
hole
*punct* ;
one
arm
elevated
*punct* ,
and
holding
by
a
shroud
*punct* ;
captain
ahab
stood
erect
*punct* ,
looking
straight
out
beyond
the
ship's
ever-pitching
prow
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
word
he
spoke
*punct* ;
nor
did
his
officers
say
aught
to
him
*punct* ;
though
by
all
their
minutest
gestures
and
expressions
*punct* ,
they
plainly
showed
the
uneasy
*punct* ,
if
not
painful
*punct* ,
consciousness
of
being
under
a
troubled
master-eye
*punct* .
*break*
and
not
only
that
*punct* ,
but
moody
stricken
ahab
stood
before
them
with
a
crucifixion
in
his
face
*punct* ;
in
all
the
nameless
regal
overbearing
dignity
of
some
mighty
woe
*punct* .
*break*
ere
long
*punct* ,
from
his
first
visit
in
the
air
*punct* ,
he
withdrew
into
his
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
but
after
that
morning
*punct* ,
he
was
every
day
visible
to
the
crew
*punct* ;
either
standing
in
his
pivot-hole
*punct* ,
or
seated
upon
an
ivory
stool
he
had
*punct* ;
or
heavily
walking
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
sky
grew
less
gloomy
*punct* ;
indeed
*punct* ,
began
to
grow
a
little
genial
*punct* ,
he
became
still
less
and
less
a
recluse
*punct* ;
as
if
*punct* ,
when
the
ship
had
sailed
from
home
*punct* ,
nothing
but
the
dead
wintry
bleakness
of
the
sea
had
then
kept
him
so
secluded
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
by
and
by
*punct* ,
it
came
to
pass
*punct* ,
that
he
was
almost
continually
in
the
air
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
yet
*punct* ,
for
all
that
he
said
*punct* ,
or
perceptibly
did
*punct* ,
on
the
at
last
sunny
deck
*punct* ,
he
seemed
as
unnecessary
there
as
another
mast
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
pequod
was
only
making
a
passage
now
*punct* ;
not
regularly
cruising
*punct* ;
nearly
all
whaling
preparatives
needing
supervision
the
mates
were
fully
competent
to
*punct* ,
so
that
there
was
little
or
nothing
*punct* ,
out
of
himself
*punct* ,
to
employ
or
excite
ahab
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ;
and
thus
chase
away
*punct* ,
for
that
one
interval
*punct* ,
the
clouds
that
layer
upon
layer
were
piled
upon
his
brow
*punct* ,
as
ever
all
clouds
choose
the
loftiest
peaks
to
pile
themselves
upon
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
ere
long
*punct* ,
the
warm
*punct* ,
warbling
persuasiveness
of
the
pleasant
*punct* ,
holiday
weather
we
came
to
*punct* ,
seemed
gradually
to
charm
him
from
his
mood
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
as
when
the
red-cheeked
*punct* ,
dancing
girls
*punct* ,
april
and
may
*punct* ,
trip
home
to
the
wintry
*punct* ,
misanthropic
woods
*punct* ;
even
the
barest
*punct* ,
ruggedest
*punct* ,
most
thunder-cloven
old
oak
will
at
least
send
forth
some
few
green
sprouts
*punct* ,
to
welcome
such
glad-hearted
visitants
*punct* ;
so
ahab
did
*punct* ,
in
the
end
*punct* ,
a
little
respond
to
the
playful
allurings
of
that
girlish
air
*punct* .
*break*
the
warmly
cool
*punct* ,
clear
*punct* ,
ringing
*punct* ,
perfumed
*punct* ,
overflowing
*punct* ,
redundant
days
*punct* ,
were
as
crystal
goblets
of
persian
sherbet
*punct* ,
heaped
up
*punct* ,
flaked
up
*punct* ,
with
rose-water
snow
*punct* .
*break*
the
starred
and
stately
nights
seemed
haughty
dames
in
jewelled
velvets
*punct* ,
nursing
at
home
in
lonely
pride
*punct* ,
the
memory
of
their
absent
conquering
earls
*punct* ,
the
golden
helmeted
suns
*punct* !
*break*
for
sleeping
man
*punct* ,
twas
hard
to
choose
between
such
winsome
days
and
such
seducing
nights
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
the
witcheries
of
that
unwaning
weather
did
not
merely
lend
new
spells
and
potencies
to
the
outward
world
*punct* .
*break*
inward
they
turned
upon
the
soul
*punct* ,
especially
when
the
still
mild
hours
of
eve
came
on
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
memory
shot
her
crystals
as
the
clear
ice
most
forms
of
noiseless
twilights
*punct* .
*break*
and
all
these
subtle
agencies
*punct* ,
more
and
more
they
wrought
on
ahab's
texture
*punct* .
*break*
old
age
is
always
wakeful
*punct* ;
as
if
*punct* ,
the
longer
linked
with
life
*punct* ,
the
less
man
has
to
do
with
aught
that
looks
like
death
*punct* .
*break*
among
sea-commanders
*punct* ,
the
old
greybeards
will
oftenest
leave
their
berths
to
visit
the
night-cloaked
deck
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
so
with
ahab
*punct* ;
only
that
now
*punct* ,
of
late
*punct* ,
he
seemed
so
much
to
live
in
the
open
air
*punct* ,
that
truly
speaking
*punct* ,
his
visits
were
more
to
the
cabin
*punct* ,
than
from
*punct* ,
the
cabin
to
the
planks
*punct* .
*break*
it
feels
like
going
down
into
one's
tomb,
*punct* ,
he
would
mutter
to
himself,
*punct* ,
for
an
old
captain
like
me
to
be
descending
this
narrow
scuttle
*punct* ,
to
go
to
my
grave-dug
berth
*punct* .
*break*
some
considerating
touch
of
humanity
was
in
him
*punct* ;
for
at
times
like
these
*punct* ,
he
usually
abstained
from
patrolling
the
quarter-deck
*punct* ;
because
to
his
wearied
mates
*punct* ,
seeking
repose
within
six
inches
of
his
ivory
heel
*punct* ,
such
would
have
been
the
reverberating
crack
and
din
of
that
bony
step
*punct* ,
that
their
dreams
would
have
been
of
the
crunching
teeth
of
sharks
*punct* .
*break*
but
once
*punct* ,
the
mood
was
on
him
too
deep
for
common
regardings
*punct* ;
and
as
with
heavy
*punct* ,
lumber-like
pace
he
was
measuring
the
ship
from
taffrail
to
mainmast
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ,
the
odd
second
mate
*punct* ,
came
up
from
below
*punct* ,
and
with
a
certain
unassured
*punct* ,
deprecating
humorousness
*punct* ,
hinted
that
if
captain
ahab
was
pleased
to
walk
the
planks
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
no
one
could
say
nay
*punct* ;
but
there
might
be
some
way
of
muffling
the
noise
*punct* ;
hinting
something
indistinctly
and
hesitatingly
about
a
globe
of
tow
*punct* ,
and
the
insertion
into
it
*punct* ,
of
the
ivory
heel
*punct* .
*break*
stubb
*punct* ,
thou
did'st
not
know
ahab
then
*punct* .
*break*
am
i
a
cannon-ball
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ,
said
ahab
*punct* ,
that
thou
wouldst
wad
me
that
fashion
*punct* ?
*break*
but
go
thy
ways
*punct* ;
i
had
forgot
*punct* .
*break*
below
to
thy
nightly
grave
*punct* ;
where
such
as
ye
sleep
between
shrouds
*punct* ,
to
use
ye
to
the
filling
one
at
last.
*punct* ,
down
*punct* ,
dog
*punct* ,
and
kennel
*punct* !
*break*
starting
at
the
unforeseen
concluding
exclamation
of
the
so
suddenly
scornful
old
man
*punct* ,
stubb
was
speechless
a
moment
*punct* ;
then
said
excitedly
*punct* ,
i
am
not
used
to
be
spoken
to
that
way
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
i
do
but
less
than
half
like
it
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
gritted
ahab
between
his
set
teeth
*punct* ,
and
violently
moving
away
*punct* ,
as
if
to
avoid
some
passionate
temptation
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
not
yet
*punct* ,
said
stubb
*punct* ,
emboldened
*punct* ,
i
will
not
tamely
be
called
a
dog
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
then
be
called
ten
times
a
donkey
*punct* ,
and
a
mule
*punct* ,
and
an
ass
*punct* ,
and
begone
*punct* ,
or
i'll
clear
the
world
of
thee
*punct* !
*break*
as
he
said
this
*punct* ,
ahab
advanced
upon
him
with
such
overbearing
terrors
in
his
aspect
*punct* ,
that
stubb
involuntarily
retreated
*punct* .
*break*
stop
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ;
somehow
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
i
don't
well
know
whether
to
go
back
and
strike
him
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
what's
that?
*punct* ,
down
here
on
my
knees
and
pray
for
him
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
that
was
the
thought
coming
up
in
me
*punct* ;
but
it
would
be
the
first
time
i
ever
did
pray
*punct* .
*break*
it's
queer
*punct* ;
very
queer
*punct* ;
and
he's
queer
too
*punct* ;
aye
*punct* ,
take
him
fore
and
aft
*punct* ,
he's
about
the
queerest
old
man
stubb
ever
sailed
with
*punct* .
*break*
how
he
flashed
at
me!
*punct* ,
his
eyes
like
powder-pans
*punct* !
*break*
is
he
mad
*punct* ?
*break*
anyway
there's
something
on
his
mind
*punct* ,
as
sure
as
there
must
be
something
on
a
deck
when
it
cracks
*punct* .
*break*
he
aint
in
his
bed
now
*punct* ,
either
*punct* ,
more
than
three
hours
out
of
the
twenty-four
*punct* ;
and
he
don't
sleep
then
*punct* .
*break*
didn't
that
dough-boy
*punct* ,
the
steward
*punct* ,
tell
me
that
of
a
morning
he
always
finds
the
old
man's
hammock
clothes
all
rumpled
and
tumbled
*punct* ,
and
the
sheets
down
at
the
foot
*punct* ,
and
the
coverlid
almost
tied
into
knots
*punct* ,
and
the
pillow
a
sort
of
frightful
hot
*punct* ,
as
though
a
baked
brick
had
been
on
it
*punct* ?
*break*
a
hot
old
man
*punct* !
*break*
i
guess
he's
got
what
some
folks
ashore
call
a
conscience
*punct* ;
it's
a
kind
of
tic-dolly-row
they
say
*punct* ,
worse
nor
a
toothache
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ;
i
don't
know
what
it
is
*punct* ,
but
the
lord
keep
me
from
catching
it
*punct* .
*break*
he's
full
of
riddles
*punct* ;
i
wonder
what
he
goes
into
the
after
hold
for
*punct* ,
every
night
*punct* ,
as
dough-boy
tells
me
he
suspects
*punct* ;
what's
that
for
*punct* ,
i
should
like
to
know
*punct* ?
*break*
who's
made
appointments
with
him
in
the
hold
*punct* ?
*break*
ain't
that
queer
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ?
*break*
but
there's
no
telling
*punct* ,
it's
the
old
game
*punct* ,
here
goes
for
a
snooze
*punct* .
*break*
damn
me
*punct* ,
it's
worth
a
fellow's
while
to
be
born
into
the
world
*punct* ,
if
only
to
fall
right
asleep
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
that
i
think
of
it
*punct* ,
that's
about
the
first
thing
babies
do
*punct* ,
and
that's
a
sort
of
queer
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
damn
me
*punct* ,
but
all
things
are
queer
*punct* ,
come
to
think
of
em
*punct* .
*break*
but
that's
against
my
principles
*punct* .
*break*
think
not
*punct* ,
is
my
eleventh
commandment
*punct* ;
and
sleep
when
you
can
*punct* ,
is
my
twelfth
*punct* ,
so
here
goes
again
*punct* .
*break*
but
how's
that
*punct* ?
*break*
didn't
he
call
me
a
dog
*punct* ?
*break*
he
called
me
ten
times
a
donkey
*punct* ,
and
piled
a
lot
of
jackasses
on
top
of
that
*punct* !
*break*
he
might
as
well
have
kicked
me
*punct* ,
and
done
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
maybe
he
did
kick
me
*punct* ,
and
i
didn't
observe
it
*punct* ,
i
was
so
taken
all
aback
with
his
brow
*punct* ,
somehow
*punct* .
*break*
it
flashed
like
a
bleached
bone
*punct* .
*break*
what
the
devil's
the
matter
with
me
*punct* ?
*break*
i
don't
stand
right
on
my
legs
*punct* .
*break*
coming
afoul
of
that
old
man
has
a
sort
of
turned
me
wrong
side
out
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
lord
*punct* ,
i
must
have
been
dreaming
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
how
*punct* ?
*break*
lighting
the
pipe
at
the
binnacle
lamp
and
planting
the
stool
on
the
weather
side
of
the
deck
*punct* ,
he
sat
and
smoked
*punct* .
*break*
in
old
norse
times
*punct* ,
the
thrones
of
the
sea-loving
danish
kings
were
fabricated
*punct* ,
saith
tradition
*punct* ,
of
the
tusks
of
the
narwhale
*punct* .
*break*
how
could
one
look
at
ahab
then
*punct* ,
seated
on
that
tripod
of
bones
*punct* ,
without
bethinking
him
of
the
royalty
it
symbolized
*punct* ?
*break*
for
a
khan
of
the
plank
*punct* ,
and
a
king
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
and
a
great
lord
of
leviathans
was
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
some
moments
passed
*punct* ,
during
which
the
thick
vapor
came
from
his
mouth
in
quick
and
constant
puffs
*punct* ,
which
blew
back
again
into
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
how
now
*punct* ,
he
soliloquized
at
last
*punct* ,
withdrawing
the
tube
*punct* ,
this
smoking
no
longer
soothes
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
my
pipe
*punct* !
*break*
hard
must
it
go
with
me
if
thy
charm
be
gone
*punct* !
*break*
here
have
i
been
unconsciously
toiling
*punct* ,
not
pleasuring,
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
and
ignorantly
smoking
to
windward
all
the
while
*punct* ;
to
windward
*punct* ,
and
with
such
nervous
whiffs
*punct* ,
as
if
*punct* ,
like
the
dying
whale
*punct* ,
my
final
jets
were
the
strongest
and
fullest
of
trouble
*punct* .
*break*
what
business
have
i
with
this
pipe
*punct* ?
*break*
this
thing
that
is
meant
for
sereneness
*punct* ,
to
send
up
mild
white
vapors
among
mild
white
hairs
*punct* ,
not
among
torn
iron-grey
locks
like
mine
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
smoke
no
more
*punct* ,
he
tossed
the
still
lighted
pipe
into
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
the
fire
hissed
in
the
waves
*punct* ;
the
same
instant
the
ship
shot
by
the
bubble
the
sinking
pipe
made
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
queer
dream
*punct* ,
king-post
*punct* ,
i
never
had
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
the
old
man's
ivory
leg
*punct* ,
well
i
dreamed
he
kicked
me
with
it
*punct* ;
and
when
i
tried
to
kick
back
*punct* ,
upon
my
soul
*punct* ,
my
little
man
*punct* ,
i
kicked
my
leg
right
off
*punct* !
*break*
and
then
*punct* ,
presto
*punct* !
*break*
ahab
seemed
a
pyramid
*punct* ,
and
i
*punct* ,
like
a
blazing
fool
*punct* ,
kept
kicking
at
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
was
still
more
curious
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ,
you
know
how
curious
all
dreams
are
*punct* ,
through
all
this
rage
that
i
was
in
*punct* ,
i
somehow
seemed
to
be
thinking
to
myself
*punct* ,
that
after
all
*punct* ,
it
was
not
much
of
an
insult
*punct* ,
that
kick
from
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
thinks
i,what's
the
row
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
not
a
real
leg
*punct* ,
only
a
false
leg
*punct* .
*break*
and
there's
a
mighty
difference
between
a
living
thump
and
a
dead
thump
*punct* .
*break*
that's
what
makes
a
blow
from
the
hand
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ,
fifty
times
more
savage
to
bear
than
a
blow
from
a
cane
*punct* .
*break*
the
living
member
*punct* ,
that
makes
the
living
insult
*punct* ,
my
little
man
*punct* .
*break*
and
thinks
i
to
myself
all
the
while
*punct* ,
mind
*punct* ,
while
i
was
stubbing
my
silly
toes
against
that
cursed
pyramid
*punct* ,
so
confoundedly
contradictory
was
it
all
*punct* ,
all
the
while
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
i
was
thinking
to
myself
*punct* ,
what's
his
leg
now
*punct* ,
but
a
cane
*punct* ,
a
whalebone
cane
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
thinks
i,it
was
only
a
playful
cudgelling
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
only
a
whaleboning
that
he
gave
me
*punct* ,
not
a
base
kick
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
thinks
i,look
at
it
once
*punct* ;
why
*punct* ,
the
end
of
it
*punct* ,
the
foot
part
*punct* ,
what
a
small
sort
of
end
it
is
*punct* ;
whereas
*punct* ,
if
a
broad
footed
farmer
kicked
me
*punct* ,
there's
a
devilish
broad
insult
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
insult
is
whittled
down
to
a
point
only
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
comes
the
greatest
joke
of
the
dream
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* .
*break*
while
i
was
battering
away
at
the
pyramid
*punct* ,
a
sort
of
badger-haired
old
merman
*punct* ,
with
a
hump
on
his
back
*punct* ,
takes
me
by
the
shoulders
*punct* ,
and
slews
me
round
*punct* .
*break*
what
are
you
bout
*punct* ?
*break*
man
*punct* ,
but
i
was
frightened
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
phiz
*punct* !
*break*
but
*punct* ,
somehow
*punct* ,
next
moment
i
was
over
the
fright
*punct* .
*break*
what
am
i
about
*punct* ?
*break*
says
i
at
last
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
business
is
that
of
yours
*punct* ,
i
should
like
to
know
*punct* ,
mr.
humpback
*punct* ?
*break*
by
the
lord
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ,
i
had
no
sooner
said
that
*punct* ,
than
he
turned
round
his
stern
to
me
*punct* ,
bent
over
*punct* ,
and
dragging
up
a
lot
of
seaweed
he
had
for
a
clout
*punct* ,
what
do
you
think
*punct* ,
i
saw?
*punct* ,
why
thunder
alive
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
his
stern
was
stuck
full
of
marlinspikes
*punct* ,
with
the
points
out
*punct* .
*break*
says
i
*punct* ,
on
second
thoughts,i
guess
i
won't
kick
you
*punct* ,
old
fellow
*punct* .
*break*
wise
stubb
*punct* ,
said
he,wise
stubb
*punct* ;
and
kept
muttering
it
all
the
time
*punct* ,
a
sort
of
eating
of
his
own
gums
like
a
chimney
hag
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
he
wasn't
going
to
stop
saying
over
his
wise
stubb
*punct* ,
wise
stubb
*punct* ,
i
thought
i
might
as
well
fall
to
kicking
the
pyramid
again
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
had
only
just
lifted
my
foot
for
it
*punct* ,
when
he
roared
out
*punct* ,
stop
that
kicking
*punct* !
*break*
halloa
*punct* ,
says
i,what's
the
matter
now
*punct* ,
old
fellow
*punct* ?
*break*
look
ye
here
*punct* ,
says
he;let's
argue
the
insult
*punct* .
*break*
captain
ahab
kicked
ye
*punct* ,
didn't
he
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
he
did
*punct* ,
says
i
*punct* ,
right
here
it
was
*punct* .
*break*
very
good
*punct* ,
says
he
*punct* ,
he
used
his
ivory
leg
*punct* ,
didn't
he
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
he
did
*punct* ,
says
i
*punct* .
*break*
well
then
*punct* ,
says
he
*punct* ,
wise
stubb
*punct* ,
what
have
you
to
complain
of
*punct* ?
*break*
didn't
he
kick
with
right
good
will
*punct* ?
*break*
it
wasn't
a
common
pitch
pine
leg
he
kicked
with
*punct* ,
was
it
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
you
were
kicked
by
a
great
man
*punct* ,
and
with
a
beautiful
ivory
leg
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* .
*break*
it's
an
honor
*punct* ;
i
consider
it
an
honor
*punct* .
*break*
listen
*punct* ,
wise
stubb
*punct* .
*break*
in
old
england
the
greatest
lords
think
it
great
glory
to
be
slapped
by
a
queen
*punct* ,
and
made
garter-knights
of
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
be
your
boast
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ,
that
ye
were
kicked
by
old
ahab
*punct* ,
and
made
a
wise
man
of
*punct* .
*break*
remember
what
i
say
*punct* ;
be
kicked
by
him
*punct* ;
account
his
kicks
honors
*punct* ;
and
on
no
account
kick
back
*punct* ;
for
you
can't
help
yourself
*punct* ,
wise
stubb
*punct* .
*break*
don't
you
see
that
pyramid
*punct* ?
*break*
with
that
*punct* ,
he
all
of
a
sudden
seemed
somehow
*punct* ,
in
some
queer
fashion
*punct* ,
to
swim
off
into
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
i
snored
*punct* ;
rolled
over
*punct* ;
and
there
i
was
in
my
hammock
*punct* !
*break*
now
*punct* ,
what
do
you
think
of
that
dream
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ?
*break*
i
don't
know
*punct* ;
it
seems
a
sort
of
foolish
to
me
*punct* ,
tho'
*punct* .
*break*
may
be
*punct* ,
may
be
*punct* .
*break*
but
it's
made
a
wise
man
of
me
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* .
*break*
d'ye
see
ahab
standing
there
*punct* ,
sideways
looking
over
the
stern
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
the
best
thing
you
can
do
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ,
is
to
let
that
old
man
alone
*punct* ;
never
speak
to
him
*punct* ,
whatever
he
says
*punct* .
*break*
what's
that
he
shouts
*punct* ?
*break*
mast-head
*punct* ,
there
*punct* !
*break*
look
sharp
*punct* ,
all
of
ye
*punct* !
*break*
there
are
whales
hereabouts
*punct* !
*break*
if
ye
see
a
white
one
*punct* ,
split
your
lungs
for
him
*punct* !
*break*
what
d'ye
think
of
that
now
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ?
*break*
a
white
whale
*punct* ,
did
ye
mark
that
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ?
*break*
look
ye
*punct* ,
there's
something
special
in
the
wind
*punct* .
*break*
stand
by
for
it
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
has
that
that's
bloody
on
his
mind
*punct* .
*break*
ere
that
come
to
pass
*punct* ;
ere
the
pequod's
weedy
hull
rolls
side
by
side
with
the
barnacled
hulls
of
the
leviathan
*punct* ;
at
the
outset
it
is
but
well
to
attend
to
a
matter
almost
indispensable
to
a
thorough
appreciative
understanding
of
the
more
special
leviathanic
revelations
and
allusions
of
all
sorts
which
are
to
follow
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
some
systematized
exhibition
of
the
whale
in
his
broad
genera
*punct* ,
that
i
would
now
fain
put
before
you
*punct* .
*break*
yet
is
it
no
easy
task
*punct* .
*break*
the
classification
of
the
constituents
of
a
chaos
*punct* ,
nothing
less
is
here
essayed
*punct* .
*break*
listen
to
what
the
best
and
latest
authorities
have
laid
down
*punct* .
*break*
no
branch
of
zoology
is
so
much
involved
as
that
which
is
entitled
cetology
*punct* ,
says
captain
scoresby
*punct* ,
a

*break*
it
is
not
my
intention
*punct* ,
were
it
in
my
power
*punct* ,
to
enter
into
the
inquiry
as
to
the
true
method
of
dividing
the
cetacea
into
groups
and
families
*punct* ...
utter
confusion
exists
among
the
historians
of
this
animal
*punct* ,
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
says
surgeon
beale
*punct* ,
a

*break*
unfitness

pursue
our
research
in
the
unfathomable
waters
*punct* .
*break*
impenetrable
veil
covering
our
knowledge
of
the
cetacea
*punct* .
*break*
a
field
strewn
with
thorns
*punct* .
*break*
all
these
incomplete
indications
but
serve
to
torture
us
naturalists
*punct* .
*break*
thus
speak
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
the
great
cuvier
*punct* ,
and
john
hunter
*punct* ,
and
lesson
*punct* ,
those
lights
of

*punct* .
*break*
many
are
the
men
*punct* ,
small

great
*punct* ,
old

new
*punct* ,
landsmen
and
seamen
*punct* ,
who

to
what
ultimate
generalizing

all

*break*
and
here
be
it
said
*punct* ,
that
the
greenland
whale
is
an
usurper
upon
the
throne
of
the
seas
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
not
even
by
any
means
the
largest
of
the
whales
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
long
priority
of
his
claims
*punct* ,
and
the
profound
ignorance
which
*punct* ,
till
some
seventy
years
back
*punct* ,
invested
the
then
fabulous
and
utterly
unknown
sperm-whale
*punct* ,
and
which
ignorance
to
this
present
day
still
reigns
in
all
but
some
few
scientific
retreats
and
whale-ports
*punct* ;
this
usurpation
has
been
every
way
complete
*punct* .
*break*
reference
to
nearly
all
the
leviathanic
allusions
in
the
great
poets
of
past
days
*punct* ,
will
satisfy
you
that
the
greenland
whale
*punct* ,
without
one
rival
*punct* ,
was
to
them
the
monarch
of
the
seas
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
time
has
at
last
come
for
a
new
proclamation
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
charing
cross
*punct* ;
hear
ye
*punct* !
*break*
good
people
all,
*punct* ,
the
greenland
whale
is
deposed,
*punct* ,
the
great
sperm
whale
now
reigneth
*punct* !
*break*
there
are
only
two
books
in
being
which
at
all
pretend
to
put
the
living
sperm
whale
before
you
*punct* ,
and
at
the
same
time
*punct* ,
in
the
remotest
degree
succeed
in
the
attempt
*punct* .
*break*
those
books
are
beale's
and
bennett's
*punct* ;
both
in
their
time
surgeons
to
english
south-sea
whale-ships
*punct* ,
and
both
exact
and
reliable
men
*punct* .
*break*
as
yet
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
scientific
or
poetic
*punct* ,
lives
not
complete
in
any
literature
*punct* .
*break*
far
above
all
other
hunted
whales
*punct* ,
his
is
an
unwritten
life
*punct* .
*break*
now
the
various
species
of
whales
need
some
sort
of
popular
comprehensive
classification
*punct* ,
if
only
an
easy
outline
one
for
the
present
*punct* ,
hereafter
to
be
filled
in
all
its
departments
by
subsequent
laborers
*punct* .
*break*
as
no
better
man
advances
to
take
this
matter
in
hand
*punct* ,
i
hereupon
offer
my
own
poor
endeavors
*punct* .
*break*
i
promise
nothing
complete
*punct* ;
because
any
human
thing
supposed
to
be
complete
*punct* ,
must
for
that
very
reason
infallibly
be
faulty
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
not
pretend
to
a
minute
anatomical
description
of
the
various
species
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
in
this
place
at
least
*punct* ,
to
much
of
any
description
*punct* .
*break*
my
object
here
is
simply
to
project
the
draught
of
a
systematization
of
cetology
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
the
architect
*punct* ,
not
the
builder
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
a
ponderous
task
*punct* ;
no
ordinary
letter-sorter
in
the
post-office
is
equal
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
to
grope
down
into
the
bottom
of
the
sea
after
them
*punct* ;
to
have
one's
hands
among
the
unspeakable
foundations
*punct* ,
ribs
*punct* ,
and
very
pelvis
of
the
world
*punct* ;
this
is
a
fearful
thing
*punct* .
*break*
what
am
i
that
i
should
essay
to
hook
the
nose
of
this
leviathan
*punct* !
*break*
the
awful
tauntings
in
job
might
well
appal
me
*punct* .
*break*
will
he
*punct* ,
the
leviathan
*punct* ,
make
a
covenant
with
thee
*punct* ?
*break*
behold
the
hope
of
him
is
vain
*punct* !
*break*
but
i
have
swam
through
libraries
and
sailed
through
oceans
*punct* ;
i
have
had
to
do
with
whales
with
these
visible
hands
*punct* ;
i
am
in
earnest
*punct* ;
and
i
will
try
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
some
preliminaries
to
settle
*punct* .
*break*
first
*punct* :
the
uncertain
*punct* ,
unsettled
condition
of
this
science
of
cetology
is
in
the
very
vestibule
attested
by
the
fact
*punct* ,
that
in
some
quarters
it
still
remains
a
moot
point
whether
a
whale
be
a
fish
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
system
of
nature
*punct* ,
a
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
linnaeus
declares
*punct* ,
i
hereby
separate
the
whales
from
the
fish
*punct* .
*break*
but
of
my
own
knowledge
*punct* ,
i
know
that
down
to
the
year
*punct* ,
sharks
and
shad
*punct* ,
alewives
and
herring
*punct* ,
against
linnaeus's
express
edict
*punct* ,
were
still
found
dividing
the
possession
of
the
same
seas
with
the
leviathan
*punct* .
*break*
i
submitted
all
this
to
my
friends
simeon
macey
and
charley
coffin
*punct* ,
of
nantucket
*punct* ,
both
messmates
of
mine
in
a
certain
voyage
*punct* ,
and
they
united
in
the
opinion
that
the
reasons
set
forth
were
altogether
insufficient
*punct* .
*break*
charley
profanely
hinted
they
were
humbug
*punct* .
*break*
be
it
known
that
*punct* ,
waiving
all
argument
*punct* ,
i
take
the
good
old
fashioned
ground
that
the
whale
is
a
fish
*punct* ,
and
call
upon
holy
jonah
to
back
me
*punct* .
*break*
this
fundamental
thing
settled
*punct* ,
the
next
point
is
*punct* ,
in
what
internal
respect
does
the
whale
differ
from
other
fish
*punct* .
*break*
above
*punct* ,
linnaeus
has
given
you
those
items
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
brief
*punct* ,
they
are
these
*punct* :
lungs
and
warm
blood
*punct* ;
whereas
*punct* ,
all
other
fish
are
lungless
and
cold
blooded
*punct* .
*break*
next
*punct* :
how
shall
we
define
the
whale
*punct* ,
by
his
obvious
externals
*punct* ,
so
as
conspicuously
to
label
him
for
all
time
to
come
*punct* ?
*break*
to
be
short
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
a
whale
is
a
spouting
fish
with
a
horizontal
tail
*punct* .
*break*
there
you
have
him
*punct* .
*break*
however
contracted
*punct* ,
that
definition
is
the
result
of
expanded
meditation
*punct* .
*break*
a
walrus
spouts
much
like
a
whale
*punct* ,
but
the
walrus
is
not
a
fish
*punct* ,
because
he
is
amphibious
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
last
term
of
the
definition
is
still
more
cogent
*punct* ,
as
coupled
with
the
first
*punct* .
*break*
almost
any
one
must
have
noticed
that
all
the
fish
familiar
to
landsmen
have
not
a
flat
*punct* ,
but
a
vertical
*punct* ,
or
up-and-down
tail
*punct* .
*break*
whereas
*punct* ,
among
spouting
fish
the
tail
*punct* ,
though
it
may
be
similarly
shaped
*punct* ,
invariably
assumes
a
horizontal
position
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
above
definition
of
what
a
whale
is
*punct* ,
i
do
by
no
means
exclude
from
the
leviathanic
brotherhood
any
sea
creature
hitherto
identified
with
the
whale
by
the
best
informed
nantucketers
*punct* ;
nor
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
link
with
it
any
fish
hitherto
authoritatively
regarded
as
alien
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
come
the
grand
divisions
of
the
entire
whale
host
*punct* .
*break*
first
*punct* :
according
to
magnitude
i
divide
the
whales
into
three
primary
books
*punct* ,
subdivisible
into
chapters
*punct* ,
and
these
shall
comprehend
them
all
*punct* ,
both
small
and
large
*punct* .
*break*
the
folio
whale
*punct* ;
ii
*punct* .
*break*
the
octavo
whale
*punct* ;
iii
*punct* .
*break*
the
duodecimo
whale
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
type
of
the
folio
i
present
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ;
of
the
octavo
*punct* ,
the
grampus
*punct* ;
of
the
duodecimo
*punct* ,
the
porpoise
*punct* .
*break*
among
these
i
here
include
the
following
chapters:
*punct* ,
i
*punct* .
*break*
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ;
ii
*punct* .
*break*
the
right
whale
*punct* ;
iii
*punct* .
*break*
the
fin
back
whale
*punct* ;
iv
*punct* .
*break*
the
razor
back
whale
*punct* ;
vi
*punct* .
*break*
the
sulphur
bottom
whale
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
folio
*punct* ,
chapter
i
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
*punct* ,
without
doubt
*punct* ,
the
largest
inhabitant
of
the
globe
*punct* ;
the
most
formidable
of
all
whales
to
encounter
*punct* ;
the
most
majestic
in
aspect
*punct* ;
and
lastly
*punct* ,
by
far
the
most
valuable
in
commerce
*punct* ;
he
being
the
only
creature
from
which
that
valuable
substance
*punct* ,
spermaceti
*punct* ,
is
obtained
*punct* .
*break*
all
his
peculiarities
will
*punct* ,
in
many
other
places
*punct* ,
be
enlarged
upon
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
chiefly
with
his
name
that
i
now
have
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
philologically
considered
*punct* ,
it
is
absurd
*punct* .
*break*
some
centuries
ago
*punct* ,
when
the
sperm
whale
was
almost
wholly
unknown
in
his
own
proper
individuality
*punct* ,
and
when
his
oil
was
only
accidentally
obtained
from
the
stranded
fish
*punct* ;
in
those
days
spermaceti
*punct* ,
it
would
seem
*punct* ,
was
popularly
supposed
to
be
derived
from
a
creature
identical
with
the
one
then
known
in
england
as
the
greenland
or
right
whale
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
idea
also
*punct* ,
that
this
same
spermaceti
was
that
quickening
humor
of
the
greenland
whale
which
the
first
syllable
of
the
word
literally
expresses
*punct* .
*break*
in
those
times
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
spermaceti
was
exceedingly
scarce
*punct* ,
not
being
used
for
light
*punct* ,
but
only
as
an
ointment
and
medicament
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
only
to
be
had
from
the
druggists
as
you
nowadays
buy
an
ounce
of
rhubarb
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
the
appellation
must
at
last
have
come
to
be
bestowed
upon
the
whale
from
which
this
spermaceti
was
really
derived
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
folio
*punct* ,
chapter
ii
*punct* .
*break*
it
yields
the
article
commonly
known
as
whalebone
or
baleen
*punct* ;
and
the
oil
specially
known
as
whale
oil
*punct* ,
an
inferior
article
in
commerce
*punct* .
*break*
among
the
fishermen
*punct* ,
he
is
indiscriminately
designated
by
all
the
following
titles
*punct* :
the
whale
*punct* ;
the
greenland
whale
*punct* ;
the
black
whale
*punct* ;
the
great
whale
*punct* ;
the
true
whale
*punct* ;
the
right
whale
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
a
deal
of
obscurity
concerning
the
identity
of
the
species
thus
multitudinously
baptized
*punct* .
*break*
what
then
is
the
whale
*punct* ,
which
i
include
in
the
second
species
of
my
folios
*punct* ?
*break*
it
is
the
great
mysticetus
of
the
english
naturalists
*punct* ;
the
greenland
whale
of
the
english
whalemen
*punct* ;
the
baliene
ordinaire
of
the
french
whalemen
*punct* ;
the
growlands
walfish
of
the
swedes
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
the
whale
which
for
more
than
two
centuries
past
has
been
hunted
by
the
dutch
and
english
in
the
arctic
seas
*punct* ;
it
is
the
whale
which
the
american
fishermen
have
long
pursued
in
the
indian
ocean
*punct* ,
on
the
brazil
banks
*punct* ,
on
the
nor
west
coast
*punct* ,
and
various
other
parts
of
the
world
*punct* ,
designated
by
them
right
whale
cruising
grounds
*punct* .
*break*
some
pretend
to
see
a
difference
between
the
greenland
whale
of
the
english
and
the
right
whale
of
the
americans
*punct* .
*break*
but
they
precisely
agree
in
all
their
grand
features
*punct* ;
nor
has
there
yet
been
presented
a
single
determinate
fact
upon
which
to
ground
a
radical
distinction
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
by
endless
subdivisions
based
upon
the
most
inconclusive
differences
*punct* ,
that
some
departments
of
natural
history
become
so
repellingly
intricate
*punct* .
*break*
the
right
whale
will
be
elsewhere
treated
of
at
some
length
*punct* ,
with
reference
to
elucidating
the
sperm
whale
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
folio
*punct* ,
chapter
iii
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
length
he
attains
*punct* ,
and
in
his
baleen
*punct* ,
the
fin-back
resembles
the
right
whale
*punct* ,
but
is
of
a
less
portly
girth
*punct* ,
and
a
lighter
color
*punct* ,
approaching
to
olive
*punct* .
*break*
his
great
lips
present
a
cable-like
aspect
*punct* ,
formed
by
the
intertwisting
*punct* ,
slanting
folds
of
large
wrinkles
*punct* .
*break*
his
grand
distinguishing
feature
*punct* ,
the
fin
*punct* ,
from
which
he
derives
his
name
*punct* ,
is
often
a
conspicuous
object
*punct* .
*break*
this
fin
is
some
three
or
four
feet
long
*punct* ,
growing
vertically
from
the
hinder
part
of
the
back
*punct* ,
of
an
angular
shape
*punct* ,
and
with
a
very
sharp
pointed
end
*punct* .
*break*
even
if
not
the
slightest
other
part
of
the
creature
be
visible
*punct* ,
this
isolated
fin
will
*punct* ,
at
times
*punct* ,
be
seen
plainly
projecting
from
the
surface
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
sea
is
moderately
calm
*punct* ,
and
slightly
marked
with
spherical
ripples
*punct* ,
and
this
gnomon-like
fin
stands
up
and
casts
shadows
upon
the
wrinkled
surface
*punct* ,
it
may
well
be
supposed
that
the
watery
circle
surrounding
it
somewhat
resembles
a
dial
*punct* ,
with
its
style
and
wavy
hour-lines
graved
on
it
*punct* .
*break*
on
that
ahaz-dial
the
shadow
often
goes
back
*punct* .
*break*
the
fin-back
is
not
gregarious
*punct* .
*break*
he
seems
a
whale-hater
*punct* ,
as
some
men
are
man-haters
*punct* .
*break*
very
shy
*punct* ;
always
going
solitary
*punct* ;
unexpectedly
rising
to
the
surface
in
the
remotest
and
most
sullen
waters
*punct* ;
his
straight
and
single
lofty
jet
rising
like
a
tall
misanthropic
spear
upon
a
barren
plain
*punct* ;
gifted
with
such
wondrous
power
and
velocity
in
swimming
*punct* ,
as
to
defy
all
present
pursuit
from
man
*punct* ;
this
leviathan
seems
the
banished
and
unconquerable
cain
of
his
race
*punct* ,
bearing
for
his
mark
that
style
upon
his
back
*punct* .
*break*
from
having
the
baleen
in
his
mouth
*punct* ,
the
fin-back
is
sometimes
included
with
the
right
whale
*punct* ,
among
a
theoretic
species
denominated
whalebone
whales
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
whales
with
baleen
*punct* .
*break*
of
these
so
called
whalebone
whales
*punct* ,
there
would
seem
to
be
several
varieties
*punct* ,
most
of
which
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
are
little
known
*punct* .
*break*
broad-nosed
whales
and
beaked
whales
*punct* ;
pike-headed
whales
*punct* ;
bunched
whales
*punct* ;
under-jawed
whales
and
rostrated
whales
*punct* ,
are
the
fishermen's
names
for
a
few
sorts
*punct* .
*break*
the
baleen
*punct* ,
hump
*punct* ,
back-fin
*punct* ,
and
teeth
*punct* ;
these
are
things
whose
peculiarities
are
indiscriminately
dispersed
among
all
sorts
of
whales
*punct* ,
without
any
regard
to
what
may
be
the
nature
of
their
structure
in
other
and
more
essential
particulars
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
the
sperm
whale
and
the
humpbacked
whale
*punct* ,
each
has
a
hump
*punct* ;
but
there
the
similitude
ceases
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
this
same
humpbacked
whale
and
the
greenland
whale
*punct* ,
each
of
these
has
baleen
*punct* ;
but
there
again
the
similitude
ceases
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
is
just
the
same
with
the
other
parts
above
mentioned
*punct* .
*break*
in
various
sorts
of
whales
*punct* ,
they
form
such
irregular
combinations
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
in
the
case
of
any
one
of
them
detached
*punct* ,
such
an
irregular
isolation
*punct* ;
as
utterly
to
defy
all
general
methodization
formed
upon
such
a
basis
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
rock
every
one
of
the
whale-naturalists
has
split
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
may
possibly
be
conceived
that
*punct* ,
in
the
internal
parts
of
the

is
there
in

more

his
baleen
*punct* ?
*break*
yet
we
have
seen
that
by
his
baleen
it
is
impossible
correctly
to
classify
the

*break*
and

you

there
you
will
not
find

what

*break*
nothing

to

at

the

but
possessing
all
the
grand
distinctive
features
of
the
leviathan

most
naturalists
have
recognised
him
for
one

*break*
he
is
of
moderate
octavo
size
*punct* ,
varying
from
fifteen
to
twenty-five
feet
in
length
*punct* ,
and
of
corresponding
dimensions
round
the
waist
*punct* .
*break*
by
some

is

advance

*break*
where
any
name
happens
to
be

inexpressive
*punct* ,
i
shall
say
so
*punct* ,
and
suggest
another
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
so
now
*punct* ,
touching
the
black
fish
*punct* ,
so
called
*punct* ,
because
blackness
is
the
rule
among
almost
all
whales
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
call
him
the
hyena
whale
*punct* ,
if
you
please
*punct* .
*break*
his
voracity
is
well
known
*punct* ,
and
from
the
circumstance
that
the
inner
angles
of
his
lips
are
curved
upwards
*punct* ,
he
carries
an
everlasting
mephistophelean
grin
on
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
this
whale
averages
some
sixteen
or
eighteen
feet
in
length
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
found
in
almost
all
latitudes
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
a
peculiar
way
of
showing
his
dorsal
hooked
fin
in
swimming
*punct* ,
which
looks
something
like
a
roman
nose
*punct* .
*break*
when
not
more
profitably
employed
*punct* ,
the
sperm
whale
hunters
sometimes
capture
the
hyena
whale
*punct* ,
to
keep
up
the
supply
of
cheap
oil
for
domestic
employment
*punct* ,
as
some
frugal
housekeepers
*punct* ,
in
the
absence
of
company
*punct* ,
and
quite
alone
by
themselves
*punct* ,
burn
unsavory
tallow
instead
of
odorous
wax

*break*
though
their
blubber
is
very

nostril

*punct* ,
another
instance
of
a
curiously
named
whale
*punct* ,
so
named
i
suppose
from
his
peculiar
horn
being
originally
mistaken
for
a
peaked
nose
*punct* .
*break*
the
creature
is
some
sixteen
feet
in
length
*punct* ,
while
its
horn
averages
five
feet
*punct* ,
though
some
exceed
ten
*punct* ,
and
even
attain
to
fifteen
feet
*punct* .
*break*
strictly
speaking
*punct* ,
this
horn
is
but
a
lengthened
tusk
*punct* ,
growing
out
from
the
jaw
in
a
line
a
little
depressed
from
the
horizontal
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
only
found
on
the
sinister
side
*punct* ,
which
has
an
ill
effect
*punct* ,
giving
its
owner
something
analogous
to
the
aspect
of
a
clumsy
left-handed
man
*punct* .
*break*
what
precise
purpose
this
ivory
horn
or
lance
answers
*punct* ,
it
would
be
hard
to
say
*punct* .
*break*
it
does
not
seemed
to
be
used
like
the
blade
of
the
sword-fish
and
bill-fish
*punct* ;
though
some
sailors
tell
me
that
the
narwhale
employs
it
for
a
rake
in
turning
over
the
bottom
of
the
sea
for
food
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
cannot
prove
either
of
these
surmises
to
be
correct
*punct* .
*break*
my
own
opinion
is
*punct* ,
that
however
this
one-sided
horn
may
really
be
used
by
the
narwhale
*punct* ,
however
that
may
be
*punct* ,
it
would
certainly
be
very
convenient
to
him
for
a
folder
in
reading
pamphlets
*punct* .
*break*
the
narwhale
i
have
heard
called
the
tusked
whale
*punct* ,
the
horned
whale
*punct* ,
and
the
unicorn
whale
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
certainly
a
curious
example
of
the
unicornism
to
be
found
in
almost
every
kingdom
of
animated
nature
*punct* .
*break*
from
certain
cloistered
old
authors
i
have
gathered
that
this
same
sea-unicorn's
horn
was
in
ancient
days
regarded
as
the
great
antidote
against
poison
*punct* ,
and
as
such
*punct* ,
preparations
of
it
brought
immense
prices
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
also
distilled
to
a
volatile
salts
for
fainting
ladies
*punct* ,
the
same
way
that
the
horns
of
the
male
deer
are
manufactured
into
hartshorn
*punct* .
*break*
originally
it
was
in
itself
accounted
an
object
of
great
curiosity
*punct* .

black

tells
me
that
sir
martin
frobisher
on
his
return
from
that
voyage
*punct* ,
when
queen
bess
did
gallantly
wave
her
jewelled
hand
to
him
from
a
window
of
greenwich
palace
*punct* ,
as
his
bold
ship
sailed
down
the
thames
*punct* ;
when
sir
martin
returned
from
that
voyage
*punct* ,
saith
black
letter
*punct* ,
on
bended
knees
he
presented
to
her
highness
a
prodigious
long
horn
of
the
narwhale
*punct* ,
which
for
a
long
period
after
hung
in
the
castle
at
windsor
*punct* .
*break*
an
irish
author
avers

the
earl

*punct* ,
did
likewise
present
to
her
highness
another
horn
*punct* ,
pertaining
to
a
land
beast
of
the
unicorn
nature
*punct* .
*break*
the
narwhale
has
a
very
picturesque
*punct* ,
leopard-like
look
*punct* ,
being
of
a
milk-white
ground
color
*punct* ,
dotted
with
round
and
oblong
spots
of
black
*punct* .
*break*
his
oil
is
very
superior

clear
and
fine

there
is

*break*
from
what
i
have
seen
of
him
at

distance

i
should
say
that
he
was
about
the
bigness
of
a
grampus
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
very
savage
*punct* ,
a
sort
of
feegee
fish
*punct* .
*break*
he
sometimes
takes
the
great
folio
whales
by
the
lip
*punct* ,
and
hangs
there
like
a
leech
*punct* ,
till
the
mighty
brute
is
worried
to
death
*punct* .
*break*
the
killer
is
never
hunted
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
heard
what
sort
of

he
has

*break*
for
we
are
all
killers
*punct* ,
on
land
and
on
sea
*punct* ;
bonapartes
and
sharks
included
*punct* .
*break*
he
mounts
the
folio
whale's
back
*punct* ,
and
as
he
swims
*punct* ,
he
works
his
passage
by
flogging
him
*punct* ;
as
some
schoolmasters
get
along
in
the
world
by
a
similar
process
*punct* .
*break*
still
less
is
known
of
the
thrasher
than
of
the

*punct* .
*break*
both
are

*break*
to
those
who
have
not
chanced
specially
to
study
the
subject
*punct* ,
it
may
possibly
seem
strange
*punct* ,
that
fishes
not
commonly
exceeding
four
or
five
feet
should
be
marshalled
among
whales
*punct* ,
a
word
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
in
the
popular
sense
*punct* ,
always
conveys
an
idea
of
hugeness
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
creatures
set
down
above
as
duodecimoes
are
infallibly
whales
*punct* ,
by
the
terms
of
my
definition
of
what
a
whale
is
*punct* ,
i
*punct* .
*break*
a
spouting
fish
*punct* ,
with
a
horizontal
tail
*punct* .
*break*
the
name
is
of
my
own
bestowal
*punct* ;
for
there
are
more
than
one
sort
of
porpoises
*punct* ,
and
something
must
be
done
to
distinguish
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
call
them
thus
*punct* ,
because
he
always
swims
in
hilarious
shoals
*punct* ,
which
upon
the
broad
sea
keep
tossing
themselves
to
heaven
like
caps
in
a
fourth-of-july
crowd
*punct* .
*break*
their
appearance
is
generally
hailed
with
delight
by
the
mariner
*punct* .
*break*
full
of
fine
spirits
*punct* ,
they
invariably
come
from
the
breezy
billows
to
windward
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
the
lads
that
always
live
before
the
wind
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
accounted
a
lucky
omen
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
yourself
can
withstand
three
cheers
at
beholding
these
vivacious
fish
*punct* ,
then
heaven
help
ye
*punct* ;
the
spirit
of
godly
gamesomeness
is
not
in
ye
*punct* .
*break*
a
well-fed
*punct* ,
plump
huzza
porpoise
will
yield
you
one
good
gallon
of
good
oil
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
fine
and
delicate
fluid
extracted
from
his
jaws
is
exceedingly
valuable
*punct* .
*break*
porpoise
meat
is
good
eating
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
never
have
occurred
to
you
that
a
porpoise
spouts
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
his
spout
is
so
small
that
it
is
not
very
readily
discernible
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
next
time
you
have
a
chance

watch
him

he
is

the

porpoise

but
much

general
make
*punct* .
*break*
provoke
him

and
he
will
buckle
to
a

*break*
i
have
lowered

him
many

*punct* ,
but
never

saw
him

kind
of

pacific
*punct* ,
so
far
as
it
is
known
*punct* .
*break*
the
only
english
name
*punct* ,
by
which
he
has
hitherto
been
designated
*punct* ,
is
that
of
the
fishers
*punct* ,
right-whale
porpoise
*punct* ,
from
the
circumstance
that
he
is
chiefly
found
in
the
vicinity
of
that
folio
*punct* .
*break*
in
shape
*punct* ,
he
differs
in
some
degree
from
the
huzza
porpoise
*punct* ,
being
of
a
less
rotund
and
jolly
girth
*punct* ;
indeed
*punct* ,
he
is
of
quite
a
neat
and
gentleman-like
figure
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
no
fins
on
his
back
*punct* ,
most
other
porpoises
have
*punct* ,
he
has
a
lovely
tail
*punct* ,
and
sentimental
indian
eyes
of
a
hazel
hue
*punct* .
*break*
but
his
mealy-mouth
spoils
all
*punct* .
*break*
though
his
entire
back
down
to
his
side
fins
is
of
a
deep
sable
*punct* ,
yet
a
boundary
line
*punct* ,
distinct
as
the
mark
in
a
ship's
hull
*punct* ,
called
the
bright
waist
*punct* ,
that
line
streaks
him
from
stem
to
stern
*punct* ,
with
two
separate
colors
*punct* ,
black
above
and
white
below
*punct* .
*break*
the
white
comprises
part
of
his
head
*punct* ,
and
the
whole
of
his
mouth
*punct* ,
which
makes
him
look
as
if
he
had
just
escaped
from
a
felonious
visit
to
a
meal-bag
*punct* .
*break*
a
most
mean
and
mealy
aspect
*punct* !
*break*
his
oil
is
much
like
that
of
the
common
porpoise
*punct* .
*break*
beyond
the
duodecimo
*punct* ,
this
system
does
not
proceed
*punct* ,
inasmuch
as
the
porpoise
is
the
smallest
of
the
whales
*punct* .
*break*
above
*punct* ,
you
have
all
the
leviathans
of
note
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
are
a
rabble
of
uncertain
*punct* ,
fugitive
*punct* ,
half-fabulous
whales
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
as
an
american
whaleman
*punct* ,
i
know
by
reputation
*punct* ,
but
not
personally
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
enumerate
them
by
their
forecastle
appellations
*punct* ;
for
possibly
such
a
list
may
be
valuable
to
future
investigators
*punct* ,
who
may
complete
what
i
have
here

begun

*break*
from
icelandic
*punct* ,
dutch

other
lists
of
uncertain

blessed
with
all
manner
of
uncouth

*break*
but
i
omit
them
as
altogether
obsolete

and
can
hardly
help
suspecting
them
for
mere
sounds

full

leviathanism

signifying
nothing

finally
*punct* :
it
was

that
this

you

plainly
see

i
have
kept
my
word

*break*
but
i
now
leave
my
cetological
system
standing
thus
unfinished
*punct* ,
even
as
the
great
cathedral
of
cologne
was
left

with
the

still
standing
upon
the
top
of
the
uncompleted

architects

grand

*break*
this
whole
book
is
but
a
draught
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
but
the
draught
of
a
draught
*punct* .
*break*
oh
time
*punct* ,
strength
*punct* ,
cash
*punct* ,
and
patience
*punct* !
*break*
literally
this
word
means
fat-cutter
*punct* ;
usage
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
in
time
made
it
equivalent
to
chief
harpooneer
*punct* .
*break*
in
those
days
*punct* ,
the
captain's
authority
was
restricted
to
the
navigation
and
general
management
of
the
vessel
*punct* :
while
over
the
whale-hunting
department
and
all
its
concerns
*punct* ,
the
specksynder
or
chief
harpooneer
reigned
supreme
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
british
greenland
fishery
*punct* ,
under
the
corrupted
title
of
specksioneer
*punct* ,
this
old
dutch
official
is
still
retained
*punct* ,
but
his
former
dignity
is
sadly
abridged
*punct* .
*break*
at
present
he
ranks
simply
as
senior
harpooneer
*punct* ;
and
as
such
*punct* ,
is
but
one
of
the
captain's
more
inferior
subalterns
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
as
upon
the
good
conduct
of
the
harpooneers
the
success
of
a
whaling
voyage
largely
depends
*punct* ,
and
since
in
the
american
fishery
he
is
not
only
an
important
officer
in
the
boat
*punct* ,
but
under
certain
circumstances
*punct* ,
night
watches
on
a
whaling
ground
*punct* ,
the
command
of
the
ship's
deck
is
also
his
*punct* ;
therefore
the
grand
political
maxim
of
the
sea
demands
*punct* ,
that
he
should
nominally
live
apart
from
the
men
before
the
mast
*punct* ,
and
be
in
some
way
distinguished
as
their
professional
superior
*punct* ;
though
always
*punct* ,
by
them
*punct* ,
familiarly
regarded
as
their
social
equal
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
the
grand
distinction
drawn
between
officer
and
man
at
sea
*punct* ,
is
this
*punct* ,
the
first
lives
aft
*punct* ,
the
last
forward
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
in
whale-ships
and
merchantmen
alike
*punct* ,
the
mates
have
their
quarters
with
the
captain
*punct* ;
and
so
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
in
most
of
the
american
whalers
the
harpooneers
are
lodged
in
the
after
part
of
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
to
say
*punct* ,
they
take
their
meals
in
the
captain's
cabin
*punct* ,
and
sleep
in
a
place
indirectly
communicating
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
many
are
the
nantucket
ships
in
which
you
will
see
the
skipper
parading
his
quarter-deck
with
an
elated
grandeur
not
surpassed
in
any
military
navy
*punct* ;
nay
*punct* ,
extorting
almost
as
much
outward
homage
as
if
he
wore
the
imperial
purple
*punct* ,
and
not
the
shabbiest
of
pilot-cloth
*punct* .
*break*
and
though
of
all
men
the
moody
captain
of
the
pequod
was
the
least
given
to
that
sort
of
shallowest
assumption
*punct* ;
and
though
the
only
homage
he
ever
exacted
*punct* ,
was
implicit
*punct* ,
instantaneous
obedience
*punct* ;
though
he
required
no
man
to
remove
the
shoes
from
his
feet
ere
stepping
upon
the
quarter-deck
*punct* ;
and
though
there
were
times
when
*punct* ,
owing
to
peculiar
circumstances
connected
with
events
hereafter
to
be
detailed
*punct* ,
he
addressed
them
in
unusual
terms
*punct* ,
whether
of
condescension
or
in
terrorem
*punct* ,
or
otherwise
*punct* ;
yet
even
captain
ahab
was
by
no
means
unobservant
of
the
paramount
forms
and
usages
of
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
nor
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
will
it
fail
to
be
eventually
perceived
*punct* ,
that
behind
those
forms
and
usages
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ,
he
sometimes
masked
himself
*punct* ;
incidentally
making
use
of
them
for
other
and
more
private
ends
than
they
were
legitimately
intended
to
subserve
*punct* .
*break*
that
certain
sultanism
of
his
brain
*punct* ,
which
had
otherwise
in
a
good
degree
remained
unmanifested
*punct* ;
through
those
forms
that
same
sultanism
became
incarnate
in
an
irresistible
dictatorship
*punct* .
*break*
for
be
a
man's
intellectual
superiority
what
it
will
*punct* ,
it
can
never
assume
the
practical
*punct* ,
available
supremacy
over
other
men
*punct* ,
without
the
aid
of
some
sort
of
external
arts
and
entrenchments
*punct* ,
always
*punct* ,
in
themselves
*punct* ,
more
or
less
paltry
and
base
*punct* .
*break*
this
it
is
*punct* ,
that
for
ever
keeps
god's
true
princes
of
the
empire
from
the
world's
hustings
*punct* ;
and
leaves
the
highest
honors
that
this
air
can
give
*punct* ,
to
those
men
who
become
famous
more
through
their
infinite
inferiority
to
the
choice
hidden
handful
of
the
divine
inert
*punct* ,
than
through
their
undoubted
superiority
over
the
dead
level
of
the
mass
*punct* .
*break*
such
large
virtue
lurks
in
these
small
things
when
extreme
political
superstitions
invest
them
*punct* ,
that
in
some
royal
instances
even
to
idiot
imbecility
they
have
imparted
potency
*punct* .
*break*
nor
*punct* ,
will
the
tragic
dramatist
who
would
depict
mortal
indomitableness
in
its
fullest
sweep
and
direct
swing
*punct* ,
ever
forget
a
hint
*punct* ,
incidentally
so
important
in
his
art
*punct* ,
as
the
one
now
alluded
to
*punct* .
*break*
but
ahab
*punct* ,
my
captain
*punct* ,
still
moves
before
me
in
all
his
nantucket
grimness
and
shagginess
*punct* ;
and
in
this
episode
touching
emperors
and
kings
*punct* ,
i
must
not
conceal
that
i
have
only
to
do
with
a
poor
old
whale-hunter
like
him
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
all
outward
majestical
trappings
and
housings
are
denied
me
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* !
*break*
what
shall
be
grand
in
thee
*punct* ,
it
must
needs
be
plucked
at
from
the
skies
*punct* ,
and
dived
for
in
the
deep
*punct* ,
and
featured
in
the
unbodied
air
*punct* !
*break*
from
his
complete
inattention
to
the
tidings
*punct* ,
you
would
think
that
moody
ahab
had
not
heard
his
menial
*punct* .
*break*
but
presently
*punct* ,
catching
hold
of
the
mizen
shrouds
*punct* ,
he
swings
himself
to
the
deck
*punct* ,
and
in
an
even
*punct* ,
unexhilarated
voice
*punct* ,
saying
*punct* ,
dinner
*punct* ,
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ,
disappears
into
the
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
last
echo
of
his
sultan's
step
has
died
away
*punct* ,
and
starbuck
*punct* ,
the
first
emir
*punct* ,
has
every
reason
to
suppose
that
he
is
seated
*punct* ,
then
starbuck
rouses
from
his
quietude
*punct* ,
takes
a
few
turns
along
the
planks
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
after
a
grave
peep
into
the
binnacle
*punct* ,
says
*punct* ,
with
some
touch
of
pleasantness
*punct* ,
dinner
*punct* ,
mr.
stubb
*punct* ,
and
descends
the
scuttle
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
third
emir
*punct* ,
now
seeing
himself
all
alone
on
the
quarter-deck
*punct* ,
seems
to
feel
relieved
from
some
curious
restraint
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
tipping
all
sorts
of
knowing
winks
in
all
sorts
of
directions
*punct* ,
and
kicking
off
his
shoes
*punct* ,
he
strikes
into
a
sharp
but
noiseless
squall
of
a
hornpipe
right
over
the
grand
turk's
head
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
by
a
dexterous
sleight
*punct* ,
pitching
his
cap
up
into
the
mizentop
for
a
shelf
*punct* ,
he
goes
down
rollicking
*punct* ,
so
far
at
least
as
he
remains
visible
from
the
deck
*punct* ,
reversing
all
other
processions
*punct* ,
by
bringing
up
the
rear
with
music
*punct* .
*break*
but
ere
stepping
into
the
cabin
doorway
below
*punct* ,
he
pauses
*punct* ,
ships
a
new
face
altogether
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
independent
*punct* ,
hilarious
little
flask
enters
king
ahab's
presence
*punct* ,
in
the
character
of
abjectus
*punct* ,
or
the
slave
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
the
least
among
the
strange
things
bred
by
the
intense
artificialness
of
sea-usages
*punct* ,
that
while
in
the
open
air
of
the
deck
some
officers
will
*punct* ,
upon
provocation
*punct* ,
bear
themselves
boldly
and
defyingly
enough
towards
their
commander
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
ten
to
one
*punct* ,
let
those
very
officers
the
next
moment
go
down
to
their
customary
dinner
in
that
same
commander's
cabin
*punct* ,
and
straightway
their
inoffensive
*punct* ,
not
to
say
deprecatory
and
humble
air
towards
him
*punct* ,
as
he
sits
at
the
head
of
the
table
*punct* ;
this
is
marvellous
*punct* ,
sometimes
most
comical
*punct* .
*break*
wherefore
this
difference
*punct* ?
*break*
to
have
been
belshazzar
*punct* ,
king
of
babylon
*punct* ;
and
to
have
been
belshazzar
*punct* ,
not
haughtily
but
courteously
*punct* ,
therein
certainly
must
have
been
some
touch
of
mundane
grandeur
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
who
in
the
rightly
regal
and
intelligent
spirit
presides
over
his
own
private
dinner-table
of
invited
guests
*punct* ,
that
man's
unchallenged
power
and
dominion
of
individual
influence
for
the
time
*punct* ;
that
man's
royalty
of
state
transcends
belshazzar's
*punct* ,
for
belshazzar
was
not
the
greatest
*punct* .
*break*
who
has
but
once
dined
his
friends
*punct* ,
has
tasted
what
it
is
to
be
caesar
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
witchery
of
social
czarship
which
there
is
no
withstanding
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
own
proper
turn
*punct* ,
each
officer
waited
to
be
served
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
as
little
children
before
ahab
*punct* ;
and
yet
*punct* ,
in
ahab
*punct* ,
there
seemed
not
to
lurk
the
smallest
social
arrogance
*punct* .
*break*
with
one
mind
*punct* ,
their
intent
eyes
all
fastened
upon
the
old
man's
knife
*punct* ,
as
he
carved
the
chief
dish
before
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
suppose
that
for
the
world
they
would
have
profaned
that
moment
with
the
slightest
observation
*punct* ,
even
upon
so
neutral
a
topic
as
the
weather
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
reaching
out
his
knife
and
fork
*punct* ,
between
which
the
slice
of
beef
was
locked
*punct* ,
ahab
thereby
motioned
starbuck's
plate
towards
him
*punct* ,
the
mate
received
his
meat
as
though
receiving
alms
*punct* ;
and
cut
it
tenderly
*punct* ;
and
a
little
started
if
*punct* ,
perchance
*punct* ,
the
knife
grazed
against
the
plate
*punct* ;
and
chewed
it
noiselessly
*punct* ;
and
swallowed
it
*punct* ,
not
without
circumspection
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
like
the
coronation
banquet
at
frankfort
*punct* ,
where
the
german
emperor
profoundly
dines
with
the
seven
imperial
electors
*punct* ,
so
these
cabin
meals
were
somehow
solemn
meals
*punct* ,
eaten
in
awful
silence
*punct* ;
and
yet
at
table
old
ahab
forbade
not
conversation
*punct* ;
only
he
himself
was
dumb
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
relief
it
was
to
choking
stubb
*punct* ,
when
a
rat
made
a
sudden
racket
in
the
hold
below
*punct* .
*break*
and
poor
little
flask
*punct* ,
he
was
the
youngest
son
*punct* ,
and
little
boy
of
this
weary
family
party
*punct* .
*break*
his
were
the
shinbones
of
the
saline
beef
*punct* ;
his
would
have
been
the
drumsticks
*punct* .
*break*
for
flask
to
have
presumed
to
help
himself
*punct* ,
this
must
have
seemed
to
him
tantamount
to
larceny
in
the
first
degree
*punct* .
*break*
had
he
helped
himself
at
that
table
*punct* ,
doubtless
*punct* ,
never
more
would
he
have
been
able
to
hold
his
head
up
in
this
honest
world
*punct* ;
nevertheless
*punct* ,
strange
to
say
*punct* ,
ahab
never
forbade
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
had
flask
helped
himself
*punct* ,
the
chances
were
ahab
had
never
so
much
as
noticed
it
*punct* .
*break*
least
of
all
*punct* ,
did
flask
presume
to
help
himself
to
butter
*punct* .
*break*
whether
he
thought
the
owners
of
the
ship
denied
it
to
him
*punct* ,
on
account
of
its
clotting
his
clear
*punct* ,
sunny
complexion
*punct* ;
or
whether
he
deemed
that
*punct* ,
on
so
long
a
voyage
in
such
marketless
waters
*punct* ,
butter
was
at
a
premium
*punct* ,
and
therefore
was
not
for
him
*punct* ,
a
subaltern
*punct* ;
however
it
was
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ,
alas
*punct* !
*break*
was
a
butterless
man
*punct* !
*break*
for
hereby
flask's
dinner
was
badly
jammed
in
point
of
time
*punct* .
*break*
starbuck
and
stubb
both
had
the
start
of
him
*punct* ;
and
yet
they
also
have
the
privilege
of
lounging
in
the
rear
*punct* .
*break*
if
stubb
even
*punct* ,
who
is
but
a
peg
higher
than
flask
*punct* ,
happens
to
have
but
a
small
appetite
*punct* ,
and
soon
shows
symptoms
of
concluding
his
repast
*punct* ,
then
flask
must
bestir
himself
*punct* ,
he
will
not
get
more
than
three
mouthfuls
that
day
*punct* ;
for
it
is
against
holy
usage
for
stubb
to
precede
flask
to
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
it
was
that
flask
once
admitted
in
private
*punct* ,
that
ever
since
he
had
arisen
to
the
dignity
of
an
officer
*punct* ,
from
that
moment
he
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
be
otherwise
than
hungry
*punct* ,
more
or
less
*punct* .
*break*
for
what
he
ate
did
not
so
much
relieve
his
hunger
*punct* ,
as
keep
it
immortal
in
him
*punct* .
*break*
peace
and
satisfaction
*punct* ,
thought
flask
*punct* ,
have
for
ever
departed
from
my
stomach
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
an
officer
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
how
i
wish
i
could
fist
a
bit
of
old-fashioned
beef
in
the
forecastle
*punct* ,
as
i
used
to
when
i
was
before
the
mast
*punct* .
*break*
there's
the
fruits
of
promotion
now
*punct* ;
there's
the
vanity
of
glory
*punct* :
there's
the
insanity
of
life
*punct* !
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
if
it
were
so
that
any
mere
sailor
of
the
pequod
had
a
grudge
against
flask
in
flask's
official
capacity
*punct* ,
all
that
sailor
had
to
do
*punct* ,
in
order
to
obtain
ample
vengeance
*punct* ,
was
to
go
aft
at
dinner-time
*punct* ,
and
get
a
peep
at
flask
through
the
cabin
sky-light
*punct* ,
sitting
silly
and
dumfoundered
before
awful
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
ahab
and
his
three
mates
formed
what
may
be
called
the
first
table
in
the
pequod's
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
after
their
departure
*punct* ,
taking
place
in
inverted
order
to
their
arrival
*punct* ,
the
canvas
cloth
was
cleared
*punct* ,
or
rather
was
restored
to
some
hurried
order
by
the
pallid
steward
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
the
three
harpooneers
were
bidden
to
the
feast
*punct* ,
they
being
its
residuary
legatees
*punct* .
*break*
they
made
a
sort
of
temporary
servants
hall
of
the
high
and
mighty
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
in
strange
contrast
to
the
hardly
tolerable
constraint
and
nameless
invisible
domineerings
of
the
captain's
table
*punct* ,
was
the
entire
care-free

democracy

inferior
fellows
the
harpooneers

their
masters
*punct* ,
the
mates
*punct* ,
seemed
afraid
of
the
sound
of
the
hinges
of
their
own
jaws
*punct* ,
the
harpooneers
chewed
their
food
with
such
a
relish
that
there
was
a
report
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
they
dined
like
lords
*punct* ;
they
filled
their
bellies
like
indian
ships
all
day
loading
with
spices
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
he
were
not
lively
about
it
*punct* ,
if
he
did
not
go
with
a
nimble
hop-skip-and-jump
*punct* ,
then
tashtego
had
an
ungentlemanly
way
of
accelerating
him
by
darting
a
fork
at
his
back
*punct* ,
harpoonwise
*punct* .
*break*
and
once
daggoo
*punct* ,
seized
with
a
sudden
humor
*punct* ,
assisted
dough-boy's
memory
by
snatching
him
up
bodily
*punct* ,
and
thrusting
his
head
into
a
great
empty
wooden
trencher
*punct* ,
while
tashtego
*punct* ,
knife
in
hand
*punct* ,
began
laying
out
the
circle
preliminary
to
scalping
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
naturally
a
very
nervous
*punct* ,
shuddering
sort
of
little
fellow
*punct* ,
this
bread-faced
steward
*punct* ;
the
progeny
of
a
bankrupt
baker
and
a
hospital
nurse
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
with
the
standing
spectacle
of
the
black
terrific
ahab
*punct* ,
and
the
periodical
tumultuous
visitations
of
these
three
savages
*punct* ,
dough-boy's
whole
life
was
one
continual
lip-quiver
*punct* .
*break*
commonly
*punct* ,
after
seeing
the
harpooneers
furnished
with
all
things
they
demanded
*punct* ,
he
would
escape
from
their
clutches
into
his
little
pantry
adjoining
*punct* ,
and
fearfully
peep
out
at
them
through
the
blinds
of
its
door
*punct* ,
till
all
was
over
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
sight
to
see
queequeg
seated
over
against
tashtego
*punct* ,
opposing
his
filed
teeth
to
the
indian's
*punct* :
crosswise
to
them
*punct* ,
daggoo
seated
on
the
floor
*punct* ,
for
a
bench
would
have
brought
his
hearse-plumed
head
to
the
low
carlines
*punct* ;
at
every
motion
of
his
colossal
limbs
*punct* ,
making
the
low
cabin
framework
to
shake
*punct* ,
as
when
an
african
elephant
goes
passenger
in
a
ship
*punct* .
*break*
but
for
all
this
*punct* ,
the
great
negro
was
wonderfully
abstemious
*punct* ,
not
to
say
dainty
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
hardly
possible
that
by
such
comparatively
small
mouthfuls
he
could
keep
up
the
vitality
diffused
through
so
broad
*punct* ,
baronial
*punct* ,
and
superb
a
person
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
doubtless
*punct* ,
this
noble
savage
fed
strong
and
drank
deep
of
the
abounding
element
of
air
*punct* ;
and
through
his
dilated
nostrils
snuffed
in
the
sublime
life
of
the
worlds
*punct* .
*break*
not
by
beef
or
by
bread
*punct* ,
are
giants
made
or
nourished
*punct* .
*break*
but
queequeg
*punct* ,
he
had
a
mortal
*punct* ,
barbaric
smack
of
the
lip
in
eating
*punct* ,
an
ugly
sound
enough
*punct* ,
so
much
so
*punct* ,
that
the
trembling
dough-boy
almost
looked
to
see
whether
any
marks
of
teeth
lurked
in
his
own
lean
arms
*punct* .
*break*
nor
did
the
whetstone
which
the
harpooneers
carried
in
their
pockets
*punct* ,
for
their
lances
and
other
weapons
*punct* ;
and
with
which
whetstones
*punct* ,
at
dinner
*punct* ,
they
would
ostentatiously
sharpen
their
knives
*punct* ;
that
grating
sound
did
not
at
all
tend
to
tranquillize
poor
dough-boy
*punct* .
*break*
how
could
he
forget
that
in
his
island
days
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
for
one
*punct* ,
must
certainly
have
been
guilty
of
some
murderous
*punct* ,
convivial
indiscretions
*punct* .
*break*
hard
fares
the
white
waiter
who
waits

cannibals
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
napkin
should
he
carry
on
his
arm
*punct* ,
but
a
buckler
*punct* .
*break*
in
good
time
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
to
his
great
delight
*punct* ,
the
three
salt-sea
warriors
would
rise
and
depart
*punct* ;
to
his
credulous
*punct* ,
fable-mongering
ears
*punct* ,
all
their
martial
bones
jingling
in
them
at
every
step
*punct* ,
like
moorish
scimetars
in
scabbards
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
though
these
barbarians
dined
in
the
cabin
*punct* ,
and
nominally
lived
there
*punct* ;
still
*punct* ,
being
anything
but
sedentary
in
their
habits
*punct* ,
they
were
scarcely
ever
in
it
except
at
meal-times
*punct* ,
and
just
before
sleeping-time
*punct* ,
when
they
passed
through
it
to
their
own
peculiar
quarters
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
one
matter
*punct* ,
ahab
seemed
no
exception
to
most
american
whale
captains
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
as
a
set
*punct* ,
rather
incline
to
the
opinion
that
by
rights
the
ship's
cabin
belongs
to
them
*punct* ;
and
that
it
is
by
courtesy
alone
that
anybody
else
is
*punct* ,
at
any
time
*punct* ,
permitted
there
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
*punct* ,
in
real
truth
*punct* ,
the
mates
and
harpooneers
of
the
pequod
might
more
properly
be
said
to
have
lived
out
of
the
cabin
than
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
for
when
they
did
enter
it
*punct* ,
it
was
something
as
a
street-door
enters
a
house
*punct* ;
turning
inwards
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
only
to
be
turned
out
the
next
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
as
a
permanent
thing
*punct* ,
residing
in
the
open
air
*punct* .
*break*
nor
did
they
lose
much
hereby
*punct* ;
in
the
cabin
was
no
companionship
*punct* ;
socially
*punct* ,
ahab
was
inaccessible
*punct* .
*break*
though
nominally
included
in
the
census
of
christendom
*punct* ,
he
was
still
an
alien
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
lived
in
the
world
*punct* ,
as
the
last
of
the
grisly
bears
lived
in
settled
missouri
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
when
spring
and
summer
had
departed
*punct* ,
that
wild
logan
of
the
woods
*punct* ,
burying
himself
in
the
hollow
of
a
tree
*punct* ,
lived
out
the
winter
there
*punct* ,
sucking
his
own
paws
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
in
his
inclement
*punct* ,
howling
old
age
*punct* ,
ahab's
soul
*punct* ,
shut
up
in
the
caved
trunk
of
his
body
*punct* ,
there
fed
upon
the
sullen
paws
of
its
gloom
*punct* !
*break*
in
most
american
whalemen
the
mast-heads
are
manned
almost
simultaneously
with
the
vessel's
leaving
her
port
*punct* ;
even
though
she
may
have
fifteen
thousand
miles
*punct* ,
and
more
*punct* ,
to
sail
ere
reaching
her
proper
cruising
ground
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
*punct* ,
after
a
three
*punct* ,
four
*punct* ,
or
five
years
voyage
she
is
drawing
nigh
home
with
anything
empty
in
her
*punct* ,
say
*punct* ,
an
empty
vial
even
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
her
mast-heads
are
kept
manned
to
the
last
*punct* ;
and
not
till
her
skysail-poles
sail
in
among
the
spires
of
the
port
*punct* ,
does
she
altogether
relinquish
the
hope
of
capturing
one
whale
more
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
as
the
business
of
standing
mast-heads
*punct* ,
ashore
or
afloat
*punct* ,
is
a
very
ancient
and
interesting
one
*punct* ,
let
us
in
some
measure
expatiate
here
*punct* .
*break*
i
take
it
*punct* ,
that
the
earliest
standers
of
mast-heads
were
the
old
egyptians
*punct* ;
because
*punct* ,
in
all
my
researches
*punct* ,
i
find
none
prior
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
for
though
their
progenitors
*punct* ,
the
builders
of
babel
*punct* ,
must
doubtless
*punct* ,
by
their
tower
*punct* ,
have
intended
to
rear
the
loftiest
mast-head
in
all
asia
*punct* ,
or
africa
either
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
ere
the
final
truck
was
put
to
it
*punct* ,
as
that
great
stone
mast
of
theirs
may
be
said
to
have
gone
by
the
board
*punct* ,
in
the
dread
gale
of
god's
wrath
*punct* ;
therefore
*punct* ,
we
cannot
give
these
babel
builders
priority
over
the
egyptians
*punct* .
*break*
and
that
the
egyptians
were
a
nation
of
mast-head
standers
*punct* ,
is
an
assertion
based
upon
the
general
belief
among
archaeologists
*punct* ,
that
the
first
pyramids
were
founded
for
astronomical
purposes
*punct* :
a
theory
singularly
supported
by
the
peculiar
stair-like
formation
of
all
four
sides
of
those
edifices
*punct* ;
whereby
*punct* ,
with
prodigious
long
upliftings
of
their
legs
*punct* ,
those
old
astronomers
were
wont
to
mount
to
the
apex
*punct* ,
and
sing
out
for
new
stars
*punct* ;
even
as
the
look-outs
of
a
modern
ship
sing
out
for
a
sail
*punct* ,
or
a
whale
just
bearing
in
sight
*punct* .
*break*
of
modern
standers-of-mast-heads
we
have
but
a
lifeless
set
*punct* ;
mere
stone
*punct* ,
iron
*punct* ,
and
bronze
men
*punct* ;
who
*punct* ,
though
well
capable
of
facing
out
a
stiff
gale
*punct* ,
are
still
entirely
incompetent
to
the
business
of
singing
out
upon
discovering
any
strange
sight
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
napoleon
*punct* ;

*punct* ,
upon
the

of
vendome
*punct* ,
stands
with
arms
folded

some
one
hundred

fifty
feet

also
*punct* ,
on

ever

most
obscured

token
is

answer
a

hail
from

however
madly
invoked
to
befriend
by
their
counsels
the
distracted
decks
upon
which

gaze

however
it
may
be
surmised

penetrate
through
the

descry

it

seem
unwarrantable
to
couple
in
any
respect
the
mast-head
standers

land
with
those
of
the
sea
*punct* ;
but
that
in
truth
it
is
not
so

is
plainly
evinced
by
an
item
for
which
obed
macy
*punct* ,
the
sole
historian
of
nantucket
*punct* ,
stands
accountable
*punct* .
*break*
the
worthy
obed
tells
us

that
in
the
early
times
of
the
whale
fishery
*punct* ,
ere
ships
were
regularly
launched
in
pursuit
of
the
game
*punct* ,
the
people
of
that
island
erected
lofty
spars
along
the
sea-coast
*punct* ,

the
look-outs
ascended
by
means

something

we
may
beget
*punct* .
*break*
in
shape
*punct* ,
the
sleet's
crow's-nest
is
something
like
a
large
tierce
or
pipe
*punct* ;
it
is
open
above
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
where
it
is
furnished
with
a
movable
side-screen
to
keep
to
windward
of
your
head
in
a
hard
gale
*punct* .
*break*
being
fixed
on
the
summit
of
the
mast
*punct* ,
you
ascend
into
it
through
a
little
trap-hatch
in
the
bottom
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
after
side
*punct* ,
or
side
next
the
stern
of
the
ship
*punct* ,
is
a
comfortable
seat
*punct* ,
with
a
locker
underneath
for
umbrellas
*punct* ,
comforters
*punct* ,
and
coats
*punct* .
*break*
in
front
is
a
leather
rack
*punct* ,
in
which
to
keep
your
speaking
trumpet
*punct* ,
pipe
*punct* ,
telescope
*punct* ,
and
other
nautical
conveniences
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
it
was
plainly
a
labor
of
love
for
captain
sleet
to
describe
*punct* ,
as
he
does
*punct* ,
all
the
little
detailed
conveniences
of
his
crow's-nest
*punct* ;
but
though
he
so
enlarges
upon
many
of
these
*punct* ,
and
though
he
treats
us
to
a
very
scientific
account
of
his
experiments
in
this
crow's-nest
*punct* ,
with
a
small
compass
he
kept
there
for
the
purpose
of
counteracting
the
errors
resulting
from
what
is
called
the
local
attraction
of
all
binnacle
magnets
*punct* ;
an
error
ascribable
to
the
horizontal
vicinity
of
the
iron
in
the
ship's
planks
*punct* ,
and
in
the
glacier's
case
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
to
there
having
been
so
many
broken-down
blacksmiths
among
her
crew
*punct* ;
i
say
*punct* ,
that
though
the
captain
is
very
discreet
and
scientific
here
*punct* ,
yet
*punct* ,
for
all
his
learned
binnacle
deviations
*punct* ,
azimuth
compass
observations
*punct* ,
and
approximate
errors
*punct* ,
he
knows
very
well
*punct* ,
captain
sleet
*punct* ,
that
he
was
not
so
much
immersed
in
those
profound
magnetic
meditations
*punct* ,
as
to
fail
being
attracted
occasionally
towards
that
well
replenished
little
case-bottle
*punct* ,
so
nicely
tucked
in
on
one
side
of
his
crow's
nest
*punct* ,
within
easy
reach
of
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
though
*punct* ,
upon
the
whole
*punct* ,
i
greatly
admire
and
even
love
the
brave
*punct* ,
the
honest
*punct* ,
and
learned
captain
*punct* ;
yet
i
take
it
very
ill
of
him
that
he
should
so
utterly
ignore
that
case-bottle
*punct* ,
seeing
what
a
faithful
friend
and
comforter
it
must
have
been
*punct* ,
while
with
mittened
fingers
and
hooded
head
he
was
studying
the
mathematics
aloft
there
in
that
bird's
nest
within
three
or
four
perches
of
the
pole
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
we
southern
whale-fishers
are
not
so
snugly
housed
aloft
as
captain
sleet
and
his
greenland-men
were
*punct* ;
yet
that
disadvantage
is
greatly
counterbalanced
by
the
widely
contrasting
serenity
of
those
seductive
seas
in
which
we
south
fishers
mostly
float
*punct* .
*break*
for
one
*punct* ,
i
used
to
lounge
up
the
rigging
very
leisurely
*punct* ,
resting
in
the
top
to
have
a
chat
with
queequeg
*punct* ,
or
any
one
else
off
duty
whom
i
might
find
there
*punct* ;
then
ascending
a
little
way
further
*punct* ,
and
throwing
a
lazy
leg
over
the
top-sail
yard
*punct* ,
take
a
preliminary
view
of
the
watery
pastures
*punct* ,
and
so
at
last
mount
to
my
ultimate
destination
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
here
*punct* ,
and
frankly
admit
that
i
kept
but
sorry
guard
*punct* .
*break*
and
let
me
in
this
place
movingly
admonish
you
*punct* ,
ye
ship-owners
of
nantucket
*punct* !
*break*
beware
of
enlisting
in
your
vigilant
fisheries
any
lad
with
lean
brow
and
hollow
eye
*punct* ;
given
to
unseasonable
meditativeness
*punct* ;
and
who
offers
to
ship
with
the
phaedon
instead
of
bowditch
in
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
beware
of
such
an
one
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ;
your
whales
must
be
seen
before
they
can
be
killed
*punct* ;
and
this
sunken-eyed
young
platonist
will
tow
you
ten
wakes
round
the
world
*punct* ,
and
never
make
you
one
pint
of
sperm
the
richer
*punct* .
*break*
nor
are
these
monitions
at
all
unneeded
*punct* .
*break*
for
nowadays
*punct* ,
the
whale-fishery
furnishes
an
asylum
for
many
romantic
*punct* ,
melancholy
*punct* ,
and
absent-minded
young
men
*punct* ,
disgusted
with
the
carking
cares
of
earth
*punct* ,
and
seeking
sentiment
in
tar
and
blubber
*punct* .
*break*
childe
harold
not
unfrequently
perches
himself
upon
the
mast-head
of
some
luckless
disappointed
whale-ship
*punct* ,
and
in
moody
phrase
ejaculates:
*punct* ,
roll
on
*punct* ,
thou
deep
and
dark
blue
ocean
*punct* ,
roll
*punct* !
*break*
ten
thousand
blubber-hunters
sweep
over
thee
in
vain
*punct* .
*break*
very
often
do
the
captains
of
such
ships
take
those
absent-minded
young
philosophers
to
task
*punct* ,
upbraiding
them
with
not
feeling
sufficient
interest
in
the
voyage
*punct* ;
half-hinting
that
they
are
so
hopelessly
lost
to
all
honorable
ambition
*punct* ,
as
that
in
their
secret
souls
they
would
rather
not
see
whales
than
otherwise
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
in
vain
*punct* ;
those
young
platonists
have
a
notion
that
their
vision
is
imperfect
*punct* ;
they
are
short-sighted
*punct* ;
what
use
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
to
strain
the
visual
nerve
*punct* ?
*break*
they
have
left
their
opera-glasses
at
home
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
thou
monkey
*punct* ,
said
a
harpooneer
to
one
of
these
lads
*punct* ,
we've
been
cruising
now
hard
upon
three
years
*punct* ,
and
thou
hast
not
raised
a
whale
yet
*punct* .
*break*
whales
are
scarce
as
hen's
teeth
whenever
thou
art
up
here
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
enchanted
mood
*punct* ,
thy
spirit
ebbs
away
to
whence
it
came
*punct* ;
becomes
diffused
through
time
and
space
*punct* ;
like
cranmer's
sprinkled
pantheistic
ashes
*punct* ,
forming
at
last
a
part
of
every
shore
the
round
globe
over
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
life
in
thee
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
except
that
rocking
life
imparted
by
a
gently
rolling
ship
*punct* ;
by
her
*punct* ,
borrowed
from
the
sea
*punct* ;
by
the
sea
*punct* ,
from
the
inscrutable
tides
of
god
*punct* .
*break*
but
while
this
sleep
*punct* ,
this
dream
is
on
ye
*punct* ,
move
your
foot
or
hand
an
inch
*punct* ;
slip
your
hold
at
all
*punct* ;
and
your
identity
comes
back
in
horror
*punct* .
*break*
over
descartian
vortices
you
hover
*punct* .
*break*
and
perhaps
*punct* ,
at
mid-day
*punct* ,
in
the
fairest
weather
*punct* ,
with
one
half-throttled
shriek
you
drop
through
that
transparent
air
into
the
summer
sea
*punct* ,
no
more
to
rise
for
ever
*punct* .
*break*
heed
it
well
*punct* ,
ye
pantheists
*punct* !
*break*
there
most
sea-captains
usually
walk
at
that
hour
*punct* ,
as
country
gentlemen
*punct* ,
after
the
same
meal
*punct* ,
take
a
few
turns
in
the
garden
*punct* .
*break*
soon
his
steady
*punct* ,
ivory
stride
was
heard
*punct* ,
as
to
and
fro
he
paced
his
old
rounds
*punct* ,
upon
planks
so
familiar
to
his
tread
*punct* ,
that
they
were
all
over
dented
*punct* ,
like
geological
stones
*punct* ,
with
the
peculiar
mark
of
his
walk
*punct* .
*break*
but
on
the
occasion
in
question
*punct* ,
those
dents
looked
deeper
*punct* ,
even
as
his
nervous
step
that
morning
left
a
deeper
mark
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
so
full
of
his
thought
was
ahab
*punct* ,
that
at
every
uniform
turn
that
he
made
*punct* ,
now
at
the
main-mast
and
now
at
the
binnacle
*punct* ,
you
could
almost
see
that
thought
turn
in
him
as
he
turned
*punct* ,
and
pace
in
him
as
he
paced
*punct* ;
so
completely
possessing
him
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
that
it
all
but
seemed
the
inward
mould
of
every
outer
movement
*punct* .
*break*
d'ye
mark
him
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ?
*break*
whispered
stubb
*punct* ;
the
chick
that's
in
him
pecks
the
shell
*punct* .
*break*
t'will
soon
be
out
*punct* .
*break*
the
hours
wore
on;
*punct* ,
ahab
now
shut
up
within
his
cabin
*punct* ;
anon
*punct* ,
pacing
the
deck
*punct* ,
with
the
same
intense
bigotry
of
purpose
in
his
aspect
*punct* .
*break*
it
drew
near
the
close
of
day
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
he
came
to
a
halt
by
the
bulwarks
*punct* ,
and
inserting
his
bone
leg
into
the
auger-hole
there
*punct* ,
and
with
one
hand
grasping
a
shroud
*punct* ,
he
ordered
starbuck
to
send
everybody
aft
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
mate
*punct* ,
astonished
at
an
order
seldom
or
never
given
on
ship-board
except
in
some
extraordinary
case
*punct* .
*break*
send
everybody
aft
*punct* ,
repeated
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
mast-heads
*punct* ,
there
*punct* !
*break*
when
the
entire
ship's
company
were
assembled
*punct* ,
and
with
curious
and
not
wholly
unapprehensive
faces
*punct* ,
were
eyeing
him
*punct* ,
for
he
looked
not
unlike
the
weather
horizon
when
a
storm
is
coming
up
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* ,
after
rapidly
glancing
over
the
bulwarks
*punct* ,
and
then
darting
his
eyes
among
the
crew
*punct* ,
started
from
his
standpoint
*punct* ;
and
as
though
not
a
soul
were
nigh
him
resumed
his
heavy
turns
upon
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
with
bent
head
and
half-slouched
hat
he
continued
to
pace
*punct* ,
unmindful
of
the
wondering
whispering
among
the
men
*punct* ;
till
stubb
cautiously
whispered
to
flask
*punct* ,
that
ahab
must
have
summoned
them
there
for
the
purpose
of
witnessing
a
pedestrian
feat
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
did
not
last
long
*punct* .
*break*
vehemently
pausing
*punct* ,
he
cried:
*punct* ,
what
do
ye
do
when
ye
see
a
whale
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ?
*break*
sing
out
for
him
*punct* !
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
with
a
wild
approval
in
his
tones
*punct* ;
observing
the
hearty
animation
into
which
his
unexpected
question
had
so
magnetically
thrown
them
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
do
ye
next
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ?
*break*
lower
away
*punct* ,
and
after
him
*punct* !
*break*
and
what
tune
is
it
ye
pull
to
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ?
*break*
a
dead
whale
or
a
stove
boat
*punct* !
*break*
more
and
more
strangely
and
fiercely
glad
and
approving
*punct* ,
grew
the
countenance
of
the
old
man
at
every
shout
*punct* ;
while
the
mariners
began
to
gaze
curiously
at
each
other
*punct* ,
as
if
marvelling
how
it
was
that
they
themselves
became
so
excited
at
such
seemingly
purposeless
questions
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
they
were
all
eagerness
again
*punct* ,
as
ahab
*punct* ,
now
half-revolving
in
his
pivot-hole
*punct* ,
with
one
hand
reaching
high
up
a
shroud
*punct* ,
and
tightly
*punct* ,
almost
convulsively
grasping
it
*punct* ,
addressed
them
thus:
*punct* ,
all
ye
mast-headers
have
before
now
heard
me
give
orders
about
a
white
whale
*punct* .
*break*
d'ye
see
this
spanish
ounce
of
gold?
*punct* ,
holding
up
a
broad
bright
coin
to
the
sun
*punct* ,
it
is
a
sixteen
dollar
piece
*punct* ,
men
*punct* .
*break*
d'ye
see
it
*punct* ?
*break*
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ,
hand
me
yon
top-maul
*punct* .
*break*
while
the
mate
was
getting
the
hammer
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* ,
without
speaking
*punct* ,
was
slowly
rubbing
the
gold
piece
against
the
skirts
of
his
jacket
*punct* ,
as
if
to
heighten
its
lustre
*punct* ,
and
without
using
any
words
was
meanwhile
lowly
humming
to
himself
*punct* ,
producing
a
sound
so
strangely
muffled
and
inarticulate
that
it
seemed
the
mechanical
humming
of
the
wheels
of
his
vitality
in
him
*punct* .
*break*
receiving
the
top-maul
from
starbuck
*punct* ,
he
advanced
towards
the
main-mast
with
the
hammer
uplifted
in
one
hand
*punct* ,
exhibiting
the
gold
with
the
other
*punct* ,
and
with
a
high
raised
voice
exclaiming
*punct* :
whosoever
of
ye
raises
me
a
white-headed
whale
with
a
wrinkled
brow
and
a
crooked
jaw
*punct* ;
whosoever
of
ye
raises
me
that
white-headed
whale
*punct* ,
with
three
holes
punctured
in
his
starboard
fluke
*punct* ,
look
ye
*punct* ,
whosoever
of
ye
raises
me
that
same
white
whale
*punct* ,
he
shall
have
this
gold
ounce
*punct* ,
my
boys
*punct* !
*break*
cried
the
seamen
*punct* ,
as
with
swinging
tarpaulins
they
hailed
the
act
of
nailing
the
gold
to
the
mast
*punct* .
*break*
skin
your
eyes
for
him
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ;
look
sharp
for
white
water
*punct* ;
if
ye
see
but
a
bubble
*punct* ,
sing
out
*punct* .
*break*
all
this
while
tashtego
*punct* ,
daggoo
*punct* ,
and
queequeg
had
looked
on
with
even
more
intense
interest
and
surprise
than
the
rest
*punct* ,
and
at
the
mention
of
the
wrinkled
brow
and
crooked
jaw
they
had
started
as
if
each
was
separately
touched
by
some
specific
recollection
*punct* .
*break*
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
said
tashtego
*punct* ,
that
white
whale
must
be
the
same
that
some
call
moby
dick
*punct* .
*break*
do
ye
know
the
white
whale
then
*punct* ,

*break*
does
he
fan-tail
a
little
curious
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
before

goes
down

*break*
said
the
gay-header
deliberately
*punct* .
*break*
and

a
curious
spout
*punct* ,

*punct* ,
said
daggoo
*punct* ,
very
bushy
*punct* ,
even
for

cried
queequeg
disjointedly
*punct* ,
all
twiske-tee
betwisk
*punct* ,
like
him
*punct* ,
him
*punct* ,
faltering
hard
for

screwing

round

uncorking

*break*
captain
ahab

said
starbuck
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
with
stubb
and
flask
*punct* ,
had
thus
far
been
eyeing
his
superior
with
increasing
surprise
*punct* ,
but
at
last
seemed
struck
with
a
thought
which
somewhat
explained
all
the
wonder
*punct* .
*break*
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
i
have
heard
of
moby
dick
*punct* ,
but
it
was
not
moby
dick
that
took
off
thy
leg
*punct* ?
*break*
who
told
thee
that
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ;
then
pausing
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* ;
aye
*punct* ,
my
hearties
all
round
*punct* ;
it
was
moby
dick
that
dismasted
me
*punct* ;
moby
dick
that
brought
me
to
this
dead
stump
i
stand
on
now
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
he
shouted
with
a
terrific
*punct* ,
loud
*punct* ,
animal
sob
*punct* ,
like
that
of
a
heart-stricken
moose
*punct* ;
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* !
*break*
then
tossing
both
arms
*punct* ,
with
measureless
imprecations
he
shouted
out
*punct* :
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* !
*break*
and
i'll
chase
him
round
good
hope
*punct* ,
and
round
the
horn
*punct* ,
and
round
the
norway
maelstrom
*punct* ,
and
round
perdition's
flames
before
i
give
him
up
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
is
what
ye
have
shipped
for
*punct* ,
men
*punct* !
*break*
to
chase
that
white
whale
on
both
sides
of
land
*punct* ,
and
over
all
sides
of
earth
*punct* ,
till
he
spouts
black
blood
and
rolls
fin
out
*punct* .
*break*
what
say
ye
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
will
ye
splice
hands
on
it
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ?
*break*
i
think
ye
do
look
brave
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* !
*break*
shouted
the
harpooneers
and
seamen
*punct* ,
running
closer
to
the
excited
old
man
*punct* :
a
sharp
eye
for
the
white
whale
*punct* ;
a
sharp
lance
for
moby
dick
*punct* !
*break*
god
bless
ye
*punct* ,
he
seemed
to
half
sob
and
half
shout
*punct* .
*break*
god
bless
ye
*punct* ,
men
*punct* .
*break*
go
draw
the
great
measure
of
grog
*punct* .
*break*
but
what's
this
long
face
about
*punct* ,
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ;
wilt
thou
not
chase
the
white
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
art
not
game
for
moby
dick
*punct* ?
*break*
i
am
game
for
his
crooked
jaw
*punct* ,
and
for
the
jaws
of
death
too
*punct* ,
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
if
it
fairly
comes
in
the
way
of
the
business
we
follow
*punct* ;
but
i
came
here
to
hunt
whales
*punct* ,
not
my
commander's
vengeance
*punct* .
*break*
how
many
barrels
will
thy
vengeance
yield
thee
even
if
thou
gettest
it
*punct* ,
captain
ahab
*punct* ?
*break*
it
will
not
fetch
thee
much
in
our
nantucket
market
*punct* .
*break*
but
come
closer
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* ;
thou
requirest
a
little
lower
layer
*punct* .
*break*
if
money's
to
be
the
measurer
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
and
the
accountants
have
computed
their
great
counting-house
the
globe
*punct* ,
by
girdling
it
with
guineas
*punct* ,
one
to
every
three
parts
of
an
inch
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
let
me
tell
thee
*punct* ,
that
my
vengeance
will
fetch
a
great
premium
here
*punct* !
*break*
he
smites
his
chest
*punct* ,
whispered
stubb
*punct* ,
what's
that
for
*punct* ?
*break*
methinks
it
rings
most
vast
*punct* ,
but
hollow
*punct* .
*break*
vengeance
on
a
dumb
brute
*punct* !
*break*
cried
starbuck
*punct* ,
that
simply
smote
thee
from
blindest
instinct
*punct* !
*break*
to
be
enraged
with
a
dumb
thing
*punct* ,
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
seems
blasphemous
*punct* .
*break*
hark
ye
yet
again,
*punct* ,
the
little
lower
layer
*punct* .
*break*
all
visible
objects
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
are
but
as
pasteboard
masks
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
each
event
*punct* ,
in
the
living
act
*punct* ,
the
undoubted
deed
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ,
some
unknown
but
still
reasoning
thing
puts
forth
the
mouldings
of
its
features
from
behind
the
unreasoning
mask
*punct* .
*break*
how
can
the
prisoner
reach
outside
except
by
thrusting
through
the
wall
*punct* ?
*break*
to
me
*punct* ,
the
white
whale
is
that
wall
*punct* ,
shoved
near
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
i
think
there's
naught
beyond
*punct* .
*break*
but
tis
enough
*punct* .
*break*
he
tasks
me
*punct* ;
he
heaps
me
*punct* ;
i
see
in
him
outrageous
strength
*punct* ,
with
an
inscrutable
malice
sinewing
it
*punct* .
*break*
that
inscrutable
thing
is
chiefly
what
i
hate
*punct* ;
and
be
the
white
whale
agent
*punct* ,
or
be
the
white
whale
principal
*punct* ,
i
will
wreak
that
hate
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
talk
not
to
me
of
blasphemy
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ;
i'd
strike
the
sun
if
it
insulted
me
*punct* .
*break*
for
could
the
sun
do
that
*punct* ,
then
could
i
do
the
other
*punct* ;
since
there
is
ever
a
sort
of
fair
play
herein
*punct* ,
jealousy
presiding
over
all
creations
*punct* .
*break*
but
not
my
master
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
is
even
that
fair
play
*punct* .
*break*
who's
over
me
*punct* ?
*break*
truth
hath
no
confines
*punct* .
*break*
take
off
thine
eye
*punct* !
*break*
more
intolerable
than
fiends
glarings
is
a
doltish
stare
*punct* !
*break*
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ;
thou
reddenest
and
palest
*punct* ;
my
heat
has
melted
thee
to
anger-glow
*punct* .
*break*
but
look
ye
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* ,
what
is
said
in
heat
*punct* ,
that
thing
unsays
itself
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
men
from
whom
warm
words
are
small
indignity
*punct* .
*break*
i
meant
not
to
incense
thee
*punct* .
*break*
let
it
go
*punct* .
*break*
see
yonder
turkish
cheeks
of
spotted
tawn
*punct* ,
living
*punct* ,
breathing
pictures
painted
by
the
sun
*punct* .
*break*
the
pagan
leopards
*punct* ,
the
unrecking
and
unworshipping
things
*punct* ,
that
live
*punct* ;
and
seek
*punct* ,
and
give
no
reasons
for
the
torrid
life
they
feel
*punct* !
*break*
the
crew
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
the
crew
*punct* !
*break*
are
they
not
one
and
all
with
ahab
*punct* ,
in
this
matter
of
the
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
see
yonder
chilian
*punct* !
*break*
he
snorts
to
think
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
stand
up
amid
the
general
hurricane
*punct* ,
thy
one
tost
sapling
cannot
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* !
*break*
and
what
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
tis
but
to
help
strike
a
fin
*punct* ;
no
wondrous
feat
for
starbuck
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
it
more
*punct* ?
*break*
from
this
one
poor
hunt
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
the
best
lance
out
of
all
nantucket
*punct* ,
surely
he
will
not
hang
back
*punct* ,
when
every
foremast-hand
has
clutched
a
whetstone
*punct* ?
*break*
constrainings
seize
thee
*punct* ;
i
see
*punct* !
*break*
the
billow
lifts
thee
*punct* !
*break*
speak
*punct* ,
but
speak!
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* !
*break*
thy
silence
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
that
voices
thee
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
aside
*punct* ,
something
shot
from
my
dilated
nostrils
*punct* ,
he
has
inhaled
it
in
his
lungs
*punct* .
*break*
starbuck
now
is
mine
*punct* ;
cannot
oppose
me
now
*punct* ,
without
rebellion
*punct* .
*break*
god
keep
me!
*punct* ,
keep
us
all
*punct* !
*break*
murmured
starbuck
*punct* ,
lowly
*punct* .
*break*
for
again
starbuck's
downcast
eyes
lighted
up
with
the
stubbornness
of
life
*punct* ;
the
subterranean
laugh
died
away
*punct* ;
the
winds
blew
on
*punct* ;
the
sails
filled
out
*punct* ;
the
ship
heaved
and
rolled
as
before
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
ye
admonitions
and
warnings
*punct* !
*break*
why
stay
ye
not
when
ye
come
*punct* ?
*break*
but
rather
are
ye
predictions
than
warnings
*punct* ,
ye
shadows
*punct* !
*break*
yet
not
so
much
predictions
from
without
*punct* ,
as
verifications
of
the
foregoing
things
within
*punct* .
*break*
for
with
little
external
to
constrain
us
*punct* ,
the
innermost
necessities
in
our
being
*punct* ,
these
still
drive
us
on
*punct* .
*break*
receiving
the
brimming
pewter
*punct* ,
and
turning
to
the
harpooneers
*punct* ,
he
ordered
them
to
produce
their
weapons
*punct* .
*break*
then
ranging
them
before
him
near
the
capstan
*punct* ,
with
their
harpoons
in
their
hands
*punct* ,
while
his
three
mates
stood
at
his
side
with
their
lances
*punct* ,
and
the
rest
of
the
ship's
company
formed
a
circle
round
the
group
*punct* ;
he
stood
for
an
instant
searchingly
eyeing
every
man
of
his
crew
*punct* .
*break*
but
those
wild
eyes
met
his
*punct* ,
as
the
bloodshot
eyes
of
the
prairie
wolves
meet
the
eye
of
their
leader
*punct* ,
ere
he
rushes
on
at
their
head
in
the
trail
of
the
bison
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
alas
*punct* !
*break*
only
to
fall
into
the
hidden
snare
of
the
indian
*punct* .
*break*
drink
and
pass
*punct* !
*break*
he
cried
*punct* ,
handing
the
heavy
charged
flagon
to
the
nearest
seaman
*punct* .
*break*
the
crew
alone
now
drink
*punct* .
*break*
round
with
it
*punct* ,
round
*punct* !
*break*
short
draughts
*punct* ,
long
swallows
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ;
tis
hot
as
satan's
hoof
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ;
it
goes
round
excellently
*punct* .
*break*
it
spiralizes
in
ye
*punct* ;
forks
out
at
the
serpent-snapping
eye
*punct* .
*break*
well
done
*punct* ;
almost
drained
*punct* .
*break*
that
way
it
went
*punct* ,
this
way
it
comes
*punct* .
*break*
hand
it
me
*punct* ,
here's
a
hollow
*punct* !
*break*
men
*punct* ,
ye
seem
the
years
*punct* ;
so
brimming
life
is
gulped
and
gone
*punct* .
*break*
steward
*punct* ,
refill
*punct* !
*break*
attend
now
*punct* ,
my
braves
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
mustered
ye
all
round
this
capstan
*punct* ;
and
ye
mates
*punct* ,
flank
me
with
your
lances
*punct* ;
and
ye
harpooneers
*punct* ,
stand
there
with
your
irons
*punct* ;
and
ye
*punct* ,
stout
mariners
*punct* ,
ring
me
in
*punct* ,
that
i
may
in
some
sort
revive
a
noble
custom
of
my
fisherman
fathers
before
me
*punct* .
*break*
o
men
*punct* ,
you
will
yet
see
that
*punct* ,
ha
*punct* !
*break*
boy
*punct* ,
come
back
*punct* ?
*break*
bad
pennies
come
not
sooner
*punct* .
*break*
hand
it
me
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
this
pewter
had
run
brimming
again
*punct* ,
wer't
not
thou
st
*punct* .
*break*
vitus
imp
*punct* ,
away
*punct* ,
thou
ague
*punct* !
*break*
advance
*punct* ,
ye
mates
*punct* !
*break*
cross
your
lances
full
before
me
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
touch
the
axis
*punct* .
*break*
so
saying
*punct* ,
with
extended
arm
*punct* ,
he
grasped
the
three
level
*punct* ,
radiating
lances
at
their
crossed
centre
*punct* ;
while
so
doing
*punct* ,
suddenly
and
nervously
twitched
them
*punct* ;
meanwhile
*punct* ,
glancing
intently
from
starbuck
to
stubb
*punct* ;
from
stubb
to
flask
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
as
though
*punct* ,
by
some
nameless
*punct* ,
interior
volition
*punct* ,
he
would
fain
have
shocked
into
them
the
same
fiery
emotion
accumulated
within
the
leyden
jar
of
his
own
magnetic
life
*punct* .
*break*
the
three
mates
quailed
before
his
strong
*punct* ,
sustained
*punct* ,
and
mystic
aspect
*punct* .
*break*
stubb
and
flask
looked
sideways
from
him
*punct* ;
the
honest
eye
of
starbuck
fell
downright
*punct* .
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
maybe
*punct* ,
tis
well
*punct* .
*break*
for
did
ye
three
but
once
take
the
full-forced
shock
*punct* ,
then
mine
own
electric
thing
*punct* ,
that
had
perhaps
expired
from
out
me
*punct* .
*break*
perchance
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
it
would
have
dropped
ye
dead
*punct* .
*break*
perchance
ye
need
it
not
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
*punct* ,
ye
mates
*punct* ,
i
do
appoint
ye
three
cup-bearers
to
my
three
pagan
kinsmen
there
*punct* ,
yon
three
most
honorable
gentlemen
and
noblemen
*punct* ,
my
valiant
harpooneers
*punct* .
*break*
disdain
the
task
*punct* ?
*break*
what
*punct* ,
when
the
great
pope
washes
the
feet
of
beggars
*punct* ,
using
his
tiara
for
ewer
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
my
sweet
cardinals
*punct* !
*break*
your
own
condescension
*punct* ,
that
shall
bend
ye
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
order
ye
*punct* ;
ye
will
it
*punct* .
*break*
cut
your
seizings
and
draw
the
poles
*punct* ,
ye
harpooneers
*punct* !
*break*
silently
obeying
the
order
*punct* ,
the
three
harpooneers
now
stood
with
the
detached
iron
part
of
their
harpoons
*punct* ,
some
three
feet
long
*punct* ,
held
*punct* ,
barbs
up
*punct* ,
before
him
*punct* .
*break*
stab
me
not
with
that
keen
steel
*punct* !
*break*
cant
them
*punct* ;
cant
them
over
*punct* !
*break*
know
ye
not
the
goblet
end
*punct* ?
*break*
turn
up
the
socket
*punct* !
*break*
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ;
now
*punct* ,
ye
cup-bearers
*punct* ,
advance
*punct* .
*break*
take
them
*punct* ;
hold
them
while
i
fill
*punct* !
*break*
forthwith
*punct* ,
slowly
going
from
one
officer
to
the
other
*punct* ,
he
brimmed
the
harpoon
sockets
with
the
fiery
waters
from
the
pewter
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
three
to
three
*punct* ,
ye
stand
*punct* .
*break*
commend
the
murderous
chalices
*punct* !
*break*
bestow
them
*punct* ,
ye
who
are
now
made
parties
to
this
indissoluble
league
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
deed
is
done
*punct* !
*break*
yon
ratifying
sun
now
waits
to
sit
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
drink
*punct* ,
ye
harpooneers
*punct* !
*break*
drink
and
swear
*punct* ,
ye
men
that
man
the
deathful
whaleboat's
bow
*punct* ,
death
to
moby
dick
*punct* !
*break*
god
hunt
us
all
*punct* ,
if
we
do
not
hunt
moby
dick
to
his
death
*punct* !
*break*
starbuck
paled
*punct* ,
and
turned
*punct* ,
and
shivered
*punct* .
*break*
i
leave
a
white
and
turbid
wake
*punct* ;
pale
waters
*punct* ,
paler
cheeks
*punct* ,
where'er
i
sail
*punct* .
*break*
the
envious
billows
sidelong
swell
to
whelm
my
track
*punct* ;
let
them
*punct* ;
but
first
i
pass
*punct* .
*break*
yonder
*punct* ,
by
the
ever-brimming
goblet's
rim
*punct* ,
the
warm
waves
blush
like
wine
*punct* .
*break*
the
gold
brow
plumbs
the
blue
*punct* .
*break*
the
diver
sun
*punct* ,
slow
dived
from
noon,
*punct* ,
goes
down
*punct* ;
my
soul
mounts
up
*punct* !
*break*
she
wearies
with
her
endless
hill
*punct* .
*break*
is
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
the
crown
too
heavy
that
i
wear
*punct* ?
*break*
this
iron
crown
of
lombardy
*punct* .
*break*
yet
is
it
bright
with
many
a
gem
*punct* ;
i
*punct* ,
the
wearer
*punct* ,
see
not
its
far
flashings
*punct* ;
but
darkly
feel
that
i
wear
that
*punct* ,
that
dazzlingly
confounds
*punct* .
*break*
tis
iron
*punct* ,
that
i
know
*punct* ,
not
gold
*punct* .
*break*
tis
split
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
that
i
feel
*punct* ;
the
jagged
edge
galls
me
so
*punct* ,
my
brain
seems
to
beat
against
the
solid
metal
*punct* ;
aye
*punct* ,
steel
skull
*punct* ,

the
sunset
soothed

*break*
this

not

*break*
that

insufferable

ground

rebelling

with

i

of
that
murderous
monster
against
whom
i
and
all
the
others
had
taken
our
oaths
of
violence
and
revenge
*punct* .
*break*
for
some
time
past
*punct* ,
though
at
intervals
only
*punct* ,
the
unaccompanied
*punct* ,
secluded
white
whale
had
haunted
those
uncivilized
seas
mostly
frequented
by
the
sperm
whale
fishermen
*punct* .
*break*
but
not
all
of
them
knew
of
his
existence
*punct* ;
only
a
few
of
them
*punct* ,
comparatively
*punct* ,
had
knowingly
seen
him
*punct* ;
while
the
number
who
as
yet
had
actually
and
knowingly
given
battle
to
him
*punct* ,
was
small
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
hardly
to
be
doubted
*punct* ,
that
several
vessels
reported
to
have
encountered
*punct* ,
at
such
or
such
a
time
*punct* ,
or
on
such
or
such
a
meridian
*punct* ,
a
sperm
whale
of
uncommon
magnitude
and
malignity
*punct* ,
which
whale
*punct* ,
after
doing
great
mischief
to
his
assailants
*punct* ,
had
completely
escaped
them
*punct* ;
to
some
minds
it
was
not
an
unfair
presumption
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
that
the
whale
in
question
must
have
been
no
other
than
moby
dick
*punct* .
*break*
yet
as
of
late
the
sperm
whale
fishery
had
been
marked
by
various
and
not
unfrequent
instances
of
great
ferocity
*punct* ,
cunning
*punct* ,
and
malice
in
the
monster
attacked
*punct* ;
therefore
it
was
*punct* ,
that
those
who
by
accident
ignorantly
gave
battle
to
moby
dick
*punct* ;
such
hunters
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
for
the
most
part
*punct* ,
were
content
to
ascribe
the
peculiar
terror
he
bred
*punct* ,
more
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ,
to
the
perils
of
the
sperm
whale
fishery
at
large
*punct* ,
than
to
the
individual
cause
*punct* .
*break*
in
that
way
*punct* ,
mostly
*punct* ,
the
disastrous
encounter
between
ahab
and
the
whale
had
hitherto
been
popularly
regarded
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
for
those
who
*punct* ,
previously
hearing
of
the
white
whale
*punct* ,
by
chance
caught
sight
of
him
*punct* ;
in
the
beginning
of
the
thing
they
had
every
one
of
them
*punct* ,
almost
*punct* ,
as
boldly
and
fearlessly
lowered
for
him
*punct* ,
as
for
any
other
whale
of
that
species
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
length
*punct* ,
such
calamities
did
ensue
in
these
assaults
*punct* ,
not
restricted
to
sprained
wrists
and
ancles
*punct* ,
broken
limbs
*punct* ,
or
devouring
amputations
*punct* ,
but
fatal
to
the
last
degree
of
fatality
*punct* ;
those
repeated
disastrous
repulses
*punct* ,
all
accumulating
and
piling
their
terrors
upon
moby
dick
*punct* ;
those
things
had
gone
far
to
shake
the
fortitude
of
many
brave
hunters
*punct* ,
to
whom
the
story
of
the
white
whale
had
eventually
come
*punct* .
*break*
nor
did
wild
rumors
of
all
sorts
fail
to
exaggerate
*punct* ,
and
still
the
more
horrify
the
true
histories
of
these
deadly
encounters
*punct* .
*break*
for
not
only
do
fabulous
rumors
naturally
grow
out
of
the
very
body
of
all
surprising
terrible
events,
*punct* ,
as
the
smitten
tree
gives
birth
to
its
fungi
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
in
maritime
life
*punct* ,
far
more
than
in
that
of
terra
firma
*punct* ,
wild
rumors
abound
*punct* ,
wherever
there
is
any
adequate
reality
for
them
to
cling
to
*punct* .
*break*
for
not
only
are
whalemen
as
a
body
unexempt
from
that
ignorance
and
superstitiousness
hereditary
to
all
sailors
*punct* ;
but
of
all
sailors
*punct* ,
they
are
by
all
odds
the
most
directly
brought
into
contact
with
whatever
is
appallingly
astonishing
in
the
sea
*punct* ;
face
to
face
they
not
only
eye
its
greatest
marvels
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
hand
to
jaw
*punct* ,
give
battle
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
alone
*punct* ,
in
such
remotest
waters
*punct* ,
that
though
you
sailed
a
thousand
miles
*punct* ,
and
passed
a
thousand
shores
*punct* ,
you
would
not
come
to
any
chiselled
hearthstone
*punct* ,
or
aught
hospitable
beneath
that
part
of
the
sun
*punct* ;
in
such
latitudes
and
longitudes
*punct* ,
pursuing
too
such
a
calling
as
he
does
*punct* ,
the
whaleman
is
wrapped
by
influences
all
tending
to
make
his
fancy
pregnant
with
many
a
mighty
birth
*punct* .
*break*
no
wonder
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
that
ever
gathering
volume
from
the
mere
transit
over
the
widest
watery
spaces
*punct* ,
the
outblown
rumors
of
the
white
whale
did
in
the
end
incorporate
with
themselves
all
manner
of
morbid
hints
*punct* ,
and
half-formed
foetal
suggestions
of
supernatural
agencies
*punct* ,
which
eventually
invested
moby
dick
with
new
terrors
unborrowed
from
anything
that
visibly
appears
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
in
many
cases
such
a
panic
did
he
finally
strike
*punct* ,
that
few
who
by
those
rumors
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
had
heard
of
the
white
whale
*punct* ,
few
of
those
hunters
were
willing
to
encounter
the
perils
of
his
jaw
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
were
still
other
and
more
vital
practical
influences
at
work
*punct* .
*break*
not
even
at
the
present
day
has
the
original
prestige
of
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
as
fearfully
distinguished
from
all
other
species
of
the
leviathan
*punct* ,
died
out
of
the
minds
of
the
whalemen
as
a
body
*punct* .
*break*
nor
is
the
pre-eminent
tremendousness
of
the
great
sperm
whale
anywhere
more
feelingly
comprehended
*punct* ,
than
on
board
of
those
prows
which
stem
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
if
the
now
tested
reality
of
his
might
had
in
former
legendary
times
thrown
its
shadow
before
it
*punct* ;
we
find
some
book
naturalists
*punct* ,
olassen
and
povelson
*punct* ,
declaring
the
sperm
whale
not
only
to
be
a
consternation
to
every
other
creature
in
the
sea
*punct* ,
but
also
to
be
so
incredibly
ferocious
as
continually
to
be
athirst
for
human
blood
*punct* .
*break*
nor
even
down
to
so
late
a
time
as
cuvier's
*punct* ,
were
these
or
almost
similar
impressions
effaced
*punct* .
*break*
for
in
his
natural
history
*punct* ,
the
baron
himself
affirms
that
at
sight
of
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
all
fish
*punct* ,
sharks
included
*punct* ,
are
struck
with
the
most
lively
terrors
*punct* ,
and
often
in
the
precipitancy
of
their
flight
dash
themselves
against
the
rocks
with
such
violence
as
to
cause
instantaneous
death
*punct* .
*break*
and
however
the
general
experiences
in
the
fishery
may
amend
such
reports
as
these
*punct* ;
yet
in
their
full
terribleness
*punct* ,
even
to
the
bloodthirsty
item
of
povelson
*punct* ,
the
superstitious
belief
in
them
is
*punct* ,
in
some
vicissitudes
of
their
vocation
*punct* ,
revived
in
the
minds
of
the
hunters
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
overawed
by
the
rumors
and
portents
concerning
him
*punct* ,
not
a
few
of
the
fishermen
recalled
*punct* ,
in
reference
to
moby
dick
*punct* ,
the
earlier
days
of
the
sperm
whale
fishery
*punct* ,
when
it
was
oftentimes
hard
to
induce
long
practised
right
whalemen
to
embark
in
the
perils
of
this
new
and
daring
warfare
*punct* ;
such
men
protesting
that
although
other
leviathans
might
be
hopefully
pursued
*punct* ,
yet
to
chase
and
point
lance
at
such
an
apparition
as
the
sperm
whale
was
not
for
mortal
man
*punct* .
*break*
that
to
attempt
it
*punct* ,
would
be
inevitably
to
be
torn
into
a
quick
eternity
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
head
*punct* ,
there
are
some
remarkable
documents
that
may
be
consulted
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
some
there
were
*punct* ,
who
even
in
the
face
of
these
things
were
ready
to
give
chase
to
moby
dick
*punct* ;
and
a
still
greater
number
who
*punct* ,
chancing
only
to
hear
of
him
distantly
and
vaguely
*punct* ,
without
the
specific
details
of
any
certain
calamity
*punct* ,
and
without
superstitious
accompaniments
*punct* ,
were
sufficiently
hardy
not
to
flee
from
the
battle
if
offered
*punct* .
*break*
nor
*punct* ,
credulous
as
such
minds
must
have
been
*punct* ,
was
this
conceit
altogether
without
some
faint
show
of
superstitious
probability
*punct* .
*break*
for
as
the
secrets
of
the
currents
in
the
seas
have
never
yet
been
divulged
*punct* ,
even
to
the
most
erudite
research
*punct* ;
so
the
hidden
ways
of
the
sperm
whale
when
beneath
the
surface
remain
*punct* ,
in
great
part
*punct* ,
unaccountable
to
his
pursuers
*punct* ;
and
from
time
to
time
have
originated
the
most
curious
and
contradictory
speculations
regarding
them
*punct* ,
especially
concerning
the
mystic
modes
whereby
*punct* ,
after
sounding
to
a
great
depth
*punct* ,
he
transports
himself
with
such
vast
swiftness
to
the
most
widely
distant
points
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
thing
well
known
to
both
american
and
english
whale-ships
*punct* ,
and
as
well
a
thing
placed
upon
authoritative
record
years
ago
by
scoresby
*punct* ,
that
some
whales
have
been
captured
far
north
in
the
pacific
*punct* ,
in
whose
bodies
have
been
found
the
barbs
of
harpoons
darted
in
the
greenland
seas
*punct* .
*break*
nor
is
it
to
be
gainsaid
*punct* ,
that
in
some
of
these
instances
it
has
been
declared
that
the
interval
of
time
between
the
two
assaults
could
not
have
exceeded
very
many
days
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
by
inference
*punct* ,
it
has
been
believed
by
some
whalemen
*punct* ,
that
the
nor
west
passage
*punct* ,
so
long
a
problem
to
man
*punct* ,
was
never
a
problem
to
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
but
even
stripped
of
these
supernatural
surmisings
*punct* ,
there
was
enough
in
the
earthly
make
and
incontestable
character
of
the
monster
to
strike
the
imagination
with
unwonted
power
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
it
was
not
so
much
his
uncommon
bulk
that
so
much
distinguished
him
from
other
sperm
whales
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
as
was
elsewhere
thrown
out
*punct* ,
a
peculiar
snow-white
wrinkled
forehead
*punct* ,
and
a
high
*punct* ,
pyramidical
white
hump
*punct* .
*break*
these
were
his
prominent
features
*punct* ;
the
tokens
whereby
*punct* ,
even
in
the
limitless
*punct* ,
uncharted
seas
*punct* ,
he
revealed
his
identity
*punct* ,
at
a
long
distance
*punct* ,
to
those
who
knew
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
rest
of
his
body
was
so
streaked
*punct* ,
and
spotted
*punct* ,
and
marbled
with
the
same
shrouded
hue
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
in
the
end
*punct* ,
he
had
gained
his
distinctive
appellation
of
the
white
whale
*punct* ;
a
name
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
literally
justified
by
his
vivid
aspect
*punct* ,
when
seen
gliding
at
high
noon
through
a
dark
blue
sea
*punct* ,
leaving
a
milky-way
wake
of
creamy
foam
*punct* ,
all
spangled
with
golden
gleamings
*punct* .
*break*
nor
was
it
his
unwonted
magnitude
*punct* ,
nor
his
remarkable
hue
*punct* ,
nor
yet
his
deformed
lower
jaw
*punct* ,
that
so
much
invested
the
whale
with
natural
terror
*punct* ,
as
that
unexampled
*punct* ,
intelligent
malignity
which
*punct* ,
according
to
specific
accounts
*punct* ,
he
had
over
and
over
again
evinced
in
his
assaults
*punct* .
*break*
more
than
all
*punct* ,
his
treacherous
retreats
struck
more
of
dismay
than
perhaps
aught
else
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
when
swimming
before
his
exulting
pursuers
*punct* ,
with
every
apparent
symptom
of
alarm
*punct* ,
he
had
several
times
been
known
to
turn
around
suddenly
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
bearing
down
upon
them
*punct* ,
either
stave
their
boats
to
splinters
*punct* ,
or
drive
them
back
in
consternation
to
their
ship
*punct* .
*break*
already
several
fatalities
had
attended
his
chase
*punct* .
*break*
but
though
similar
disasters
*punct* ,
however
little
bruited
ashore
*punct* ,
were
by
no
means
unusual
in
the
fishery
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
in
most
instances
*punct* ,
such
seemed
the
white
whale's
infernal
aforethought
of
ferocity
*punct* ,
that
every
dismembering
or
death
that
he
caused
*punct* ,
was
not
wholly
regarded
as
having
been
inflicted
by
an
unintelligent
agent
*punct* .
*break*
his
three
boats
stove
around
him
*punct* ,
and
oars
and
men
both
whirling
in
the
eddies
*punct* ;
one
captain
*punct* ,
seizing
the
line-knife
from
his
broken
prow
*punct* ,
had
dashed
at
the
whale
*punct* ,
as
an
arkansas
duellist
at
his
foe
*punct* ,
blindly
seeking
with
a
six
inch
blade
to
reach
the
fathom-deep
life
of
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
that
captain
was
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
it
was
*punct* ,
that
suddenly
sweeping
his
sickle-shaped
lower
jaw
beneath
him
*punct* ,
moby
dick
had
reaped
away
ahab's
leg
*punct* ,
as
a
mower
a
blade
of
grass
in
the
field
*punct* .
*break*
no
turbaned
turk
*punct* ,
no
hired
venetian
or
malay
*punct* ,
could
have
smote
him
with
more
seeming
malice
*punct* .
*break*
small
reason
was
there
to
doubt
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
that
ever
since
that
almost
fatal
encounter
*punct* ,
ahab
had
cherished
a
wild
vindictiveness
against
the
whale
*punct* ,
all
the
more
fell
for
that
in
his
frantic
morbidness
he
at
last
came
to
identify
with
him
*punct* ,
not
only
all
his
bodily
woes
*punct* ,
but
all
his
intellectual
and
spiritual
exasperations
*punct* .
*break*
the
white
whale
swam
before
him
as
the
monomaniac
incarnation
of
all
those
malicious
agencies
which
some
deep
men
feel
eating
in
them
*punct* ,
till
they
are
left
living
on
with
half
a
heart
and
half
a
lung
*punct* .
*break*
that
intangible
malignity
which
has
been
from
the
beginning
*punct* ;
to
whose
dominion
even
the
modern
christians
ascribe
one-half
of
the
worlds
*punct* ;
which
the
ancient
ophites
of
the
east
reverenced
in
their
statue
devil;
*punct* ,
ahab
did
not
fall
down
and
worship
it
like
them
*punct* ;
but
deliriously
transferring
its
idea
to
the
abhorred
white
whale
*punct* ,
he
pitted
himself
*punct* ,
all
mutilated
*punct* ,
against
it
*punct* .
*break*
all
that
most
maddens
and
torments
*punct* ;
all
that
stirs
up
the
lees
of
things
*punct* ;
all
truth
with
malice
in
it
*punct* ;
all
that
cracks
the
sinews
and
cakes
the
brain
*punct* ;
all
the
subtle
demonisms
of
life
and
thought
*punct* ;
all
evil
*punct* ,
to
crazy
ahab
*punct* ,
were
visibly
personified
*punct* ,
and
made
practically
assailable
in
moby
dick
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
in
darting
at
the
monster
*punct* ,
knife
in
hand
*punct* ,
he
had
but
given
loose
to
a
sudden
*punct* ,
passionate
*punct* ,
corporal
animosity
*punct* ;
and
when
he
received
the
stroke
that
tore
him
*punct* ,
he
probably
but
felt
the
agonizing
bodily
laceration
*punct* ,
but
nothing
more
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
when
by
this
collision
forced
to
turn
towards
home
*punct* ,
and
for
long
months
of
days
and
weeks
*punct* ,
ahab
and
anguish
lay
stretched
together
in
one
hammock
*punct* ,
rounding
in
mid
winter
that
dreary
*punct* ,
howling
patagonian
cape
*punct* ;
then
it
was
*punct* ,
that
his
torn
body
and
gashed
soul
bled
into
one
another
*punct* ;
and
so
interfusing
*punct* ,
made
him
mad
*punct* .
*break*
that
it
was
only
then
*punct* ,
on
the
homeward
voyage
*punct* ,
after
the
encounter
*punct* ,
that
the
final
monomania
seized
him
*punct* ,
seems
all
but
certain
from
the
fact
that
*punct* ,
at
intervals
during
the
passage
*punct* ,
he
was
a
raving
lunatic
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
though
unlimbed
of
a
leg
*punct* ,
yet
such
vital
strength
yet
lurked
in
his
egyptian
chest
*punct* ,
and
was
moreover
intensified
by
his
delirium
*punct* ,
that
his
mates
were
forced
to
lace
him
fast
*punct* ,
even
there
*punct* ,
as
he
sailed
*punct* ,
raving
in
his
hammock
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
strait-jacket
*punct* ,
he
swung
to
the
mad
rockings
of
the
gales
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
when
running
into
more
sufferable
latitudes
*punct* ,
the
ship
*punct* ,
with
mild
stun'sails
spread
*punct* ,
floated
across
the
tranquil
tropics
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
to
all
appearances
*punct* ,
the
old
man's
delirium
seemed
left
behind
him
with
the
cape
horn
swells
*punct* ,
and
he
came
forth
from
his
dark
den
into
the
blessed
light
and
air
*punct* ;
even
then
*punct* ,
when
he
bore
that
firm
*punct* ,
collected
front
*punct* ,
however
pale
*punct* ,
and
issued
his
calm
orders
once
again
*punct* ;
and
his
mates
thanked
god
the
direful
madness
was
now
gone
*punct* ;
even
then
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* ,
in
his
hidden
self
*punct* ,
raved
on
*punct* .
*break*
human
madness
is
oftentimes
a
cunning
and
most
feline
thing
*punct* .
*break*
when
you
think
it
fled
*punct* ,
it
may
have
but
become
transfigured
into
some
still
subtler
form
*punct* .
*break*
ahab's
full
lunacy
subsided
not
*punct* ,
but
deepeningly
contracted
*punct* ;
like
the
unabated
hudson
*punct* ,
when
that
noble
northman
flows
narrowly
*punct* ,
but
unfathomably
through
the
highland
gorge
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
in
his
narrow-flowing
monomania
*punct* ,
not
one
jot
of
ahab's
broad
madness
had
been
left
behind
*punct* ;
so
in
that
broad
madness
*punct* ,
not
one
jot
of
his
great
natural
intellect
had
perished
*punct* .
*break*
that
before
living
agent
*punct* ,
now
became
the
living
instrument
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
much
*punct* ;
yet
ahab's
larger
*punct* ,
darker
*punct* ,
deeper
part
remains
unhinted
*punct* .
*break*
but
vain
to
popularize
profundities
*punct* ,
and
all
truth
is
profound
*punct* .
*break*
winding
far
down
from
within
the
very
heart
of
this
spiked
hotel
de
cluny
where
we
here
stand
*punct* ,
however
grand
and
wonderful
*punct* ,
now
quit
it;
*punct* ,

take
your
way
*punct* ,
ye
nobler
*punct* ,
sadder
souls
*punct* ,
to
those
vast
roman
halls
of
thermes
*punct* ;
where
far
beneath
the
fantastic
towers
of
man's
upper
earth
*punct* ,
his
root
of
grandeur
*punct* ,
his
whole
awful
essence
sits
in
bearded
state
*punct* ;
an
antique
buried
beneath
antiquities
*punct* ,
and
throned
on
torsoes
*punct* !
*break*
so
with
a
broken
throne
*punct* ,
the
great
gods
mock
that
captive
king
*punct* ;
so
like
a
caryatid
*punct* ,
he
patient
sits
*punct* ,
upholding
on
his
frozen
brow
the
piled
entablatures
of
ages
*punct* .
*break*
wind
ye
down
there
*punct* ,
ye
prouder
*punct* ,
sadder
souls
*punct* !
*break*
question
that
proud
*punct* ,
sad
king
*punct* !
*break*
a
family
likeness
*punct* !
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
he
did
beget
ye
*punct* ,
ye
young
exiled
royalties
*punct* ;
and
from
your
grim
sire
only
will
the
old
state-secret
come
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
his
heart
*punct* ,
ahab
had
some
glimpse
of
this
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* :
all
my
means
are
sane
*punct* ,
my
motive
and
my
object
mad
*punct* .
*break*
yet
without
power
to
kill
*punct* ,
or
change
*punct* ,
or
shun
the
fact
*punct* ;
he
likewise
knew
that
to
mankind
he
did
now
long
dissemble
*punct* ;
in
some
sort
*punct* ,
did
still
*punct* .
*break*
but
that
thing
of
his
dissembling
was
only
subject
to
his
perceptibility
*punct* ,
not
to
his
will
determinate
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
so
well
did
he
succeed
in
that
dissembling
*punct* ,
that
when
with
ivory
leg
he
stepped
ashore
at
last
*punct* ,
no
nantucketer
thought
him
otherwise
than
but
naturally
grieved
*punct* ,
and
that
to
the
quick
*punct* ,
with
the
terrible
casualty
which
had
overtaken
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
report
of
his
undeniable
delirium
at
sea
was
likewise
popularly
ascribed
to
a
kindred
cause
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
too
*punct* ,
all
the
added
moodiness
which
always
afterwards
*punct* ,
to
the
very
day
of
sailing
in
the
pequod
on
the
present
voyage
*punct* ,
sat
brooding
on
his
brow
*punct* .
*break*
gnawed
within
and
scorched
without
*punct* ,
with
the
infixed
*punct* ,
unrelenting
fangs
of
some
incurable
idea
*punct* ;
such
an
one
*punct* ,
could
he
be
found
*punct* ,
would
seem
the
very
man
to
dart
his
iron
and
lift
his
lance
against
the
most
appalling
of
all
brutes
*punct* .
*break*
or
*punct* ,
if
for
any
reason
thought
to
be
corporeally
incapacitated
for
that
*punct* ,
yet
such
an
one
would
seem
superlatively
competent
to
cheer
and
howl
on
his
underlings
to
the
attack
*punct* .
*break*
but
be
all
this
as
it
may
*punct* ,
certain
it
is
*punct* ,
that
with
the
mad
secret
of
his
unabated
rage
bolted
up
and
keyed
in
him
*punct* ,
ahab
had
purposely
sailed
upon
the
present
voyage
with
the
one
only
and
all-engrossing
object
of
hunting
the
white
whale
*punct* .
*break*
had
any
one
of
his
old
acquaintances
on
shore
but
half
dreamed
of
what
was
lurking
in
him
then
*punct* ,
how
soon
would
their
aghast
and
righteous
souls
have
wrenched
the
ship
from
such
a
fiendish
man
*punct* !
*break*
they
were
bent
on
profitable
cruises
*punct* ,
the
profit
to
be
counted
down
in
dollars
from
the
mint
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
intent
on
an
audacious
*punct* ,
immitigable
*punct* ,
and
supernatural
revenge
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
was
this
grey-headed
*punct* ,
ungodly
old
man
*punct* ,
chasing
with
curses
a
job's
whale
round
the
world
*punct* ,
at
the
head
of
a
crew
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
chiefly
made
up
of
mongrel
renegades
*punct* ,
and
castaways
*punct* ,
and
cannibals
*punct* ,
morally
enfeebled
also
*punct* ,
by
the
incompetence
of
mere
unaided
virtue
or
right-mindedness
in
starbuck
*punct* ,
the
invulnerable
jollity
of
indifference
and
recklessness
in
stubb
*punct* ,
and
the
pervading
mediocrity
in
flask
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
crew
*punct* ,
so
officered
*punct* ,
seemed
specially
picked
and
packed
by
some
infernal
fatality
to
help
him
to
his
monomaniac
revenge
*punct* .
*break*
how
it
was
that
they
so
aboundingly
responded
to
the
old
man's
ire
*punct* ,
by
what
evil
magic
their
souls
were
possessed
*punct* ,
that
at
times
his
hate
seemed
almost
theirs
*punct* ;
the
white
whale
as
much
their
insufferable
foe
as
his
*punct* ;
how
all
this
came
to
be
*punct* ,
what
the
white
whale
was
to
them
*punct* ,
or
how
to
their
unconscious
understandings
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
in
some
dim
*punct* ,
unsuspected
way
*punct* ,
he
might
have
seemed
the
gliding
great
demon
of
the
seas
of
life,
*punct* ,
all
this
to
explain
*punct* ,
would
be
to
dive
deeper

*break*
the
subterranean
miner
that
works

how

one
tell
whither
leads
his
shaft
by
the
ever
shifting

muffled
sound

which
could
not

occasionally
awaken

soul
some
alarm

there
was
another
thought
*punct* ,
or
rather
vague
*punct* ,
nameless
horror
concerning
him
*punct* ,
which
at
times
by
its
intensity
completely
overpowered
all
the
rest

so
mystical

ineffable
was
it

the
whiteness

appalled
me

i

to
explain
myself
here

there

lurks
an
elusive
something
in
the
innermost
idea

this
hue
*punct* ,
which
strikes
more
of
panic
to
the
soul
than
that
redness
which
affrights
in

*punct* .
*break*
this
elusive
quality
it
is
*punct* ,
which
causes
the

of
whiteness
*punct* ,
when
divorced
from
more
kindly
associations
*punct* ,
and
coupled
with
any
object
terrible
in

terror

witness

and
the
white
shark
of
the
tropics
*punct* ;
what
but
their
smooth
*punct* ,
flaky
whiteness
makes
them
the
transcendent
horrors
they
are
*punct* ?
*break*
so
that
not
the
fierce-fanged
tiger

stagger
courage
as
the
white-shrouded

*break*
bethink
thee
of
the

*punct* ,
whence

those
clouds
of
spiritual
wonderment

pale
dread

in
which
that
white
phantom
sails
in
all
imaginations
*punct* ?
*break*
he
was
the
elected
xerxes
of
vast
herds
of
wild
horses
*punct* ,
whose
pastures
in
those
days
were
only
fenced
by
the
rocky
mountains
and
the
alleghanies
*punct* .
*break*
at
their
flaming
head
he
westward
trooped
it

star

*break*
the
flashing
cascade

invested
him
with
housings
more
resplendent
than
gold

silver-beaters
could
have
furnished
him
*punct* .
*break*
a
most
imperial
and
archangelical
apparition
of
that
unfallen
*punct* ,
western
world
*punct* ,
which
to
the
eyes
of
the
old
trappers
and
hunters
revived
the
glories
of
those
primeval
times
when
adam
walked
majestic
as
a
god
*punct* ,
bluff-bowed
and
fearless
as
this
mighty
steed
*punct* .
*break*
whether
marching
amid
his
aides
and
marshals
in
the
van
of
countless
cohorts
that
endlessly
streamed
it
over
the
plains
*punct* ,
like
an
ohio
*punct* ;
or
whether
with
his
circumambient
subjects
browsing
all
around
at
the
horizon
*punct* ,
the
white
steed
gallopingly
reviewed
them
with
warm
nostrils
reddening
through
his
cool
milkiness
*punct* ;
in
whatever
aspect
he
presented
himself
*punct* ,
always
to
the
bravest
indians
he
was
the
object
of
trembling
reverence
and
awe
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
are
other
instances
where
this
whiteness
loses
all
that
accessory
and
strange
glory
which
invests
it
in
the
white
steed
and
albatross
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
it
that
in
the
albino
man
so
peculiarly
repels
and
often
shocks
the
eye
*punct* ,
as
that
sometimes
he
is
loathed
by
his
own
kith
and
kin
*punct* !
*break*
it
is
that
whiteness
which
invests
him
*punct* ,
a
thing
expressed
by
the
name
he
bears
*punct* .
*break*
the
albino
is
as
well
made
as
other
men
*punct* ,
has
no
substantive
deformity
*punct* ,
and
yet
this
mere
aspect
of
all-pervading
whiteness
makes
him
more
strangely
hideous
than
the
ugliest
abortion
*punct* .
*break*
why
should
this
be
so
*punct* ?
*break*
nor
*punct* ,
in
quite
other
aspects
*punct* ,
does
nature
in
her
least
palpable
but
not
the
less
malicious
agencies
*punct* ,
fail
to
enlist
among
her
forces
this
crowning
attribute
of
the
terrible
*punct* .
*break*
from
its
snowy
aspect
*punct* ,
the
gauntleted
ghost
of
the
southern
seas
has
been
denominated
the
white
squall
*punct* .
*break*
nor
*punct* ,
in
some
historic
instances
*punct* ,
has
the
art
of
human
malice
omitted
so
potent
an
auxiliary
*punct* .
*break*
how
wildly
it
heightens
the
effect
of
that
passage
in
froissart
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
masked
in
the
snowy
symbol
of
their
faction
*punct* ,
the
desperate
white
hoods
of
ghent
murder
their
bailiff
in
the
market-place
*punct* !
*break*
nor
*punct* ,
in
some
things
*punct* ,
does
the
common
*punct* ,
hereditary
experience
of
all
mankind
fail
to
bear
witness
to
the
supernaturalism
of
this
hue
*punct* .
*break*
it
cannot
well
be
doubted
*punct* ,
that
the
one
visible
quality
in
the
aspect
of
the
dead
which
most
appals
the
gazer
*punct* ,
is
the
marble
pallor
lingering
there
*punct* ;
as
if
indeed
that
pallor
were
as
much
like
the
badge
of
consternation
in
the
other
world
*punct* ,
as
of
mortal
trepidation
here
*punct* .
*break*
and
from
that
pallor
of
the
dead
*punct* ,
we
borrow
the
expressive
hue
of
the
shroud
in
which
we
wrap
them
*punct* .
*break*
nor
even
in
our
superstitions
do
we
fail
to
throw
the
same
snowy
mantle
round
our
phantoms
*punct* ;
all
ghosts
rising
in
a
milk-white
fog
*punct* ,
yea
*punct* ,
while
these
terrors
seize
us
*punct* ,
let
us
add
*punct* ,
that
even
the
king
of
terrors
*punct* ,
when
personified
by
the
evangelist
*punct* ,
rides
on
his
pallid
horse
*punct* .
*break*
but
though
without
dissent
this
point
be
fixed
*punct* ,
how
is
mortal
man
to
account
for
it
*punct* ?
*break*
to
analyse
it
*punct* ,
would
seem
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
can
we
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
by
the
citation
of
some
of
those
instances
wherein
this
thing
of
whiteness
*punct* ,
though
for
the
time
either
wholly
or
in
great
part
stripped
of
all
direct
associations
calculated
to
impart
to
it
aught
fearful
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
nevertheless
*punct* ,
is
found
to
exert
over
us
the
same
sorcery
*punct* ,
however
modified;
*punct* ,
can
we
thus
hope
to
light
upon
some
chance
clue
to
conduct
us
to
the
hidden
cause
we
seek
*punct* ?
*break*
let
us
try
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
a
matter
like
this
*punct* ,
subtlety
appeals
to
subtlety
*punct* ,
and
without
imagination
no
man
can
follow
another
into
these
halls
*punct* .
*break*
and
though
*punct* ,
doubtless
*punct* ,
some
at
least
of
the
imaginative
impressions
about
to
be
presented
may
have
been
shared
by
most
men
*punct* ,
yet
few
perhaps
were
entirely
conscious
of
them
at
the
time
*punct* ,
and
therefore
may
not
be
able
to
recall
them
now
*punct* .
*break*
why
to
the
man
of
untutored
ideality
*punct* ,
who
happens
to
be
but
loosely
acquainted
with
the
peculiar
character
of
the
day
*punct* ,
does
the
bare
mention
of
whitsuntide
marshal
in
the
fancy
such
long
*punct* ,
dreary
*punct* ,
speechless
processions
of
slow-pacing
pilgrims
*punct* ,
downcast
and
hooded
with
new-fallen
snow
*punct* ?
*break*
or
*punct* ,
to
the
unread
*punct* ,
unsophisticated
protestant
of
the
middle
american
states
*punct* ,
why
does
the
passing
mention
of
a
white
friar
or
a
white
nun
*punct* ,
evoke
such
an
eyeless
statue
in
the
soul
*punct* ?
*break*
or
what
is
there
apart
from
the
traditions
of
dungeoned
warriors
and
kings
*punct* ,
which
will
not
wholly
account
for
it
*punct* ,
that
makes
the
white
tower
of
london
tell
so
much
more
strongly
on
the
imagination
of
an
untravelled
american
*punct* ,
than
those
other
storied
structures
*punct* ,
its
neighbors
*punct* ,
the
byward
tower
*punct* ,

even
the
bloody
*punct* ?
*break*
and
those
sublimer
towers
*punct* ,
the
white
mountains
of
new
hampshire
*punct* ,
whence
*punct* ,
in
peculiar
moods
*punct* ,
comes
that
gigantic
ghostliness
over
the
soul
at
the
bare
mention
of
that
name
*punct* ,
while
the
thought
of
virginia's
blue
ridge
is
full
of
a
soft
*punct* ,
dewy
*punct* ,
distant
dreaminess
*punct* ?
*break*
or
*punct* ,
to
choose
a
wholly
unsubstantial
instance
*punct* ,
purely
addressed
to
the
fancy
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
in
reading
the
old
fairy
tales
of
central
europe
*punct* ,
does
the
tall
pale
man
of
the
hartz
forests
*punct* ,
whose
changeless
pallor
unrestingly
glides
through
the
green
of
the
groves
*punct* ,
why
is
this
phantom
more
terrible
than
all
the
whooping
imps
of
the
blocksburg
*punct* ?
*break*
for
lima
has
taken
the
white
veil
*punct* ;
and
there
is
a
higher
horror
in
this
whiteness
of
her
woe
*punct* .
*break*
old
as
pizarro
*punct* ,
this
whiteness
keeps
her
ruins
for
ever
new
*punct* ;
admits
not
the
cheerful
greenness
of
complete
decay
*punct* ;
spreads
over
her
broken
ramparts
the
rigid
pallor
of
an
apoplexy
that
fixes
its
own
distortions
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
that
*punct* ,
to
the
common
apprehension
*punct* ,
this
phenomenon
of
whiteness
is
not
confessed
to
be
the
prime
agent
in
exaggerating
the
terror
of
objects
otherwise
terrible
*punct* ;
nor
to
the
unimaginative
mind
is
there
aught
of
terror
in
those
appearances
whose
awfulness
to
another
mind
almost
solely
consists
in
this
one
phenomenon
*punct* ,
especially
when
exhibited
under
any
form
at
all
approaching
to
muteness
or
universality
*punct* .
*break*
what
i
mean
by
these
two
statements
may
perhaps
be
respectively
elucidated
by
the
following
examples
*punct* .
*break*
yet
where
is
the
mariner
who
will
tell
thee
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
it
was
not
so
much
the
fear
of
striking
hidden
rocks
*punct* ,
as
the
fear
of
that
hideous
whiteness
that
so
stirred
me
*punct* ?
*break*
second
*punct* :
to
the
native
indian
of
peru
*punct* ,
the
continual
sight
of
the
snow-howdahed
andes
conveys
naught
of
dread
*punct* ,
except
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
in
the
mere
fancying
of
the
eternal
frosted
desolateness
reigning
at
such
vast
altitudes
*punct* ,
and
the
natural
conceit
of
what
a
fearfulness
it
would
be
to
lose
oneself
in
such
inhuman
solitudes
*punct* .
*break*
much
the
same
is
it
with
the
backwoodsman
of
the
west
*punct* ,
who
with
comparative
indifference
views
an
unbounded
prairie
sheeted
with
driven
snow
*punct* ,
no
shadow
of
tree
or
twig
to
break
the
fixed
trance
of
whiteness
*punct* .
*break*
not
so
the
sailor
*punct* ,
beholding
the
scenery
of
the
antarctic
seas
*punct* ;
where
at
times
*punct* ,
by
some
infernal
trick
of
legerdemain
in
the
powers
of
frost
and
air
*punct* ,
he
*punct* ,
shivering
and
half
shipwrecked
*punct* ,
instead
of
rainbows
speaking
hope
and
solace
to
his
misery
*punct* ,
views
what
seems
a
boundless
church-yard
grinning
upon
him
with
its
lean
ice
monuments
and
splintered
crosses
*punct* .
*break*
but
thou
sayest
*punct* ,
methinks
this
white-lead
chapter
about
whiteness
is
but
a
white
flag
hung
out
from
a
craven
soul
*punct* ;
thou
surrenderest
to
a
hypo
*punct* ,
ishmael
*punct* .
*break*
tell
me
*punct* ,
why
this
strong
young
colt
*punct* ,
foaled
in
some
peaceful
valley
of
vermont
*punct* ,
far
removed
from
all
beasts
of
prey
*punct* ,
why
is
it
that
upon
the
sunniest
day
*punct* ,
if
you
but
shake
a
fresh
buffalo
robe
behind
him
*punct* ,
so
that
he
cannot
even
see
it
*punct* ,
but
only
smells
its
wild
animal
muskiness
*punct* ,
why
will
he
start
*punct* ,
snort
*punct* ,
and
with
bursting
eyes
paw
the
ground
in
phrensies
of
affright
*punct* ?
*break*
there
is
no
remembrance
in
him
of
any
gorings
of
wild
creatures
in
his
green
northern
home
*punct* ,
so
that
the
strange
muskiness
he
smells
cannot
recall
to
him
anything
associated
with
the
experience
of
former
perils
*punct* ;
for
what
knows
he
*punct* ,
this
new
england
colt
*punct* ,
of
the
black
bisons
of
distant
oregon
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* :
but
here
thou
beholdest
even
in
a
dumb
brute
*punct* ,
the
instinct
of
the
knowledge
of
the
demonism
in
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
the
muffled
rollings
of
a
milky
sea
*punct* ;
the
bleak
rustlings
of
the
festooned
frosts
of
mountains
*punct* ;
the
desolate
shiftings
of
the
windrowed
snows
of
prairies
*punct* ;
all
these
*punct* ,
to
ishmael
*punct* ,
are
as
the
shaking
of
that
buffalo
robe
to
the
frightened
colt
*punct* !
*break*
though
neither
knows
where
lie
the
nameless
things
of
which
the
mystic
sign
gives
forth
such
hints
*punct* ;
yet
with
me
*punct* ,
as
with
the
colt
*punct* ,
somewhere
those
things
must
exist
*punct* .
*break*
though
in
many
of
its
aspects
this
visible
world
seems
formed
in
love
*punct* ,
the
invisible
spheres
were
formed
in
fright
*punct* .
*break*
but
not
yet
have
we
solved
the
incantation
of
this
whiteness
*punct* ,
and
learned
why
it
appeals
with
such
power
to
the
soul
*punct* ;
and
more
strange
and
far
more
portentous
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
as
we
have
seen
*punct* ,
it
is
at
once
the
most
meaning
symbol
of
spiritual
things
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
the
very
veil
of
the
christian's
deity
*punct* ;
and
yet
should
be
as
it
is
*punct* ,
the
intensifying
agent
in
things
the
most
appalling
to
mankind
*punct* .
*break*
is
it
that
by
its
indefiniteness
it
shadows
forth
the
heartless
voids
and
immensities
of
the
universe
*punct* ,
and
thus
stabs
us
from
behind
with
the
thought
of
annihilation
*punct* ,
when
beholding
the
white
depths
of
the
milky
way
*punct* ?
*break*
or
is
it
*punct* ,
that
as
in
essence
whiteness
is
not
so
much
a
color
as
the
visible
absence
of
color
*punct* ,
and
at
the
same
time
the
concrete
of
all
colors
*punct* ;
is
it
for
these
reasons
that
there
is
such
a
dumb
blankness
*punct* ,
full
of
meaning
*punct* ,
in
a
wide
landscape
of
snows
*punct* ,
a
colorless
*punct* ,
all-color
of
atheism
from
which
we
shrink
*punct* ?
*break*
and
of
all
these
things
the
albino
whale
was
the
symbol
*punct* .
*break*
wonder
ye
then
at
the
fiery
hunt
*punct* ?
*break*
but
even
assuming
all
this
to
be
true
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
were
it
not
for
the
whiteness
*punct* ,
you
would
not
have
that
intensified
terror
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
the
white
shark
*punct* ,
the
white
gliding
ghostliness
of
repose
in
that
creature
*punct* ,
when
beheld
in
his
ordinary
moods
*punct* ,
strangely
tallies
with
the
same
quality
in
the
polar
quadruped
*punct* .
*break*
this
peculiarity
is
most
vividly
hit
by
the
french
in
the
name
they
bestow
upon
that
fish
*punct* .
*break*
the
romish
mass
for
the
dead
begins
with
requiem
eternam
*punct* ,
eternal
rest
*punct* ,
whence
requiem
denominating
the
mass
itself
*punct* ,
and
any
other
funereal
music
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
allusion
to
the
white
*punct* ,
silent
stillness
of
death
in
this
shark
*punct* ,
and
the
mild
deadliness
of
his
habits

the
french
call
him
requin
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
the
first
albatross
i
ever
saw
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
during
a
prolonged
gale
*punct* ,
in
waters
hard
upon
the
antarctic
seas
*punct* .
*break*
from
my
forenoon
watch
below
*punct* ,
i
ascended
to
the
overclouded
deck
*punct* ;
and
there
*punct* ,
dashed
upon
the
main
hatches
*punct* ,
i
saw
a
regal
*punct* ,
feathery
thing
of
unspotted
whiteness
*punct* ,
and
with
a
hooked
*punct* ,
roman
bill
sublime
*punct* .
*break*
at
intervals
*punct* ,
it
arched
forth
its
vast
archangel
wings
*punct* ,
as
if
to
embrace
some
holy
ark
*punct* .
*break*
wondrous
flutterings
and
throbbings
shook
it
*punct* .
*break*
though
bodily
unharmed
*punct* ,
it
uttered
cries
*punct* ,
as
some
king's
ghost
in
supernatural
distress
*punct* .
*break*
through
its
inexpressible
*punct* ,
strange
eyes
*punct* ,
methought
i
peeped
to
secrets
which
took
hold
of
god
*punct* .
*break*
as
abraham
before
the
angels
*punct* ,
i
bowed
myself
*punct* ;
the
white
thing
was
so
white
*punct* ,
its
wings
so
wide
*punct* ,
and
in
those
for
ever
exiled
waters
*punct* ,
i
had
lost
the
miserable
warping
memories
of
traditions
and
of
towns
*punct* .
*break*
long
i
gazed
at
that
prodigy
of
plumage
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
tell
*punct* ,
can
only
hint
*punct* ,
the
things
that
darted
through
me
then
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
last
i
awoke
*punct* ;
and
turning
*punct* ,
asked
a
sailor
what
bird
was
this
*punct* .
*break*
a
goney
*punct* ,
he
replied
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
had
heard
that
name
before
*punct* ;
is
it
conceivable
that
this
glorious
thing
is
utterly
unknown
to
men
ashore
*punct* !
*break*
but
some
time
after
*punct* ,
i
learned
that
goney
was
some
seaman's
name
for
albatross
*punct* .
*break*
for
neither
had
i
then
read
the
rhyme
*punct* ,
nor
knew
the
bird
to
be
an
albatross
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
in
saying
this
*punct* ,
i
do
but
indirectly
burnish
a
little
brighter
the
noble
merit
of
the
poem
and
the
poet
*punct* .
*break*
i
assert
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
that
in
the
wondrous
bodily
whiteness
of
the
bird
chiefly
lurks
the
secret
of
the
spell
*punct* ;
a
truth
the
more
evinced
in
this
*punct* ,
that
by
a
solecism
of
terms
there
are
birds
called
grey
albatrosses
*punct* ;
and
these
i
have
frequently
seen
*punct* ,
but
never
with
such
emotions
as
when
i
beheld
the
antarctic
fowl
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
had
the
mystic
thing
been
caught
*punct* ?
*break*
whisper
it
not
*punct* ,
and
i
will
tell
*punct* ;
with
a
treacherous
hook
and
line
*punct* ,
as
the
fowl
floated
on
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
the
captain
made
a
postman
of
it
*punct* ;
tying
a
lettered
*punct* ,
leathern
tally
round
its
neck
*punct* ,
with
the
ship's
time
and
place
*punct* ;
and
then
letting
it
escape
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
doubt
not
*punct* ,
that
leathern
tally
*punct* ,
meant
for
man
*punct* ,
was
taken
off
in
heaven
*punct* ,
when
the
white
fowl
flew
to
join
the
wing-folding
*punct* ,
the
invoking
*punct* ,
and
adoring
cherubim
*punct* !
*break*
did
you
hear
that
noise
*punct* ,
cabaco
*punct* ?
*break*
it
was
the
middle-watch
*punct* ;
a
fair
moonlight
*punct* ;
the
seamen
were
standing
in
a
cordon
*punct* ,
extending
from
one
of
the
fresh-water
butts
in
the
waist
*punct* ,
to
the
scuttle-butt
near
the
taffrail
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
manner
*punct* ,
they
passed
the
buckets
to
fill
the
scuttle-butt
*punct* .
*break*
standing
*punct* ,
for
the
most
part
*punct* ,
on
the
hallowed
precincts
of
the
quarter-deck
*punct* ,
they
were
careful
not
to
speak
or
rustle
their
feet
*punct* .
*break*
from
hand
to
hand
*punct* ,
the
buckets
went
in
the
deepest
silence
*punct* ,
only
broken
by
the
occasional
flap
of
a
sail
*punct* ,
and
the
steady
hum
of
the
unceasingly
advancing
keel
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
in
the
midst
of
this
repose
*punct* ,
that
archy
*punct* ,
one
of
the
cordon
*punct* ,
whose
post
was
near
the
after-hatches
*punct* ,
whispered
to
his
neighbor
*punct* ,
a
cholo
*punct* ,
the
words
above
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
hear
that
noise
*punct* ,
cabaco
*punct* ?
*break*
take
the
bucket
*punct* ,
will
ye
*punct* ,
archy
*punct* ?
*break*
what
noise
d'ye
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
there
it
is
again
*punct* ,
under
the
hatches
*punct* ,
don't
you
hear
it
*punct* ,
a
cough
*punct* ,
it
sounded
like
a
cough
*punct* .
*break*
cough
be
damned
*punct* !
*break*
pass
along
that
return
bucket
*punct* .
*break*
there
again
*punct* ,
there
it
is!
*punct* ,
it
sounds
like
two
or
three
sleepers
turning
over
*punct* ,
now
*punct* !
*break*
have
done
*punct* ,
shipmate
*punct* ,
will
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
the
three
soaked
biscuits
ye
eat
for
supper
turning
over
inside
of
ye
*punct* ,
nothing
else
*punct* .
*break*
look
to
the
bucket
*punct* !
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
you
are
the
chap
*punct* ,
ain't
ye
*punct* ,
that
heard
the
hum
of
the
old
quakeress's
knitting-needles
fifty
miles
at
sea
from
nantucket
*punct* ;
you're
the
chap
*punct* .
*break*
grin
away
*punct* ;
we'll
see
what
turns
up
*punct* .
*break*
hark
ye
*punct* ,
cabaco
*punct* ,
there
is
somebody
down
in
the
after-hold
that
has
not
yet
been
seen
on
deck
*punct* ;
and
i
suspect
our
old
mogul
knows
something
of
it
too
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
stubb
tell
flask
*punct* ,
one
morning
watch
*punct* ,
that
there
was
something
of
that
sort
in
the
wind
*punct* .
*break*
then
seating
himself
before
it
*punct* ,
you
would
have
seen
him
intently
study
the
various
lines
and
shadings
which
there
met
his
eye
*punct* ;
and
with
slow
but
steady
pencil
trace
additional
courses
over
spaces
that
before
were
blank
*punct* .
*break*
at
intervals
*punct* ,
he
would
refer
to
piles
of
old
log-books
beside
him
*punct* ,
wherein
were
set
down
the
seasons
and
places
in
which
*punct* ,
on
various
former
voyages
of
various
ships
*punct* ,
sperm
whales
had
been
captured
or
seen
*punct* .
*break*
while
thus
employed
*punct* ,
the
heavy
pewter
lamp
suspended
in
chains
over
his
head
*punct* ,
continually
rocked
with
the
motion
of
the
ship
*punct* ,
and
for
ever
threw
shifting
gleams
and
shadows
of
lines
upon
his
wrinkled
brow
*punct* ,
till
it
almost
seemed
that
while
he
himself
was
marking
out
lines
and
courses
on
the
wrinkled
charts
*punct* ,
some
invisible
pencil
was
also
tracing
lines
and
courses
upon
the
deeply
marked
chart
of
his
forehead
*punct* .
*break*
almost
every
night
they
were
brought
out
*punct* ;
almost
every
night
some
pencil
marks
were
effaced
*punct* ,
and
others
were
substituted
*punct* .
*break*
for
with
the
charts
of
all
four
oceans
before
him
*punct* ,
ahab
was
threading
a
maze
of
currents
and
eddies
*punct* ,
with
a
view
to
the
more
certain
accomplishment
of
that
monomaniac
thought
of
his
soul
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
to
any
one
not
fully
acquainted
with
the
ways
of
the
leviathans
*punct* ,
it
might
seem
an
absurdly
hopeless
task
thus
to
seek
out
one
solitary
creature
in
the
unhooped
oceans
of
this
planet
*punct* .
*break*
but
not
so
did
it
seem
to
ahab
*punct* ,
who
knew
the
sets
of
all
tides
and
currents
*punct* ;
and
thereby
calculating
the
driftings
of
the
sperm
whale's
food
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
calling
to
mind
the
regular
*punct* ,
ascertained
seasons
for
hunting
him
in
particular
latitudes
*punct* ;
could
arrive
at
reasonable
surmises
*punct* ,
almost
approaching
to
certainties
*punct* ,
concerning
the
timeliest
day
to
be
upon
this
or
that
ground
in
search
of
his
prey
*punct* .
*break*
so
assured
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
is
the
fact
concerning
the
periodicalness
of
the
sperm
whale's
resorting
to
given
waters
*punct* ,
that
many
hunters
believe
that
*punct* ,
could
he
be
closely
observed
and
studied
throughout
the
world
*punct* ;
were
the
logs
for
one
voyage
of
the
entire
whale
fleet
carefully
collated
*punct* ,
then
the
migrations
of
the
sperm
whale
would
be
found
to
correspond
in
invariability
to
those
of
the
herring-shoals
or
the
flights
of
swallows
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
hint
*punct* ,
attempts
have
been
made
to
construct
elaborate
migratory
charts
of
the
sperm
whale
*punct* .
*break*
the
sum
is
*punct* ,
that
at
particular
seasons
within
that
breadth
and
along
that
path
*punct* ,
migrating
whales
may
with
great
confidence
be
looked
for
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
circumstance
which
at
first
sight
seemed
to
entangle
his
delirious
but
still
methodical
scheme
*punct* .
*break*
but
not
so
in
the
reality
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* .
*break*
though
the
gregarious
sperm
whales
have
their
regular
seasons
for
particular
grounds
*punct* ,
yet
in
general
you
cannot
conclude
that
the
herds
which
hunted
such
and
such
a
latitude
or
longitude
this
year
*punct* ,
say
*punct* ,
will
turn
out
to
be
identically
the
same
with
those
that
were
found
there
the
preceding
season
*punct* ;
though
there
are
peculiar
and
unquestionable
instances
where
the
contrary
of
this
has
proved
true
*punct* .
*break*
in
general
*punct* ,
the
same
remark
*punct* ,
only
within
a
less
wide
limit
*punct* ,
applies
to
the
solitaries
and
hermits
among
the
matured
*punct* ,
aged
sperm
whales
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
though
moby
dick
had
in
a
former
year
been
seen
*punct* ,
for
example
*punct* ,
on
what
is
called
the
seychelle
ground
in
the
indian
ocean
*punct* ,
or
volcano
bay
on
the
japanese
coast
*punct* ;
yet
it
did
not
follow
*punct* ,
that
were
the
pequod
to
visit
either
of
those
spots
at
any
subsequent
corresponding
season
*punct* ,
she
would
infallibly
encounter
him
there
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
with
some
other
feeding
grounds
*punct* ,
where
he
had
at
times
revealed
himself
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
these
seemed
only
his
casual
stopping-places
and
ocean-inns
*punct* ,
so
to
speak
*punct* ,
not
his
places
of
prolonged
abode
*punct* .
*break*
that
particular
set
time
and
place
were
conjoined
in
the
one
technical
phrase
*punct* ,
the
season-on-the-line
*punct* .
*break*
for
there
and
then
*punct* ,
for
several
consecutive
years
*punct* ,
moby
dick
had
been
periodically
descried
*punct* ,
lingering
in
those
waters
for
awhile
*punct* ,
as
the
sun
*punct* ,
in
its
annual
round
*punct* ,
loiters
for
a
predicted
interval
in
any
one
sign
of
the
zodiac
*punct* .
*break*
there
it
was
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
that
most
of
the
deadly
encounters
with
the
white
whale
had
taken
place
*punct* ;
there
the
waves
were
storied
with
his
deeds
*punct* ;
there
also
was
that
tragic
spot
where
the
monomaniac
old
man
had
found
the
awful
motive
to
his
vengeance
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
the
cautious
comprehensiveness
and
unloitering
vigilance
with
which
ahab
threw
his
brooding
soul
into
this
unfaltering
hunt
*punct* ,
he
would
not
permit
himself
to
rest
all
his
hopes
upon
the
one
crowning
fact
above
mentioned
*punct* ,
however
flattering
it
might
be
to
those
hopes
*punct* ;
nor
in
the
sleeplessness
of
his
vow
could
he
so
tranquillize
his
unquiet
heart
as
to
postpone
all
intervening
quest
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
the
pequod
had
sailed
from
nantucket
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
season-on-the-line
*punct* .
*break*
no
possible
endeavor
then
could
enable
her
commander
to
make
the
great
passage
southwards
*punct* ,
double
cape
horn
*punct* ,
and
then
running
down
sixty
degrees
of
latitude
arrive
in
the
equatorial
pacific
in
time
to
cruise
there
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
*punct* ,
he
must
wait
for
the
next
ensuing
season
*punct* .
*break*
yet
the
premature
hour
of
the
pequod's
sailing
had
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
been
correctly
selected
by
ahab
*punct* ,
with
a
view
to
this
very
complexion
of
things
*punct* .
*break*
because
*punct* ,
an
interval
of
three
hundred
and
sixty-five
days
and
nights
was
before
him
*punct* ;
an
interval
which
*punct* ,
instead
of
impatiently
enduring
ashore
*punct* ,
he
would
spend
in
a
miscellaneous
hunt
*punct* ;
if
by
chance
the
white
whale
*punct* ,
spending
his
vacation
in
seas
far
remote
from
his
periodical
feeding-grounds
*punct* ,
should
turn
up
his
wrinkled
brow
off
the
persian
gulf
*punct* ,
or
in
the
bengal
bay
*punct* ,
or
china
seas
*punct* ,
or
in
any
other
waters
haunted
by
his
race
*punct* .
*break*
but
granting
all
this
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
regarded
discreetly
and
coolly
*punct* ,
seems
it
not
but
a
mad
idea
*punct* ,
this
*punct* ;
that
in
the
broad
boundless
ocean
*punct* ,
one
solitary
whale
*punct* ,
even
if
encountered
*punct* ,
should
be
thought
capable
of
individual
recognition
from
his
hunter
*punct* ,
even
as
a
white-bearded
mufti
in
the
thronged
thoroughfares
of
constantinople
*punct* ?
*break*
for
the
peculiar
snow-white
brow
of
moby
dick
*punct* ,
and
his
snow-white
hump
*punct* ,
could
not
but
be
unmistakable
*punct* .
*break*
and
have
i
not
tallied
the
whale
*punct* ,
ahab
would
mutter
to
himself
*punct* ,
as
after
poring
over
his
charts
till
long
after
midnight
he
would
throw
himself
back
in
reveries
*punct* ,
tallied
him
*punct* ,
and
shall
he
escape
*punct* ?
*break*
his
broad
fins
are
bored
*punct* ,
and
scalloped
out
like
a
lost
sheep's
ear
*punct* !
*break*
and
here
*punct* ,
his
mad
mind
would
run
on
in
a
breathless
race
*punct* ;
till
a
weariness
and
faintness
of
pondering
came
over
him
*punct* ;
and
in
the
open
air
of
the
deck
he
would
seek
to
recover
his
strength
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
god
*punct* !
*break*
what
trances
of
torments
does
that
man
endure
who
is
consumed
with
one
unachieved
revengeful
desire
*punct* .
*break*
he
sleeps
with
clenched
hands
*punct* ;
and
wakes
with
his
own
bloody
nails
in
his
palms
*punct* .
*break*
often
*punct* ,
when
forced
from
his
hammock
by
exhausting
and
intolerably
vivid
dreams
of
the
night
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
resuming
his
own
intense
thoughts
through
the
day
*punct* ,
carried
them
on
amid
a
clashing
of
phrensies
*punct* ,
and
whirled
them
round
and
round
in
his
blazing
brain
*punct* ,
till
the
very
throbbing
of
his
life-spot
became
insufferable
anguish
*punct* ;
and
when
*punct* ,
as
was
sometimes
the
case
*punct* ,
these
spiritual
throes
in
him
heaved
his
being
up
from
its
base
*punct* ,
and
a
chasm
seemed
opening
in
him
*punct* ,
from
which
forked
flames
and
lightnings
shot
up
*punct* ,
and
accursed
fiends
beckoned
him
to
leap
down
among
them
*punct* ;
when
this
hell
in
himself
yawned
beneath
him
*punct* ,
a
wild
cry
would
be
heard
through
the
ship
*punct* ;
and
with
glaring
eyes
ahab
would
burst
from
his
state
room
*punct* ,
as
though
escaping
from
a
bed
that
was
on
fire
*punct* .
*break*
yet
these
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
instead
of
being
the
unsuppressable
symptoms
of
some
latent
weakness
*punct* ,
or
fright
at
his
own
resolve
*punct* ,
were
but
the
plainest
tokens
of
its
intensity
*punct* .
*break*
the
latter
was
the
eternal
*punct* ,
living
principle
or
soul
in
him
*punct* ;
and
in
sleep
*punct* ,
being
for
the
time
dissociated
from
the
characterizing
mind
*punct* ,
which
at
other
times
employed
it
for
its
outer
vehicle
or
agent
*punct* ,
it
spontaneously
sought
escape
from
the
scorching
contiguity
of
the
frantic
thing
*punct* ,
of
which
*punct* ,
for
the
time
*punct* ,
it
was
no
longer
an
integral
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
the
mind
does
not
exist
unless
leagued
with
the
soul
*punct* ,
therefore
it
must
have
been
that
*punct* ,
in
ahab's
case
*punct* ,
yielding
up
all
his
thoughts
and
fancies
to
his
one
supreme
purpose
*punct* ;
that
purpose
*punct* ,
by
its
own
sheer
inveteracy
of
will
*punct* ,
forced
itself
against
gods
and
devils
into
a
kind
of
self-assumed
*punct* ,
independent
being
of
its
own
*punct* .
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
could
grimly
live
and
burn
*punct* ,
while
the
common
vitality
to
which
it
was
conjoined
*punct* ,
fled
horror-stricken
from
the
unbidden
and
unfathered
birth
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
*punct* ,
the
tormented
spirit
that
glared
out
of
bodily
eyes
*punct* ,
when
what
seemed
ahab
rushed
from
his
room
*punct* ,
was
for
the
time
but
a
vacated
thing
*punct* ,
a
formless
somnambulistic
being
*punct* ,
a
ray
of
living
light
*punct* ,
to
be
sure
*punct* ,
but
without
an
object
to
color
*punct* ,
and
therefore
a
blankness
in
itself
*punct* .
*break*
by
that
circular
*punct* ,
it
appears
that
precisely
such
a
chart
is
in
course
of
completion
*punct* ;
and
portions
of
it
are
presented
in
the
circular
*punct* .
*break*
i
care
not
to
perform
this
part
of
my
task
methodically
*punct* ;
but
shall
be
content
to
produce
the
desired
impression
by
separate
citations
of
items
*punct* ,
practically
or
reliably
known
to
me
as
a
whaleman
*punct* ;
and
from
these
citations
*punct* ,
i
take
it
*punct* ,
the
conclusion
aimed
at
will
naturally
follow
of
itself
*punct* .
*break*
first
*punct* :
i
have
personally
known
three
instances
where
a
whale
*punct* ,
after
receiving
a
harpoon
*punct* ,
has
effected
a
complete
escape
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
after
an
interval
*punct* ,
in
one
instance
of
three
years
*punct* ,
has
been
again
struck
by
the
same
hand
*punct* ,
and
slain
*punct* ;
when
the
two
irons
*punct* ,
both
marked
by
the
same
private
cypher
*punct* ,
have
been
taken
from
the
body
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
instance
where
three
years
intervened
between
the
flinging
of
the
two
harpoons
*punct* ;
and
i
think
it
may
have
been
something
more
than
that
*punct* ;
the
man
who
darted
them
happening
*punct* ,
in
the
interval
*punct* ,
to
go
in
a
trading
ship
on
a
voyage
to
africa
*punct* ,
went
ashore
there
*punct* ,
joined
a
discovery
party
*punct* ,
and
penetrated
far
into
the
interior
*punct* ,
where
he
travelled
for
a
period
of
nearly
two
years
*punct* ,
often
endangered
by
serpents
*punct* ,
savages
*punct* ,
tigers
*punct* ,
poisonous
miasmas
*punct* ,
with
all
the
other
common
perils
incident
to
wandering
in
the
heart
of
unknown
regions
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
*punct* ,
the
whale
he
had
struck
must
also
have
been
on
its
travels
*punct* ;
no
doubt
it
had
thrice
circumnavigated
the
globe
*punct* ,
brushing
with
its
flanks
all
the
coasts
of
africa
*punct* ;
but
to
no
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
this
man
and
this
whale
again
came
together
*punct* ,
and
the
one
vanquished
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
i
*punct* ,
myself
*punct* ,
have
known
three
instances
similar
to
this
*punct* ;
that
is
in
two
of
them
i
saw
the
whales
struck
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
upon
the
second
attack
*punct* ,
saw
the
two
irons
with
the
respective
marks
cut
in
them
*punct* ,
afterwards
taken
from
the
dead
fish
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
three-year
instance
*punct* ,
it
so
fell
out
that
i
was
in
the
boat
both
times
*punct* ,
first
and
last
*punct* ,
and
the
last
time
distinctly
recognized
a
peculiar
sort
of
huge
mole
under
the
whale's
eye
*punct* ,
which
i
had
observed
there
three
years
previous
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
three
years
*punct* ,
but
i
am
pretty
sure
it
was
more
than
that
*punct* .
*break*
here
are
three
instances
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
which
i
personally
know
the
truth
of
*punct* ;
but
i
have
heard
of
many
other
instances
from
persons
whose
veracity
in
the
matter
there
is
no
good
ground
to
impeach
*punct* .
*break*
why
such
a
whale
became
thus
marked
was
not
altogether
and
originally
owing
to
his
bodily
peculiarities
as
distinguished
from
other
whales
*punct* ;
for
however
peculiar
in
that
respect
any
chance
whale
may
be
*punct* ,
they
soon
put
an
end
to
his
peculiarities
by
killing
him
*punct* ,
and
boiling
him
down
into
a
peculiarly
valuable
oil
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* :
the
reason
was
this
*punct* :
that
from
the
fatal
experiences
of
the
fishery
there
hung
a
terrible
prestige
of
perilousness
about
such
a
whale
as
there
did
about
rinaldo
rinaldini
*punct* ,
insomuch
that
most
fishermen
were
content
to
recognise
him
by
merely
touching
their
tarpaulins
when
he
would
be
discovered
lounging
by
them
on
the
sea
*punct* ,
without
seeking
to
cultivate
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
*punct* .
*break*
like
some
poor
devils
ashore
that
happen
to
know
an
irascible
great
man
*punct* ,
they
make
distant
unobtrusive
salutations
to
him
in
the
street
*punct* ,
lest
if
they
pursued
the
acquaintance
further
*punct* ,
they
might
receive
a
summary
thump
for
their
presumption
*punct* .
*break*
but
not
only
did
each
of
these
famous
whales
enjoy
great
individual
celebrity
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
you
may
call
it
an
ocean-wide
renown
*punct* ;
not
only
was
he
famous
in
life
and
now
is
immortal
in
forecastle
stories
after
death
*punct* ,
but
he
was
admitted
into
all
the
rights
*punct* ,
privileges
*punct* ,
and
distinctions
of
a
name
*punct* ;
had
as
much
a
name
indeed
as
cambyses
or
caesar
*punct* .
*break*
was
it
not
so
*punct* ,
o
timor
tom
*punct* !
*break*
thou
famed
leviathan
*punct* ,
scarred
like
an
iceberg
*punct* ,
who
so
long
did'st
lurk
in
the
oriental
straits
of
that
name
*punct* ,
whose
spout
was
oft
seen
from
the
palmy
beach
of
ombay
*punct* ?
*break*
was
it
not
so
*punct* ,
o
new
zealand
jack
*punct* !
*break*
thou
terror
of
all
cruisers
that
crossed
their
wakes
in
the
vicinity
of
the
tattoo
land
*punct* ?
*break*
was
it
not
so
*punct* ,
o
morquan
*punct* !
*break*
king
of
japan
*punct* ,
whose
lofty
jet
they
say
at
times
assumed
the
semblance
of
a
snow-white
cross
against
the
sky
*punct* ?
*break*
was
it
not
so
*punct* ,
o
don
miguel
*punct* !
*break*
thou
chilian
whale
*punct* ,
marked
like
an
old
tortoise
with
mystic
hieroglyphics
upon
the
back
*punct* !
*break*
in
plain
prose
*punct* ,
here
are
four
whales
as
well
known
to
the
students
of
cetacean
history
as
marius
or
sylla
to
the
classic
scholar
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
is
not
all
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
where
i
can
find
a
better
place
than
just
here
*punct* ,
to
make
mention
of
one
or
two
other
things
*punct* ,
which
to
me
seem
important
*punct* ,
as
in
printed
form
establishing
in
all
respects
the
reasonableness
of
the
whole
story
of
the
white
whale
*punct* ,
more
especially
the
catastrophe
*punct* .
*break*
for
this
is
one
of
those
disheartening
instances
where
truth
requires
full
as
much
bolstering
as
error
*punct* .
*break*
so
ignorant
are
most
landsmen
of
some
of
the
plainest
and
most
palpable
wonders
of
the
world
*punct* ,
that
without
some
hints
touching
the
plain
facts
*punct* ,
historical
and
otherwise
*punct* ,
of
the
fishery
*punct* ,
they
might
scout
at
moby
dick
as
a
monstrous
fable
*punct* ,
or
still
worse
and
more
detestable
*punct* ,
a
hideous
and
intolerable
allegory
*punct* .
*break*
first
*punct* :
though
most
men
have
some
vague
flitting
ideas
of
the
general
perils
of
the
grand
fishery
*punct* ,
yet
they
have
nothing
like
a
fixed
*punct* ,
vivid
conception
of
those
perils
*punct* ,
and
the
frequency
with
which
they
recur
*punct* .
*break*
one
reason
perhaps
is
*punct* ,
that
not
one
in
fifty
of
the
actual
disasters
and
deaths
by
casualties
in
the
fishery
*punct* ,
ever
finds
a
public
record
at
home
*punct* ,
however
transient
and
immediately
forgotten
that
record
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
suppose
that
that
poor
fellow
there
*punct* ,
who
this
moment
perhaps
caught
by
the
whale-line
off
the
coast
of
new
guinea
*punct* ,
is
being
carried
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
by
the
sounding
leviathan
*punct* ,
do
you
suppose
that
that
poor
fellow's
name
will
appear
in
the
newspaper
obituary
you
will
read
to-morrow
at
your
breakfast
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* :
because
the
mails
are
very
irregular
between
here
and
new
guinea
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
did
you
ever
hear
what
might
be
called
regular
news
direct
or
indirect
from
new
guinea
*punct* ?
*break*
yet
i
tell
you
that
upon
one
particular
voyage
which
i
made
to
the
pacific
*punct* ,
among
many
others
we
spoke
thirty
different
ships
*punct* ,
every
one
of
which
had
had
a
death
by
a
whale
*punct* ,
some
of
them
more
than
one
*punct* ,
and
three
that
had
each
lost
a
boat's
crew
*punct* .
*break*
for
god's
sake
*punct* ,
be
economical
with
your
lamps
and
candles
*punct* !
*break*
but
fortunately
the
special
point
i
here
seek
can
be
established
upon
testimony
entirely
independent
of
my
own
*punct* .
*break*
that
point
is
this
*punct* :
the
sperm
whale
is
in
some
cases
sufficiently
powerful
*punct* ,
knowing
*punct* ,
and
judiciously
malicious
*punct* ,
as
with
direct
aforethought
to
stave
in
*punct* ,
utterly
destroy
*punct* ,
and
sink
a
large
ship
*punct* ;
and
what
is
more
*punct* ,
the
sperm
whale
has
done
it
*punct* .
*break*
first
*punct* :
in
the
year
the
ship
essex
*punct* ,
captain
pollard
*punct* ,
of
nantucket
*punct* ,
was
cruising
in
the
pacific
ocean
*punct* .
*break*
one
day
she
saw
spouts
*punct* ,
lowered
her
boats
*punct* ,
and
gave
chase
to
a
shoal
of
sperm
whales
*punct* .
*break*
ere
long
*punct* ,
several
of
the
whales
were
wounded
*punct* ;
when
*punct* ,
suddenly
*punct* ,
a
very
large
whale
escaping
from
the
boats
*punct* ,
issued
from
the
shoal
*punct* ,
and
bore
directly
down
upon
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
dashing
his
forehead
against
her
hull
*punct* ,
he
so
stove
her
in
*punct* ,
that
in
less
than
ten
minutes
she
settled
down
and
fell
over
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
surviving
plank
of
her
has
been
seen
since
*punct* .
*break*
after
the
severest
exposure
*punct* ,
part
of
the
crew
reached
the
land
in
their
boats
*punct* .
*break*
being
returned
home
at
last
*punct* ,
captain
pollard
once
more
sailed
for
the
pacific
in
command
of
another
ship
*punct* ,
but
the
gods
shipwrecked
him
again
upon
unknown
rocks
and
breakers
*punct* ;
for
the
second
time
his
ship
was
utterly
lost
*punct* ,
and
forthwith
forswearing
the
sea
*punct* ,
he
has
never
tempted
it
since
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
day
captain
pollard
is
a
resident
of
nantucket
*punct* .
*break*
conversation
turning
upon
whales
*punct* ,
the
commodore
was
pleased
to
be
sceptical
touching
the
amazing
strength
ascribed
to
them
by
the
professional
gentlemen
present
*punct* .
*break*
he
peremptorily
denied
for
example
*punct* ,
that
any
whale
could
so
smite
his
stout
sloop-of-war
as
to
cause
her
to
leak
so
much
as
a
thimbleful
*punct* .
*break*
very
good
*punct* ;
but
there
is
more
coming
*punct* .
*break*
some
weeks
after
*punct* ,
the
commodore
set
sail
in
this
impregnable
craft
for
valparaiso
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
was
stopped
on
the
way
by
a
portly
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
that
begged
a
few
moments
confidential
business
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
not
superstitious
*punct* ,
but
i
consider
the
commodore's
interview
with
that
whale
as
providential
*punct* .
*break*
was
not
saul
of
tarsus
converted
from
unbelief
by
a
similar
fright
*punct* ?
*break*
i
tell
you
*punct* ,
the
sperm
whale
will
stand
no
nonsense
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
now
refer
you
to
langsdorff's
voyages
for
a
little
circumstance
in
point
*punct* ,
peculiarly
interesting
to
the
writer
hereof
*punct* .
*break*
langsdorff
*punct* ,
you
must
know
by
the
way
*punct* ,
was
attached
to
the
russian
admiral
krusenstern's
famous
discovery
expedition
in
the
beginning
of
the
present
century
*punct* .
*break*
captain
langsdorff
thus
begins
his
seventeenth
chapter
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
thirteenth
of
may
our
ship
was
ready
to
sail
*punct* ,
and
the
next
day
we
were
out
in
the
open
sea
*punct* ,
on
our
way
to
ochotsh
*punct* .
*break*
the
weather
was
very
clear
and
fine
*punct* ,
but
so
intolerably
cold
that
we
were
obliged
to
keep
on
our
fur
clothing
*punct* .
*break*
for
some
days
we
had
very
little
wind
*punct* ;
it
was
not
till
the
nineteenth
that
a
brisk
gale
from
the
northwest
sprang
up
*punct* .
*break*
an
uncommon
large
whale
*punct* ,
the
body
of
which
was
larger
than
the
ship
itself
*punct* ,
lay
almost
at
the
surface
of
the
water
*punct* ,
but
was
not
perceived
by
any
one
on
board
till
the
moment
when
the
ship
*punct* ,
which
was
in
full
sail
*punct* ,
was
almost
upon
him
*punct* ,
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
prevent
its
striking
against
him
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
thus
placed
in
the
most
imminent
danger
*punct* ,
as
this
gigantic
creature
*punct* ,
setting
up
its
back
*punct* ,
raised
the
ship
three
feet
at
least
out
of
the
water
*punct* .
*break*
the
masts
reeled
*punct* ,
and
the
sails
fell
altogether
*punct* ,
while
we
who
were
below
all
sprang
instantly
upon
the
deck
*punct* ,
concluding
that
we
had
struck
upon
some
rock
*punct* ;
instead
of
this
we
saw
the
monster
sailing
off
with
the
utmost
gravity
and
solemnity
*punct* .
*break*
captain
d'wolf
applied
immediately
to
the
pumps
to
examine
whether
or
not
the
vessel
had
received
any
damage
from
the
shock
*punct* ,
but
we
found
that
very
happily
it
had
escaped
entirely
uninjured
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
the
captain
d'wolf
here
alluded
to
as
commanding
the
ship
in
question
*punct* ,
is
a
new
englander
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
after
a
long
life
of
unusual
adventures
as
a
sea-captain
*punct* ,
this
day
resides
in
the
village
of
dorchester
near
boston
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
the
honor
of
being
a
nephew
of
his
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
particularly
questioned
him
concerning
this
passage
in
langsdorff
*punct* .
*break*
in
that
up
and
down
manly
book
of
old-fashioned
adventure
*punct* ,
so
full
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
of
honest
wonders
*punct* ,
the
voyage
of
lionel
wafer
*punct* ,
one
of
ancient
dampier's
old
chums
*punct* ,
i
found
a
little
matter
set
down
so
like
that
just
quoted
from
langsdorff
*punct* ,
that
i
cannot
forbear
inserting
it
here
for
a
corroborative
example
*punct* ,
if
such
be
needed
*punct* .
*break*
lionel
*punct* ,
it
seems
*punct* ,
was
on
his
way
to
john
ferdinando
*punct* ,
as
he
calls
the
modern
juan
fernandes
*punct* .
*break*
in
our
way
thither
*punct* ,
he
says
*punct* ,
about
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
*punct* ,
when
we
were
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
leagues
from
the
main
of
america
*punct* ,
our
ship
felt
a
terrible
shock
*punct* ,
which
put
our
men
in
such
consternation
that
they
could
hardly
tell
where
they
were
or
what
to
think
*punct* ;
but
every
one
began
to
prepare
for
death
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
the
shock
was
so
sudden
and
violent
*punct* ,
that
we
took
it
for
granted
the
ship
had
struck
against
a
rock
*punct* ;
but
when
the
amazement
was
a
little
over
*punct* ,
we
cast
the
lead
*punct* ,
and
sounded
*punct* ,
but
found
no
ground
*punct* .
*break*
the
suddenness
of
the
shock
made
the
guns
leap
in
their
carriages
*punct* ,
and
several
of
the
men
were
shaken
out
of
their
hammocks
*punct* .
*break*
captain
davis
*punct* ,
who
lay
with
his
head
on
a
gun
*punct* ,
was
thrown
out
of
his
cabin
*punct* !
*break*
lionel
then
goes
on
to
impute
the
shock
to
an
earthquake
*punct* ,
and
seems
to
substantiate
the
imputation
by
stating
that
a
great
earthquake
*punct* ,
somewhere
about
that
time
*punct* ,
did
actually
do
great
mischief
along
the
spanish
land
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
should
not
much
wonder
if
*punct* ,
in
the
darkness
of
that
early
hour
of
the
morning
*punct* ,
the
shock
was
after
all
caused
by
an
unseen
whale
vertically
bumping
the
hull
from
beneath
*punct* .
*break*
i
might
proceed
with
several
more
examples
*punct* ,
one
way
or
another
known
to
me
*punct* ,
of
the
great
power
and
malice
at
times
of
the
sperm
whale
*punct* .
*break*
in
more
than
one
instance
*punct* ,
he
has
been
known
*punct* ,
not
only
to
chase
the
assailing
boats
back
to
their
ships
*punct* ,
but
to
pursue
the
ship
itself
*punct* ,
and
long
withstand
all
the
lances
hurled
at
him
from
its
decks
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
it
is
very
often
observed
that
*punct* ,
if
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
once
struck
*punct* ,
is
allowed
time
to
rally
*punct* ,
he
then
acts
*punct* ,
not
so
often
with
blind
rage
*punct* ,
as
with
wilful
*punct* ,
deliberate
designs
of
destruction
to
his
pursuers
*punct* ;
nor
is
it
without
conveying
some
eloquent
indication
of
his
character
*punct* ,
that
upon
being
attacked
he
will
frequently
open
his
mouth
*punct* ,
and
retain
it
in
that
dread
expansion
for
several
consecutive
minutes
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
must
be
content
with
only
one
more
and
a
concluding
illustration
*punct* ;
a
remarkable
and
most
significant
one
*punct* ,
by
which
you
will
not
fail
to
see
*punct* ,
that
not
only
is
the
most
marvellous
event
in
this
book
corroborated
by
plain
facts
of
the
present
day
*punct* ,
but
that
these
marvels
*punct* ,
like
all
marvels
*punct* ,
are
mere
repetitions
of
the
ages
*punct* ;
so
that
for
the
millionth
time
we
say
amen
with
solomon
*punct* ,
verily
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
sixth
christian
century
lived
procopius
*punct* ,
a
christian
magistrate
of
constantinople
*punct* ,
in
the
days
when
justinian
was
emperor
and
belisarius
general
*punct* .
*break*
as
many
know
*punct* ,
he
wrote
the
history
of
his
own
times
*punct* ,
a
work
every
way
of
uncommon
value
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
best
authorities
*punct* ,
he
has
always
been
considered
a
most
trustworthy
and
unexaggerating
historian
*punct* ,
except
in
some
one
or
two
particulars
*punct* ,
not
at
all
affecting
the
matter
presently
to
be
mentioned
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
this
history
of
his
*punct* ,
procopius
mentions
that
*punct* ,
during
the
term
of
his
prefecture
at
constantinople
*punct* ,
a
great
sea-monster
was
captured
in
the
neighboring
propontis
*punct* ,
or
sea
of
marmora
*punct* ,
after
having
destroyed
vessels
at
intervals
in
those
waters
for
a
period
of
more
than
fifty
years
*punct* .
*break*
a
fact
thus
set
down
in
substantial
history
cannot
easily
be
gainsaid
*punct* .
*break*
nor
is
there
any
reason
it
should
be
*punct* .
*break*
of
what
precise
species
this
sea-monster
was
*punct* ,
is
not
mentioned
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
he
destroyed
ships
*punct* ,
as
well
as
for
other
reasons
*punct* ,
he
must
have
been
a
whale
*punct* ;
and
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
think
a
sperm
whale
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
will
tell
you
why
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
long
time
i
fancied
that
the
sperm
whale
had
been
always
unknown
in
the
mediterranean
and
the
deep
waters
connecting
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
further
investigations
have
recently
proved
to
me
*punct* ,
that
in
modern
times
there
have
been
isolated
instances
of
the
presence
of
the
sperm
whale
in
the
mediterranean
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
told
*punct* ,
on
good
authority
*punct* ,
that
on
the
barbary
coast
*punct* ,
a
commodore
davis
of
the
british
navy
found
the
skeleton
of
a
sperm
whale
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
as
a
vessel
of
war
readily
passes
through
the
dardanelles
*punct* ,
hence
a
sperm
whale
could
*punct* ,
by
the
same
route
*punct* ,
pass
out
of
the
mediterranean
into
the
propontis
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
propontis
*punct* ,
as
far
as
i
can
learn
*punct* ,
none
of
that
peculiar
substance
called
brit
is
to
be
found
*punct* ,
the
aliment
of
the
right
whale
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
food
of
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
squid
or
cuttle-fish
*punct* ,
lurks
at
the
bottom
of
that
sea
*punct* ,
because
large
creatures
*punct* ,
but
by
no
means
the
largest
of
that
sort
*punct* ,
have
been
found
at
its
surface
*punct* .
*break*
his
aspect
was
most
horrible
*punct* ,
and
such
as
indicated
resentment
and
fury
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
directly
from
the
shoal
which
we
had
just
before
entered
*punct* ,
and
in
which
we
had
struck
three
of
his
companions
*punct* ,
as
if
fired
with
revenge
for
their
sufferings
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* :
at
all
events
*punct* ,
the
whole
circumstances
taken
together
*punct* ,
all
happening
before
my
own
eyes
*punct* ,
and
producing
*punct* ,
at
the
time
*punct* ,
impressions
in
my
mind
of
decided
*punct* ,
calculating
mischief
*punct* ,
on
the
part
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
many
of
which
impressions
i
cannot
now
recall
*punct* ,
induce
me
to
be
satisfied
that
i
am
correct
in
my
opinion
*punct* .
*break*
here
are
his
reflections
some
time
after
quitting
the
ship
*punct* ,
during
a
black
night
in
an
open
boat
*punct* ,
when
almost
despairing
of
reaching
any
hospitable
shore
*punct* .
*break*
the
dark
ocean
and
swelling
waters
were
nothing
*punct* ;
the
fears
of
being
swallowed
up
by
some
dreadful
tempest
*punct* ,
or
dashed
upon
hidden
rocks
*punct* ,
with
all
the
other
ordinary
subjects
of
fearful
contemplation
*punct* ,
seemed
scarcely
entitled
to
a
moment's
thought
*punct* ;
the
dismal
looking
wreck
*punct* ,
and
the
horrid
aspect
and
revenge
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
wholly
engrossed
my
reflections
*punct* ,
until
day
again
made
its
appearance
*punct* .
*break*
or
at
least
if
this
were
otherwise
*punct* ,
there
were
not
wanting
other
motives
much
more
influential
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
such
an
hypothesis
be
indeed
exceptionable
*punct* ,
there
were
still
additional
considerations
which
*punct* ,
though
not
so
strictly
according
with
the
wildness
of
his
ruling
passion
*punct* ,
yet
were
by
no
means
incapable
of
swaying
him
*punct* .
*break*
to
accomplish
his
object
ahab
must
use
tools
*punct* ;
and
of
all
tools
used
in
the
shadow
of
the
moon
*punct* ,
men
are
most
apt
to
get
out
of
order
*punct* .
*break*
he
knew
*punct* ,
for
example
*punct* ,
that
however
magnetic
his
ascendency
in
some
respects
was
over
starbuck
*punct* ,
yet
that
ascendency
did
not
cover
the
complete
spiritual
man
any
more
than
mere
corporeal
superiority
involves
intellectual
mastership
*punct* ;
for
to
the
purely
spiritual
*punct* ,
the
intellectual
but
stand
in
a
sort
of
corporeal
relation
*punct* .
*break*
starbuck's
body
and
starbuck's
coerced
will
were
ahab's
*punct* ,
so
long
as
ahab
kept
his
magnet
at
starbuck's
brain
*punct* ;
still
he
knew
that
for
all
this
the
chief
mate
*punct* ,
in
his
soul
*punct* ,
abhorred
his
captain's
quest
*punct* ,
and
could
he
*punct* ,
would
joyfully
disintegrate
himself
from
it
*punct* ,
or
even
frustrate
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
might
be
that
a
long
interval
would
elapse
ere
the
white
whale
was
seen
*punct* .
*break*
during
that
long
interval
starbuck
would
ever
be
apt
to
fall
into
open
relapses
of
rebellion
against
his
captain's
leadership
*punct* ,
unless
some
ordinary
*punct* ,
prudential
*punct* ,
circumstantial
influences
were
brought
to
bear
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
nor
was
ahab
unmindful
of
another
thing
*punct* .
*break*
in
times
of
strong
emotion
mankind
disdain
all
base
considerations
*punct* ;
but
such
times
are
evanescent
*punct* .
*break*
the
permanent
constitutional
condition
of
the
manufactured
man
*punct* ,
thought
ahab
*punct* ,
is
sordidness
*punct* .
*break*
granting
that
the
white
whale
fully
incites
the
hearts
of
this
my
savage
crew
*punct* ,
and
playing
round
their
savageness
even
breeds
a
certain
generous
knight-errantism
in
them
*punct* ,
still
*punct* ,
while
for
the
love
of
it
they
give
chase
to
moby
dick
*punct* ,
they
must
also
have
food
for
their
more
common
*punct* ,
daily
appetites
*punct* .
*break*
for
even
the
high
lifted
and
chivalric
crusaders
of
old
times
were
not
content
to
traverse
two
thousand
miles
of
land
to
fight
for
their
holy
sepulchre
*punct* ,
without
committing
burglaries
*punct* ,
picking
pockets
*punct* ,
and
gaining
other
pious
perquisites
by
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
had
they
been
strictly
held
to
their
one
final
and
romantic
object
*punct* ,
that
final
and
romantic
object
*punct* ,
too
many
would
have
turned
from
in
disgust
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
not
strip
these
men
*punct* ,
thought
ahab
*punct* ,
of
all
hopes
of
cash
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
cash
*punct* .
*break*
they
may
scorn
cash
now
*punct* ;
but
let
some
months
go
by
*punct* ,
and
no
perspective
promise
of
it
to
them
*punct* ,
and
then
this
same
quiescent
cash
all
at
once
mutinying
in
them
*punct* ,
this
same
cash
would
soon
cashier
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
nor
was
there
wanting
still
another
precautionary
motive
more
related
to
ahab
personally
*punct* .
*break*
having
impulsively
*punct* ,
it
is
probable
*punct* ,
and
perhaps
somewhat
prematurely
revealed
the
prime
but
private
purpose
of
the
pequod's
voyage
*punct* ,
ahab
was
now
entirely
conscious
that
*punct* ,
in
so
doing
*punct* ,
he
had
indirectly
laid
himself
open
to
the
unanswerable
charge
of
usurpation
*punct* ;
and
with
perfect
impunity
*punct* ,
both
moral
and
legal
*punct* ,
his
crew
if
so
disposed
*punct* ,
and
to
that
end
competent
*punct* ,
could
refuse
all
further
obedience
to
him
*punct* ,
and
even
violently
wrest
from
him
the
command
*punct* .
*break*
from
even
the
barely
hinted
imputation
of
usurpation
*punct* ,
and
the
possible
consequences
of
such
a
suppressed
impression
gaining
ground
*punct* ,
ahab
must
of
course
have
been
most
anxious
to
protect
himself
*punct* .
*break*
for
all
these
reasons
then
*punct* ,
and
others
perhaps
too
analytic
to
be
verbally
developed
here
*punct* ,
ahab
plainly
saw
that
he
must
still
in
a
good
degree
continue
true
to
the
natural
*punct* ,
nominal
purpose
of
the
pequod's
voyage
*punct* ;
observe
all
customary
usages
*punct* ;
and
not
only
that
*punct* ,
but
force
himself
to
evince
all
his
well
known
passionate
interest
in
the
general
pursuit
of
his
profession
*punct* .
*break*
be
all
this
as
it
may
*punct* ,
his
voice
was
now
often
heard
hailing
the
three
mast-heads
and
admonishing
them
to
keep
a
bright
look-out
*punct* ,
and
not
omit
reporting
even
a
porpoise
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
and
i
were
mildly
employed
weaving
what
is
called
a
sword-mat
*punct* ,
for
an
additional
lashing
to
our
boat
*punct* .
*break*
so
still
and
subdued
and
yet
somehow
preluding
was
all
the
scene
*punct* ,
and
such
an
incantation
of
revery
lurked
in
the
air
*punct* ,
that
each
silent
sailor
seemed
resolved
into
his
own
invisible
self
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
the
attendant
or
page
of
queequeg
*punct* ,
while
busy
at
the
mat
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
kept
passing
and
repassing
the
filling
or
woof
of
marline
between
the
long
yarns
of
the
warp
*punct* ,
using
my
own
hand
for
the
shuttle
*punct* ,
and
as
queequeg
*punct* ,
standing
sideways
*punct* ,
ever
and
anon
slid
his
heavy
oaken
sword
between
the
threads
*punct* ,
and
idly
looking
off
upon
the
water
*punct* ,
carelessly
and
unthinkingly
drove
home
every
yarn
*punct* :
i
say
so
strange
a
dreaminess
did
there
then
reign
all
over
the
ship
and
all
over
the
sea
*punct* ,
only
broken
by
the
intermitting
dull
sound
of
the
sword
*punct* ,
that
it
seemed
as
if
this
were
the
loom
of
time
*punct* ,
and
i
myself
were
a
shuttle
mechanically
weaving
and
weaving
away
at
the
fates
*punct* .
*break*
this
warp
seemed
necessity
*punct* ;
and
here
*punct* ,
thought
i
*punct* ,
with
my
own
hand
i
ply
my
own
shuttle
and
weave
my
own
destiny
into
these
unalterable
threads
*punct* .
*break*
meantime
*punct* ,
queequeg's
impulsive
*punct* ,
indifferent
sword
*punct* ,
sometimes
hitting
the
woof
slantingly
*punct* ,
or
crookedly
*punct* ,
or
strongly
*punct* ,
or
weakly
*punct* ,
as
the
case
might
be
*punct* ;
and
by
this
difference
in
the
concluding
blow
producing
a
corresponding
contrast
in
the
final
aspect
of
the
completed
fabric
*punct* ;
this
savage's
sword
*punct* ,
thought
i
*punct* ,
which
thus
finally
shapes
and
fashions
both
warp
and
woof
*punct* ;
this
easy
*punct* ,
indifferent
sword
must
be
chance
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
chance
*punct* ,
free
will
*punct* ,
and
necessity
*punct* ,
no
wise
incompatible
*punct* ,
all
interweavingly
working
together
*punct* .
*break*
the
straight
warp
of
necessity
*punct* ,
not
to
be
swerved
from
its
ultimate
course
*punct* ,
its
every
alternating
vibration
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
only
tending
to
that
*punct* ;
free
will
still
free
to
ply
her
shuttle
between
given
threads
*punct* ;
and
chance
*punct* ,
though
restrained
in
its
play
within
the
right
lines
of
necessity
*punct* ,
and
sideways
in
its
motions
directed
by
free
will
*punct* ,
though
thus
prescribed
to
by
both
*punct* ,
chance
by
turns
rules
either
*punct* ,
and
has
the
last
featuring
blow
at
events
*punct* .
*break*
thus
we
were
weaving
and
weaving
away
when
i
started
at
a
sound
so
strange
*punct* ,
long
drawn
*punct* ,
and
musically
wild
and
unearthly
*punct* ,
that
the
ball
of
free
will
dropped
from
my
hand
*punct* ,
and
i
stood
gazing
up
at
the
clouds
whence
that
voice
dropped
like
a
wing
*punct* .
*break*
high
aloft
in
the
cross-trees
was
that
mad
gay-header
*punct* ,
tashtego
*punct* .
*break*
his
body
was
reaching
eagerly
forward
*punct* ,
his
hand
stretched
out
like
a
wand
*punct* ,
and
at
brief
sudden
intervals
he
continued
his
cries
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
sure
the
same
sound
was
that
very
moment
perhaps
being
heard
all
over
the
seas
*punct* ,
from
hundreds
of
whalemen's
look-outs
perched
as
high
in
the
air
*punct* ;
but
from
few
of
those
lungs
could
that
accustomed
old
cry
have
derived
such
a
marvellous
cadence
as
from
tashtego
the
indian's
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
stood
hovering
over
you
half
suspended
in
air
*punct* ,
so
wildly
and
eagerly
peering
towards
the
horizon
*punct* ,
you
would
have
thought
him
some
prophet
or
seer
beholding
the
shadows
of
fate
*punct* ,
and
by
those
wild
cries
announcing
their
coming
*punct* .
*break*
there
she
blows
*punct* !
*break*
on
the
lee-beam
*punct* ,
about
two
miles
off
*punct* !
*break*
a
school
of
them
*punct* !
*break*
instantly
all
was
commotion
*punct* .
*break*
the
sperm
whale
blows
as
a
clock
ticks
*punct* ,
with
the
same
undeviating
and
reliable
uniformity
*punct* .
*break*
and
thereby
whalemen
distinguish
this
fish
from
other
tribes
of
his
genus
*punct* .
*break*
there
go
flukes
*punct* !
*break*
was
now
the
cry
from
tashtego
*punct* ;
and
the
whales
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
quick
*punct* ,
steward
*punct* !
*break*
dough-boy
hurried
below
*punct* ,
glanced
at
the
watch
*punct* ,
and
reported
the
exact
minute
to
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
the
ship
was
now
kept
away
from
the
wind
*punct* ,
and
she
went
gently
rolling
before
it
*punct* .
*break*
tashtego
reporting
that
the
whales
had
gone
down
heading
to
leeward
*punct* ,
we
confidently
looked
to
see
them
again
directly
in
advance
of
our
bows
*punct* .
*break*
for
that
singular
craft
at
times
evinced
by
the
sperm
whale
when
*punct* ,
sounding
with
his
head
in
one
direction
*punct* ,
he
nevertheless
*punct* ,
while
concealed
beneath
the
surface
*punct* ,
mills
round
*punct* ,
and
swiftly
swims
off
in
the
opposite
quarter
*punct* ,
this
deceitfulness
of
his
could
not
now
be
in
action
*punct* ;
for
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
fish
seen
by
tashtego
had
been
in
any
way
alarmed
*punct* ,
or
indeed
knew
at
all
of
our
vicinity
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
the
men
selected
for
shipkeepers
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
those
not
appointed
to
the
boats
*punct* ,
by
this
time
relieved
the
indian
at
the
main-mast
head
*punct* .
*break*
the
sailors
at
the
fore
and
mizzen
had
come
down
*punct* ;
the
line
tubs
were
fixed
in
their
places
*punct* ;
the
cranes
were
thrust
out
*punct* ;
the
mainyard
was
backed
*punct* ,
and
the
three
boats
swung
over
the
sea
like
three
samphire
baskets
over
high
cliffs
*punct* .
*break*
outside
of
the
bulwarks
their
eager
crews
with
one
hand
clung
to
the
rail
*punct* ,
while
one
foot
was
expectantly
poised
on
the
gunwale
*punct* .
*break*
so
look
the
long
line
of
man-of-war's
men
about
to
throw
themselves
on
board
an
enemy's
ship
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
this
critical
instant
a
sudden
exclamation
was
heard
that
took
every
eye
from
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
this
boat
had
always
been
deemed
one
of
the
spare
boats
*punct* ,
though
technically
called
the
captain's
*punct* ,
on
account
of
its
hanging
from
the
starboard
quarter
*punct* .
*break*
the
figure
that
now
stood
by
its
bows
was
tall
and
swart
*punct* ,
with
one
white
tooth
evilly
protruding
from
its
steel-like
lips
*punct* .
*break*
a
rumpled
chinese
jacket
of
black
cotton
funereally
invested
him
*punct* ,
with
wide
black
trowsers
of
the
same
dark
stuff
*punct* .
*break*
but
strangely
crowning
his
ebonness
was
a
glistening
white
plaited
turban
*punct* ,
the
living
hair
braided
and
coiled
round
and
round
upon
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
less
swart
in
aspect
*punct* ,
the
companions
of
this
figure
were
of
that
vivid
*punct* ,
tiger-yellow
complexion
peculiar
to
some
of
the
aboriginal
natives
of
the
manillas;
*punct* ,
a
race
notorious
for
a
certain
diabolism
of
subtilty
*punct* ,
and
by
some
honest
white
mariners
supposed
to
be
the
paid
spies
and
secret
confidential
agents
on
the
water
of
the
devil
*punct* ,
their
lord
*punct* ,
whose
counting-room
they
suppose
to
be
elsewhere
*punct* .
*break*
while
yet
the
wondering
ship's
company
were
gazing
upon
these
strangers
*punct* ,
ahab
cried
out
to
the
white-turbaned
old
man
at
their
head
*punct* ,
all
ready
there
*punct* ,
fedallah
*punct* ?
*break*
ready
*punct* ,
was
the
half-hissed
reply
*punct* .
*break*
lower
away
then
*punct* ;
d'ye
hear
*punct* ?
*break*
shouting
across
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
lower
away
there
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* .
*break*
such
was
the
thunder
of
his
voice
*punct* ,
that
spite
of
their
amazement
the
men
sprang
over
the
rail
*punct* ;
the
sheaves
whirled
round
in
the
blocks
*punct* ;
with
a
wallow
*punct* ,
the
three
boats
dropped
into
the
sea
*punct* ;
while
*punct* ,
with
a
dexterous
*punct* ,
off-handed
daring
*punct* ,
unknown
in
any
other
vocation
*punct* ,
the
sailors
*punct* ,
goat-like
*punct* ,
leaped
down
the
rolling
ship's
side
into
the
tossed
boats
below
*punct* .
*break*
but
with
all
their
eyes
again
riveted
upon
the
swart
fedallah
and
his
crew
*punct* ,
the
inmates
of
the
other
boats
obeyed
not
the
command
*punct* .
*break*
captain
ahab?
*punct* ,
said
starbuck
*punct* .
*break*
spread
yourselves
*punct* ,
cried
ahab
*punct* ;
give
way
*punct* ,
all
four
boats
*punct* .
*break*
thou
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ,
pull
out
more
to
leeward
*punct* !
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
cheerily
cried
little
king-post
*punct* ,
sweeping
round
his
great
steering
oar
*punct* .
*break*
addressing
his
crew
*punct* .
*break*
there!
*punct* ,
there!
*punct* ,
there
again
*punct* !
*break*
there
she
blows
right
ahead
*punct* ,

*punct* ,
lay
back
*punct* !
*break*
never

yonder
yellow
boys
*punct* ,
archy
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
i
don't
mind
em
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
archy
*punct* ;
i
knew
it
all
before
now
*punct* .
*break*
didn't
i
hear
em
in
the
hold
*punct* ?
*break*
and
didn't
i
tell
cabaco
here
of
it
*punct* ?
*break*
what
say
ye
*punct* ,
cabaco
*punct* ?
*break*
they
are
stowaways
*punct* ,
mr.
flask
*punct* .
*break*
pull
*punct* ,
pull
*punct* ,
my
fine
hearts-alive
*punct* ;
pull
*punct* ,
my
children
*punct* ;
pull
*punct* ,
my
little
ones
*punct* ,
drawingly
and
soothingly
sighed
stubb
to
his
crew
*punct* ,
some
of
whom
still
showed
signs
of
uneasiness
*punct* .
*break*
why
don't
you
break
your
backbones
*punct* ,
my
boys
*punct* ?
*break*
what
is
it
you
stare
at
*punct* ?
*break*
those
chaps
in
yonder
boat
*punct* ?
*break*
they
are
only
five
more
hands
come
to
help
us
*punct* ,
never
mind
from
where
*punct* ,
the
more
the
merrier
*punct* .
*break*
pull
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
do
pull
*punct* ;
never
mind
the
brimstone
*punct* ,
devils
are
good
fellows
enough
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ;
there
you
are
now
*punct* ;
that's
the
stroke
for
a
thousand
pounds
*punct* ;
that's
the
stroke
to
sweep
the
stakes
*punct* !
*break*
hurrah
for
the
gold
cup
of
sperm
oil
*punct* ,
my
heroes
*punct* !
*break*
three
cheers
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
all
hearts
alive

*break*
easy
*punct* ,
easy
*punct* ;
don't
be
in
a
hurry
*punct* ,
don't
be
in
a
hurry
*punct* .
*break*
why
don't
you
snap
your
oars
*punct* ,
you
rascals
*punct* ?
*break*
bite
something
*punct* ,
you
dogs
*punct* !
*break*
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ,
then;
*punct* ,
softly
*punct* ,
softly

*break*
that's

*punct* ,
that's

*break*
long
and
strong
*punct* .
*break*
give
way
there
*punct* ,
give
way
*punct* !
*break*
the
devil
fetch
ye
*punct* ,
ye
ragamuffin
rapscallions
*punct* ;
ye
are
all
asleep
*punct* .
*break*
stop
snoring
*punct* ,
ye
sleepers
*punct* ,
and
pull
*punct* .
*break*
pull
*punct* ,
will
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
pull
*punct* ,
can't
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
pull
*punct* ,
won't
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
why
in
the
name
of
gudgeons
and
ginger-cakes
don't
ye
pull?
*punct* ,
pull
and
break
something
*punct* !
*break*
whipping
out
the
sharp
knife
from
his
girdle
*punct* ;
every
mother's
son
of
ye
draw
his
knife
*punct* ,
and
pull
with
the
blade
between
his
teeth
*punct* .
*break*
that's
it
*punct* ,
that's
it
*punct* .
*break*
now
ye
do
something
*punct* ;
that
looks
like

*punct* ,
my
steel-bits
*punct* .
*break*
start
her
*punct* ,
start
her
*punct* ,
my
silver-spoons
*punct* !
*break*
start
her
*punct* ,
marling-spikes
*punct* !
*break*
stubb's
exordium
to
his
crew
is
given
here
at
large
*punct* ,
because
he
had
rather
a
peculiar
way
of
talking
to
them
in
general
*punct* ,
and
especially
in
inculcating
the
religion
of
rowing
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
must
not
suppose
from
this
specimen
of
his
sermonizings
that
he
ever
flew
into
downright
passions
with
his
congregation
*punct* .
*break*
not
at
all
*punct* ;
and
therein
consisted
his
chief
peculiarity
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
say
the
most
terrific
things
to
his
crew
*punct* ,
in
a
tone
so
strangely
compounded
of
fun
and
fury
*punct* ,
and
the
fury
seemed
so
calculated
merely
as
a
spice
to
the
fun
*punct* ,
that
no
oarsman
could
hear
such
queer
invocations
without
pulling
for
dear
life
*punct* ,
and
yet
pulling
for
the
mere
joke
of
the
thing
*punct* .
*break*
besides
he
all
the
time
looked
so
easy
and
indolent
himself
*punct* ,
so
loungingly
managed
his
steering-oar
*punct* ,
and
so
broadly
gaped
*punct* ,
open-mouthed
at
times
*punct* ,
that
the
mere
sight
of
such
a
yawning
commander
*punct* ,
by
sheer
force
of
contrast
*punct* ,
acted
like
a
charm
upon
the
crew
*punct* .
*break*
then
again
*punct* ,
stubb
was
one
of
those
odd
sort
of
humorists
*punct* ,
whose
jollity
is
sometimes
so
curiously
ambiguous
*punct* ,
as
to
put
all
inferiors
on
their
guard
in
the
matter
of
obeying
them
*punct* .
*break*
in
obedience
to
a
sign
from
ahab
*punct* ,
starbuck
was
now
pulling
obliquely
across
stubb's
bow
*punct* ;
and
when
for
a
minute
or
so
the
two
boats
were
pretty
near
to
each
other
*punct* ,
stubb
hailed
the
mate
*punct* .
*break*
larboard
boat
there
*punct* ,
ahoy
*punct* !
*break*
a
word
with
ye
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
if
ye
please
*punct* !
*break*
returned
starbuck
*punct* ,
turning
round
not
a
single
inch
as
he
spoke
*punct* ;
still
earnestly
but
whisperingly
urging
his
crew
*punct* ;
his
face
set
like
a
flint
from
stubb's
*punct* .
*break*
what
think
ye
of
those
yellow
boys
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
smuggled
on
board
*punct* ,
somehow
*punct* ,
before
the
ship
sailed
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
strong
*punct* ,
strong
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* !
*break*
*punct* ,
in
a
whisper
to
his
crew
*punct* ,
then
speaking
out
loud
again
*punct* :
a
sad
business
*punct* ,
mr.
stubb
*punct* !
*break*
*punct* ,
seethe
her
*punct* ,
seethe
her
*punct* ,
my
lads!
*punct* ,
but
never
mind
*punct* ,
mr.
stubb
*punct* ,
all
for
the
best
*punct* .
*break*
let
all
your
crew
pull
strong
*punct* ,
come
what
will
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
pull
*punct* ,
my
boys!
*punct* ,
sperm
*punct* ,
sperm's
the
play
*punct* !
*break*
this
at
least
is
duty
*punct* ;
duty
and
profit
hand
in
hand
*punct* !
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
i
thought
as
much
*punct* ,
soliloquized
stubb
*punct* ,
when
the
boats
diverged
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
i
clapt
eye
on
em
*punct* ,
i
thought
so
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
and
that's
what
he
went
into
the
after
hold
for
*punct* ,
so
often
*punct* ,
as
dough-boy
long
suspected
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
hidden
down
there
*punct* .
*break*
the
white
whale's
at
the
bottom
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
so
be
it
*punct* !
*break*
can't
be
helped
*punct* !
*break*
give
way
*punct* ,
men
*punct* !
*break*
it
ain't
the
white
whale
to-day
*punct* !
*break*
now
the
advent
of
these
outlandish
strangers
at
such
a
critical
instant
as
the
lowering
of
the
boats
from
the
deck
*punct* ,
this
had
not
unreasonably
awakened
a
sort
of
superstitious
amazement
in
some
of
the
ship's
company
*punct* ;
but
archy's
fancied
discovery
having
some
time
previous
got
abroad
among
them
*punct* ,
though
indeed
not
credited
then
*punct* ,
this
had
in
some
small
measure
prepared
them
for
the
event
*punct* .
*break*
it
took
off
the
extreme
edge
of
their
wonder
*punct* ;
and
so
what
with
all
this
and
stubb's
confident
way
of
accounting
for
their
appearance
*punct* ,
they
were
for
the
time
freed
from
superstitious
surmisings
*punct* ;
though
the
affair
still
left
abundant
room
for
all
manner
of
wild
conjectures
as
to
dark
ahab's
precise
agency
in
the
matter
from
the
beginning
*punct* .
*break*
for
me
*punct* ,
i
silently
recalled
the
mysterious
shadows
i
had
seen
creeping
on
board
the
pequod
during
the
dim
nantucket
dawn
*punct* ,
as
well
as
the
enigmatical
hintings
of
the
unaccountable
elijah
*punct* .
*break*
meantime
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* ,
out
of
hearing
of
his
officers
*punct* ,
having
sided
the
furthest
to
windward
*punct* ,
was
still
ranging
ahead
of
the
other
boats
*punct* ;
a
circumstance
bespeaking
how
potent
a
crew
was
pulling
him
*punct* .
*break*
those
tiger
yellow
creatures
of
his
seemed
all
steel
and
whale-bone
*punct* ;
like
five
trip-hammers
they
rose
and
fell
with
regular
strokes
of
strength
*punct* ,
which
periodically
started
the
boat
along
the
water
like
a
horizontal
burst
boiler
out
of
a
mississippi
steamer
*punct* .
*break*
all
at
once
the
out-stretched
arm
gave
a
peculiar
motion
and
then
remained
fixed
*punct* ,
while
the
boat's
five
oars
were
seen
simultaneously
peaked
*punct* .
*break*
boat
and
crew
sat
motionless
on
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
instantly
the
three
spread
boats
in
the
rear
paused
on
their
way
*punct* .
*break*
the
whales
had
irregularly
settled
bodily
down
into
the
blue
*punct* ,
thus
giving
no
distantly
discernible
token
of
the
movement
*punct* ,
though
from
his
closer
vicinity
ahab
had
observed
it
*punct* .
*break*
every
man
look
out
along
his
oars
*punct* !
*break*
thou
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
stand
up
*punct* !
*break*
nimbly
springing
up
on
the
triangular
raised
box
in
the
bow
*punct* ,
the
savage
stood
erect
there
*punct* ,
and
with
intensely
eager
eyes
gazed
off
towards
the
spot
where
the
chase
had
last
been
descried
*punct* .
*break*
likewise
upon
the
extreme
stern
of
the
boat
where
it
was
also
triangularly
platformed
level
with
the
gunwale
*punct* ,
starbuck
himself
was
seen
coolly
and
adroitly
balancing
himself
to
the
jerking
tossings
of
his
chip
of
a
craft
*punct* ,
and
silently
eyeing
the
vast
blue
eye
of
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
not
very
far
distant
flask's
boat
was
also
lying
breathlessly
still
*punct* ;
its
commander
recklessly
standing
upon
the
top
of
the
loggerhead
*punct* ,
a
stout
sort
of
post
rooted
in
the
keel
*punct* ,
and
rising
some
two
feet
above
the
level
of
the
stern
platform
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
used
for
catching
turns
with
the
whale
line
*punct* .
*break*
its
top
is
not
more
spacious
than
the
palm
of
a
man's
hand
*punct* ,
and
standing
upon
such
a
base
as
that
*punct* ,
flask
seemed
perched
at
the
mast-head
of
some
ship
which
had
sunk
to
all
but
her
trucks
*punct* .
*break*
but
little
king-post
was
small
and
short
*punct* ,
and
at
the
same
time
little
king-post
was
full
of
a
large
and
tall
ambition
*punct* ,
so
that
this
loggerhead
stand-point
of
his
did
by
no
means
satisfy
king-post
*punct* .
*break*
i
can't
see
three
seas
off
*punct* ;
tip
us
up
an
oar
there
*punct* ,
and
let
me
on
to
that
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
mount
*punct* ?
*break*
that
i
will
*punct* ,
and
thank
ye
very
much
*punct* ,
my
fine
fellow
*punct* ;
only
i
wish
you
fifty
feet
taller
*punct* .
*break*
whereupon
planting
his
feet
firmly
against
two
opposite
planks
of
the
boat
*punct* ,
the
gigantic
negro
*punct* ,
stooping
a
little
*punct* ,
presented
his
flat
palm
to
flask's
foot
*punct* ,
and
then
putting
flask's
hand
on
his
hearse-plumed
head
and
bidding
him
spring
as
he
himself
should
toss
*punct* ,
with
one
dexterous
fling
landed
the
little
man
high
and
dry
on
his
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
and
here
was
flask
now
standing
*punct* ,
daggoo
with
one
lifted
arm
furnishing
him
with
a
breast-band
to
lean
against
and
steady
himself
by
*punct* .
*break*
at
any
time
it
is
a
strange
sight
to
the
tyro
to
see
with
what
wondrous
habitude
of
unconscious
skill
the
whaleman
will
maintain
an
erect
posture
in
his
boat
*punct* ,
even
when
pitched
about
by
the
most
riotously
perverse
and
cross-running
seas
*punct* .
*break*
still
more
strange
to
see
him
giddily
perched
upon
the
loggerhead
itself
*punct* ,
under
such
circumstances
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
sight
of
little
flask
mounted
upon
gigantic
daggoo
was
yet
more
curious
*punct* ;
for
sustaining
himself
with
a
cool
*punct* ,
indifferent
*punct* ,
easy
*punct* ,
unthought
of
*punct* ,
barbaric
majesty
*punct* ,
the
noble
negro
to
every
roll
of
the
sea
harmoniously
rolled
his
fine
form
*punct* .
*break*
on
his
broad
back
*punct* ,
flaxen-haired
flask
seemed
a
snow-flake
*punct* .
*break*
the
bearer
looked
nobler
than
the
rider
*punct* .
*break*
though
truly
vivacious
*punct* ,
tumultuous
*punct* ,
ostentatious
little
flask
would
now
and
then
stamp
with
impatience
*punct* ;
but
not
one
added
heave
did
he
thereby
give
to
the
negro's
lordly
chest
*punct* .
*break*
so
have
i
seen
passion
and
vanity
stamping
the
living
magnanimous
earth
*punct* ,
but
the
earth
did
not
alter
her
tides
and
her
seasons
for
that
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
stubb
*punct* ,
the
third
mate
*punct* ,
betrayed
no
such
far-gazing
solicitudes
*punct* .
*break*
the
whales
might
have
made
one
of
their
regular
soundings
*punct* ,
not
a
temporary
dive
from
mere
fright
*punct* ;
and
if
that
were
the
case
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ,
as
his
wont
in
such
cases
*punct* ,
it
seems
*punct* ,
was
resolved
to
solace
the
languishing
interval
with
his
pipe
*punct* .
*break*
he
withdrew
it
from
his
hatband
*punct* ,
where
he
always
wore
it
aslant
like
a
feather
*punct* .
*break*
to
a
landsman
*punct* ,
no
whale
*punct* ,
nor
any
sign
of
a
herring
*punct* ,
would
have
been
visible
at
that
moment
*punct* ;
nothing
but
a
troubled
bit
of
greenish
white
water
*punct* ,
and
thin
scattered
puffs
of
vapor
hovering
over
it
*punct* ,
and
suffusingly
blowing
off
to
leeward
*punct* ,
like
the
confused
scud
from
white
rolling
billows
*punct* .
*break*
the
air
around
suddenly
vibrated
and
tingled
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ,
like
the
air
over
intensely
heated
plates
of
iron
*punct* .
*break*
beneath
this
atmospheric
waving
and
curling
*punct* ,
and
partially
beneath
a
thin
layer
of
water
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
the
whales
were
swimming
*punct* .
*break*
seen
in
advance
of
all
the
other
indications
*punct* ,
the
puffs
of
vapor
they
spouted
*punct* ,
seemed
their
forerunning
couriers
and
detached
flying
outriders
*punct* .
*break*
all
four
boats
were
now
in
keen
pursuit
of
that
one
spot
of
troubled
water
and
air
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
bade
far
to
outstrip
them
*punct* ;
it
flew
on
and
on
*punct* ,
as
a
mass
of
interblending
bubbles
borne
down
a
rapid
stream
from
the
hills
*punct* .
*break*
pull
*punct* ,
pull
*punct* ,
my
good
boys
*punct* ,
said
starbuck
*punct* ,
in
the
lowest
possible
but
intensest
concentrated
whisper
to
his
men
*punct* ;
while
the
sharp
fixed
glance
from
his
eyes
darted
straight
ahead
of
the
bow
*punct* ,
almost
seemed
as
two
visible
needles
in
two
unerring
binnacle
compasses
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
say
much
to
his
crew
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
nor
did
his
crew
say
anything
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
only
the
silence
of
the
boat
was
at
intervals
startlingly
pierced
by
one
of
his
peculiar
whispers
*punct* ,
now
harsh
with
command
*punct* ,
now
soft
with
entreaty
*punct* .
*break*
how
different
the
loud
little
king-post
*punct* .
*break*
sing
out
and
say
something
*punct* ,
my
hearties
*punct* .
*break*
roar
and
pull
*punct* ,
my
thunderbolts
*punct* !
*break*
beach
me
*punct* ,
beach
me
on
their
black
backs
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* ;
only
do
that
for
me
*punct* ,
and
i'll
sign
over
to
you
my
martha's
vineyard
plantation
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* ;
including
wife
and
children
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* .
*break*
lay
me
on
*punct* ,
lay
me
on
*punct* !
*break*
o
lord
*punct* ,
lord
*punct* !
*break*
but
i
shall
go
stark
*punct* ,
staring
mad
*punct* :
see
*punct* !
*break*
see
that
white
water
*punct* !
*break*
and
so
shouting
*punct* ,
he
pulled
his
hat
from
his
head
*punct* ,
and
stamped
up
and
down
on
it
*punct* ;
then
picking
it
up
*punct* ,
flirted
it
far
off
upon
the
sea
*punct* ;
and
finally
fell
to
rearing
and
plunging
in
the
boat's
stern
like
a
crazed
colt
from
the
prairie
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
give
him
fits
*punct* ,
that's
the
very
word
*punct* ,
pitch
fits
into
em
*punct* .
*break*
merrily
*punct* ,
merrily
*punct* ,
hearts-alive
*punct* .
*break*
pudding
for
supper
*punct* ,
you
know;
*punct* ,
merry's
the
word
*punct* .
*break*
pull
*punct* ,
babes
*punct* ,
pull
*punct* ,
sucklings
*punct* ,
pull
*punct* ,
all
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
the
devil
are
you
hurrying
about
*punct* ?
*break*
softly
*punct* ,
softly
*punct* ,
and
steadily
*punct* ,
my
men
*punct* .
*break*
only
pull
*punct* ,
and
keep
pulling
*punct* ;
nothing
more
*punct* .
*break*
crack
all
your
backbones
*punct* ,
and
bite
your
knives
in
two
*punct* ,
that's
all
*punct* .
*break*
take
it
easy
*punct* ,
why
don't
ye
take
it
easy
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
and
burst
all
your
livers
and
lungs
*punct* !
*break*
but
what
it
was
that
inscrutable
ahab
said
to
that
tiger-yellow
crew
of
his
*punct* ,
these
were
words
best
omitted
here
*punct* ;
for
you
live
under
the
blessed
light
of
the
evangelical
land
*punct* .
*break*
only
the
infidel
sharks
in
the
audacious
seas
may
give
ear
to
such
words
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
with
tornado
brow
*punct* ,
and
eyes
of
red
murder
*punct* ,
and
foam-glued
lips
*punct* ,
ahab
leaped
after
his
prey
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
*punct* ,
all
the
boats
tore
on
*punct* .
*break*
the
repeated
specific
allusions
of
flask
to
that
whale
*punct* ,
as
he
called
the
fictitious
monster
which
he
declared
to
be
incessantly
tantalizing
his
boat's
bow
with
its
tail
*punct* ,
these
allusions
of
his
were
at
times
so
vivid
and
life-like
*punct* ,
that
they
would
cause
some
one
or
two
of
his
men
to
snatch
a
fearful
look
over
the
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
was
against
all
rule
*punct* ;
for
the
oarsmen
must
put
out
their
eyes
*punct* ,
and
ram
a
skewer
through
their
necks
*punct* ;
usage
pronouncing
that
they
must
have
no
organs
but
ears
*punct* ,
and
no
limbs
but
arms
*punct* ,
in
these
critical
moments
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
sight
full
of
quick
wonder
and
awe
*punct* !
*break*
the
vast
swells
of
the
omnipotent
sea
*punct* ;
the
surging
*punct* ,
hollow
roar
they
made
*punct* ,
as
they
rolled
along
the
eight
gunwales
*punct* ,
like
gigantic
bowls
in
a
boundless
bowling-green
*punct* ;
the
brief
suspended
agony
of
the
boat
*punct* ,
as
it
would
tip
for
an
instant
on
the
knife-like
edge
of
the
sharper
waves
*punct* ,
that
almost
seemed
threatening
to
cut
it
in
two
*punct* ;
the
sudden
profound
dip
into
the
watery
glens
and
hollows
*punct* ;
the
keen
spurrings
and
goadings
to
gain
the
top
of
the
opposite
hill
*punct* ;
the
headlong
*punct* ,
sled-like
slide
down
its
other
side;
*punct* ,
all
these
*punct* ,
with
the
cries
of
the
headsmen
and
harpooneers
*punct* ,
and
the
shuddering
gasps
of
the
oarsmen
*punct* ,
with
the
wondrous
sight
of
the
ivory
pequod
bearing
down
upon
her
boats
with
outstretched
sails
*punct* ,
like
a
wild
hen
after
her
screaming
brood;
*punct* ,
all
this
was
thrilling
*punct* .
*break*
the
dancing
white
water
made
by
the
chase
was
now
becoming
more
and
more
visible
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
increasing
darkness
of
the
dun
cloud-shadows
flung
upon
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
the
jets
of
vapor
no
longer
blended
*punct* ,
but
tilted
everywhere
to
right
and
left
*punct* ;
the
whales
seemed
separating
their
wakes
*punct* .
*break*
the
boats
were
pulled
more
apart
*punct* ;
starbuck
giving
chase
to
three
whales
running
dead
to
leeward
*punct* .
*break*
our
sail
was
now
set
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
with
the
still
rising
wind
*punct* ,
we
rushed
along
*punct* ;
the
boat
going
with
such
madness
through
the
water
*punct* ,
that
the
lee
oars
could
scarcely
be
worked
rapidly
enough
to
escape
being
torn
from
the
row-locks
*punct* .
*break*
soon
we
were
running
through
a
suffusing
wide
veil
of
mist
*punct* ;
neither
ship
nor
boat
to
be
seen
*punct* .
*break*
give
way
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
whispered
starbuck
*punct* ,
drawing
still
further
aft
the
sheet
of
his
sail
*punct* ;
there
is
time
to
kill
a
fish
yet
before
the
squall
comes
*punct* .
*break*
there's
white
water
again!
*punct* ,
close
to
*punct* !
*break*
soon
after
*punct* ,
two
cries
in
quick
succession
on
each
side
of
us
denoted
that
the
other
boats
had
got
fast
*punct* ;
but
hardly
were
they
overheard
*punct* ,
when
with
a
lightning-like
hurtling
whisper
starbuck
said
*punct* :
stand
up
*punct* !
*break*
and
queequeg
*punct* ,
harpoon
in
hand
*punct* ,
sprang
to
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
though
not
one
of
the
oarsmen
was
then
facing
the
life
and
death
peril
so
close
to
them
ahead
*punct* ,
yet
with
their
eyes
on
the
intense
countenance
of
the
mate
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
*punct* ,
they
knew
that
the
imminent
instant
had
come
*punct* ;
they
heard
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
an
enormous
wallowing
sound
as
of
fifty
elephants
stirring
in
their
litter
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
the
boat
was
still
booming
through
the
mist
*punct* ,
the
waves
curling
and
hissing
around
us
like
the
erected
crests
of
enraged
serpents
*punct* .
*break*
that's
his
hump
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ,
give
it
to
him
*punct* !
*break*
a
short
rushing
sound
leaped
out
of
the
boat
*punct* ;
it
was
the
darted
iron
of
queequeg
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
crew
were
half
suffocated
as
they
were
tossed
helter-skelter
into
the
white
curdling
cream
of
the
squall
*punct* .
*break*
squall
*punct* ,
whale
*punct* ,
and
harpoon
had
all
blended
together
*punct* ;
and
the
whale
*punct* ,
merely
grazed
by
the
iron
*punct* ,
escaped
*punct* .
*break*
though
completely
swamped
*punct* ,
the
boat
was
nearly
unharmed
*punct* .
*break*
swimming
round
it
we
picked
up
the
floating
oars
*punct* ,
and
lashing
them
across
the
gunwale
*punct* ,
tumbled
back
to
our
places
*punct* .
*break*
there
we
sat
up
to
our
knees
in
the
sea
*punct* ,
the
water
covering
every
rib
and
plank
*punct* ,
so
that
to
our
downward
gazing
eyes
the
suspended
craft
seemed
a
coral
boat
grown
up
to
us
from
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
*punct* .
*break*
the
wind
increased
to
a
howl
*punct* ;
the
waves
dashed
their
bucklers
together
*punct* ;
the
whole
squall
roared
*punct* ,
forked
*punct* ,
and
crackled
around
us
like
a
white
fire
upon
the
prairie
*punct* ,
in
which
*punct* ,
unconsumed
*punct* ,
we
were
burning
*punct* ;
immortal
in
these
jaws
of
death
*punct* !
*break*
in
vain
we
hailed
the
other
boats
*punct* ;
as
well
roar
to
the
live
coals
down
the
chimney
of
a
flaming
furnace
as
hail
those
boats
in
that
storm
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
the
driving
scud
*punct* ,
rack
*punct* ,
and
mist
*punct* ,
grew
darker
with
the
shadows
of
night
*punct* ;
no
sign
of
the
ship
could
be
seen
*punct* .
*break*
the
rising
sea
forbade
all
attempts
to
bale
out
the
boat
*punct* .
*break*
the
oars
were
useless
as
propellers
*punct* ,
performing
now
the
office
of
life-preservers
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
cutting
the
lashing
of
the
water-proof
match
keg
*punct* ,
after
many
failures
starbuck
contrived
to
ignite
the
lamp
in
the
lantern
*punct* ;
then
stretching
it
on
a
waif
pole
*punct* ,
handed
it
to
queequeg
as
the
standard-bearer
of
this
forlorn
hope
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
he
sat
*punct* ,
holding
up
that
imbecile
candle
in
the
heart
of
that
almighty
forlornness
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
he
sat
*punct* ,
the
sign
and
symbol
of
a
man
without
faith
*punct* ,
hopelessly
holding
up
hope
in
the
midst
of
despair
*punct* .
*break*
wet
*punct* ,
drenched
through
*punct* ,
and
shivering
cold
*punct* ,
despairing
of
ship
or
boat
*punct* ,
we
lifted
up
our
eyes
as
the
dawn
came
on
*punct* .
*break*
the
mist
still
spread
over
the
sea
*punct* ,
the
empty
lantern
lay
crushed
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
queequeg
started
to
his
feet
*punct* ,
hollowing
his
hand
to
his
ear
*punct* .
*break*
we
all
heard
a
faint
creaking
*punct* ,
as
of
ropes
and
yards
hitherto
muffled
by
the
storm
*punct* .
*break*
affrighted
*punct* ,
we
all
sprang
into
the
sea
as
the
ship
at
last
loomed
into
view
*punct* ,
bearing
right
down
upon
us
within
a
distance
of
not
much
more
than
its
length
*punct* .
*break*
floating
on
the
waves
we
saw
the
abandoned
boat
*punct* ,
as
for
one
instant
it
tossed
and
gaped
beneath
the
ship's
bows
like
a
chip
at
the
base
of
a
cataract
*punct* ;
and
then
the
vast
hull
rolled
over
it
*punct* ,
and
it
was
seen
no
more
till
it
came
up
weltering
astern
*punct* .
*break*
again
we
swam
for
it
*punct* ,
were
dashed
against
it
by
the
seas
*punct* ,
and
were
at
last
taken
up
and
safely
landed
on
board
*punct* .
*break*
ere
the
squall
came
close
to
*punct* ,
the
other
boats
had
cut
loose
from
their
fish
and
returned
to
the
ship
in
good
time
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
nothing
dispirits
*punct* ,
and
nothing
seems
worth
while
disputing
*punct* .
*break*
he
bolts
down
all
events
*punct* ,
all
creeds
*punct* ,
and
beliefs
*punct* ,
and
persuasions
*punct* ,
all
hard
things
visible
and
invisible
*punct* ,
never
mind
how
knobby
*punct* ;
as
an
ostrich
of
potent
digestion
gobbles
down
bullets
and
gun
flints
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
for
small
difficulties
and
worryings
*punct* ,
prospects
of
sudden
disaster
*punct* ,
peril
of
life
and
limb
*punct* ;
all
these
*punct* ,
and
death
itself
*punct* ,
seem
to
him
only
sly
*punct* ,
good-natured
hits
*punct* ,
and
jolly
punches
in
the
side
bestowed
by
the
unseen
and
unaccountable
old
joker
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
nothing
like
the
perils
of
whaling
to
breed
this
free
and
easy
sort
of
genial
*punct* ,
desperado
philosophy
*punct* ;
and
with
it
i
now
regarded
this
whole
voyage
of
the
pequod
*punct* ,
and
the
great
white
whale
its
object
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
when
they
had
dragged
me
*punct* ,
the
last
man
*punct* ,
to
the
deck
*punct* ,
and
i
was
still
shaking
myself
in
my
jacket
to
fling
off
the
water
*punct* ;
queequeg
*punct* ,
my
fine
friend
*punct* ,
does
this
sort
of
thing
often
happen
*punct* ?
*break*
without
much
emotion
*punct* ,
though
soaked
through
just
like
me
*punct* ,
he
gave
me
to
understand
that
such
things
did
often
happen
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
stubb
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
turning
to
that
worthy
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
buttoned
up
in
his
oil-jacket
*punct* ,
was
now
calmly
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
rain
*punct* ;
mr.
stubb
*punct* ,
i
think
i
have
heard
you
say
that
of
all
whalemen
you
ever
met
*punct* ,
our
chief
mate
*punct* ,
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ,
is
by
far
the
most
careful
and
prudent
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
then
*punct* ,
that
going
plump
on
a
flying
whale
with
your
sail
set
in
a
foggy
squall
is
the
height
of
a
whaleman's
discretion
*punct* ?
*break*
i've
lowered
for
whales
from
a
leaking
ship
in
a
gale
off
cape
horn
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
flask
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
turning
to
little
king-post
*punct* ,
who
was
standing
close
by
*punct* ;
you
are
experienced
in
these
things
*punct* ,
and
i
am
not
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
tell
me
whether
it
is
an
unalterable
law
in
this
fishery
*punct* ,
mr.
flask
*punct* ,
for
an
oarsman
to
break
his
own
back
pulling
himself
back-foremost
into
death's
jaws
*punct* ?
*break*
can't
you
twist
that
smaller
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
that's
the
law
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
like
to
see
a
boat's
crew
backing
water
up
to
a
whale
face
foremost
*punct* .
*break*
ha
*punct* ,
ha
*punct* !
*break*
the
whale
would
give
them
squint
for
squint
*punct* ,
mind
that
*punct* !
*break*
here
then
*punct* ,
from
three
impartial
witnesses
*punct* ,
i
had
a
deliberate
statement
of
the
entire
case
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
come
along
*punct* ,
you
shall
be
my
lawyer
*punct* ,
executor
*punct* ,
and
legatee
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
seem
strange
that
of
all
men
sailors
should
be
tinkering
at
their
last
wills
and
testaments
*punct* ,
but
there
are
no
people
in
the
world
more
fond
of
that
diversion
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
the
fourth
time
in
my
nautical
life
that
i
had
done
the
same
thing
*punct* .
*break*
after
the
ceremony
was
concluded
upon
the
present
occasion
*punct* ,
i
felt
all
the
easier
*punct* ;
a
stone
was
rolled
away
from
my
heart
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
all
the
days
i
should
now
live
would
be
as
good
as
the
days
that
lazarus
lived
after
his
resurrection
*punct* ;
a
supplementary
clean
gain
of
so
many
months
or
weeks
as
the
case
might
be
*punct* .
*break*
i
survived
myself
*punct* ;
my
death
and
burial
were
locked
up
in
my
chest
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
round
me
tranquilly
and
contentedly
*punct* ,
like
a
quiet
ghost
with
a
clean
conscience
sitting
inside
the
bars
of
a
snug
family
vault
*punct* .
*break*
cried
stubb
*punct* ;
if
i
had
but
one
leg
you
would
not
catch
me
in
a
boat
*punct* ,
unless
maybe
to
stop
the
plug-hole
with
my
timber
toe
*punct* .
*break*
he's
a
wonderful
old
man
*punct* !
*break*
if
his
leg
were
off
at
the
hip
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
it
would
be
a
different
thing
*punct* .
*break*
that
would
disable
him
*punct* ;
but
he
has
one
knee
*punct* ,
and
good
part
of
the
other
left
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
that
*punct* ,
my
little
man
*punct* ;
i
never
yet
saw
him
kneel
*punct* .
*break*
among
whale-wise
people
it
has
often
been
argued
whether
*punct* ,
considering
the
paramount
importance
of
his
life
to
the
success
of
the
voyage
*punct* ,
it
is
right
for
a
whaling
captain
to
jeopardize
that
life
in
the
active
perils
of
the
chase
*punct* .
*break*
so
tamerlane's
soldiers
often
argued
with
tears
in
their
eyes
*punct* ,
whether
that
invaluable
life
of
his
ought
to
be
carried
into
the
thickest
of
the
fight
*punct* .
*break*
but
with
ahab
the
question
assumed
a
modified
aspect
*punct* .
*break*
considering
that
with
two
legs
man
is
but
a
hobbling
wight
in
all
times
of
danger
*punct* ;
considering
that
the
pursuit
of
whales
is
always
under
great
and
extraordinary
difficulties
*punct* ;
that
every
individual
moment
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
then
comprises
a
peril
*punct* ;
under
these
circumstances
is
it
wise
for
any
maimed
man
to
enter
a
whale-boat
in
the
hunt
*punct* ?
*break*
as
a
general
thing
*punct* ,
the
joint-owners
of
the
pequod
must
have
plainly
thought
not
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
well
knew
that
although
his
friends
at
home
would
think
little
of
his
entering
a
boat
in
certain
comparatively
harmless
vicissitudes
of
the
chase
*punct* ,
for
the
sake
of
being
near
the
scene
of
action
and
giving
his
orders
in
person
*punct* ,
yet
for
captain
ahab
to
have
a
boat
actually
apportioned
to
him
as
a
regular
headsman
in
the
hunt
*punct* ,
above
all
for
captain
ahab
to
be
supplied
with
five
extra
men
*punct* ,
as
that
same
boat's
crew
*punct* ,
he
well
knew
that
such
generous
conceits
never
entered
the
heads
of
the
owners
of
the
pequod
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
he
had
not
solicited
a
boat's
crew
from
them
*punct* ,
nor
had
he
in
any
way
hinted
his
desires
on
that
head
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
he
had
taken
private
measures
of
his
own
touching
all
that
matter
*punct* .
*break*
but
almost
everybody
supposed
that
this
particular
preparative
heedfulness
in
ahab
must
only
be
with
a
view
to
the
ultimate
chase
of
moby
dick
*punct* ;
for
he
had
already
revealed
his
intention
to
hunt
that
mortal
monster
in
person
*punct* .
*break*
but
such
a
supposition
did
by
no
means
involve
the
remotest
suspicion
as
to
any
boat's
crew
being
assigned
to
that
boat
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
with
the
subordinate
phantoms
*punct* ,
what
wonder
remained
soon
waned
away
*punct* ;
for
in
a
whaler
wonders
soon
wane
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
now
and
then
such
unaccountable
odds
and
ends
of
strange
nations
come
up
from
the
unknown
nooks
and
ash-holes
of
the
earth
to
man
these
floating
outlaws
of
whalers
*punct* ;
and
the
ships
themselves
often
pick
up
such
queer
castaway
creatures
found
tossing
about
the
open
sea
on
planks
*punct* ,
bits
of
wreck
*punct* ,
oars
*punct* ,
whale-boats
*punct* ,
canoes
*punct* ,
blown-off
japanese
junks
*punct* ,
and
what
not
*punct* ;
that
beelzebub
himself
might
climb
up
the
side
and
step
down
into
the
cabin
to
chat
with
the
captain
*punct* ,
and
it
would
not
create
any
unsubduable
excitement
in
the
forecastle
*punct* .
*break*
but
be
all
this
as
it
may
*punct* ,
certain
it
is
that
while
the
subordinate
phantoms
soon
found
their
place
among
the
crew
*punct* ,
though
still
as
it
were
somehow
distinct
from
them
*punct* ,
yet
that
hair-turbaned
fedallah
remained
a
muffled
mystery
to
the
last
*punct* .
*break*
whence
he
came
in
a
mannerly
world
like
this
*punct* ,
by
what
sort
of
unaccountable
tie
he
soon
evinced
himself
to
be
linked
with
ahab's
peculiar
fortunes
*punct* ;
nay
*punct* ,
so
far
as
to
have
some
sort
of
a
half-hinted
influence
*punct* ;
heaven
knows
*punct* ,
but
it
might
have
been
even
authority
over
him
*punct* ;
all
this
none
knew
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
while
gliding
through
these
latter
waters
that
one
serene
and
moonlight
night
*punct* ,
when
all
the
waves
rolled
by
like
scrolls
of
silver
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
by
their
soft
*punct* ,
suffusing
seethings
*punct* ,
made
what
seemed
a
silvery
silence
*punct* ,
not
a
solitude
*punct* :
on
such
a
silent
night
a
silvery
jet
was
seen
far
in
advance
of
the
white
bubbles
at
the
bow
*punct* .
*break*
lit
up
by
the
moon
*punct* ,
it
looked
celestial
*punct* ;
seemed
some
plumed
and
glittering
god
uprising
from
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
fedallah
first
descried
this
jet
*punct* .
*break*
for
of
these
moonlight
nights
*punct* ,
it
was
his
wont
to
mount
to
the
main-mast
head
*punct* ,
and
stand
a
look-out
there
*punct* ,
with
the
same
precision
as
if
it
had
been
day
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
think
with
what
emotions
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
the
seamen
beheld
this
old
oriental
perched
aloft
at
such
unusual
hours
*punct* ;
his
turban
and
the
moon
*punct* ,
companions
in
one
sky
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
*punct* ,
after
spending
his
uniform
interval
there
for
several
successive
nights
without
uttering
a
single
sound
*punct* ;
when
*punct* ,
after
all
this
silence
*punct* ,
his
unearthly
voice
was
heard
announcing
that
silvery
*punct* ,
moon-lit
jet
*punct* ,
every
reclining
mariner
started
to
his
feet
as
if
some
winged
spirit
had
lighted
in
the
rigging
*punct* ,
and
hailed
the
mortal
crew
*punct* .
*break*
there
she
blows
*punct* !
*break*
had
the
trump
of
judgment
blown
*punct* ,
they
could
not
have
quivered
more
*punct* ;
yet
still
they
felt
no
terror
*punct* ;
rather
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
for
though
it
was
a
most
unwonted
hour
*punct* ,
yet
so
impressive
was
the
cry
*punct* ,
and
so
deliriously
exciting
*punct* ,
that
almost
every
soul
on
board
instinctively
desired
a
lowering
*punct* .
*break*
walking
the
deck
with
quick
*punct* ,
side-lunging
strides
*punct* ,
ahab
commanded
the
t'gallant
sails
and
royals
to
be
set
*punct* ,
and
every
stunsail
spread
*punct* .
*break*
the
best
man
in
the
ship
must
take
the
helm
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
with
every
mast-head
manned
*punct* ,
the
piled-up
craft
rolled
down
before
the
wind
*punct* .
*break*
the
strange
*punct* ,
upheaving
*punct* ,
lifting
tendency
of
the
taffrail
breeze
filling
the
hollows
of
so
many
sails
*punct* ,
made
the
buoyant
*punct* ,
hovering
deck
to
feel
like
air
beneath
the
feet
*punct* ;
while
still
she
rushed
along
*punct* ,
as
if
two
antagonistic
influences
were
struggling
in
her
*punct* ,
one
to
mount
direct
to
heaven
*punct* ,
the
other
to
drive
yawingly
to
some
horizontal
goal
*punct* .
*break*
and
had
you
watched
ahab's
face
that
night
*punct* ,
you
would
have
thought
that
in
him
also
two
different
things
were
warring
*punct* .
*break*
while
his
one
live
leg
made
lively
echoes
along
the
deck
*punct* ,
every
stroke
of
his
dead
limb
sounded
like
a
coffin-tap
*punct* .
*break*
on
life
and
death
this
old
man
walked
*punct* .
*break*
but
though
the
ship
so
swiftly
sped
*punct* ,
and
though
from
every
eye
*punct* ,
like
arrows
*punct* ,
the
eager
glances
shot
*punct* ,
yet
the
silvery
jet
was
no
more
seen
that
night
*punct* .
*break*
every
sailor
swore
he
saw
it
once
*punct* ,
but
not
a
second
time
*punct* .
*break*
this
midnight-spout
had
almost
grown
a
forgotten
thing
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
some
days
after
*punct* ,
lo
*punct* !
*break*
at
the
same
silent
hour
*punct* ,
it
was
again
announced
*punct* :
again
it
was
descried
by
all
*punct* ;
but
upon
making
sail
to
overtake
it
*punct* ,
once
more
it
disappeared
as
if
it
had
never
been
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
it
served
us
night
after
night
*punct* ,
till
no
one
heeded
it
but
to
wonder
at
it
*punct* .
*break*
nor
with
the
immemorial
superstition
of
their
race
*punct* ,
and
in
accordance
with
the
preternaturalness
*punct* ,
as
it
seemed
*punct* ,
which
in
many
things
invested
the
pequod
*punct* ,
were
there
wanting
some
of
the
seamen
who
swore
that
whenever
and
wherever
descried
*punct* ;
at
however
remote
times
*punct* ,
or
in
however
far
apart
latitudes
and
longitudes
*punct* ,
that
unnearable
spout
was
cast
by
one
self-same
whale
*punct* ;
and
that
whale
*punct* ,
moby
dick
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
time
*punct* ,
there
reigned
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
a
sense
of
peculiar
dread
at
this
flitting
apparition
*punct* ,
as
if
it
were
treacherously
beckoning
us
on
and
on
*punct* ,
in
order
that
the
monster
might
turn
round
upon
us
*punct* ,
and
rend
us
at
last
in
the
remotest
and
most
savage
seas
*punct* .
*break*
these
temporary
apprehensions
*punct* ,
so
vague
but
so
awful
*punct* ,
derived
a
wondrous
potency
from
the
contrasting
serenity
of
the
weather
*punct* ,
in
which
*punct* ,
beneath
all
its
blue
blandness
*punct* ,
some
thought
there
lurked
a
devilish
charm
*punct* ,
as
for
days
and
days
we
voyaged
along
*punct* ,
through
seas
so
wearily
*punct* ,
lonesomely
mild
*punct* ,
that
all
space
*punct* ,
in
repugnance
to
our
vengeful
errand
*punct* ,
seemed
vacating
itself
of
life
before
our
urn-like
prow
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
at
last
*punct* ,
when
turning
to
the
eastward
*punct* ,
the
cape
winds
began
howling
around
us
*punct* ,
and
we
rose
and
fell
upon
the
long
*punct* ,
troubled
seas
that
are
there
*punct* ;
when
the
ivory-tusked
pequod
sharply
bowed
to
the
blast
*punct* ,
and
gored
the
dark
waves
in
her
madness
*punct* ,
till
*punct* ,
like
showers
of
silver
chips
*punct* ,
the
foam-flakes
flew
over
her
bulwarks
*punct* ;
then
all
this
desolate
vacuity
of
life
went
away
*punct* ,
but
gave
place
to
sights
more
dismal
than
before
*punct* .
*break*
close
to
our
bows
*punct* ,
strange
forms
in
the
water
darted
hither
and
thither
before
us
*punct* ;
while
thick
in
our
rear
flew
the
inscrutable
sea-ravens
*punct* .
*break*
and
every
morning
*punct* ,
perched
on
our
stays
*punct* ,
rows
of
these
birds
were
seen
*punct* ;
and
spite
of
our
hootings
*punct* ,
for
a
long
time
obstinately
clung
to
the
hemp
*punct* ,
as
though
they
deemed
our
ship
some
drifting
*punct* ,
uninhabited
craft
*punct* ;
a
thing
appointed
to
desolation
*punct* ,
and
therefore
fit
roosting-place
for
their
homeless
selves
*punct* .
*break*
cape
of
good
hope
*punct* ,
do
they
call
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
rather
cape
tormentoto
*punct* ,
as
called
of
yore
*punct* ;
for
long
allured
by
the
perfidious
silences
that
before
had
attended
us
*punct* ,
we
found
ourselves
launched
into
this
tormented
sea
*punct* ,
where
guilty
beings
transformed
into
those
fowls
and
these
fish
*punct* ,
seemed
condemned
to
swim
on
everlastingly
without
any
haven
in
store
*punct* ,
or
beat
that
black
air
without
any
horizon
*punct* .
*break*
but
calm
*punct* ,
snow-white
*punct* ,
and
unvarying
*punct* ;
still
directing
its
fountain
of
feathers
to
the
sky
*punct* ;
still
beckoning
us
on
from
before
*punct* ,
the
solitary
jet
would
at
times
be
descried
*punct* .
*break*
during
all
this
blackness
of
the
elements
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* ,
though
assuming
for
the
time
the
almost
continual
command
of
the
drenched
and
dangerous
deck
*punct* ,
manifested
the
gloomiest
reserve
*punct* ;
and
more
seldom
than
ever
addressed
his
mates
*punct* .
*break*
in
tempestuous
times
like
these
*punct* ,
after
everything
above
and
aloft
has
been
secured
*punct* ,
nothing
more
can
be
done
but
passively
to
await
the
issue
of
the
gale
*punct* .
*break*
then
captain
and
crew
become
practical
fatalists
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
with
his
ivory
leg
inserted
into
its
accustomed
hole
*punct* ,
and
with
one
hand
firmly
grasping
a
shroud
*punct* ,
ahab
for
hours
and
hours
would
stand
gazing
dead
to
windward
*punct* ,
while
an
occasional
squall
of
sleet
or
snow
would
all
but
congeal
his
very
eyelashes
together
*punct* .
*break*
meantime
*punct* ,
the
crew
driven
from
the
forward
part
of
the
ship
by
the
perilous
seas
that
burstingly
broke
over
its
bows
*punct* ,
stood
in
a
line
along
the
bulwarks
in
the
waist
*punct* ;
and
the
better
to
guard
against
the
leaping
waves
*punct* ,
each
man
had
slipped
himself
into
a
sort
of
bowline
secured
to
the
rail
*punct* ,
in
which
he
swung
as
in
a
loosened
belt
*punct* .
*break*
few
or
no
words
were
spoken
*punct* ;
and
the
silent
ship
*punct* ,
as
if
manned
by
painted
sailors
in
wax
*punct* ,
day
after
day
tore
on
through
all
the
swift
madness
and
gladness
of
the
demoniac
waves
*punct* .
*break*
by
night
the
same
muteness
of
humanity
before
the
shrieks
of
the
ocean
prevailed
*punct* ;
still
in
silence
the
men
swung
in
the
bowlines
*punct* ;
still
wordless
ahab
stood
up
to
the
blast
*punct* .
*break*
even
when
wearied
nature
seemed
demanding
repose
he
would
not
seek
that
repose
in
his
hammock
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
table
beside
him
lay
unrolled
one
of
those
charts
of
tides
and
currents
which
have
previously
been
spoken
of
*punct* .
*break*
his
lantern
swung
from
his
tightly
clenched
hand
*punct* .
*break*
though
the
body
was
erect
*punct* ,
the
head
was
thrown
back
so
that
the
closed
eyes
were
pointed
towards
the
needle
of
the
tell-tale
that
swung
from
a
beam
in
the
ceiling
*punct* .
*break*
terrible
old
man
*punct* !
*break*
as
she
slowly
drew
nigh
*punct* ,
from
my
lofty
perch
at
the
fore-mast-head
*punct* ,
i
had
a
good
view
of
that
sight
so
remarkable
to
a
tyro
in
the
far
ocean
fisheries
*punct* ,
a
whaler
at
sea
*punct* ,
and
long
absent
from
home
*punct* .
*break*
as
if
the
waves
had
been
fullers
*punct* ,
this
craft
was
bleached
like
the
skeleton
of
a
stranded
walrus
*punct* .
*break*
all
down
her
sides
*punct* ,
this
spectral
appearance
was
traced
with
long
channels
of
reddened
rust
*punct* ,
while
all
her
spars
and
her
rigging
were
like
the
thick
branches
of
trees
furred
over
with
hoar-frost
*punct* .
*break*
only
her
lower
sails
were
set
*punct* .
*break*
a
wild
sight
it
was
to
see
her
long-bearded
look-outs
at
those
three
mast-heads
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
clad
in
the
skins
of
beasts
*punct* ,
so
torn
and
bepatched
the
raiment
that
had
survived
nearly
four
years
of
cruising
*punct* .
*break*
have
ye
seen
the
white
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
but
as
the
strange
captain
*punct* ,
leaning
over
the
pallid
bulwarks
*punct* ,
was
in
the
act
of
putting
his
trumpet
to
his
mouth
*punct* ,
it
somehow
fell
from
his
hand
into
the
sea
*punct* ;
and
the
wind
now
rising
amain
*punct* ,
he
in
vain
strove
to
make
himself
heard
without
it
*punct* .
*break*
meantime
his
ship
was
still
increasing
the
distance
between
*punct* .
*break*
while
in
various
silent
ways
the
seamen
of
the
pequod
were
evincing
their
observance
of
this
ominous
incident
at
the
first
mere
mention
of
the
white
whale's
name
to
another
ship
*punct* ,
ahab
for
a
moment
paused
*punct* ;
it
almost
seemed
as
though
he
would
have
lowered
a
boat
to
board
the
stranger
*punct* ,
had
not
the
threatening
wind
forbade
*punct* .
*break*
but
taking
advantage
of
his
windward
position
*punct* ,
he
again
seized
his
trumpet
*punct* ,
and
knowing
by
her
aspect
that
the
stranger
vessel
was
a
nantucketer
and
shortly
bound
home
*punct* ,
he
loudly
hailed
*punct* ,
ahoy
there
*punct* !
*break*
this
is
the
pequod
*punct* ,
bound
round
the
world
*punct* !
*break*
tell
them
to
address
all
future
letters
to
the
pacific
ocean
*punct* !
*break*
and
this
time
three
years
*punct* ,
if
i
am
not
at
home
*punct* ,
tell
them
to
address
them
to
*punct* ,
at
that
moment
the
two
wakes
were
fairly
crossed
*punct* ,
and
instantly
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
in
accordance
with
their
singular
ways
*punct* ,
shoals
of
small
harmless
fish
*punct* ,
that
for
some
days
before
had
been
placidly
swimming
by
our
side
*punct* ,
darted
away
with
what
seemed
shuddering
fins
*punct* ,
and
ranged
themselves
fore
and
aft
with
the
stranger's
flanks
*punct* .
*break*
though
in
the
course
of
his
continual
voyagings
ahab
must
often
before
have
noticed
a
similar
sight
*punct* ,
yet
*punct* ,
to
any
monomaniac
man
*punct* ,
the
veriest
trifles
capriciously
carry
meanings
*punct* .
*break*
swim
away
from
me
*punct* ,
do
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
murmured
ahab
*punct* ,
gazing
over
into
the
water
*punct* .
*break*
there
seemed
but
little
in
the
words
*punct* ,
but
the
tone
conveyed
more
of
deep
helpless
sadness
than
the
insane
old
man
had
ever
before
evinced
*punct* .
*break*
keep
her
off
round
the
world
*punct* !
*break*
round
the
world
*punct* !
*break*
there
is
much
in
that
sound
to
inspire
proud
feelings
*punct* ;
but
whereto
does
all
that
circumnavigation
conduct
*punct* ?
*break*
only
through
numberless
perils
to
the
very
point
whence
we
started
*punct* ,
where
those
that
we
left
behind
secure
*punct* ,
were
all
the
time
before
us
*punct* .
*break*
were
this
world
an
endless
plain
*punct* ,
and
by
sailing
eastward
we
could
for
ever
reach
new
distances
*punct* ,
and
discover
sights
more
sweet
and
strange
than
any
cyclades
or
islands
of
king
solomon
*punct* ,
then
there
were
promise
in
the
voyage
*punct* .
*break*
but
even
had
this
not
been
the
case
*punct* ,
he
would
not
after
all
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
have
boarded
her
*punct* ,
judging
by
his
subsequent
conduct
on
similar
occasions
*punct* ,
if
so
it
had
been
that
*punct* ,
by
the
process
of
hailing
*punct* ,
he
had
obtained
a
negative
answer
to
the
question
he
put
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
as
it
eventually
turned
out
*punct* ,
he
cared
not
to
consort
*punct* ,
even
for
five
minutes
*punct* ,
with
any
stranger
captain
*punct* ,
except
he
could
contribute
some
of
that
information
he
so
absorbingly
sought
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
this
might
remain
inadequately
estimated
*punct* ,
were
not
something
said
here
of
the
peculiar
usages
of
whaling-vessels
when
meeting
each
other
in
foreign
seas
*punct* ,
and
especially
on
a
common
cruising-ground
*punct* .
*break*
and
especially
would
this
seem
to
be
a
matter
of
course
*punct* ,
in
the
case
of
vessels
owned
in
one
seaport
*punct* ,
and
whose
captains
*punct* ,
officers
*punct* ,
and
not
a
few
of
the
men
are
personally
known
to
each
other
*punct* ;
and
consequently
*punct* ,
have
all
sorts
of
dear
domestic
things
to
talk
about
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
long
absent
ship
*punct* ,
the
outward-bounder
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
has
letters
on
board
*punct* ;
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
she
will
be
sure
to
let
her
have
some
papers
of
a
date
a
year
or
two
later
than
the
last
one
on
her
blurred
and
thumb-worn
files
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
return
for
that
courtesy
*punct* ,
the
outward-bound
ship
would
receive
the
latest
whaling
intelligence
from
the
cruising-ground
to
which
she
may
be
destined
*punct* ,
a
thing
of
the
utmost
importance
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
degree
*punct* ,
all
this
will
hold
true
concerning
whaling
vessels
crossing
each
other's
track
on
the
cruising-ground
itself
*punct* ,
even
though
they
are
equally
long
absent
from
home
*punct* .
*break*
for
one
of
them
may
have
received
a
transfer
of
letters
from
some
third
*punct* ,
and
now
far
remote
vessel
*punct* ;
and
some
of
those
letters
may
be
for
the
people
of
the
ship
she
now
meets
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
they
would
exchange
the
whaling
news
*punct* ,
and
have
an
agreeable
chat
*punct* .
*break*
for
not
only
would
they
meet
with
all
the
sympathies
of
sailors
*punct* ,
but
likewise
with
all
the
peculiar
congenialities
arising
from
a
common
pursuit
and
mutually
shared
privations
and
perils
*punct* .
*break*
nor
would
difference
of
country
make
any
very
essential
difference
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
so
long
as
both
parties
speak
one
language
*punct* ,
as
is
the
case
with
americans
and
english
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
the
english
whalers
sometimes
affect
a
kind
of
metropolitan
superiority
over
the
american
whalers
*punct* ;
regarding
the
long
*punct* ,
lean
nantucketer
*punct* ,
with
his
nondescript
provincialisms
*punct* ,
as
a
sort
of
sea-peasant
*punct* .
*break*
but
where
this
superiority
in
the
english
whalemen
does
really
consist
*punct* ,
it
would
be
hard
to
say
*punct* ,
seeing
that
the
yankees
in
one
day
*punct* ,
collectively
*punct* ,
kill
more
whales
than
all
the
english
*punct* ,
collectively
*punct* ,
in
ten
years
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
is
a
harmless
little
foible
in
the
english
whale-hunters
*punct* ,
which
the
nantucketer
does
not
take
much
to
heart
*punct* ;
probably
*punct* ,
because
he
knows
that
he
has
a
few
foibles
himself
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
we
see
that
of
all
ships
separately
sailing
the
sea
*punct* ,
the
whalers
have
most
reason
to
be
sociable
*punct* ,
and
they
are
so
*punct* .
*break*
whereas
*punct* ,
some
merchant
ships
crossing
each
other's
wake
in
the
mid-atlantic
*punct* ,
will
oftentimes
pass
on
without
so
much
as
a
single
word
of
recognition
*punct* ,
mutually
cutting
each
other
on
the
high
seas
*punct* ,
like
a
brace
of
dandies
in
broadway
*punct* ;
and
all
the
time
indulging
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
in
finical
criticism
upon
each
other's
rig
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
men-of-war
*punct* ,
when
they
chance
to
meet
at
sea
*punct* ,
they
first
go
through
such
a
string
of
silly
bowings
and
scrapings
*punct* ,
such
a
ducking
of
ensigns
*punct* ,
that
there
does
not
seem
to
be
much
right-down
hearty
good-will
and
brotherly
love
about
it
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
as
touching
slave-ships
meeting
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
they
are
in
such
a
prodigious
hurry
*punct* ,
they
run
away
from
each
other
as
soon
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
for
pirates
*punct* ,
when
they
chance
to
cross
each
other's
cross-bones
*punct* ,
the
first
hail
is
*punct* ,
how
many
skulls?
*punct* ,
the
same
way
that
whalers
hail
*punct* ,
how
many
barrels
*punct* ?
*break*
and
that
question
once
answered
*punct* ,
pirates
straightway
steer
apart
*punct* ,
for
they
are
infernal
villains
on
both
sides
*punct* ,
and
don't
like
to
see
overmuch
of
each
other's
villanous
likenesses
*punct* .
*break*
but
look
at
the
godly
*punct* ,
honest
*punct* ,
unostentatious
*punct* ,
hospitable
*punct* ,
sociable
*punct* ,
free-and-easy
whaler
*punct* !
*break*
what
does
the
whaler
do
when
she
meets
another
whaler
in
any
sort
of
decent
weather
*punct* ?
*break*
she
has
a
gam
*punct* ,
a
thing
so
utterly
unknown
to
all
other
ships
that
they
never
heard
of
the
name
even
*punct* ;
and
if
by
chance
they
should
hear
of
it
*punct* ,
they
only
grin
at
it
*punct* ,
and
repeat
gamesome
stuff
about
spouters
and
blubber-boilers
*punct* ,
and
such
like
pretty
exclamations
*punct* .
*break*
because
*punct* ,
in
the
case
of
pirates
*punct* ,
say
*punct* ,
i
should
like
to
know
whether
that
profession
of
theirs
has
any
peculiar
glory
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
sometimes
ends
in
uncommon
elevation
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ;
but
only
at
the
gallows
*punct* .
*break*
and
besides
*punct* ,
when
a
man
is
elevated
in
that
odd
fashion
*punct* ,
he
has
no
proper
foundation
for
his
superior
altitude
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
i
conclude
*punct* ,
that
in
boasting
himself
to
be
high
lifted
above
a
whaleman
*punct* ,
in
that
assertion
the
pirate
has
no
solid
basis
to
stand
on
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
is
a
gam
*punct* ?
*break*
you
might
wear
out
your
index-finger
running
up
and
down
the
columns
of
dictionaries
*punct* ,
and
never
find
the
word
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
johnson
never
attained
to
that
erudition
*punct* ;
noah
webster's
ark
does
not
hold
it
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
this
same
expressive
word
has
now
for
many
years
been
in
constant
use
among
some
fifteen
thousand
true
born
yankees
*punct* .
*break*
certainly
it
needs
a
definition
*punct* ,
and
should
be
incorporated
into
the
lexicon
*punct* .
*break*
with
that
view
*punct* ,
let
me
learnedly
define
it
*punct* .
*break*
noun
*punct* ,
a
social
meeting
of
two
*punct* ,
or
more
*punct* ,
whale-ships
*punct* ,
generally
on
a
cruising-ground
*punct* ;
when
*punct* ,
after
exchanging
hails
*punct* ,
they
exchange
visits
by
boats
crews
*punct* :
the
two
captains
remaining
*punct* ,
for
the
time
*punct* ,
on
board
of
one
ship
*punct* ,
and
the
two
chief
mates
on
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
another
little
item
about
gamming
which
must
not
be
forgotten
here
*punct* .
*break*
all
professions
have
their
own
little
peculiarities
of
detail
*punct* ;
so
has
the
whale
fishery
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
pirate
*punct* ,
man-of-war
*punct* ,
or
slave
ship
*punct* ,
when
the
captain
is
rowed
anywhere
in
his
boat
*punct* ,
he
always
sits
in
the
stern
sheets
on
a
comfortable
*punct* ,
sometimes
cushioned
seat
there
*punct* ,
and
often
steers
himself
with
a
pretty
little
milliner's
tiller
decorated
with
gay
cords
and
ribbons
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
whale-boat
has
no
seat
astern
*punct* ,
no
sofa
of
that
sort
whatever
*punct* ,
and
no
tiller
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
high
times
indeed
*punct* ,
if
whaling
captains
were
wheeled
about
the
water
on
castors
like
gouty
old
aldermen
in
patent
chairs
*punct* .
*break*
and
often
you
will
notice
that
being
conscious
of
the
eyes
of
the
whole
visible
world
resting
on
him
from
the
sides
of
the
two
ships
*punct* ,
this
standing
captain
is
all
alive
to
the
importance
of
sustaining
his
dignity
by
maintaining
his
legs
*punct* .
*break*
nor
is
this
any
very
easy
matter
*punct* ;
for
in
his
rear
is
the
immense
projecting
steering
oar
hitting
him
now
and
then
in
the
small
of
his
back
*punct* ,
the
after-oar
reciprocating
by
rapping
his
knees
in
front
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
thus
completely
wedged
before
and
behind
*punct* ,
and
can
only
expand
himself
sideways
by
settling
down
on
his
stretched
legs
*punct* ;
but
a
sudden
*punct* ,
violent
pitch
of
the
boat
will
often
go
far
to
topple
him
*punct* ,
because
length
of
foundation
is
nothing
without
corresponding
breadth
*punct* .
*break*
merely
make
a
spread
angle
of
two
poles
*punct* ,
and
you
cannot
stand
them
up
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
it
would
never
do
in
plain
sight
of
the
world's
riveted
eyes
*punct* ,
it
would
never
do
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
for
this
straddling
captain
to
be
seen
steadying
himself
the
slightest
particle
by
catching
hold
of
anything
with
his
hands
*punct* ;
indeed
*punct* ,
as
token
of
his
entire
*punct* ,
buoyant
self-command
*punct* ,
he
generally
carries
his
hands
in
his
trowsers
pockets
*punct* ;
but
perhaps
being
generally
very
large
*punct* ,
heavy
hands
*punct* ,
he
carries
them
there
for
ballast
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
manned
almost
wholly
by
polynesians
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
short
gam
that
ensued
she
gave
us
strong
news
of
moby
dick
*punct* .
*break*
to
some
the
general
interest
in
the
white
whale
was
now
wildly
heightened
by
a
circumstance
of
the
town-ho's
story
*punct* ,
which
seemed
obscurely
to
involve
with
the
whale
a
certain
wondrous
*punct* ,
inverted
visitation
of
one
of
those
so
called
judgments
of
god
which
at
times
are
said
to
overtake
some
men
*punct* .
*break*
this
latter
circumstance
*punct* ,
with
its
own
particular
accompaniments
*punct* ,
forming
what
may
be
called
the
secret
part
of
the
tragedy
about
to
be
narrated
*punct* ,
never
reached
the
ears
of
captain
ahab
or
his
mates
*punct* .
*break*
for
that
secret
part
of
the
story
was
unknown
to
the
captain
of
the
town-ho
himself
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
private
property
of
three
confederate
white
seamen
of
that
ship
*punct* ,
one
of
whom
*punct* ,
it
seems
*punct* ,
communicated
it
to
tashtego
with
romish
injunctions
of
secresy
*punct* ,
but
the
following
night
tashtego
rambled
in
his
sleep
*punct* ,
and
revealed
so
much
of
it
in
that
way
*punct* ,
that
when
he
was
wakened
he
could
not
well
withhold
the
rest
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
so
potent
an
influence
did
this
thing
have
on
those
seamen
in
the
pequod
who
came
to
the
full
knowledge
of
it
*punct* ,
and
by
such
a
strange
delicacy
*punct* ,
to
call
it
so
*punct* ,
were
they
governed
in
this
matter
*punct* ,
that
they
kept
the
secret
among
themselves
so
that
it
never
transpired
abaft
the
pequod's
main-mast
*punct* .
*break*
interweaving
in
its
proper
place
this
darker
thread
with
the
story
as
publicly
narrated
on
the
ship
*punct* ,
the
whole
of
this
strange
affair
i
now
proceed
to
put
on
lasting
record
*punct* .
*break*
for
my
humor's
sake
*punct* ,
i
shall
preserve
the
style
in
which
i
once
narrated
it
at
lima
*punct* ,
to
a
lounging
circle
of
my
spanish
friends
*punct* ,
one
saint's
eve
*punct* ,
smoking
upon
the
thick-gilt
tiled
piazza
of
the
golden
inn
*punct* .
*break*
of
those
fine
cavaliers
*punct* ,
the
young
dons
*punct* ,
pedro
and
sebastian
*punct* ,
were
on
the
closer
terms
with
me
*punct* ;
and
hence
the
interluding
questions
they
occasionally
put
*punct* ,
and
which
are
duly
answered
at
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
somewhere
to
the
northward
of
the
line
*punct* .
*break*
one
morning
upon
handling
the
pumps
*punct* ,
according
to
daily
usage
*punct* ,
it
was
observed
that
she
made
more
water
in
her
hold
than
common
*punct* .
*break*
they
supposed
a
sword-fish
had
stabbed
her
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
captain
*punct* ,
having
some
unusual
reason
for
believing
that
rare
good
luck
awaited
him
in
those
latitudes
*punct* ;
and
therefore
being
very
averse
to
quit
them
*punct* ,
and
the
leak
not
being
then
considered
at
all
dangerous
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
they
could
not
find
it
after
searching
the
hold
as
low
down
as
was
possible
in
rather
heavy
weather
*punct* ,
the
ship
still
continued
her
cruisings
*punct* ,
the
mariners
working
at
the
pumps
at
wide
and
easy
intervals
*punct* ;
but
no
good
luck
came
*punct* ;
more
days
went
by
*punct* ,
and
not
only
was
the
leak
yet
undiscovered
*punct* ,
but
it
sensibly
increased
*punct* .
*break*
so
much
so
*punct* ,
that
now
taking
some
alarm
*punct* ,
the
captain
*punct* ,
making
all
sail
*punct* ,
stood
away
for
the
nearest
harbor
among
the
islands
*punct* ,
there
to
have
his
hull
hove
out
and
repaired
*punct* .
*break*
though
no
small
passage
was
before
her
*punct* ,
yet
*punct* ,
if
the
commonest
chance
favored
*punct* ,
he
did
not
at
all
fear
that
his
ship
would
founder
by
the
way
*punct* ,
because
his
pumps
were
of
the
best
*punct* ,
and
being
periodically
relieved
at
them
*punct* ,
those
six-and-thirty
men
of
his
could
easily
keep
the
ship
free
*punct* ;
never
mind
if
the
leak
should
double
on
her
*punct* .
*break*
in
truth
*punct* ,
well
nigh
the
whole
of
this
passage
being
attended
by
very
prosperous
breezes
*punct* ,
the
town-ho
had
all
but
certainly
arrived
in
perfect
safety
at
her
port
without
the
occurrence
of
the
least
fatality
*punct* ,
had
it
not
been
for
the
brutal
overbearing
of
radney
*punct* ,
the
mate
*punct* ,
a
vineyarder
*punct* ,
and
the
bitterly
provoked
vengeance
of
steelkilt
*punct* ,
a
lakeman
and
desperado
from
buffalo
*punct* .
*break*
lakeman!
*punct* ,
buffalo
*punct* !
*break*
pray
*punct* ,
what
is
a
lakeman
*punct* ,
and
where
is
buffalo
*punct* ?
*break*
said
don
sebastian
*punct* ,
rising
in
his
swinging
mat
of
grass
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
eastern
shore
of
our
lake
erie
*punct* ,
don
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
i
crave
your
courtesy
*punct* ,
may
be
*punct* ,
you
shall
soon
hear
further
of
all
that
*punct* .
*break*
for
in
their
interflowing
aggregate
*punct* ,
those
grand
fresh-water
seas
of
ours
*punct* ,
erie
*punct* ,
and
ontario
*punct* ,
and
huron
*punct* ,
and
superior
*punct* ,
and
michigan,
*punct* ,
possess
an
ocean-like
expansiveness
*punct* ,
with
many
of
the
ocean's
noblest
traits
*punct* ;
with
many
of
its
rimmed
varieties
of
races
and
of
climes
*punct* .
*break*
they
contain
round
archipelagoes
of
romantic
isles
*punct* ,
even
as
the
polynesian
waters
do
*punct* ;
in
large
part
*punct* ,
are
shored
by
two
great
contrasting
nations
*punct* ,
as
the
atlantic
is
*punct* ;
they
furnish
long
maritime
approaches
to
our
numerous
territorial
colonies
from
the
east
*punct* ,
dotted
all
round
their
banks
*punct* ;
here
and
there
are
frowned
upon
by
batteries
*punct* ,
and
by
the
goat-like
craggy
guns
of
lofty
mackinaw
*punct* ;
they
have
heard
the
fleet
thunderings
of
naval
victories
*punct* ;
at
intervals
*punct* ,
they
yield
their
beaches
to
wild
barbarians
*punct* ,
whose
red
painted
faces
flash
from
out
their
peltry
wigwams
*punct* ;
for
leagues
and
leagues
are
flanked
by
ancient
and
unentered
forests
*punct* ,
where
the
gaunt
pines
stand
like
serried
lines
of
kings
in
gothic
genealogies
*punct* ;
those
same
woods
harboring
wild
afric
beasts
of
prey
*punct* ,
and
silken
creatures
whose
exported
furs
give
robes
to
tartar
emperors
*punct* ;
they
mirror
the
paved
capitals
of
buffalo
and
cleveland
*punct* ,
as
well
as
winnebago
villages
*punct* ;
they
float
alike
the
full-rigged
merchant
ship
*punct* ,
the
armed
cruiser
of
the
state
*punct* ,
the
steamer
*punct* ,
and
the
beech
canoe
*punct* ;
they
are
swept
by
borean
and
dismasting
blasts
as
direful
as
any
that
lash
the
salted
wave
*punct* ;
they
know
what
shipwrecks
are
*punct* ,
for
out
of
sight
of
land
*punct* ,
however
inland
*punct* ,
they
have
drowned
full
many
a
midnight
ship
with
all
its
shrieking
crew
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
though
an
inlander
*punct* ,
steelkilt
was
wild-ocean
born
*punct* ,
and
wild-ocean
nurtured
*punct* ;
as
much
of
an
audacious
mariner
as
any
*punct* .
*break*
and
for
radney
*punct* ,
though
in
his
infancy
he
may
have
laid
him
down
on
the
lone
nantucket
beach
*punct* ,
to
nurse
at
his
maternal
sea
*punct* ;
though
in
after
life
he
had
long
followed
our
austere
atlantic
and
your
contemplative
pacific
*punct* ;
yet
was
he
quite
as
vengeful
and
full
of
social
quarrel
as
the
backwoods
seaman
*punct* ,
fresh
from
the
latitudes
of
buck-horn
handled
bowie-knives
*punct* .
*break*
at
all
events
*punct* ,
he
had
proved
so
thus
far
*punct* ;
but
radney
was
doomed
and
made
mad
*punct* ,
and
steelkilt
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
you
shall
hear
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
more
than
a
day
or
two
at
the
furthest
after
pointing
her
prow
for
her
island
haven
*punct* ,
that
the
town-ho's
leak
seemed
again
increasing
*punct* ,
but
only
so
as
to
require
an
hour
or
more
at
the
pumps
every
day
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
know
that
in
a
settled
and
civilized
ocean
like
our
atlantic
*punct* ,
for
example
*punct* ,
some
skippers
think
little
of
pumping
their
whole
way
across
it
*punct* ;
though
of
a
still
*punct* ,
sleepy
night
*punct* ,
should
the
officer
of
the
deck
happen
to
forget
his
duty
in
that
respect
*punct* ,
the
probability
would
be
that
he
and
his
shipmates
would
never
again
remember
it
*punct* ,
on
account
of
all
hands
gently
subsiding
to
the
bottom
*punct* .
*break*
nor
in
the
solitary
and
savage
seas
far
from
you
to
the
westward
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
is
it
altogether
unusual
for
ships
to
keep
clanging
at
their
pump-handles
in
full
chorus
even
for
a
voyage
of
considerable
length
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
if
it
lie
along
a
tolerably
accessible
coast
*punct* ,
or
if
any
other
reasonable
retreat
is
afforded
them
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
only
when
a
leaky
vessel
is
in
some
very
out
of
the
way
part
of
those
waters
*punct* ,
some
really
landless
latitude
*punct* ,
that
her
captain
begins
to
feel
a
little
anxious
*punct* .
*break*
much
this
way
had
it
been
with
the
town-ho
*punct* ;
so
when
her
leak
was
found
gaining
once
more
*punct* ,
there
was
in
truth
some
small
concern
manifested
by
several
of
her
company
*punct* ;
especially
by
radney
the
mate
*punct* .
*break*
he
commanded
the
upper
sails
to
be
well
hoisted
*punct* ,
sheeted
home
anew
*punct* ,
and
every
way
expanded
to
the
breeze
*punct* .
*break*
now
this
radney
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
was
as
little
of
a
coward
*punct* ,
and
as
little
inclined
to
any
sort
of
nervous
apprehensiveness
touching
his
own
person
as
any
fearless
*punct* ,
unthinking
creature
on
land
or
on
sea
that
you
can
conveniently
imagine
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
when
he
betrayed
this
solicitude
about
the
safety
of
the
ship
*punct* ,
some
of
the
seamen
declared
that
it
was
only
on
account
of
his
being
a
part
owner
in
her
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
as
you
well
know
*punct* ,
it
is
not
seldom
the
case
in
this
conventional
world
of
ours
*punct* ,
watery
or
otherwise
*punct* ;
that
when
a
person
placed
in
command
over
his
fellow-men
finds
one
of
them
to
be
very
significantly
his
superior
in
general
pride
of
manhood
*punct* ,
straightway
against
that
man
he
conceives
an
unconquerable
dislike
and
bitterness
*punct* ;
and
if
he
have
a
chance
he
will
pull
down
and
pulverize
that
subaltern's
tower
*punct* ,
and
make
a
little
heap
of
dust
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
be
this
conceit
of
mine
as
it
may
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
at
all
events
steelkilt
was
a
tall
and
noble
animal
with
a
head
like
a
roman
*punct* ,
and
a
flowing
golden
beard
like
the
tasseled
housings
of
your
last
viceroy's
snorting
charger
*punct* ;
and
a
brain
*punct* ,
and
a
heart
*punct* ,
and
a
soul
in
him
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
which
had
made
steelkilt
charlemagne
*punct* ,
had
he
been
born
son
to
charlemagne's
father
*punct* .
*break*
but
radney
*punct* ,
the
mate
*punct* ,
was
ugly
as
a
mule
*punct* ;
yet
as
hardy
*punct* ,
as
stubborn
*punct* ,
as
malicious
*punct* .
*break*
he
did
not
love
steelkilt
*punct* ,
and
steelkilt
knew
it
*punct* .
*break*
espying
the
mate
drawing
near
as
he
was
toiling
at
the
pump
with
the
rest
*punct* ,
the
lakeman
affected
not
to
notice
him
*punct* ,
but
unawed
*punct* ,
went
on
with
his
gay
banterings
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
my
merry
lads
*punct* ,
it's
a
lively
leak
this
*punct* ;
hold
a
cannikin
*punct* ,
one
of
ye
*punct* ,
and
let's
have
a
taste
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
lord
*punct* ,
it's
worth
bottling
*punct* !
*break*
i
tell
ye
what
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
old
rad's
investment
must
go
for
it
*punct* !
*break*
he
had
best
cut
away
his
part
of
the
hull
and
tow
it
home
*punct* .
*break*
the
fact
is
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* ,
that
sword-fish
only
began
the
job
*punct* ;
he's
come
back
again
with
a
gang
of
ship-carpenters
*punct* ,
saw-fish
*punct* ,
and
file-fish
*punct* ,
and
what
not
*punct* ;
and
the
whole
posse
of
em
are
now
hard
at
work
cutting
and
slashing
at
the
bottom
*punct* ;
making
improvements
*punct* ,
i

*punct* .
*break*
if
old
rad
were
here
now
*punct* ,
i'd
tell
him
to
jump
overboard
and
scatter
em
*punct* .
*break*
they're
playing
the
devil
with
his
estate
*punct* ,
i
can
tell
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
he's
a
simple
old
soul,
*punct* ,
rad
*punct* ,
and
a
beauty
too
*punct* .
*break*
boys
*punct* ,
they
say
the
rest
of
his
property
is
invested
in
looking-glasses
*punct* .
*break*
i
wonder
if
he'd
give
a
poor
devil
like
me
the
model
of
his
nose
*punct* .
*break*
damn
your
eyes
*punct* !
*break*
what's
that
pump
stopping
for
*punct* ?
*break*
roared
radney
*punct* ,
pretending
not
to
have
heard
the
sailors
talk
*punct* .
*break*
thunder
away
at
it
*punct* !
*break*
lively
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* ,
lively
*punct* ,
now
*punct* !
*break*
and
with
that
the
pump
clanged
like
fifty
fire-engines
*punct* ;
the
men
tossed
their
hats
off
to
it
*punct* ,
and
ere
long
that
peculiar
gasping
of
the
lungs
was
heard
which
denotes
the
fullest
tension
of
life's
utmost
energies
*punct* .
*break*
quitting
the
pump
at
last
*punct* ,
with
the
rest
of
his
band
*punct* ,
the
lakeman
went
forward
all
panting
*punct* ,
and
sat
himself
down
on
the
windlass
*punct* ;
his
face
fiery
red
*punct* ,
his
eyes
bloodshot
*punct* ,
and
wiping
the
profuse
sweat
from
his
brow
*punct* .
*break*
now
what
cozening
fiend
it
was
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
that
possessed
radney
to
meddle
with
such
a
man
in
that
corporeally
exasperated
state
*punct* ,
i
know
not
*punct* ;
but
so
it
happened
*punct* .
*break*
intolerably
striding
along
the
deck
*punct* ,
the
mate
commanded
him
to
get
a
broom
and
sweep
down
the
planks
*punct* ,
and
also
a
shovel
*punct* ,
and
remove
some
offensive
matters
consequent
upon
allowing
a
pig
to
run
at
large
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
sweeping
a
ship's
deck
at
sea
is
a
piece
of
household
work
which
in
all
times
but
raging
gales
is
regularly
attended
to
every
evening
*punct* ;
it
has
been
known
to
be
done
in
the
case
of
ships
actually
foundering
at
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
such
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
is
the
inflexibility
of
sea-usages
and
the
instinctive
love
of
neatness
in
seamen
*punct* ;
some
of
whom
would
not
willingly
drown
without
first
washing
their
faces
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
all
vessels
this
broom
business
is
the
prescriptive
province
of
the
boys
*punct* ,
if
boys
there
be
aboard
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
it
was
the
stronger
men
in
the
town-ho
that
had
been
divided
into
gangs
*punct* ,
taking
turns
at
the
pumps
*punct* ;
and
being
the
most
athletic
seaman
of
them
all
*punct* ,
steelkilt
had
been
regularly
assigned
captain
of
one
of
the
gangs
*punct* ;
consequently
he
should
have
been
freed
from
any
trivial
business
not
connected
with
truly
nautical
duties
*punct* ,
such
being
the
case
with
his
comrades
*punct* .
*break*
i
mention
all
these
particulars
so
that
you
may
understand
exactly
how
this
affair
stood
between
the
two
men
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
was
more
than
this
*punct* :
the
order
about
the
shovel
was
almost
as
plainly
meant
to
sting
and
insult
steelkilt
*punct* ,
as
though
radney
had
spat
in
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
any
man
who
has
gone
sailor
in
a
whale-ship
will
understand
this
*punct* ;
and
all
this
and
doubtless
much
more
*punct* ,
the
lakeman
fully
comprehended
when
the
mate
uttered
his
command
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
*punct* ,
in
his
ordinary
tone
*punct* ,
only
a
little
broken
by
the
bodily
exhaustion
he
was
temporarily
in
*punct* ,
he
answered
him
saying
that
sweeping
the
deck
was
not
his
business
*punct* ,
and
he
would
not
do
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
*punct* ,
without
at
all
alluding
to
the
shovel
*punct* ,
he
pointed
to
three
lads
as
the
customary
sweepers
*punct* ;
who
*punct* ,
not
being
billeted
at
the
pumps
*punct* ,
had
done
little
or
nothing
all
day
*punct* .
*break*
to
this
*punct* ,
radney
replied
with
an
oath
*punct* ,
in
a
most
domineering
and
outrageous
manner
unconditionally
reiterating
his
command
*punct* ;
meanwhile
advancing
upon
the
still
seated
lakeman
*punct* ,
with
an
uplifted
cooper's
club
hammer
which
he
had
snatched
from
a
cask
near
by
*punct* .
*break*
heated
and
irritated
as
he
was
by
his
spasmodic
toil
at
the
pumps
*punct* ,
for
all
his
first
nameless
feeling
of
forbearance
the
sweating
steelkilt
could
but
ill
brook
this
bearing
in
the
mate
*punct* ;
but
somehow
still
smothering
the
conflagration
within
him
*punct* ,
without
speaking
he
remained
doggedly
rooted
to
his
seat
*punct* ,
till
at
last
the
incensed
radney
shook
the
hammer
within
a
few
inches
of
his
face
*punct* ,
furiously
commanding
him
to
do
his
bidding
*punct* .
*break*
steelkilt
rose
*punct* ,
and
slowly
retreating
round
the
windlass
*punct* ,
steadily
followed
by
the
mate
with
his
menacing
hammer
*punct* ,
deliberately
repeated
his
intention
not
to
obey
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
that
his
forbearance
had
not
the
slightest
effect
*punct* ,
by
an
awful
and
unspeakable
intimation
with
his
twisted
hand
he
warned
off
the
foolish
and
infatuated
man
*punct* ;
but
it
was
to
no
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
this
way
the
two
went
once
slowly
round
the
windlass
*punct* ;
when
*punct* ,
resolved
at
last
no
longer
to
retreat
*punct* ,
bethinking
him
that
he
had
now
forborne
as
much
as
comported
with
his
humor
*punct* ,
the
lakeman
paused
on
the
hatches
and
thus
spoke
to
the
officer
*punct* :
mr.
radney
*punct* ,
i
will
not
obey
you
*punct* .
*break*
take
that
hammer
away
*punct* ,
or
look
to
yourself
*punct* .
*break*
retreating
not
the
thousandth
part
of
an
inch
*punct* ;
stabbing
him
in
the
eye
with
the
unflinching
poniard
of
his
glance
*punct* ,
steelkilt
*punct* ,
clenching
his
right
hand
behind
him
and
creepingly
drawing
it
back
*punct* ,
told
his
persecutor
that
if
the
hammer
but
grazed
his
cheek
he
*punct* ,
steelkilt
*punct* ,
would
murder
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
the
fool
had
been
branded
for
the
slaughter
by
the
gods
*punct* .
*break*
immediately
the
hammer
touched
the
cheek
*punct* ;
the
next
instant
the
lower
jaw
of
the
mate
was
stove
in
his
head
*punct* ;
he
fell
on
the
hatch
spouting
blood
like
a
whale
*punct* .
*break*
ere
the
cry
could
go
aft
steelkilt
was
shaking
one
of
the
backstays
leading
far
aloft
to
where
two
of
his
comrades
were
standing
their
mast-heads
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
both
canallers
*punct* .
*break*
cried
don
pedro
*punct* ,
we
have
seen
many
whale-ships
in
our
harbors
*punct* ,
but
never
heard
of
your
canallers
*punct* .
*break*
pardon
*punct* :
who
and
what
are
they
*punct* ?
*break*
canallers
*punct* ,
don
*punct* ,
are
the
boatmen
belonging
to
our
grand
erie
canal
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
have
heard
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
senor
*punct* ;
hereabouts
in
this
dull
*punct* ,
warm
*punct* ,
most
lazy
*punct* ,
and
hereditary
land

we
know
but
little
of
your
vigorous

*punct* .
*break*
well
then
*punct* ,
don
*punct* ,
refill
my
cup
*punct* .
*break*
your
chicha's
very
fine
*punct* ;
and
ere
proceeding
further
i
will
tell
ye
what
our
canallers
are
*punct* ;
for
such
information
may
throw
side-light
upon
my
story
*punct* .
*break*
for
three
hundred
and
sixty
miles
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
through
the
entire
breadth
of
the
state
of
new
york
*punct* ;
through
numerous
populous
cities
and
most
thriving
villages
*punct* ;

dismal
*punct* ,
uninhabited
swamps
*punct* ,
and
affluent

cultivated
fields

unrivalled
for
fertility
*punct* ;

holy-of-holies

on
roman

through

by
happy
hearts
or
broken
*punct* ;
through
all
the
wide
contrasting
scenery
of
those
noble
mohawk
counties
*punct* ;
and
especially
*punct* ,
by
rows
of
snow-white
chapels
*punct* ,
whose
spires
stand
almost
like
milestones
*punct* ,
flows
one
continual
stream
of
venetianly
corrupt
and
often
lawless
life
*punct* .
*break*
there's
your
true
ashantee
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ;
there
howl
your
pagans
*punct* ;
where
you
ever
find
them
*punct* ,
next
door
to
you
*punct* ;
under
the
long-flung
shadow
*punct* ,
and
the
snug
patronizing
lee
of
churches
*punct* .
*break*
is
that
a
friar
passing
*punct* ?
*break*
said
don
pedro
*punct* ,
looking
downwards
into
the
crowded
plazza
*punct* ,
with
humorous
concern
*punct* .
*break*
well
for
our
northern
friend
*punct* ,
dame
isabella's
inquisition
wanes
in
lima
*punct* ,
laughed
don
sebastian
*punct* .
*break*
proceed
*punct* ,
senor
*punct* .
*break*
cried
another
of
the
company
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
name
of
all
us
limeese
*punct* ,
i
but
desire
to
express
to
you
*punct* ,
sir
sailor
*punct* ,
that
we
have
by
no
means
overlooked
your
delicacy
in
not
substituting
present
lima
for
distant
venice
in
your
corrupt
comparison
*punct* .
*break*
do
not
bow
and
look
surprised
*punct* ;
you
know
the
proverb
all
along
this
coast
*punct* ,
corrupt
as
lima
*punct* .
*break*
it
but
bears
out
your
saying
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ;
churches
more
plentiful
than
billiard-tables
*punct* ,
and
for
ever
open
*punct* ,
and
corrupt
as
lima
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
venice
*punct* ;
i
have
been
there
*punct* ;
the
holy
city
of
the
blessed
evangelist
*punct* ,
st
*punct* .
*break*
mark!
*punct* ,
st
*punct* .
*break*
dominic
*punct* ,
purge
it
*punct* !
*break*
thanks
*punct* :
here
i
refill
*punct* ;
now
*punct* ,
you
pour
out
again
*punct* .
*break*
freely
depicted
in
his
own
vocation
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
the
canaller
would
make
a
fine
dramatic
hero
*punct* ,
so
abundantly
and
picturesquely
wicked
is
he
*punct* .
*break*
like
mark
antony
*punct* ,
for
days
and
days
along
his
green-turfed
*punct* ,
flowery
nile
*punct* ,
he
indolently
floats
*punct* ,
openly
toying
with
his
red-cheeked
cleopatra
*punct* ,
ripening
his
apricot
thigh
upon
the
sunny
deck
*punct* .
*break*
but
ashore
*punct* ,
all
this
effeminacy
is
dashed
*punct* .
*break*
the
brigandish
guise
which
the
canaller
so
proudly
sports
*punct* ;
his
slouched
and
gaily-ribboned
hat
betoken
his
grand
features
*punct* .
*break*
a
terror
to
the
smiling
innocence
of
the
villages
through
which
he
floats
*punct* ;
his
swart
visage
and
bold
swagger
are
not
unshunned
in
cities
*punct* .
*break*
once
a
vagabond
on
his
own
canal
*punct* ,
i
have
received
good
turns
from
one
of
these
canallers
*punct* ;
i
thank
him
heartily
*punct* ;
would
fain
be
not
ungrateful
*punct* ;
but
it
is
often
one
of
the
prime
redeeming
qualities
of
your
man
of
violence
*punct* ,
that
at
times
he
has
as
stiff
an
arm
to
back
a
poor
stranger
in
a
strait
*punct* ,
as
to
plunder
a
wealthy
one
*punct* .
*break*
in
sum
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
what
the
wildness
of
this
canal
life
is
*punct* ,
is
emphatically
evinced
by
this
*punct* ;
that
our
wild
whale-fishery
contains
so
many
of
its
most
finished
graduates
*punct* ,
and
that
scarce
any
race
of
mankind
*punct* ,
except
sydney
men
*punct* ,
are
so
much
distrusted
by
our
whaling
captains
*punct* .
*break*
impetuously
exclaimed
don
pedro
*punct* ,
spilling
his
chicha
upon
his
silvery
ruffles
*punct* .
*break*
no
need
to
travel
*punct* !
*break*
the
world's
one
lima
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
thought
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
that
at
your
temperate
north
the
generations
were
cold
and
holy
as
the
hills.
*punct* ,
but
the
story
*punct* .
*break*
i
left
off
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
where
the
lakeman
shook
the
back-stay
*punct* .
*break*
hardly
had
he
done
so
*punct* ,
when
he
was
surrounded
by
the
three
junior
mates
and
the
four
harpooneers
*punct* ,
who
all
crowded
him
to
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
but
sliding
down
the
ropes
like
baleful
comets
*punct* ,
the
two
canallers
rushed
into
the
uproar
*punct* ,
and
sought
to
drag
their
man
out
of
it
towards
the
forecastle
*punct* .
*break*
others
of
the
sailors
joined
with
them
in
this
attempt
*punct* ,
and
a
twisted
turmoil
ensued
*punct* ;
while
standing
out
of
harm's
way
*punct* ,
the
valiant
captain
danced
up
and
down
with
a
whale-pike
*punct* ,
calling
upon
his
officers
to
manhandle
that
atrocious
scoundrel
*punct* ,
and
smoke
him
along
to
the
quarter-deck
*punct* .
*break*
at
intervals
*punct* ,
he
ran
close
up
to
the
revolving
border
of
the
confusion
*punct* ,
and
prying
into
the
heart
of
it
with
his
pike
*punct* ,
sought
to
prick
out
the
object
of
his
resentment
*punct* .
*break*
but
steelkilt
and
his
desperadoes
were
too
much
for
them
all
*punct* ;
they
succeeded
in
gaining
the
forecastle
deck
*punct* ,
where
*punct* ,
hastily
slewing
about
three
or
four
large
casks
in
a
line
with
the
windlass
*punct* ,
these
sea-parisians
entrenched
themselves
behind
the
barricade
*punct* .
*break*
come
out
of
that
*punct* ,
ye
pirates
*punct* !
*break*
roared
the
captain
*punct* ,
now
menacing
them
with
a
pistol
in
each
hand
*punct* ,
just
brought
to
him
by
the
steward
*punct* .
*break*
come
out
of
that
*punct* ,
ye
cut-throats
*punct* !
*break*
steelkilt
leaped
on
the
barricade
*punct* ,
and
striding
up
and
down
there
*punct* ,
defied
the
worst
the
pistols
could
do
*punct* ;
but
gave
the
captain
to
understand
distinctly
*punct* ,
that
his
*punct* ,
steelkilt's
*punct* ,
death
would
be
the
signal
for
a
murderous
mutiny
on
the
part
of
all
hands
*punct* .
*break*
fearing
in
his
heart
lest
this
might
prove
but
too
true
*punct* ,
the
captain
a
little
desisted
*punct* ,
but
still
commanded
the
insurgents
instantly
to
return
to
their
duty
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
promise
not
to
touch
us
*punct* ,
if
we
do
*punct* ?
*break*
turn
to!
*punct* ,
i
make
no
promise;
*punct* ,
to
your
duty
*punct* !
*break*
do
you
want
to
sink
the
ship
*punct* ,
by
knocking
off
at
a
time
like
this
*punct* ?
*break*
and
he
once
more
raised
a
pistol
*punct* .
*break*
sink
the
ship
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
let
her
sink
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
man
of
us
turns
to
*punct* ,
unless
you
swear
not
to
raise
a
rope-yarn
against
us
*punct* .
*break*
what
say
ye
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ?
*break*
turning
to
his
comrades
*punct* .
*break*
a
fierce
cheer
was
their
response
*punct* .
*break*
the
lakeman
now
patrolled
the
barricade
*punct* ,
all
the
while
keeping
his
eye
on
the
captain
*punct* ,
and
jerking
out
such
sentences
as
these:
*punct* ,
it's
not
our
fault
*punct* ;
we
didn't
want
it
*punct* ;
i
told
him
to
take
his
hammer
away
*punct* ;
it
was
boy's
business
*punct* ;
he
might
have
known
me
before
this
*punct* ;
i
told
him
not
to
prick
the
buffalo
*punct* ;
i
believe
i
have
broken
a
finger
here
against
his
cursed
jaw
*punct* ;
ain't
those
mincing
knives
down
in
the
forecastle
there
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ?
*break*
look
to
those
handspikes
*punct* ,
my
hearties
*punct* .
*break*
captain
*punct* ,
by
god
*punct* ,
look
to
yourself
*punct* ;
say
the
word
*punct* ;
don't
be
a
fool
*punct* ;
forget
it
all
*punct* ;
we
are
ready
to
turn
to
*punct* ;
treat
us
decently
*punct* ,
and
we're
your
men
*punct* ;
but
we
won't
be
flogged
*punct* .
*break*
i
make
no
promises
*punct* ,
turn
to
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* !
*break*
look
ye
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
cried
the
lakeman
*punct* ,
flinging
out
his
arm
towards
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
a
few
of
us
here
*punct* ,
and
i
am
one
of
them
*punct* ,
who
have
shipped
for
the
cruise
*punct* ,
d'ye
see
*punct* ;
now
as
you
well
know
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
we
can
claim
our
discharge
as
soon
as
the
anchor
is
down
*punct* ;
so
we
don't
want
a
row
*punct* ;
it's
not
our
interest
*punct* ;
we
want
to
be
peaceable
*punct* ;
we
are
ready
to
work
*punct* ,
but
we
won't
be
flogged
*punct* .
*break*
roared
the
captain
*punct* .
*break*
steelkilt
glanced
round
him
a
moment
*punct* ,
and
then
said:
*punct* ,
i
tell
you
what
it
is
now
*punct* ,
captain
*punct* ,
rather
than
kill
ye
*punct* ,
and
be
hung
for
such
a
shabby
rascal
*punct* ,
we
won't
lift
a
hand
against
ye
unless
ye
attack
us
*punct* ;
but
till
you
say
the
word
about
not
flogging
us
*punct* ,
we
won't
do
a
hand's
turn
*punct* .
*break*
down
into
the
forecastle
then
*punct* ,
down
with
ye
*punct* ,
i'll
keep
ye
there
till
ye're
sick
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
down
ye
go
*punct* .
*break*
cried
the
ringleader
to
his
men
*punct* .
*break*
most
of
them
were
against
it
*punct* ;
but
at
length
*punct* ,
in
obedience
to
steelkilt
*punct* ,
they
preceded
him
down
into
their
dark
den
*punct* ,
growlingly
disappearing
*punct* ,
like
bears
into
a
cave
*punct* .
*break*
then
opening
the
slide
a
little
*punct* ,
the
captain
whispered
something
down
the
crack
*punct* ,
closed
it
*punct* ,
and
turned
the
key
upon
them
*punct* ,
ten
in
number
*punct* ,
leaving
on
deck
some
twenty
or
more
*punct* ,
who
thus
far
had
remained
neutral
*punct* .
*break*
all
night
a
wide-awake
watch
was
kept
by
all
the
officers
*punct* ,
forward
and
aft
*punct* ,
especially
about
the
forecastle
scuttle
and
fore
hatchway
*punct* ;
at
which
last
place
it
was
feared
the
insurgents
might
emerge
*punct* ,
after
breaking
through
the
bulkhead
below
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
hours
of
darkness
passed
in
peace
*punct* ;
the
men
who
still
remained
at
their
duty
toiling
hard
at
the
pumps
*punct* ,
whose
clinking
and
clanking
at
intervals
through
the
dreary
night
dismally
resounded
through
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
at
sunrise
the
captain
went
forward
*punct* ,
and
knocking
on
the
deck
*punct* ,
summoned
the
prisoners
to
work
*punct* ;
but
with
a
yell
they
refused
*punct* .
*break*
water
was
then
lowered
down
to
them
*punct* ,
and
a
couple
of
handfuls
of
biscuit
were
tossed
after
it
*punct* ;
when
again
turning
the
key
upon
them
and
pocketing
it
*punct* ,
the
captain
returned
to
the
quarter-deck
*punct* .
*break*
twice
every
day
for
three
days
this
was
repeated
*punct* ;
but
on
the
fourth
morning
a
confused
wrangling
*punct* ,
and
then
a
scuffling
was
heard
*punct* ,
as
the
customary
summons
was
delivered
*punct* ;
and
suddenly
four
men
burst
up
from
the
forecastle
*punct* ,
saying
they
were
ready
to
turn
to
*punct* .
*break*
the
fetid
closeness
of
the
air
*punct* ,
and
a
famishing
diet
*punct* ,
united
perhaps
to
some
fears
of
ultimate
retribution
*punct* ,
had
constrained
them
to
surrender
at
discretion
*punct* .
*break*
emboldened
by
this
*punct* ,
the
captain
reiterated
his
demand
to
the
rest
*punct* ,
but
steelkilt
shouted
up
to
him
a
terrific
hint
to
stop
his
babbling
and
betake
himself
where
he
belonged
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
fifth
morning
three
others
of
the
mutineers
bolted
up
into
the
air
from
the
desperate
arms
below
that
sought
to
restrain
them
*punct* .
*break*
only
three
were
left
*punct* .
*break*
better
turn
to
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
captain
with
a
heartless
jeer
*punct* .
*break*
shut
us
up
again
*punct* ,
will
ye
*punct* !
*break*
certainly
*punct* ,
said
the
captain
and
the
key
clicked
*punct* .
*break*
for
himself
*punct* ,
he
would
do
this
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
whether
they
joined
him
or
not
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
the
last
night
he
should
spend
in
that
den
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
scheme
met
with
no
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
other
two
*punct* ;
they
swore
they
were
ready
for
that
*punct* ,
or
for
any
other
mad
thing
*punct* ,
for
anything
in
short
but
a
surrender
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
was
more
*punct* ,
they
each
insisted
upon
being
the
first
man
on
deck
*punct* ,
when
the
time
to
make
the
rush
should
come
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
this
their
leader
as
fiercely
objected
*punct* ,
reserving
that
priority
for
himself
*punct* ;
particularly
as
his
two
comrades
would
not
yield
*punct* ,
the
one
to
the
other
*punct* ,
in
the
matter
*punct* ;
and
both
of
them
could
not
be
first
*punct* ,
for
the
ladder
would
but
admit
one
man
at
a
time
*punct* .
*break*
and
here
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
the
foul
play
of
these
miscreants
must
come
out
*punct* .
*break*
upon
hearing
the
frantic
project
of
their
leader
*punct* ,
each
in
his
own
separate
soul
had
suddenly
lighted
*punct* ,
it
would
seem
*punct* ,
upon
the
same
piece
of
treachery
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* :
to
be
foremost
in
breaking
out
*punct* ,
in
order
to
be
the
first
of
the
three
*punct* ,
though
the
last
of
the
ten
*punct* ,
to
surrender
*punct* ;
and
thereby
secure
whatever
small
chance
of
pardon
such
conduct
might
merit
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
steelkilt
made
known
his
determination
still
to
lead
them
to
the
last
*punct* ,
they
in
some
way
*punct* ,
by
some
subtle
chemistry
of
villany
*punct* ,
mixed
their
before
secret
treacheries
together
*punct* ;
and
when
their
leader
fell
into
a
doze
*punct* ,
verbally
opened
their
souls
to
each
other
in
three
sentences
*punct* ;
and
bound
the
sleeper
with
cords
*punct* ,
and
gagged
him
with
cords
*punct* ;
and
shrieked
out
for
the
captain
at
midnight
*punct* .
*break*
thinking
murder
at
hand
*punct* ,
and
smelling
in
the
dark
for
the
blood
*punct* ,
he
and
all
his
armed
mates
and
harpooneers
rushed
for
the
forecastle
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
these
were
collared
*punct* ,
and
dragged
along
the
deck
like
dead
cattle
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
side
by
side
*punct* ,
were
seized
up
into
the
mizen
rigging
*punct* ,
like
three
quarters
of
meat
*punct* ,
and
there
they
hung
till
morning
*punct* .
*break*
damn
ye
*punct* ,
cried
the
captain
*punct* ,
pacing
to
and
fro
before
them
*punct* ,
the
vultures
would
not
touch
ye
*punct* ,
ye
villains
*punct* !
*break*
at
sunrise
he
summoned
all
hands
*punct* ;
and
separating
those
who
had
rebelled
from
those
who
had
taken
no
part
in
the
mutiny
*punct* ,
he
told
the
former
that
he
had
a
good
mind
to
flog
them
all
round
*punct* ,
thought
*punct* ,
upon
the
whole
*punct* ,
he
would
do
so
*punct* ,
he
ought
to
*punct* ,
justice
demanded
it
*punct* ;
but
for
the
present
*punct* ,
considering
their
timely
surrender
*punct* ,
he
would
let
them
go
with
a
reprimand
*punct* ,
which
he
accordingly
administered
in
the
vernacular
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
for
you
*punct* ,
ye
carrion
rogues
*punct* ,
turning
to
the
three
men
in
the
rigging
*punct* ,
for
you
*punct* ,
i
mean
to
mince
ye
up
for
the
try-pots
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
seizing
a
rope
*punct* ,
he
applied
it
with
all
his
might
to
the
backs
of
the
two
traitors
*punct* ,
till
they
yelled
no
more
*punct* ,
but
lifelessly
hung
their
heads
sideways
*punct* ,
as
the
two
crucified
thieves
are
drawn
*punct* .
*break*
my
wrist
is
sprained
with
ye
*punct* !
*break*
he
cried
*punct* ,
at
last
*punct* ;
but
there
is
still
rope
enough
left
for
you
*punct* ,
my
fine
bantam
*punct* ,
that
wouldn't
give
up
*punct* .
*break*
take
that
gag
from
his
mouth
*punct* ,
and
let
us
hear
what
he
can
say
for
himself
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
the
exhausted
mutineer
made
a
tremulous
motion
of
his
cramped
jaws
*punct* ,
and
then
painfully
twisting
round
his
head
*punct* ,
said
in
a
sort
of
hiss
*punct* ,
what
i
say
is
this
*punct* ,
and
mind
it
well
*punct* ,
if
you
flog
me
*punct* ,
i
murder
you
*punct* !
*break*
say
ye
so
*punct* ?
*break*
then
see
how
ye
frighten
me
*punct* ,
and
the
captain
drew
off
with
the
rope
to
strike
*punct* .
*break*
best
not
*punct* ,
hissed
the
lakeman
*punct* .
*break*
steelkilt
here
hissed
out
something
*punct* ,
inaudible
to
all
but
the
captain
*punct* ;
who
*punct* ,
to
the
amazement
of
all
hands
*punct* ,
started
back
*punct* ,
paced
the
deck
rapidly
two
or
three
times
*punct* ,
and
then
suddenly
throwing
down
his
rope
*punct* ,
said,i
won't
do
it
*punct* ,
let
him
go
*punct* ,
cut
him
down
*punct* :
d'ye
hear
*punct* ?
*break*
ever
since
the
blow
*punct* ,
he
had
lain
in
his
berth
*punct* ;
but
that
morning
*punct* ,
hearing
the
tumult
on
the
deck
*punct* ,
he
had
crept
out
*punct* ,
and
thus
far
had
watched
the
whole
scene
*punct* .
*break*
such
was
the
state
of
his
mouth
*punct* ,
that
he
could
hardly
speak
*punct* ;
but
mumbling
something
about
his
being
willing
and
able
to
do
what
the
captain
dared
not
attempt
*punct* ,
he
snatched
the
rope
and
advanced
to
his
pinioned
foe
*punct* .
*break*
you
are
a
coward
*punct* !
*break*
hissed
the
lakeman
*punct* .
*break*
so
i
am
*punct* ,
but
take
that
*punct* .
*break*
the
mate
was
in
the
very
act
of
striking
*punct* ,
when
another
hiss
stayed
his
uplifted
arm
*punct* .
*break*
he
paused
*punct* :
and
then
pausing
no
more
*punct* ,
made
good
his
word
*punct* ,
spite
of
steelkilt's
threat
*punct* ,
whatever
that
might
have
been
*punct* .
*break*
the
three
men
were
then
cut
down
*punct* ,
all
hands
were
turned
to
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
sullenly
worked
by
the
moody
seamen
*punct* ,
the
iron
pumps
clanged
as
before
*punct* .
*break*
just
after
dark
that
day
*punct* ,
when
one
watch
had
retired
below
*punct* ,
a
clamor
was
heard
in
the
forecastle
*punct* ;
and
the
two
trembling
traitors
running
up
*punct* ,
besieged
the
cabin
door
*punct* ,
saying
they
durst
not
consort
with
the
crew
*punct* .
*break*
entreaties
*punct* ,
cuffs
*punct* ,
and
kicks
could
not
drive
them
back
*punct* ,
so
at
their
own
instance
they
were
put
down
in
the
ship's
run
for
salvation
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
no
sign
of
mutiny
reappeared
among
the
rest
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
contrary
*punct* ,
it
seemed
*punct* ,
that
mainly
at
steelkilt's
instigation
*punct* ,
they
had
resolved
to
maintain
the
strictest
peacefulness
*punct* ,
obey
all
orders
to
the
last
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
when
the
ship
reached
port
*punct* ,
desert
her
in
a
body
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
order
to
insure
the
speediest
end
to
the
voyage
*punct* ,
they
all
agreed
to
another
thing
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
not
to
sing
out
for
whales
*punct* ,
in
case
any
should
be
discovered
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
spite
of
her
leak
*punct* ,
and
spite
of
all
her
other
perils
*punct* ,
the
town-ho
still
maintained
her
mast-heads
*punct* ,
and
her
captain
was
just
as
willing
to
lower
for
a
fish
that
moment
*punct* ,
as
on
the
day
his
craft
first
struck
the
cruising
ground
*punct* ;
and
radney
the
mate
was
quite
as
ready
to
change
his
berth
for
a
boat
*punct* ,
and
with
his
bandaged
mouth
seek
to
gag
in
death
the
vital
jaw
of
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
in
radney
the
chief
mate's
watch
*punct* ;
and
as
if
the
infatuated
man
sought
to
run
more
than
half
way
to
meet
his
doom
*punct* ,
after
the
scene
at
the
rigging
*punct* ,
he
insisted
*punct* ,
against
the
express
counsel
of
the
captain
*punct* ,
upon
resuming
the
head
of
his
watch
at
night
*punct* .
*break*
upon
this
*punct* ,
and
one
or
two
other
circumstances
*punct* ,
steelkilt
systematically
built
the
plan
of
his
revenge
*punct* .
*break*
during
the
night
*punct* ,
radney
had
an
unseamanlike
way
of
sitting
on
the
bulwarks
of
the
quarter-deck
*punct* ,
and
leaning
his
arm
upon
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
which
was
hoisted
up
there
*punct* ,
a
little
above
the
ship's
side
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
attitude
*punct* ,
it
was
well
known
*punct* ,
he
sometimes
dozed
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
considerable
vacancy
between
the
boat
and
the
ship
*punct* ,
and
down
between
this
was
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
steelkilt
calculated
his
time
*punct* ,
and
found
that
his
next
trick
at
the
helm
would
come
round
at
two
o'clock
*punct* ,
in
the
morning
of
the
third
day
from
that
in
which
he
had
been
betrayed
*punct* .
*break*
at
his
leisure
*punct* ,
he
employed
the
interval
in
braiding
something
very
carefully
in
his
watches
below
*punct* .
*break*
what
are
you
making
there
*punct* ?
*break*
said
a
shipmate
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
think
*punct* ?
*break*
what
does
it
look
like
*punct* ?
*break*
like
a
lanyard
for
your
bag
*punct* ;
but
it's
an
odd
one
*punct* ,
seems
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
rather
oddish
*punct* ,
said
the
lakeman
*punct* ,
holding
it
at
arm's
length
before
him
*punct* ;
but
i
think
it
will
answer
*punct* .
*break*
shipmate
*punct* ,
i
haven't
enough
twine,
*punct* ,
have
you
any
*punct* ?
*break*
but
there
was
none
in
the
forecastle
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
must
get
some
from
old
rad
*punct* ;
and
he
rose
to
go
aft
*punct* .
*break*
you
don't
mean
to
go
a
begging
to
him
*punct* !
*break*
said
a
sailor
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
think
he
won't
do
me
a
turn
*punct* ,
when
it's
to
help
himself
in
the
end
*punct* ,
shipmate
*punct* ?
*break*
and
going
to
the
mate
*punct* ,
he
looked
at
him
quietly
*punct* ,
and
asked
him
for
some
twine
to
mend
his
hammock
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
given
him
*punct* ,
neither
twine
nor
lanyard
were
seen
again
*punct* ;
but
the
next
night
an
iron
ball
*punct* ,
closely
netted
*punct* ,
partly
rolled
from
the
pocket
of
the
lakeman's
monkey
jacket
*punct* ,
as
he
was
tucking
the
coat
into
his
hammock
for
a
pillow
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
a
fool
saved
the
would-be
murderer
from
the
bloody
deed
he
had
planned
*punct* .
*break*
yet
complete
revenge
he
had
*punct* ,
and
without
being
the
avenger
*punct* .
*break*
for
by
a
mysterious
fatality
*punct* ,
heaven
itself
seemed
to
step
in
to
take
out
of
his
hands
into
its
own
the
damning
thing
he
would
have
done
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
just
between
daybreak
and
sunrise
of
the
morning
of
the
second
day
*punct* ,
when
they
were
washing
down
the
decks
*punct* ,
that
a
stupid
teneriffe
man
*punct* ,
drawing
water
in
the
main-chains
*punct* ,
all
at
once
shouted
out
*punct* ,
there
she
rolls
*punct* !
*break*
there
she
rolls
*punct* !
*break*
jesu
*punct* ,
what
a
whale
*punct* !
*break*
it
was
moby
dick
*punct* .
*break*
cried
don
sebastian
*punct* ;
st
*punct* .
*break*
sir
sailor
*punct* ,
but
do
whales
have
christenings
*punct* ?
*break*
whom
call
you
moby
dick
*punct* ?
*break*
a
very
white
*punct* ,
and
famous
*punct* ,
and
most
deadly
immortal
monster
*punct* ,
don;
*punct* ,
but
that
would
be
too
long
a
story
*punct* .
*break*
cried
all
the
young
spaniards
*punct* ,
crowding
*punct* .
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
dons
*punct* ,
dons
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* !
*break*
i
cannot
rehearse
that
now
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
get
more
into
the
air
*punct* ,
sirs
*punct* .
*break*
cried
don
pedro
*punct* ;
our
vigorous
friend
looks
faint;
*punct* ,
fill
up
his
empty
glass
*punct* !
*break*
no
need
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ;
one
moment
*punct* ,
and
i
proceed.
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
so
suddenly
perceiving
the
snowy
whale
within
fifty
yards
of
the
ship
*punct* ,
forgetful
of
the
compact
among
the
crew
*punct* ,
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
*punct* ,
the
teneriffe
man
had
instinctively
and
involuntarily
lifted
his
voice
for
the
monster
*punct* ,
though
for
some
little
time
past
it
had
been
plainly
beheld
from
the
three
sullen
mast-heads
*punct* .
*break*
all
was
now
a
phrensy
*punct* .
*break*
the
white
whale
*punct* ,
the
white
whale
*punct* !
*break*
was
the
cry
from
captain
*punct* ,
mates
*punct* ,
and
harpooneers
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
undeterred
by
fearful
rumors
*punct* ,
were
all
anxious
to
capture
so
famous
and
precious
a
fish
*punct* ;
while
the
dogged
crew
eyed
askance
*punct* ,
and
with
curses
*punct* ,
the
appalling
beauty
of
the
vast
milky
mass
*punct* ,
that
lit
up
by
a
horizontal
spangling
sun
*punct* ,
shifted
and
glistened
like
a
living
opal
in
the
blue
morning
sea
*punct* .
*break*
gentlemen
*punct* ,
a
strange
fatality
pervades
the
whole
career
of
these
events
*punct* ,
as
if
verily
mapped
out
before
the
world
itself
was
charted
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
when
the
four
boats
were
lowered
*punct* ,
the
mate's
got
the
start
*punct* ;
and
none
howled
more
fiercely
with
delight
than
did
steelkilt
*punct* ,
as
he
strained
at
his
oar
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
stiff
pull
*punct* ,
their
harpooneer
got
fast
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
spear
in
hand
*punct* ,
radney
sprang
to
the
bow
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
always
a
furious
man
*punct* ,
it
seems
*punct* ,
in
a
boat
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
his
bandaged
cry
was
*punct* ,
to
beach
him
on
the
whale's
topmost
back
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
loath
*punct* ,
his
bowsman
hauled
him
up
and
up
*punct* ,
through
a
blinding
foam
that
blent
two
whitenesses
together
*punct* ;
till
of
a
sudden
the
boat
struck
as
against
a
sunken
ledge
*punct* ,
and
keeling
over
*punct* ,
spilled
out
the
standing
mate
*punct* .
*break*
that
instant
*punct* ,
as
he
fell
on
the
whale's
slippery
back
*punct* ,
the
boat
righted
*punct* ,
and
was
dashed
aside
by
the
swell
*punct* ,
while
radney
was
tossed
over
into
the
sea
*punct* ,
on
the
other
flank
of
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
he
struck
out
through
the
spray
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
for
an
instant
*punct* ,
was
dimly
seen
through
that
veil
*punct* ,
wildly
seeking
to
remove
himself
from
the
eye
of
moby
dick
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
whale
rushed
round
in
a
sudden
maelstrom
*punct* ;
seized
the
swimmer
between
his
jaws
*punct* ;
and
rearing
high
up
with
him
*punct* ,
plunged
headlong
again
*punct* ,
and
went
down
*punct* .
*break*
meantime
*punct* ,
at
the
first
tap
of
the
boat's
bottom
*punct* ,
the
lakeman
had
slackened
the
line
*punct* ,
so
as
to
drop
astern
from
the
whirlpool
*punct* ;
calmly
looking
on
*punct* ,
he
thought
his
own
thoughts
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
sudden
*punct* ,
terrific
*punct* ,
downward
jerking
of
the
boat
*punct* ,
quickly
brought
his
knife
to
the
line
*punct* .
*break*
he
cut
it
*punct* ;
and
the
whale
was
free
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
at
some
distance
*punct* ,
moby
dick
rose
again
*punct* ,
with
some
tatters
of
radney's
red
woollen
shirt
*punct* ,
caught
in
the
teeth
that
had
destroyed
him
*punct* .
*break*
all
four
boats
gave
chase
again
*punct* ;
but
the
whale
eluded
them
*punct* ,
and
finally
wholly
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
in
good
time
*punct* ,
the
town-ho
reached
her
port
*punct* ,
a
savage
*punct* ,
solitary
place
*punct* ,
where
no
civilized
creature
resided
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
headed
by
the
lakeman
*punct* ,
all
but
five
or
six
of
the
foremast-men
deliberately
deserted
among
the
palms
*punct* ;
eventually
*punct* ,
as
it
turned
out
*punct* ,
seizing
a
large
double
war-canoe
of
the
savages
*punct* ,
and
setting
sail
for
some
other
harbor
*punct* .
*break*
the
ship's
company
being
reduced
to
but
a
handful
*punct* ,
the
captain
called
upon
the
islanders
to
assist
him
in
the
laborious
business
of
heaving
down
the
ship
to
stop
the
leak
*punct* .
*break*
after
taking
counsel
with
his
officers
*punct* ,
he
anchored
the
ship
as
far
off
shore
as
possible
*punct* ;
loaded
and
ran
out
his
two
cannon
from
the
bows
*punct* ;
stacked
his
muskets
on
the
poop
*punct* ;
and
warning
the
islanders
not
to
approach
the
ship
at
their
peril
*punct* ,
took
one
man
with
him
*punct* ,
and
setting
the
sail
of
his
best
whale-boat
*punct* ,
steered
straight
before
the
wind
for
tahiti
*punct* ,
five
hundred
miles
distant
*punct* ,
to
procure
a
reinforcement
to
his
crew
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
fourth
day
of
the
sail
*punct* ,
a
large
canoe
was
descried
*punct* ,
which
seemed
to
have
touched
at
a
low
isle
of
corals
*punct* .
*break*
he
steered
away
from
it
*punct* ;
but
the
savage
craft
bore
down
on
him
*punct* ;
and
soon
the
voice
of
steelkilt
hailed
him
to
heave
to
*punct* ,
or
he
would
run
him
under
water
*punct* .
*break*
the
captain
presented
a
pistol
*punct* .
*break*
with
one
foot
on
each
prow
of
the
yoked
war-canoes
*punct* ,
the
lakeman
laughed
him
to
scorn
*punct* ;
assuring
him
that
if
the
pistol
so
much
as
clicked
in
the
lock
*punct* ,
he
would
bury
him
in
bubbles
and
foam
*punct* .
*break*
what
do
you
want
of
me
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
the
captain
*punct* .
*break*
where
are
you
bound
*punct* ?
*break*
and
for
what
are
you
bound
*punct* ?
*break*
demanded
steelkilt
*punct* ;
no
lies
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
bound
to
tahiti
for
more
men
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
board
you
a
moment
*punct* ,
i
come
in
peace
*punct* .
*break*
with
that
he
leaped
from
the
canoe
*punct* ,
swam
to
the
boat
*punct* ;
and
climbing
the
gunwale
*punct* ,
stood
face
to
face
with
the
captain
*punct* .
*break*
cross
your
arms
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
throw
back
your
head
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
repeat
after
me
*punct* .
*break*
as
soon
as
steelkilt
leaves
me
*punct* ,
i
swear
to
beach
this
boat
on
yonder
island
*punct* ,
and
remain
there
six
days
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
do
not
*punct* ,
may
lightnings
strike
me
*punct* !
*break*
a
pretty
scholar
*punct* ,
laughed
the
lakeman.adios
*punct* ,
senor
*punct* !
*break*
and
leaping
into
the
sea
*punct* ,
he
swam
back
to
his
comrades
*punct* .
*break*
watching
the
boat
till
it
was
fairly
beached
*punct* ,
and
drawn
up
to
the
roots
of
the
cocoa-nut
trees
*punct* ,
steelkilt
made
sail
again
*punct* ,
and
in
due
time
arrived
at
tahiti
*punct* ,
his
own
place
of
destination
*punct* .
*break*
they
embarked
*punct* ;
and
so
for
ever
got
the
start
of
their
former
captain
*punct* ,
had
he
been
at
all
minded
to
work
them
legal
retribution
*punct* .
*break*
some
ten
days
after
the
french
ships
sailed
*punct* ,
the
whale-boat
arrived
*punct* ,
and
the
captain
was
forced
to
enlist
some
of
the
more
civilized
tahitians
*punct* ,
who
had
been
somewhat
used
to
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
chartering
a
small
native
schooner
*punct* ,
he
returned
with
them
to
his
vessel
*punct* ;
and
finding
all
right
there
*punct* ,
again
resumed
his
cruisings
*punct* .
*break*
where
steelkilt
now
is
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ,
none
know
*punct* ;
but
upon
the
island
of
nantucket
*punct* ,
the
widow
of
radney
still
turns
to
the
sea
which
refuses
to
give
up
its
dead
*punct* ;
still
in
dreams
sees
the
awful
white
whale
that
destroyed
him
*punct* .
*break*
are
you
through
*punct* ?
*break*
said
don
sebastian
*punct* ,
quietly
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
*punct* ,
don
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
entreat
you
*punct* ,
tell
me
if
to
the
best
of
your
own
convictions
*punct* ,
this
story
is
in
substance
really
true
*punct* ?
*break*
it
is
so
passing
wonderful
*punct* !
*break*
did
you
get
it
from
an
unquestionable
source
*punct* ?
*break*
bear
with
me
if
i
seem
to
press
*punct* .
*break*
also
bear
with
all
of
us
*punct* ,
sir
sailor
*punct* ;
for
we
all
join
in
don
sebastian's
suit
*punct* ,
cried
the
company
*punct* ,
with
exceeding
interest
*punct* .
*break*
is
there
a
copy
of
the
holy
evangelists
in
the
golden
inn
*punct* ,
gentlemen
*punct* ?
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
said
don
sebastian
*punct* ;
but
i
know
a
worthy
priest
near
by
*punct* ,
who
will
quickly
procure
one
for
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
go
for
it
*punct* ;
but
are
you
well
advised
*punct* ?
*break*
this
may
grow
too
serious
*punct* .
*break*
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
bring
the
priest
also
*punct* ,
don
*punct* ?
*break*
though
there
are
no
auto-da-fes
in
lima
now
*punct* ,
said
one
of
the
company
to
another
*punct* :
i
fear
our
sailor
friend
runs
risk
of
the
archiepiscopacy
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
withdraw
more
out
of
the
moonlight
*punct* .
*break*
i
see
no
need
for
this
*punct* .
*break*
excuse
me
for
running
after
you
*punct* ,
don
sebastian
*punct* ;
but
may
i
also
beg
that
you
will
be
particular
in
procuring
the
largest
sized
evangelists
you
can
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
the
priest
*punct* ,
he
brings
you
the
evangelists
*punct* ,
said
don
sebastian
*punct* ,
gravely
*punct* ,
returning
with
a
tall
and
solemn
figure
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
remove
my
hat
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
be
worth
while
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
previously
to
advert
to
those
curious
imaginary
portraits
of
him
which
even
down
to
the
present
day
confidently
challenge
the
faith
of
the
landsman
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
time
to
set
the
world
right
in
this
matter
*punct* ,
by
proving
such
pictures
of
the
whale
all
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
be
that
the
primal
source
of
all
those
pictorial
delusions
will
be
found
among
the
oldest
hindoo
*punct* ,
egyptian
*punct* ,
and
grecian
sculptures
*punct* .
*break*
for
ever
since
those
inventive
but
unscrupulous
times
when
on
the
marble
panellings
of
temples
*punct* ,
the
pedestals
of
statues
*punct* ,
and
on
shields
*punct* ,
medallions
*punct* ,
cups
*punct* ,
and
coins
*punct* ,
the
dolphin
was
drawn
in
scales
of
chain-armor
like
saladin's
*punct* ,
and
a
helmeted
head
like
st
*punct* .
*break*
george's
*punct* ;
ever
since
then
has
something
of
the
same
sort
of
license
prevailed
*punct* ,
not
only
in
most
popular
pictures
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
but
in
many
scientific
presentations
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
by
all
odds
*punct* ,
the
most
ancient
extant
portrait
anyways
purporting
to
be
the
whale's
*punct* ,
is
to
be
found
in
the
famous
cavern-pagoda
of
elephanta
*punct* ,
in
india
*punct* .
*break*
the
brahmins
maintain
that
in
the
almost
endless
sculptures
of
that
immemorial
pagoda
*punct* ,
all
the
trades
and
pursuits
*punct* ,
every
conceivable
avocation
of
man
*punct* ,
were
prefigured
ages
before
any
of
them
actually
came
into
being
*punct* .
*break*
the
hindoo
whale
referred
to
*punct* ,
occurs
in
a
separate
department
of
the
wall
*punct* ,
depicting
the
incarnation
of
vishnu
in
the
form
of
leviathan
*punct* ,
learnedly
known
as
the
matse
avatar
*punct* .
*break*
but
though
this
sculpture
is
half
man
and
half
whale
*punct* ,
so
as
only
to
give
the
tail
of
the
latter
*punct* ,
yet
that
small
section
of
him
is
all
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
it
looks
more
like
the
tapering
tail
of
an
anaconda
*punct* ,
than
the
broad
palms
of
the
true
whale's
majestic
flukes
*punct* .
*break*
but
go
to
the
old
galleries
*punct* ,
and
look
now
at
a
great
christian
painter's
portrait
of
this
fish
*punct* ;
for
he
succeeds
no
better
than
the
antediluvian
hindoo
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
guido's
picture
of
perseus
rescuing
andromeda
from
the
sea-monster
or
whale
*punct* .
*break*
where
did
guido
get
the
model
of
such
a
strange
creature
as
that
*punct* ?
*break*
nor
does
hogarth
*punct* ,
in
painting
the
same
scene
in
his
own
perseus
descending
*punct* ,
make
out
one
whit
better
*punct* .
*break*
the
huge
corpulence
of
that
hogarthian
monster
undulates
on
the
surface
*punct* ,
scarcely
drawing
one
inch
of
water
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
a
sort
of
howdah
on
its
back
*punct* ,
and
its
distended
tusked
mouth
into
which
the
billows
are
rolling
*punct* ,
might
be
taken
for
the
traitors
gate
leading
from
the
thames
by
water
into
the
tower
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
there
are
the
prodromus
whales
of
the
old
scotch
sibbald
*punct* ,
and
jonah's
whale
*punct* ,
as
depicted
in
the
prints
of
old
bibles
and
the
cuts
of
old
primers
*punct* .
*break*
what
shall
be

*break*
as
for
the
book-binder's
whale
winding
like
a
vine-stalk
round
the
stock
of
a
descending
anchor
*punct* ,
as
stamped
and
gilded
on
the
backs
and
title-pages
of
many
books
both
old
and
new
*punct* ,
that
is
a
very
picturesque
but
purely
fabulous
creature
*punct* ,
imitated
*punct* ,
i
take
it
*punct* ,
from
the
like
figures
on
antique
vases
*punct* .
*break*
though
universally
denominated
a
dolphin
*punct* ,
i
nevertheless
call
this
book-binder's
fish
an
attempt
at
a
whale
*punct* ;
because
it
was
so
intended
when
the
device
was
first
introduced
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
introduced
by
an
old
italian
publisher
somewhere
about
the
15th
century
*punct* ,
during
the
revival
of
learning
*punct* ;
and
in
those
days
*punct* ,
and
even
down
to
a
comparatively
late
period
*punct* ,
dolphins
were
popularly
supposed
to
be
a
species
of
the
leviathan
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
title-page
of
the
original
edition
of
the
advancement
of
learning
you
will
find
some
curious
whales
*punct* .
*break*
but
quitting
all
these
unprofessional
attempts
*punct* ,
let
us
glance
at
those
pictures
of
leviathan
purporting
to
be
sober
*punct* ,
scientific
delineations
*punct* ,
by
those
who
know
*punct* .
*break*
in
old
harris's
collection
of
voyages
there
are
some
plates
of
whales
extracted
from
a
dutch
book
of
voyages
*punct* ,
a
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
entitled
a
whaling
voyage
to
spitzbergen
in
the
ship
jonas
in
the
whale
*punct* ,
peter
peterson
of
friesland
*punct* ,
master
*punct* .
*break*
in
one
of
those
plates
the
whales
*punct* ,
like
great
rafts
of
logs
*punct* ,
are
represented
lying
among
ice-isles
*punct* ,
with
white
bears
running
over
their
living
backs
*punct* .
*break*
in
another
plate
*punct* ,
the
prodigious
blunder
is
made
of
representing
the
whale
with
perpendicular
flukes
*punct* .
*break*
then
again
*punct* ,
there
is
an
imposing
quarto
*punct* ,
written
by
one
captain
colnett
*punct* ,
a
post
captain
in
the
english
navy
*punct* ,
entitled
a
voyage
round
cape
horn
into
the
south
seas
*punct* ,
for
the
purpose
of
extending
the
spermaceti
whale
fisheries
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
book
is
an
outline
purporting
to
be
a
picture
of
a
physeter
or
spermaceti
whale
*punct* ,
drawn
by
scale
from
one
killed
on
the
coast
of
mexico
*punct* ,
august
*punct* ,
and
hoisted
on
deck
*punct* .
*break*
i
doubt
not
the
captain
had
this
veracious
picture
taken
for
the
benefit
of
his
marines
*punct* .
*break*
to
mention
but
one
thing
about
it
*punct* ,
let
me
say
that
it
has
an
eye
which
applied
*punct* ,
according
to
the
accompanying
scale
*punct* ,
to
a
full
grown
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
would
make
the
eye
of
that
whale
a
bow-window
some
five
feet
long
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
my
gallant
captain
*punct* ,
why
did
ye
not
give
us
jonah
looking
out
of
that
eye
*punct* !
*break*
nor
are
the
most
conscientious
compilations
of
natural
history
for
the
benefit
of
the
young
and
tender
*punct* ,
free
from
the
same
heinousness
of
mistake
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
that
popular
work
goldsmith's
animated
nature
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
abridged
london
edition
of
*punct* ,
there
are
plates
of
an
alleged
whale
and
a
narwhale
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
wish
to
seem
inelegant
*punct* ,
but
this
unsightly
whale
looks
much
like
an
amputated
sow
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
as
for
the
narwhale
*punct* ,
one
glimpse
at
it
is
enough
to
amaze
one
*punct* ,
that
in
this
nineteenth
century
such
a
hippogriff
could
be
palmed
for
genuine
upon
any
intelligent
public
of
schoolboys
*punct* .
*break*
all
these
are
not
only
incorrect
*punct* ,
but
the
picture
of
the
mysticetus
or
greenland
whale
*punct* ,
that
is
to
say
*punct* ,
the
right
whale
*punct* ,
even
scoresby
*punct* ,
a
long
experienced
man
as
touching
that
species
*punct* ,
declares
not
to
have
its
counterpart
in
nature
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
placing
of
the
cap-sheaf
to
all
this
blundering
business
was
reserved
for
the
scientific
frederick
cuvier
*punct* ,
brother
to
the
famous
baron
*punct* .
*break*
in
*punct* ,
he
published
a
natural
history
of
whales
*punct* ,
in
which
he
gives
what
he
calls
a
picture
of
the
sperm
whale
*punct* .
*break*
before
showing
that
picture
to
any
nantucketer
*punct* ,
you
had
best
provide
for
your
summary
retreat
from
nantucket
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
word
*punct* ,
frederick
cuvier's
sperm
whale
is
not
a
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
but
a
squash
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
*punct* ,
he
never
had
the
benefit
of
a
whaling
voyage
*punct* ,
such
men
seldom
have
*punct* ,
but
whence
he
derived
that
picture
*punct* ,
who
can
tell
*punct* ?
*break*
perhaps
he
got
it
as
his
scientific
predecessor
in
the
same
field
*punct* ,
desmarest
*punct* ,
got
one
of
his
authentic
abortions
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
from
a
chinese
drawing
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
sort
of
lively
lads
with
the
pencil
those
chinese
are
*punct* ,
many
queer
cups
and
saucers
inform
us
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
the
sign-painters
whales
seen
in
the
streets
hanging
over
the
shops
of
oil-dealers
*punct* ,
what
shall
be
said
of
them
*punct* ?
*break*
they
are
generally
richard
iii
*punct* .
*break*
whales
*punct* ,
with
dromedary
humps
*punct* ,
and
very
savage
*punct* ;
breakfasting
on
three
or
four
sailor
tarts
*punct* ,
that
is
whaleboats
full
of
mariners
*punct* :
their
deformities
floundering
in
seas
of
blood
and
blue
paint
*punct* .
*break*
but
these
manifold
mistakes
in
depicting
the
whale
are
not
so
very
surprising
after
all
*punct* .
*break*
most
of
the
scientific
drawings
have
been
taken
from
the
stranded
fish
*punct* ;
and
these
are
about
as
correct
as
a
drawing
of
a
wrecked
ship
*punct* ,
with
broken
back
*punct* ,
would
correctly
represent
the
noble
animal
itself
in
all
its
undashed
pride
of
hull
and
spars
*punct* .
*break*
though
elephants
have
stood
for
their
full-lengths
*punct* ,
the
living
leviathan
has
never
yet
fairly
floated
himself
for
his
portrait
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
not
to
speak
of
the
highly
presumable
difference
of
contour
between
a
young
sucking
whale
and
a
full-grown
platonian
leviathan
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
even
in
the
case
of
one
of
those
young
sucking
whales
hoisted
to
a
ship's
deck
*punct* ,
such
is
then
the
outlandish
*punct* ,
eel-like
*punct* ,
limbered
*punct* ,
varying
shape
of
him
*punct* ,
that
his
precise
expression
the
devil
himself
could
not
catch
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
may
be
fancied
*punct* ,
that
from
the
naked
skeleton
of
the
stranded
whale
*punct* ,
accurate
hints
may
be
derived
touching
his
true
form
*punct* .
*break*
not
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
for
it
is
one
of
the
more
curious
things
about
this
leviathan
*punct* ,
that
his
skeleton
gives
very
little
idea
of
his
general
shape
*punct* .
*break*
though
jeremy
bentham's
skeleton
*punct* ,
which
hangs
for
candelabra
in
the
library
of
one
of
his
executors
*punct* ,
correctly
conveys
the
idea
of
a
burly-browed
utilitarian
old
gentleman
*punct* ,
with
all
jeremy's
other
leading
personal
characteristics
*punct* ;
yet
nothing
of
this
kind
could
be
inferred
from
any
leviathan's
articulated
bones
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
as
the
great
hunter
says
*punct* ,
the
mere
skeleton
of
the
whale
bears
the
same
relation
to
the
fully
invested
and
padded
animal
as
the
insect
does
to
the
chrysalis
that
so
roundingly
envelopes
it
*punct* .
*break*
this
peculiarity
is
strikingly
evinced
in
the
head
*punct* ,
as
in
some
part
of
this
book
will
be
incidentally
shown
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
also
very
curiously
displayed
in
the
side
fin
*punct* ,
the
bones
of
which
almost
exactly
answer
to
the
bones
of
the
human
hand
*punct* ,
minus
only
the
thumb
*punct* .
*break*
this
fin
has
four
regular
bone-fingers
*punct* ,
the
index
*punct* ,
middle
*punct* ,
ring
*punct* ,
and
little
finger
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
these
are
permanently
lodged
in
their
fleshy
covering
*punct* ,
as
the
human
fingers
in
an
artificial
covering
*punct* .
*break*
however
recklessly
the
whale
may
sometimes
serve
us
*punct* ,
said
humorous
stubb
one
day
*punct* ,
he
can
never
be
truly
said
to
handle
us
without
mittens
*punct* .
*break*
for
all
these
reasons
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
any
way
you
may
look
at
it
*punct* ,
you
must
needs
conclude
that
the
great
leviathan
is
that
one
creature
in
the
world
which
must
remain
unpainted
to
the
last
*punct* .
*break*
true
*punct* ,
one
portrait
may
hit
the
mark
much
nearer
than
another
*punct* ,
but
none
can
hit
it
with
any
very
considerable
degree
of
exactness
*punct* .
*break*
so
there
is
no
earthly
way
of
finding
out
precisely
what
the
whale
really
looks
like
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
pass
that
matter
by
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
of
only
four
published
outlines
of
the
great
sperm
whale
*punct* ;
colnett's
*punct* ,
huggins's
*punct* ,
frederick
cuvier's
*punct* ,
and
beale's
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
previous
chapter
colnett
and
cuvier
have
been
referred
to
*punct* .
*break*
huggins's
is
far
better
than
theirs
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
by
great
odds
*punct* ,
beale's
is
the
best
*punct* .
*break*
all
beale's
drawings
of
this
whale
are
good
*punct* ,
excepting
the
middle
figure
in
the
picture
of
three
whales
in
various
attitudes
*punct* ,
capping
his
second
chapter
*punct* .
*break*
his
frontispiece
*punct* ,
boats
attacking
sperm
whales
*punct* ,
though
no
doubt
calculated
to
excite
the
civil
scepticism
of
some
parlor
men
*punct* ,
is
admirably
correct
and
life-like
in
its
general
effect
*punct* .
*break*
ross
browne
are
pretty
correct
in
contour
*punct* ;
but
they
are
wretchedly
engraved
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
not
his
fault
though
*punct* .
*break*
of
the
right
whale
*punct* ,
the
best
outline
pictures
are
in
scoresby
*punct* ;
but
they
are
drawn
on
too
small
a
scale
to
convey
a
desirable
impression
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
but
one
picture
of
whaling
scenes
*punct* ,
and
this
is
a
sad
deficiency
*punct* ,
because
it
is
by
such
pictures
only
*punct* ,
when
at
all
well
done
*punct* ,
that
you
can
derive
anything
like
a
truthful
idea
of
the
living
whale
as
seen
by
his
living
hunters
*punct* .
*break*
respectively
*punct* ,
they
represent
attacks
on
the
sperm
and
right
whale
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
first
engraving
a
noble
sperm
whale
is
depicted
in
full
majesty
of
might
*punct* ,
just
risen
beneath
the
boat
from
the
profundities
of
the
ocean
*punct* ,
and
bearing
high
in
the
air
upon
his
back
the
terrific
wreck
of
the
stoven
planks
*punct* .
*break*
the
prow
of
the
boat
is
partially
unbroken
*punct* ,
and
is
drawn
just
balancing
upon
the
monster's
spine
*punct* ;
and
standing
in
that
prow
*punct* ,
for
that
one
single
incomputable
flash
of
time
*punct* ,
you
behold
an
oarsman
*punct* ,
half
shrouded
by
the
incensed
boiling
spout
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
and
in
the
act
of
leaping
*punct* ,
as
if
from
a
precipice
*punct* .
*break*
the
action
of
the
whole
thing
is
wonderfully
good
and
true
*punct* .
*break*
the
half-emptied
line-tub
floats
on
the
whitened
sea
*punct* ;
the
wooden
poles
of
the
spilled
harpoons
obliquely
bob
in
it
*punct* ;
the
heads
of
the
swimming
crew
are
scattered
about
the
whale
in
contrasting
expressions
of
affright
*punct* ;
while
in
the
black
stormy
distance
the
ship
is
bearing
down
upon
the
scene
*punct* .
*break*
serious
fault
might
be
found
with
the
anatomical
details
of
this
whale
*punct* ,
but
let
that
pass
*punct* ;
since
*punct* ,
for
the
life
of
me
*punct* ,
i
could
not
draw
so
good
a
one
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
second
engraving
*punct* ,
the
boat
is
in
the
act
of
drawing
alongside
the
barnacled
flank
of
a
large
running
right
whale
*punct* ,
that
rolls
his
black
weedy
bulk
in
the
sea
like
some
mossy
rock-slide
from
the
patagonian
cliffs
*punct* .
*break*
his
jets
are
erect
*punct* ,
full
*punct* ,
and
black
like
soot
*punct* ;
so
that
from
so
abounding
a
smoke
in
the
chimney
*punct* ,
you
would
think
there
must
be
a
brave
supper
cooking
in
the
great
bowels
below
*punct* .
*break*
sea
fowls
are
pecking
at
the
small
crabs
*punct* ,
shell-fish
*punct* ,
and
other
sea
candies
and
maccaroni
*punct* ,
which
the
right
whale
sometimes
carries
on
his
pestilent
back
*punct* .
*break*
and
all
the
while
the
thick-lipped
leviathan
is
rushing
through
the
deep
*punct* ,
leaving
tons
of
tumultuous
white
curds
in
his
wake
*punct* ,
and
causing
the
slight
boat
to
rock
in
the
swells
like
a
skiff
caught
nigh
the
paddle-wheels
of
an
ocean
steamer
*punct* .
*break*
but
my
life
for
it
he
was
either
practically
conversant
with
his
subject
*punct* ,
or
else
marvellously
tutored
by
some
experienced
whaleman
*punct* .
*break*
the
french
are
the
lads
for
painting
action
*punct* .
*break*
go
and
gaze
upon
all
the
paintings
in
europe
*punct* ,
and
where
will
you
find
such
a
gallery
of
living
and
breathing
commotion
on
canvas
*punct* ,
as
in
that
triumphal
hall
at
versailles
*punct* ;
where
the
beholder
fights
his
way
*punct* ,
pell-mell
*punct* ,
through
the
consecutive
great
battles
of
france
*punct* ;
where
every
sword
seems
a
flash
of
the
northern
lights
*punct* ,
and
the
successive
armed
kings
and
emperors
dash
by
*punct* ,
like
a
charge
of
crowned
centaurs
*punct* ?
*break*
not
wholly
unworthy
of
a
place
in
that
gallery
*punct* ,
are
these
sea
battle-pieces
of
garnery
*punct* .
*break*
the
natural
aptitude
of
the
french
for
seizing
the
picturesqueness
of
things
seems
to
be
peculiarly
evinced
in
what
paintings
and
engravings
they
have
of
their
whaling
scenes
*punct* .
*break*
with
not
one
tenth
of
england's
experience
in
the
fishery
*punct* ,
and
not
the
thousandth
part
of
that
of
the
americans
*punct* ,
they
have
nevertheless
furnished
both
nations
with
the
only
finished
sketches
at
all
capable
of
conveying
the
real
spirit
of
the
whale
hunt
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
most
part
*punct* ,
the
english
and
american
whale
draughtsmen
seem
entirely
content
with
presenting
the
mechanical
outline
of
things
*punct* ,
such
as
the
vacant
profile
of
the
whale
*punct* ;
which
*punct* ,
so
far
as
picturesqueness
of
effect
is
concerned
*punct* ,
is
about
tantamount
to
sketching
the
profile
of
a
pyramid
*punct* .
*break*
even
scoresby

the
justly
renowned
right
whaleman

was
certainly
an
oversight
not

have
procured
for
every

a
sworn
affidavit
taken
before
a
greenland
justice
of
the
peace
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
quiet
noon-scene
among
the
isles
of
the
pacific
*punct* ;
a
french
whaler
anchored
*punct* ,
inshore
*punct* ,
in
a
calm
*punct* ,
and
lazily
taking
water
on
board
*punct* ;
the
loosened
sails
of
the
ship
*punct* ,
and
the
long
leaves
of
the
palms
in
the
background
*punct* ,
both
drooping
together
in
the
breezeless
air
*punct* .
*break*
the
effect
is
very
fine
*punct* ,
when
considered
with
reference
to
its
presenting
the
hardy
fishermen
under
one
of
their
few
aspects
of
oriental
repose
*punct* .
*break*
the
other
engraving
is
quite
a
different
affair
*punct* :
the
ship
hove-to
upon
the
open
sea
*punct* ,
and
in
the
very
heart
of
the
leviathanic
life
*punct* ,
with
a
right
whale
alongside
*punct* ;
the
vessel
*punct* ,
in
the
act
of
cutting-in
*punct* ,
hove
over
to
the
monster
as
if
to
a
quay
*punct* ;
and
a
boat
*punct* ,
hurriedly
pushing
off
from
this
scene
of
activity
*punct* ,
is
about
giving
chase
to
whales
in
the
distance
*punct* .
*break*
the
harpoons
and
lances
lie
levelled
for
use
*punct* ;
three
oarsmen
are
just
setting
the
mast
in
its
hole
*punct* ;
while
from
a
sudden
roll
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
the
little
craft
stands
half-erect
out
of
the
water
*punct* ,
like
a
rearing
horse
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
three
whales
and
three
boats
*punct* ;
and
one
of
the
boats
*punct* ,
presumed
to
contain
the
missing
leg
in
all
its
original
integrity
*punct* ,
is
being
crunched
by
the
jaws
of
the
foremost
whale
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
time
of
his
justification
has
now
come
*punct* .
*break*
his
three
whales
are
as
good
whales
as
were
ever
published
in
wapping
*punct* ,
at
any
rate
*punct* ;
and
his
stump
as
unquestionable
a
stump
as
any
you
will
find
in
the
western
clearings
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
though
for
ever
mounted
on
that
stump
*punct* ,
never
a
stump-speech
does
the
poor
whaleman
make
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
with
downcast
eyes
*punct* ,
stands
ruefully
contemplating
his
own
amputation
*punct* .
*break*
throughout
the
pacific
*punct* ,
and
also
in
nantucket
*punct* ,
and
new
bedford
*punct* ,
and
sag
harbor
*punct* ,
you
will
come
across
lively
sketches
of
whales
and
whaling-scenes
*punct* ,
graven
by
the
fishermen
themselves
on
sperm
whale-teeth
*punct* ,
or
ladies
busks
wrought
out
of
the
right
whale-bone
*punct* ,
and
other
like
skrimshander
articles
*punct* ,
as
the
whalemen
call
the
numerous
little
ingenious
contrivances
they
elaborately
carve
out
of
the
rough
material
*punct* ,
in
their
hours
of
ocean
leisure
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
them
have
little
boxes
of
dentistical-looking
implements
*punct* ,
specially
intended
for
the
skrimshandering
business
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
in
general
*punct* ,
they
toil
with
their
jack-knives
alone
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
with
that
almost
omnipotent
tool
of
the
sailor
*punct* ,
they
will
turn
you
out
anything
you
please
*punct* ,
in
the
way
of
a
mariner's
fancy
*punct* .
*break*
long
exile
from
christendom
and
civilization
inevitably
restores
a
man
to
that
condition
in
which
god
placed
him
*punct* ,
i
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
called
savagery
*punct* .
*break*
your
true
whale-hunter
is
as
much
a
savage
as
an
iroquois
*punct* .
*break*
i
myself
am
a
savage
*punct* ;
owning
no
allegiance
but
to
the
king
of
the
cannibals
*punct* ;
and
ready
at
any
moment
to
rebel
against
him
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
one
of
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
the
savage
in
his
domestic
hours
*punct* ,
is
his
wonderful
patience
of
industry
*punct* .
*break*
an
ancient
hawaiian
war-club
or
spear-paddle
*punct* ,
in
its
full
multiplicity
and
elaboration
of
carving
*punct* ,
is
as
great
a
trophy
of
human
perseverance
as
a
latin
lexicon
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
with
but
a
bit
of
broken
sea-shell
or
a
shark's
tooth
*punct* ,
that
miraculous
intricacy
of
wooden
net-work
has
been
achieved
*punct* ;
and
it
has
cost
steady
years
of
steady
application
*punct* .
*break*
as
with
the
hawaiian
savage
*punct* ,
so
with
the
white
sailor-savage
*punct* .
*break*
wooden
whales
*punct* ,
or
whales
cut
in
profile
out
of
the
small
dark
slabs
of
the
noble
south
sea
war-wood
*punct* ,
are
frequently
met
with
in
the
forecastles
of
american
whalers
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
them
are
done
with
much
accuracy
*punct* .
*break*
at
some
old
gable-roofed
country
houses
you
will
see
brass
whales
hung
by
the
tail
for
knockers
to
the
road-side
door
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
porter
is
sleepy
*punct* ,
the
anvil-headed
whale
would
be
best
*punct* .
*break*
but
these
knocking
whales
are
seldom
remarkable
as
faithful
essays
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
spires
of
some
old-fashioned
churches
you
will
see
sheet-iron
whales
placed
there
for
weather-cocks
*punct* ;
but
they
are
so
elevated
*punct* ,
and
besides
that
are
to
all
intents
and
purposes
so
labelled
with
hands
off
*punct* !
*break*
you
cannot
examine
them
closely
enough
to
decide
upon
their
merit
*punct* .
*break*
in
bony
*punct* ,
ribby
regions
of
the
earth
*punct* ,
where
at
the
base
of
high
broken
cliffs
masses
of
rock
lie
strewn
in
fantastic
groupings
upon
the
plain
*punct* ,
you
will
often
discover
images
as
of
the
petrified
forms
of
the
leviathan
partly
merged
in
grass
*punct* ,
which
of
a
windy
day
breaks
against
them
in
a
surf
of
green
surges
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
in
mountainous
countries
where
the
traveller
is
continually
girdled
by
amphitheatrical
heights
*punct* ;
here
and
there
from
some
lucky
point
of
view
you
will
catch
passing
glimpses
of
the
profiles
of
whales
defined
along
the
undulating
ridges
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
must
be
a
thorough
whaleman
*punct* ,
to
see
these
sights
*punct* ;
and
not
only
that
*punct* ,
but
if
you
wish
to
return
to
such
a
sight
again
*punct* ,
you
must
be
sure
and
take
the
exact
intersecting
latitude
and
longitude
of
your
first
stand-point
*punct* ,
else
so
chance-like
are
such
observations
of
the
hills
*punct* ,
that
your
precise
*punct* ,
previous
stand-point
would
require
a
laborious
re-discovery
*punct* ;
like
the
solomon
islands
*punct* ,
which
still
remain
incognita
*punct* ,
though
once
high-ruffed
mendanna
trod
them
and
old
figuera
chronicled
them
*punct* .
*break*
nor
when
expandingly
lifted
by
your
subject
*punct* ,
can
you
fail
to
trace
out
great
whales
in
the
starry
heavens
*punct* ,
and
boats
in
pursuit
of
them
*punct* ;
as
when
long
filled
with
thoughts
of
war
the
eastern
nations
saw
armies
locked
in
battle
among
the
clouds
*punct* .
*break*
and
beneath
the
effulgent
antarctic
skies
i
have
boarded
the
argo-navis
*punct* ,
and
joined
the
chase
against
the
starry
cetus
far
beyond
the
utmost
stretch
of
hydrus
and
the
flying
fish
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
frigate's
anchors
for
my
bridle-bitts
and
fasces
of
harpoons
for
spurs
*punct* ,
would
i
could
mount
that
whale
and
leap
the
topmost
skies
*punct* ,
to
see
whether
the
fabled
heavens
with
all
their
countless
tents
really
lie
encamped
beyond
my
mortal
sight
*punct* !
*break*
for
leagues
and
leagues
it
undulated
round
us
*punct* ,
so
that
we
seemed
to
be
sailing
through
boundless
fields
of
ripe
and
golden
wheat
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
second
day
*punct* ,
numbers
of
right
whales
were
seen
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
secure
from
the
attack
of
a
sperm
whaler
like
the
pequod
*punct* ,
with
open
jaws
sluggishly
swam
through
the
brit
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
adhering
to
the
fringing
fibres
of
that
wondrous
venetian
blind
in
their
mouths
*punct* ,
was
in
that
manner
separated
from
the
water
that
escaped
at
the
lip
*punct* .
*break*
seen
from
the
mast-heads
*punct* ,
especially
when
they
paused
and
were
stationary
for
a
while
*punct* ,
their
vast
black
forms
looked
more
like
lifeless
masses
of
rock
than
anything
else
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
in
the
great
hunting
countries
of
india
*punct* ,
the
stranger
at
a
distance
will
sometimes
pass
on
the
plains
recumbent
elephants
without
knowing
them
to
be
such
*punct* ,
taking
them
for
bare
*punct* ,
blackened
elevations
of
the
soil
*punct* ;
even
so
*punct* ,
often
*punct* ,
with
him
*punct* ,
who
for
the
first
time
beholds
this
species
of
the
leviathans
of
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
and
even
when
recognised
at
last
*punct* ,
their
immense
magnitude
renders
it
very
hard
really
to
believe
that
such
bulky
masses
of
overgrowth
can
possibly
be
instinct
*punct* ,
in
all
parts
*punct* ,
with
the
same
sort
of
life
that
lives
in
a
dog
or
a
horse
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
in
other
respects
*punct* ,
you
can
hardly
regard
any
creatures
of
the
deep
with
the
same
feelings
that
you
do
those
of
the
shore
*punct* .
*break*
for
though
some
old
naturalists
have
maintained
that
all
creatures
of
the
land
are
of
their
kind
in
the
sea
*punct* ;
and
though
taking
a
broad
general
view
of
the
thing
*punct* ,
this
may
very
well
be
*punct* ;
yet
coming
to
specialties
*punct* ,
where
*punct* ,
for
example
*punct* ,
does
the
ocean
furnish
any
fish
that
in
disposition
answers
to
the
sagacious
kindness
of
the
dog
*punct* ?
*break*
the
accursed
shark
alone
can
in
any
generic
respect
be
said
to
bear
comparative
analogy
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
first
boat
we
read
of
*punct* ,
floated
on
an
ocean
*punct* ,
that
with
portuguese
vengeance
had
whelmed
a
whole
world
without
leaving
so
much
as
a
widow
*punct* .
*break*
that
same
ocean
rolls
now
*punct* ;
that
same
ocean
destroyed
the
wrecked
ships
of
last
year
*punct* .
*break*
yea
*punct* ,
foolish
mortals
*punct* ,
noah's
flood
is
not
yet
subsided
*punct* ;
two
thirds
of
the
fair
world
it
yet
covers
*punct* .
*break*
wherein
differ
the
sea
and
the
land
*punct* ,
that
a
miracle
upon
one
is
not
a
miracle
upon
the
other
*punct* ?
*break*
preternatural
terrors
rested
upon
the
hebrews
*punct* ,
when
under
the
feet
of
korah
and
his
company
the
live
ground
opened
and
swallowed
them
up
for
ever
*punct* ;
yet
not
a
modern
sun
ever
sets
*punct* ,
but
in
precisely
the
same
manner
the
live
sea
swallows
up
ships
and
crews
*punct* .
*break*
but
not
only
is
the
sea
such
a
foe
to
man
who
is
an
alien
to
it
*punct* ,
but
it
is
also
a
fiend
to
its
own
offspring
*punct* ;
worse
than
the
persian
host
who
murdered
his
own
guests
*punct* ;
sparing
not
the
creatures
which
itself
hath
spawned
*punct* .
*break*
like
a
savage
tigress
that
tossing
in
the
jungle
overlays
her
own
cubs
*punct* ,
so
the
sea
dashes
even
the
mightiest
whales
against
the
rocks
*punct* ,
and
leaves
them
there
side
by
side
with
the
split
wrecks
of
ships
*punct* .
*break*
no
mercy
*punct* ,
no
power
but
its
own
controls
it
*punct* .
*break*
panting
and
snorting
like
a
mad
battle
steed
that
has
lost
its
rider
*punct* ,
the
masterless
ocean
overruns
the
globe
*punct* .
*break*
consider
the
subtleness
of
the
sea
*punct* ;
how
its
most
dreaded
creatures
glide
under
water
*punct* ,
unapparent
for
the
most
part
*punct* ,
and
treacherously
hidden
beneath
the
loveliest
tints
of
azure
*punct* .
*break*
consider
also
the
devilish
brilliance
and
beauty
of
many
of
its
most
remorseless
tribes
*punct* ,
as
the
dainty
embellished
shape
of
many
species
of
sharks
*punct* .
*break*
consider
*punct* ,
once
more
*punct* ,
the
universal
cannibalism
of
the
sea
*punct* ;
all
whose
creatures
prey
upon
each
other
*punct* ,
carrying
on
eternal
war
since
the
world
began
*punct* .
*break*
consider
all
this
*punct* ;
and
then
turn
to
this
green
*punct* ,
gentle
*punct* ,
and
most
docile
earth
*punct* ;
consider
them
both
*punct* ,
the
sea
and
the
land
*punct* ;
and
do
you
not
find
a
strange
analogy
to
something
in
yourself
*punct* ?
*break*
push
not
off
from
that
isle
*punct* ,
thou
canst
never
return
*punct* !
*break*
and
still
*punct* ,
at
wide
intervals
in
the
silvery
night
*punct* ,
the
lonely
*punct* ,
alluring
jet
would
be
seen
*punct* .
*break*
but
one
transparent
blue
morning
*punct* ,
when
a
stillness
almost
preternatural
spread
over
the
sea
*punct* ,
however
unattended
with
any
stagnant
calm
*punct* ;
when
the
long
burnished
sun-glade
on
the
waters
seemed
a
golden
finger
laid
across
them
*punct* ,
enjoining
some
secresy
*punct* ;
when
the
slippered
waves
whispered
together
as
they
softly
ran
on
*punct* ;
in
this
profound
hush
of
the
visible
sphere
a
strange
spectre
was
seen
by
daggoo
from
the
main-mast-head
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
distance
*punct* ,
a
great
white
mass
lazily
rose
*punct* ,
and
rising
higher
and
higher
*punct* ,
and
disentangling
itself
from
the
azure
*punct* ,
at
last
gleamed
before
our
prow
like
a
snow-slide
*punct* ,
new
slid
from
the
hills
*punct* .
*break*
thus
glistening
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
as
slowly
it
subsided
*punct* ,
and
sank
*punct* .
*break*
then
once
more
arose
*punct* ,
and
silently
gleamed
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
not
a
whale
*punct* ;
and
yet
is
this
moby
dick
*punct* ?
*break*
again
the
phantom
went
down
*punct* ,
but
on
re-appearing
once
more
*punct* ,
with
a
stiletto-like
cry
that
startled
every
man
from
his
nod
*punct* ,
the
negro
yelled
out
*punct* ,
there
*punct* !
*break*
there
she
breaches
*punct* !
*break*
the
white
whale
*punct* ,
the
white
whale
*punct* !
*break*
upon
this
*punct* ,
the
seamen
rushed
to
the
yard-arms
*punct* ,
as
in
swarming-time
the
bees
rush
to
the
boughs
*punct* .
*break*
whether
the
flitting
attendance
of
the
one
still
and
solitary
jet
had
gradually
worked
upon
ahab
*punct* ,
so
that
he
was
now
prepared
to
connect
the
ideas
of
mildness
and
repose
with
the
first
sight
of
the
particular
whale
he
pursued
*punct* ;
however
this
was
*punct* ,
or
whether
his
eagerness
betrayed
him
*punct* ;
whichever
way
it
might
have
been
*punct* ,
no
sooner
did
he
distinctly
perceive
the
white
mass
*punct* ,
than
with
a
quick
intensity
he
instantly
gave
orders
for
lowering
*punct* .
*break*
the
four
boats
were
soon
on
the
water
*punct* ;
ahab's
in
advance
*punct* ,
and
all
swiftly
pulling
towards
their
prey
*punct* .
*break*
soon
it
went
down
*punct* ,
and
while
*punct* ,
with
oars
suspended
*punct* ,
we
were
awaiting
its
reappearance
*punct* ,
lo
*punct* !
*break*
in
the
same
spot
where
it
sank
*punct* ,
once
more
it
slowly
rose
*punct* .
*break*
almost
forgetting
for
the
moment
all
thoughts
of
moby
dick
*punct* ,
we
now
gazed
at
the
most
wondrous
phenomenon
which
the
secret
seas
have
hitherto
revealed
to
mankind
*punct* .
*break*
a
vast
pulpy
mass
*punct* ,
furlongs
in
length
and
breadth
*punct* ,
of
a
glancing
cream-color
*punct* ,
lay
floating
on
the
water
*punct* ,
innumerable
long
arms
radiating
from
its
centre
*punct* ,
and
curling
and
twisting
like
a
nest
of
anacondas
*punct* ,
as
if
blindly
to
clutch
at
any
hapless
object
within
reach
*punct* .
*break*
no
perceptible
face
or
front
did
it
have
*punct* ;
no
conceivable
token
of
either
sensation
or
instinct
*punct* ;
but
undulated
there
on
the
billows
*punct* ,
an
unearthly
*punct* ,
formless
*punct* ,
chance-like
apparition
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
as
with
a
low
sucking
sound
it
slowly
disappeared
again
*punct* ,
starbuck
still
gazing
at
the
agitated
waters
where
it
had
sunk
*punct* ,
with
a
wild
voice
exclaimed
*punct* ,
almost
rather
had
i
seen
moby
dick
and
fought
him
*punct* ,
than
to
have
seen
thee
*punct* ,
thou
white
ghost
*punct* !
*break*
what
was
it
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
the
great
live
squid
*punct* ,
which
they
say
*punct* ,
few
whale-ships
ever
beheld
*punct* ,
and
returned
to
their
ports
to
tell
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
ahab
said
nothing
*punct* ;
turning
his
boat
*punct* ,
he
sailed
back
to
the
vessel
*punct* ;
the
rest
as
silently
following
*punct* .
*break*
whatever
superstitions
the
sperm
whalemen
in
general
have
connected
with
the
sight
of
this
object
*punct* ,
certain
it
is
*punct* ,
that
a
glimpse
of
it
being
so
very
unusual
*punct* ,
that
circumstance
has
gone
far
to
invest
it
with
portentousness
*punct* .
*break*
for
though
other
species
of
whales
find
their
food
above
water
*punct* ,
and
may
be
seen
by
man
in
the
act
of
feeding
*punct* ,
the
spermaceti
whale
obtains
his
whole
food
in
unknown
zones
below
the
surface
*punct* ;
and
only
by
inference
is
it
that
any
one
can
tell
of
what
*punct* ,
precisely
*punct* ,
that
food
consists
*punct* .
*break*
at
times
*punct* ,
when
closely
pursued
*punct* ,
he
will
disgorge
what
are
supposed
to
be
the
detached
arms
of
the
squid
*punct* ;
some
of
them
thus
exhibited
exceeding
twenty
and
thirty
feet
in
length
*punct* .
*break*
they
fancy
that
the
monster
to
which
these
arms
belonged
ordinarily
clings
by
them
to
the
bed
of
the
ocean
*punct* ;
and
that
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
unlike
other
species
*punct* ,
is
supplied
with
teeth
in
order
to
attack
and
tear
it
*punct* .
*break*
there
seems
some
ground
to
imagine
that
the
great
kraken
of
bishop
pontoppodan
may
ultimately
resolve
itself
into
squid
*punct* .
*break*
the
manner
in
which
the
bishop
describes
it
*punct* ,
as
alternately
rising
and
sinking
*punct* ,
with
some
other
particulars
he
narrates
*punct* ,
in
all
this
the
two
correspond
*punct* .
*break*
but
much
abatement
is
necessary
with
respect
to
the
incredible
bulk
he
assigns
it
*punct* .
*break*
of
late
years
the
manilla
rope
has
in
the
american
fishery
almost
entirely
superseded
hemp
as
a
material
for
whale-lines
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
though
not
so
durable
as
hemp
*punct* ,
it
is
stronger
*punct* ,
and
far
more
soft
and
elastic
*punct* ;
and
i
will
add
*punct* ,
since
there
is
an
aesthetics
in
all
things
*punct* ,
is
much
more
handsome
and
becoming
to
the
boat
*punct* ,
than
hemp
*punct* .
*break*
hemp
is
a
dusky
*punct* ,
dark
fellow
*punct* ,
a
sort
of
indian
*punct* ;
but
manilla
is
as
a
golden-haired
circassian
to
behold
*punct* .
*break*
the
whale
line
is
only
two
thirds
of
an
inch
in
thickness
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
sight
*punct* ,
you
would
not
think
it
so
strong
as
it
really
is
*punct* .
*break*
by
experiment
its
one
and
fifty
yarns
will
each
suspend
a
weight
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
*punct* ;
so
that
the
whole
rope
will
bear
a
strain
nearly
equal
to
three
tons
*punct* .
*break*
in
length
*punct* ,
the
common
sperm
whale-line
measures
something
over
two
hundred
fathoms
*punct* .
*break*
towards
the
stern
of
the
boat
it
is
spirally
coiled
away
in
the
tub
*punct* ,
not
like
the
worm-pipe
of
a
still
though
*punct* ,
but
so
as
to
form
one
round
*punct* ,
cheese-shaped
mass
of
densely
bedded
sheaves
*punct* ,
or
layers
of
concentric
spiralizations
*punct* ,
without
any
hollow
but
the
heart
*punct* ,
or
minute
vertical
tube
formed
at
the
axis
of
the
cheese
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
least
tangle
or
kink
in
the
coiling
would
*punct* ,
in
running
out
*punct* ,
infallibly
take
somebody's
arm
*punct* ,
leg
*punct* ,
or
entire
body
off
*punct* ,
the
utmost
precaution
is
used
in
stowing
the
line
in
its
tub
*punct* .
*break*
some
harpooneers
will
consume
almost
an
entire
morning
in
this
business
*punct* ,
carrying
the
line
high
aloft
and
then
reeving
it
downwards
through
a
block
towards
the
tub
*punct* ,
so
as
in
the
act
of
coiling
to
free
it
from
all
possible
wrinkles
and
twists
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
english
boats
two
tubs
are
used
instead
of
one
*punct* ;
the
same
line
being
continuously
coiled
in
both
tubs
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
painted
canvas
cover
is
clapped
on
the
american
line-tub
*punct* ,
the
boat
looks
as
if
it
were
pulling
off
with
a
prodigious
great
wedding-cake
to
present
to
the
whales
*punct* .
*break*
both
ends
of
the
line
are
exposed
*punct* ;
the
lower
end
terminating
in
an
eye-splice
or
loop
coming
up
from
the
bottom
against
the
side
of
the
tub
*punct* ,
and
hanging
over
its
edge
completely
disengaged
from
everything
*punct* .
*break*
this
arrangement
of
the
lower
end
is
necessary
on
two
accounts
*punct* .
*break*
first
*punct* :
in
order
to
facilitate
the
fastening
to
it
of
an
additional
line
from
a
neighboring
boat
*punct* ,
in
case
the
stricken
whale
should
sound
so
deep
as
to
threaten
to
carry
off
the
entire
line
originally
attached
to
the
harpoon
*punct* .
*break*
in
these
instances
*punct* ,
the
whale
of
course
is
shifted
like
a
mug
of
ale
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ,
from
the
one
boat
to
the
other
*punct* ;
though
the
first
boat
always
hovers
at
hand
to
assist
its
consort
*punct* .
*break*
second
*punct* :
this
arrangement
is
indispensable
for
common
safety's
sake
*punct* ;
for
were
the
lower
end
of
the
line
in
any
way
attached
to
the
boat
*punct* ,
and
were
the
whale
then
to
run
the
line
out
to
the
end
almost
in
a
single
*punct* ,
smoking
minute
as
he
sometimes
does
*punct* ,
he
would
not
stop
there
*punct* ,
for
the
doomed
boat
would
infallibly
be
dragged
down
after
him
into
the
profundity
of
the
sea
*punct* ;
and
in
that
case
no
town-crier
would
ever
find
her
again
*punct* .
*break*
before
lowering
the
boat
for
the
chase
*punct* ,
the
upper
end
of
the
line
is
taken
aft
from
the
tub
*punct* ,
and
passing
round
the
logger-head
there
*punct* ,
is
again
carried
forward
the
entire
length
of
the
boat
*punct* ,
resting
crosswise
upon
the
loom
or
handle
of
every
man's
oar
*punct* ,
so
that
it
jogs
against
his
wrist
in
rowing
*punct* ;
and
also
passing
between
the
men
*punct* ,
as
they
alternately
sit
at
the
opposite
gunwales
*punct* ,
to
the
leaded
chocks
or
grooves
in
the
extreme
pointed
prow
of
the
boat
*punct* ,
where
a
wooden
pin
or
skewer
the
size
of
a
common
quill
*punct* ,
prevents
it
from
slipping
out
*punct* .
*break*
thus
the
whale-line
folds
the
whole
boat
in
its
complicated
coils
*punct* ,
twisting
and
writhing
around
it
in
almost
every
direction
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
oarsmen
are
involved
in
its
perilous
contortions
*punct* ;
so
that
to
the
timid
eye
of
the
landsman
*punct* ,
they
seem
as
indian
jugglers
*punct* ,
with
the
deadliest
snakes
sportively
festooning
their
limbs
*punct* .
*break*
nor
can
any
son
of
mortal
woman
*punct* ,
for
the
first
time
*punct* ,
seat
himself
amid
those
hempen
intricacies
*punct* ,
and
while
straining
his
utmost
at
the
oar
*punct* ,
bethink
him
that
at
any
unknown
instant
the
harpoon
may
be
darted
*punct* ,
and
all
these
horrible
contortions
be
put
in
play
like
ringed
lightnings
*punct* ;
he
cannot
be
thus
circumstanced
without
a
shudder
that
makes
the
very
marrow
in
his
bones
to
quiver
in
him
like
a
shaken
jelly
*punct* .
*break*
yet
habit
*punct* ,
strange
thing
*punct* !
*break*
what
cannot
habit
accomplish?
*punct* ,
gayer
sallies
*punct* ,
more
merry
mirth
*punct* ,
better
jokes
*punct* ,
and
brighter
repartees
*punct* ,
you
never
heard
over
your
mahogany
*punct* ,
than
you
will
hear
over
the
half-inch
white
cedar
of
the
whale-boat
*punct* ,
when
thus
hung
in
hangman's
nooses
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
like
the
six
burghers
of
calais
before
king
edward
*punct* ,
the
six
men
composing
the
crew
pull
into
the
jaws
of
death
*punct* ,
with
a
halter
around
every
neck
*punct* ,
as
you
may
say
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
a
very
little
thought
will
now
enable
you
to
account
for
those
repeated
whaling
disasters
*punct* ,
some
few
of
which
are
casually
chronicled
*punct* ,
of
this
man
or
that
man
being
taken
out
of
the
boat
by
the
line
*punct* ,
and
lost
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
when
the
line
is
darting
out
*punct* ,
to
be
seated
then
in
the
boat
*punct* ,
is
like
being
seated
in
the
midst
of
the
manifold
whizzings
of
a
steam-engine
in
full
play
*punct* ,
when
every
flying
beam
*punct* ,
and
shaft
*punct* ,
and
wheel
*punct* ,
is
grazing
you
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
worse
*punct* ;
for
you
cannot
sit
motionless
in
the
heart
of
these
perils
*punct* ,
because
the
boat
is
rocking
like
a
cradle
*punct* ,
and
you
are
pitched
one
way
and
the
other
*punct* ,
without
the
slightest
warning
*punct* ;
and
only
by
a
certain
self-adjusting
buoyancy
and
simultaneousness
of
volition
and
action
*punct* ,
can
you
escape
being
made
a
mazeppa
of
*punct* ,
and
run
away
with
where
the
all-seeing
sun
himself
could
never
pierce
you
out
*punct* .
*break*
but
why
say
more
*punct* ?
*break*
all
men
live
enveloped
in
whale-lines
*punct* .
*break*
all
are
born
with
halters
round
their
necks
*punct* ;
but
it
is
only
when
caught
in
the
swift
*punct* ,
sudden
turn
of
death
*punct* ,
that
mortals
realize
the
silent
*punct* ,
subtle
*punct* ,
ever-present
perils
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
when
you
see
him
quid
*punct* ,
said
the
savage
*punct* ,
honing
his
harpoon
in
the
bow
of
his
hoisted
boat
*punct* ,
then
you
quick
see
him
parm
whale
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
day
was
exceedingly
still
and
sultry
*punct* ,
and
with
nothing
special
to
engage
them
*punct* ,
the
pequod's
crew
could
hardly
resist
the
spell
of
sleep
induced
by
such
a
vacant
sea
*punct* .
*break*
for
this
part
of
the
indian
ocean
through
which
we
then
were
voyaging
is
not
what
whalemen
call
a
lively
ground
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
it
affords
fewer
glimpses
of
porpoises
*punct* ,
dolphins
*punct* ,
flying-fish
*punct* ,
and
other
vivacious
denizens
of
more
stirring
waters
*punct* ,
than
those
off
the
rio
de
la
plata
*punct* ,
or
the
in-shore
ground
off
peru
*punct* .
*break*
no
resolution
could
withstand
it
*punct* ;
in
that
dreamy
mood
losing
all
consciousness
*punct* ,
at
last
my
soul
went
out
of
my
body
*punct* ;
though
my
body
still
continued
to
sway
as
a
pendulum
will
*punct* ,
long
after
the
power
which
first
moved
it
is
withdrawn
*punct* .
*break*
ere
forgetfulness
altogether
came
over
me
*punct* ,
i
had
noticed
that
the
seamen
at
the
main
and
mizen
mast-heads
were
already
drowsy
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
at
last
all
three
of
us
lifelessly
swung
from
the
spars
*punct* ,
and
for
every
swing
that
we
made
there
was
a
nod
from
below
from
the
slumbering
helmsman
*punct* .
*break*
the
waves
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
nodded
their
indolent
crests
*punct* ;
and
across
the
wide
trance
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
east
nodded
to
west
*punct* ,
and
the
sun
over
all
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
bubbles
seemed
bursting
beneath
my
closed
eyes
*punct* ;
like
vices
my
hands
grasped
the
shrouds
*punct* ;
some
invisible
*punct* ,
gracious
agency
preserved
me
*punct* ;
with
a
shock
i
came
back
to
life
*punct* .
*break*
close
under
our
lee
*punct* ,
not
forty
fathoms
off
*punct* ,
a
gigantic
sperm
whale
lay
rolling
in
the
water
like
the
capsized
hull
of
a
frigate
*punct* ,
his
broad
*punct* ,
glossy
back
*punct* ,
of
an
ethiopian
hue
*punct* ,
glistening
in
the
sun's
rays
like
a
mirror
*punct* .
*break*
but
lazily
undulating
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
and
ever
and
anon
tranquilly
spouting
his
vapory
jet
*punct* ,
the
whale
looked
like
a
portly
burgher
smoking
his
pipe
of
a
warm
afternoon
*punct* .
*break*
but
that
pipe
*punct* ,
poor
whale
*punct* ,
was
thy
last
*punct* .
*break*
as
if
struck
by
some
enchanter's
wand
*punct* ,
the
sleepy
ship
and
every
sleeper
in
it
all
at
once
started
into
wakefulness
*punct* ;
and
more
than
a
score
of
voices
from
all
parts
of
the
vessel
*punct* ,
simultaneously
with
the
three
notes
from
aloft
*punct* ,
shouted
forth
the
accustomed
cry
*punct* ,
as
the
great
fish
slowly
and
regularly
spouted
the
sparkling
brine
into
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
clear
away
the
boats
*punct* !
*break*
and
obeying
his
own
order
*punct* ,
he
dashed
the
helm
down
before
the
helmsman
could
handle
the
spokes
*punct* .
*break*
the
sudden
exclamations
of
the
crew
must
have
alarmed
the
whale
*punct* ;
and
ere
the
boats
were
down
*punct* ,
majestically
turning
*punct* ,
he
swam
away
to
the
leeward
*punct* ,
but
with
such
a
steady
tranquillity
*punct* ,
and
making
so
few
ripples
as
he
swam
*punct* ,
that
thinking
after
all
he
might
not
as
yet
be
alarmed
*punct* ,
ahab
gave
orders
that
not
an
oar
should
be
used
*punct* ,
and
no
man
must
speak
but
in
whispers
*punct* .
*break*
presently
*punct* ,
as
we
thus
glided
in
chase
*punct* ,
the
monster
perpendicularly
flitted
his
tail
forty
feet
into
the
air
*punct* ,
and
then
sank
out
of
sight
like
a
tower
swallowed
up
*punct* .
*break*
there
go
flukes
*punct* !
*break*
was
the
cry
*punct* ,
an
announcement
immediately
followed
by
stubb's
producing
his
match
and
igniting
his
pipe
*punct* ,
for
now
a
respite
was
granted
*punct* .
*break*
after
the
full
interval
of
his
sounding
had
elapsed
*punct* ,
the
whale
rose
again
*punct* ,
and
being
now
in
advance
of
the
smoker's
boat
*punct* ,
and
much
nearer
to
it
than
to
any
of
the
others
*punct* ,
stubb
counted
upon
the
honor
of
the
capture
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
obvious
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
that
the
whale
had
at
length
become
aware
of
his
pursuers
*punct* .
*break*
all
silence
of
cautiousness
was
therefore
no
longer
of
use
*punct* .
*break*
paddles
were
dropped
*punct* ,
and
oars
came
loudly
into
play
*punct* .
*break*
and
still
puffing
at
his
pipe
*punct* ,
stubb
cheered
on
his
crew
to
the
assault
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
a
mighty
change
had
come
over
the
fish
*punct* .
*break*
all
alive
to
his
jeopardy
*punct* ,
he
was
going
head
out
*punct* ;
that
part
obliquely
projecting
from
the
mad

brewed

*break*
start
her
*punct* ,
start
her
*punct* ,
my
men
*punct* !
*break*
don't
hurry
yourselves
*punct* ;
take
plenty
of
time
*punct* ,
but
start
her
*punct* ;
start
her
like
thunder-claps
*punct* ,
that's
all
*punct* ,
cried
stubb
*punct* ,
spluttering
out
the
smoke
as
he
spoke
*punct* .
*break*
start
her
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ;
give
em
the
long
and
strong
stroke
*punct* ,
tashtego
*punct* .
*break*
start
her
*punct* ,
tash
*punct* ,
my
boy
*punct* ,
start
her
*punct* ,
all
*punct* ;
but
keep
cool
*punct* ,
keep
cool
*punct* ,
cucumbers
is
the
word
*punct* ,
easy
*punct* ,
easy
*punct* ,
only
start
her
like
grim
death
and
grinning
devils
*punct* ,
and
raise
the
buried
dead
perpendicular
out
of
their
graves
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* ,
that's
all
*punct* .
*break*
yelled
daggoo
*punct* ,
straining
forwards
and
backwards
on
his
seat
*punct* ,
like
a
pacing
tiger
in
his
cage
*punct* .
*break*
howled
queequeg
*punct* ,
as
if
smacking
his
lips
over
a
mouthful
of
grenadier's
steak
*punct* .
*break*
and
thus
with
oars
and
yells
the
keels
cut
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
*punct* ,
stubb
retaining
his
place
in
the
van
*punct* ,
still
encouraged
his
men
to
the
onset
*punct* ,
all
the
while
puffing
the
smoke
from
his
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
the
harpoon
was
hurled
*punct* .
*break*
the
oarsmen
backed
water
*punct* ;
the
same
moment
something
went
hot
and
hissing
along
every
one
of
their
wrists
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
magical
line
*punct* .
*break*
an
instant
before
*punct* ,
stubb
had
swiftly
caught
two
additional
turns
with
it
round
the
loggerhead
*punct* ,
whence
*punct* ,
by
reason
of
its
increased
rapid
circlings
*punct* ,
a
hempen
blue
smoke
now
jetted
up
and
mingled
with
the
steady
fumes
from
his
pipe
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
line
passed
round
and
round
the
loggerhead
*punct* ;
so
also
*punct* ,
just
before
reaching
that
point
*punct* ,
it
blisteringly
passed
through
and
through
both
of
stubb's
hands
*punct* ,
from
which
the
hand-cloths
*punct* ,
or
squares
of
quilted
canvas
sometimes
worn
at
these
times
*punct* ,
had
accidentally
dropped
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
like
holding
an
enemy's
sharp
two-edged
sword
by
the
blade
*punct* ,
and
that
enemy
all
the
time
striving
to
wrest
it
out
of
your
clutch
*punct* .
*break*
wet
the
line
*punct* !
*break*
wet
the
line
*punct* !
*break*
cried
stubb
to
the
tub
oarsman
*punct* ,
him
seated
by
the
tub
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
snatching
off
his
hat
*punct* ,
dashed
the
sea-water
into
it
*punct* .
*break*
more
turns
were
taken
*punct* ,
so
that
the
line
began
holding
its
place
*punct* .
*break*
the
boat
now
flew
through
the
boiling
water
like
a
shark
all
fins
*punct* .
*break*
stubb
and
tashtego
here
changed
places
*punct* ,
stem
for
stern
*punct* ,
a
staggering
business
truly
in
that
rocking
commotion
*punct* .
*break*
a
continual
cascade
played
at
the
bows
*punct* ;
a
ceaseless
whirling
eddy
in
her
wake
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
at
the
slightest
motion
from
within
*punct* ,
even
but
of
a
little
finger
*punct* ,
the
vibrating
*punct* ,
cracking
craft
canted
over
her
spasmodic
gunwale
into
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
thus
they
rushed
*punct* ;
each
man
with
might
and
main
clinging
to
his
seat
*punct* ,
to
prevent
being
tossed
to
the
foam
*punct* ;
and
the
tall
form
of
tashtego
at
the
steering
oar
crouching
almost
double
*punct* ,
in
order
to
bring
down
his
centre
of
gravity
*punct* .
*break*
whole
atlantics
and
pacifics
seemed
passed
as
they
shot
on
their
way
*punct* ,
till
at
length
the
whale
somewhat
slackened
his
flight
*punct* .
*break*
haul
in
*punct* ,
haul
in
*punct* !
*break*
cried
stubb
to
the
bowsman
*punct* !
*break*
and
*punct* ,
facing
round
towards
the
whale
*punct* ,
all
hands
began
pulling
the
boat
up
to
him
*punct* ,
while
yet
the
boat
was
being
towed
on
*punct* .
*break*
soon
ranging
up
by
his
flank
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ,
firmly
planting
his
knee
in
the
clumsy
cleat
*punct* ,
darted
dart
after
dart
into
the
flying
fish
*punct* ;
at
the
word
of
command
*punct* ,
the
boat
alternately
sterning
out
of
the
way
of
the
whale's
horrible
wallow
*punct* ,
and
then
ranging
up
for
another
fling
*punct* .
*break*
the
red
tide
now
poured
from
all
sides
of
the
monster
like
brooks
down
a
hill
*punct* .
*break*
his
tormented
body
rolled
not
in
brine
but
in
blood
*punct* ,
which
bubbled
and
seethed
for
furlongs
behind
in
their
wake
*punct* .
*break*
the
slanting
sun
playing
upon
this
crimson
pond
in
the
sea
*punct* ,
sent
back
its
reflection
into
every
face
*punct* ,
so
that
they
all
glowed
to
each
other
like
red
men
*punct* .
*break*
and
all
the
while
*punct* ,
jet
after
jet
of
white
smoke
was
agonizingly
shot
from
the
spiracle
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
and
vehement
puff
after
puff
from
the
mouth
of
the
excited
headsman
*punct* ;
as
at
every
dart
*punct* ,
hauling
in
upon
his
crooked
lance
*punct* ,
by
the
line
attached
to
it
*punct* ,
stubb
straightened
it
again
and
again
*punct* ,
by
a
few
rapid
blows
against
the
gunwale
*punct* ,
then
again
and
again
sent
it
into
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
pull
up
*punct* ,
pull
up
*punct* !
*break*
he
now
cried
to
the
bowsman
*punct* ,
as
the
waning
whale
relaxed
in
his
wrath
*punct* .
*break*
pull
up!
*punct* ,
close
to
*punct* !
*break*
and
the
boat
ranged
along
the
fish's
flank
*punct* .
*break*
when
reaching
far
over
the
bow
*punct* ,
stubb
slowly
churned
his
long
sharp
lance
into
the
fish
*punct* ,
and
kept
it
there
*punct* ,
carefully
churning
and
churning
*punct* ,
as
if
cautiously
seeking
to
feel
after
some
gold
watch
that
the
whale
might
have
swallowed
*punct* ,
and
which
he
was
fearful
of
breaking
ere
he
could
hook
it
out
*punct* .
*break*
but
that
gold
watch
he
sought
was
the
innermost
life
of
the
fish
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
abating
in
his
flurry
*punct* ,
the
whale
once
more
rolled
out
into
view
*punct* ;
surging
from
side
to
side
*punct* ;
spasmodically
dilating
and
contracting
his
spout-hole
*punct* ,
with
sharp
*punct* ,
cracking
*punct* ,
agonized
respirations
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
gush
after
gush
of
clotted
red
gore
*punct* ,
as
if
it
had
been
the
purple
lees
of
red
wine
*punct* ,
shot
into
the
frighted
air
*punct* ;
and
falling
back
again
*punct* ,
ran
dripping
down
his
motionless
flanks
into
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
his
heart
had
burst
*punct* !
*break*
he's
dead
*punct* ,
mr.
stubb
*punct* ,
said
daggoo
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ;
both
pipes
smoked
out
*punct* !
*break*
though
apparently
the
most
massive
*punct* ,
it
is
by
far
the
most
buoyant
part
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
with
ease
he
elevates
it
in
the
air
*punct* ,
and
invariably
does
so
when
going
at
his
utmost
speed
*punct* .
*break*
according
to
the
invariable
usage
of
the
fishery
*punct* ,
the
whale-boat
pushes
off
from
the
ship
*punct* ,
with
the
headsman
or
whale-killer
as
temporary
steersman
*punct* ,
and
the
harpooneer
or
whale-fastener
pulling
the
foremost
oar
*punct* ,
the
one
known
as
the
harpooneer-oar
*punct* .
*break*
now
it
needs
a
strong
*punct* ,
nervous
arm
to
strike
the
first
iron
into
the
fish
*punct* ;
for
often
*punct* ,
in
what
is
called
a
long
dart
*punct* ,
the
heavy
implement
has
to
be
flung
to
the
distance
of
twenty
or
thirty
feet
*punct* .
*break*
for
one
*punct* ,
i
cannot
bawl
very
heartily
and
work
very
recklessly
at
one
and
the
same
time
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
straining
*punct* ,
bawling
state
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
with
his
back
to
the
fish
*punct* ,
all
at
once
the
exhausted
harpooneer
hears
the
exciting
cry
*punct* ,
stand
up
*punct* ,
and
give
it
to
him
*punct* !
*break*
he
now
has
to
drop
and
secure
his
oar
*punct* ,
turn
round
on
his
centre
half
way
*punct* ,
seize
his
harpoon
from
the
crotch
*punct* ,
and
with
what
little
strength
may
remain
*punct* ,
he
essays
to
pitch
it
somehow
into
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
no
wonder
*punct* ,
taking
the
whole
fleet
of
whalemen
in
a
body
*punct* ,
that
out
of
fifty
fair
chances
for
a
dart
*punct* ,
not
five
are
successful
*punct* ;
no
wonder
that
so
many
hapless
harpooneers
are
madly
cursed
and
disrated
*punct* ;
no
wonder
that
some
of
them
actually
burst
their
blood-vessels
in
the
boat
*punct* ;
no
wonder
that
some
sperm
whalemen
are
absent
four
years
with
four
barrels
*punct* ;
no
wonder
that
to
many
ship
owners
*punct* ,
whaling
is
but
a
losing
concern
*punct* ;
for
it
is
the
harpooneer
that
makes
the
voyage
*punct* ,
and
if
you
take
the
breath
out
of
his
body
how
can
you
expect
to
find
it
there
when
most
wanted
*punct* !
*break*
again
*punct* ,
if
the
dart
be
successful
*punct* ,
then
at
the
second
critical
instant
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
when
the
whale
starts
to
run
*punct* ,
the
boat-header
and
harpooneer
likewise
start
to
running
fore
and
aft
*punct* ,
to
the
imminent
jeopardy
of
themselves
and
every
one
else
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
then
they
change
places
*punct* ;
and
the
headsman
*punct* ,
the
chief
officer
of
the
little
craft
*punct* ,
takes
his
proper
station
in
the
bows
of
the
boat
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
i
care
not
who
maintains
the
contrary
*punct* ,
but
all
this
is
both
foolish
and
unnecessary
*punct* .
*break*
the
headsman
should
stay
in
the
bows
from
first
to
last
*punct* ;
he
should
both
dart
the
harpoon
and
the
lance
*punct* ,
and
no
rowing
whatever
should
be
expected
of
him
*punct* ,
except
under
circumstances
obvious
to
any
fisherman
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
that
this
would
sometimes
involve
a
slight
loss
of
speed
in
the
chase
*punct* ;
but
long
experience
in
various
whalemen
of
more
than
one
nation
has
convinced
me
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
failures
in
the
fishery
*punct* ,
it
has
not
by
any
means
been
so
much
the
speed
of
the
whale
as
the
before
described
exhaustion
of
the
harpooneer
that
has
caused
them
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
in
productive
subjects
*punct* ,
grow
the
chapters
*punct* .
*break*
the
crotch
alluded
to
on
a
previous
page
deserves
independent
mention
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
notched
stick
of
a
peculiar
form
*punct* ,
some
two
feet
in
length
*punct* ,
which
is
perpendicularly
inserted
into
the
starboard
gunwale
near
the
bow
*punct* ,
for
the
purpose
of
furnishing
a
rest
for
the
wooden
extremity
of
the
harpoon
*punct* ,
whose
other
naked
*punct* ,
barbed
end
slopingly
projects
from
the
prow
*punct* .
*break*
thereby
the
weapon
is
instantly
at
hand
to
its
hurler
*punct* ,
who
snatches
it
up
as
readily
from
its
rest
as
a
backwoodsman
swings
his
rifle
from
the
wall
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
customary
to
have
two
harpoons
reposing
in
the
crotch
*punct* ,
respectively
called
the
first
and
second
irons
*punct* .
*break*
but
these
two
harpoons
*punct* ,
each
by
its
own
cord
*punct* ,
are
both
connected
with
the
line
*punct* ;
the
object
being
this
*punct* :
to
dart
them
both
*punct* ,
if
possible
*punct* ,
one
instantly
after
the
other
into
the
same
whale
*punct* ;
so
that
if
*punct* ,
in
the
coming
drag
*punct* ,
one
should
draw
out
*punct* ,
the
other
may
still
retain
a
hold
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
doubling
of
the
chances
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
very
often
happens
that
owing
to
the
instantaneous
*punct* ,
violent
*punct* ,
convulsive
running
of
the
whale
upon
receiving
the
first
iron
*punct* ,
it
becomes
impossible
for
the
harpooneer
*punct* ,
however
lightning-like
in
his
movements
*punct* ,
to
pitch
the
second
iron
into
him
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
as
the
second
iron
is
already
connected
with
the
line
*punct* ,
and
the
line
is
running
*punct* ,
hence
that
weapon
must
*punct* ,
at
all
events
*punct* ,
be
anticipatingly
tossed
out
of
the
boat
*punct* ,
somehow
and
somewhere
*punct* ;
else
the
most
terrible
jeopardy
would
involve
all
hands
*punct* .
*break*
tumbled
into
the
water
*punct* ,
it
accordingly
is
in
such
cases
*punct* ;
the
spare
coils
of
box
line
*punct* ,
mentioned
in
a
preceding
chapter
*punct* ,
making
this
feat
*punct* ,
in
most
instances
*punct* ,
prudently
practicable
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
critical
act
is
not
always
unattended
with
the
saddest
and
most
fatal
casualties
*punct* .
*break*
nor
*punct* ,
in
general
*punct* ,
is
it
possible
to
secure
it
again
until
the
whale
is
fairly
captured
and
a
corpse
*punct* .
*break*
consider
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
how
it
must
be
in
the
case
of
four
boats
all
engaging
one
unusually
strong
*punct* ,
active
*punct* ,
and
knowing
whale
*punct* ;
when
owing
to
these
qualities
in
him
*punct* ,
as
well
as
to
the
thousand
concurring
accidents
of
such
an
audacious
enterprise
*punct* ,
eight
or
ten
loose
second
irons
may
be
simultaneously
dangling
about
him
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
each
boat
is
supplied
with
several
harpoons
to
bend
on
to
the
line
should
the
first
one
be
ineffectually
darted
without
recovery
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
calm
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
forming
a
tandem
of
three
boats
*punct* ,
we
commenced
the
slow
business
of
towing
the
trophy
to
the
pequod
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
*punct* ,
as
we
eighteen
men
with
our
thirty-six
arms
*punct* ,
and
one
hundred
and
eighty
thumbs
and
fingers
*punct* ,
slowly
toiled
hour
after
hour
upon
that
inert
*punct* ,
sluggish
corpse
in
the
sea
*punct* ;
and
it
seemed
hardly
to
budge
at
all
*punct* ,
except
at
long
intervals
*punct* ;
good
evidence
was
hereby
furnished
of
the
enormousness
of
the
mass
we
moved
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
upon
the
great
canal
of
hang-ho
*punct* ,
or
whatever
they
call
it
*punct* ,
in
china
*punct* ,
four
or
five
laborers
on
the
foot-path
will
draw
a
bulky
freighted
junk
at
the
rate
of
a
mile
an
hour
*punct* ;
but
this
grand
argosy
we
towed
heavily
forged
along
*punct* ,
as
if
laden
with
pig-lead
in
bulk
*punct* .
*break*
vacantly
eyeing
the
heaving
whale
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
he
issued
the
usual
orders
for
securing
it
for
the
night
*punct* ,
and
then
handing
his
lantern
to
a
seaman
*punct* ,
went
his
way
into
the
cabin
*punct* ,
and
did
not
come
forward
again
until
morning
*punct* .
*break*
though
*punct* ,
in
overseeing
the
pursuit
of
this
whale
*punct* ,
captain
ahab
had
evinced
his
customary
activity
*punct* ,
to
call
it
so
*punct* ;
yet
now
that
the
creature
was
dead
*punct* ,
some
vague
dissatisfaction
*punct* ,
or
impatience
*punct* ,
or
despair
*punct* ,
seemed
working
in
him
*punct* ;
as
if
the
sight
of
that
dead
body
reminded
him
that
moby
dick
was
yet
to
be
slain
*punct* ;
and
though
a
thousand
other
whales
were
brought
to
his
ship
*punct* ,
all
that
would
not
one
jot
advance
his
grand
*punct* ,
monomaniac
object
*punct* .
*break*
very
soon
you
would
have
thought
from
the
sound
on
the
pequod's
decks
*punct* ,
that
all
hands
were
preparing
to
cast
anchor
in
the
deep
*punct* ;
for
heavy
chains
are
being
dragged
along
the
deck
*punct* ,
and
thrust
rattling
out
of
the
port-holes
*punct* .
*break*
but
by
those
clanking
links
*punct* ,
the
vast
corpse
itself
*punct* ,
not
the
ship
*punct* ,
is
to
be
moored
*punct* .
*break*
tied
by
the
head
to
the
stern
*punct* ,
and
by
the
tail
to
the
bows
*punct* ,
the
whale
now
lies
with
its
black
hull
close
to
the
vessel's
*punct* ,
and
seen
through
the
darkness
of
the
night
*punct* ,
which
obscured
the
spars
and
rigging
aloft
*punct* ,
the
two
*punct* ,
ship
and
whale
*punct* ,
seemed
yoked
together
like
colossal
bullocks
*punct* ,
whereof
one
reclines
while
the
other
remains
standing
*punct* .
*break*
if
moody
ahab
was
now
all
quiescence
*punct* ,
at
least
so
far
as
could
be
known
on
deck
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ,
his
second
mate
*punct* ,
flushed
with
conquest
*punct* ,
betrayed
an
unusual
but
still
good-natured
excitement
*punct* .
*break*
one
small
*punct* ,
helping
cause
of
all
this
liveliness
in
stubb
*punct* ,
was
soon
made
strangely
manifest
*punct* .
*break*
stubb
was
a
high
liver
*punct* ;
he
was
somewhat
intemperately
fond
of
the
whale
as
a
flavorish
thing
to
his
palate
*punct* .
*break*
a
steak
*punct* ,
a
steak
*punct* ,
ere
i
sleep
*punct* !
*break*
you
*punct* ,
daggoo
*punct* !
*break*
overboard
you
go
*punct* ,
and
cut
me
one
from
his
small
*punct* !
*break*
here
be
it
known
*punct* ,
that
though
these
wild
fishermen
do
not
*punct* ,
as
a
general
thing
*punct* ,
and
according
to
the
great
military
maxim
*punct* ,
make
the
enemy
defray
the
current
expenses
of
the
war
*punct* ,
at
least
before
realizing
the
proceeds
of
the
voyage
*punct* ,
yet
now
and
then
you
find
some
of
these
nantucketers
who
have
a
genuine
relish
for
that
particular
part
of
the
sperm
whale
designated
by
stubb
*punct* ;
comprising
the
tapering
extremity
of
the
body
*punct* .
*break*
about
midnight
that
steak
was
cut
and
cooked
*punct* ;
and
lighted
by
two
lanterns
of
sperm
oil
*punct* ,
stubb
stoutly
stood
up
to
his
spermaceti
supper
at
the
capstan-head
*punct* ,
as
if
that
capstan
were
a
sideboard
*punct* .
*break*
nor
was
stubb
the
only
banqueter
on
whale's
flesh
that
night
*punct* .
*break*
mingling
their
mumblings
with
his
own
mastications
*punct* ,
thousands
on
thousands
of
sharks
*punct* ,
swarming
round
the
dead
leviathan
*punct* ,
smackingly
feasted
on
its
fatness
*punct* .
*break*
the
few
sleepers
below
in
their
bunks
were
often
startled
by
the
sharp
slapping
of
their
tails
against
the
hull
*punct* ,
within
a
few
inches
of
the
sleepers
hearts
*punct* .
*break*
peering
over
the
side
you
could
just
see
them
*punct* ,
as
before
you
heard
them
*punct* ,
wallowing
in
the
sullen
*punct* ,
black
waters
*punct* ,
and
turning
over
on
their
backs
as
they
scooped
out
huge
globular
pieces
of
the
whale
of
the
bigness
of
a
human
head
*punct* .
*break*
this
particular
feat
of
the
shark
seems
all
but
miraculous
*punct* .
*break*
how
*punct* ,
at
such
an
apparently
unassailable
surface
*punct* ,
they
contrive
to
gouge
out
such
symmetrical
mouthfuls
*punct* ,
remains
a
part
of
the
universal
problem
of
all
things
*punct* .
*break*
the
mark
they
thus
leave
on
the
whale
*punct* ,
may
best
be
likened
to
the
hollow
made
by
a
carpenter
in
countersinking
for
a
screw
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
have
never
seen
that
sight
*punct* ,
then
suspend
your
decision
about
the
propriety
of
devil-worship
*punct* ,
and
the
expediency
of
conciliating
the
devil
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
yet
*punct* ,
stubb
heeded
not
the
mumblings
of
the
banquet
that
was
going
on
so
nigh
him
*punct* ,
no
more
than
the
sharks
heeded
the
smacking
of
his
own
epicurean
lips
*punct* .
*break*
cook
*punct* ,
cook!
*punct* ,
where's
that
old
fleece
*punct* ?
*break*
he
cried
at
length
*punct* ,
widening
his
legs
still
further
*punct* ,
as
if
to
form
a
more
secure
base
for
his
supper
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
at
the
same
time
darting
his
fork
into
the
dish
*punct* ,
as
if
stabbing
with
his
lance
*punct* ;
cook
*punct* ,
you
cook!
*punct* ,
sail
this
way
*punct* ,
cook
*punct* !
*break*
cook
*punct* ,
said
stubb
*punct* ,
rapidly
lifting
a
rather
reddish
morsel
to
his
mouth
*punct* ,
don't
you
think
this
steak
is
rather
overdone
*punct* ?
*break*
you've
been
beating
this
steak
too
much
*punct* ,
cook
*punct* ;
it's
too
tender
*punct* .
*break*
don't
i
always
say
that
to
be
good
*punct* ,
a
whale-steak
must
be
tough
*punct* ?
*break*
there
are
those
sharks
now
over
the
side
*punct* ,
don't
you
see
they
prefer
it
tough
and
rare
*punct* ?
*break*
what
a
shindy
they
are
kicking
up
*punct* !
*break*
cook
*punct* ,

they
are
welcome
to

themselves
civilly

and
in

*punct* ,
but
they
must
keep
quiet

*break*

*break*
sullenly
taking
the
offered
lantern
*punct* ,
old
fleece
limped
across
the
deck
to
the
bulwarks
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
with
one
hand
dropping
his
light
low
over
the
sea
*punct* ,
so
as
to
get
a
good
view
of
his
congregation
*punct* ,
with
the
other
hand
he
solemnly
flourished
his
tongs
*punct* ,
and
leaning
far
over
the
side
in
a
mumbling
voice
began
addressing
the
sharks
*punct* ,
while
stubb
*punct* ,
softly
crawling
behind
*punct* ,
overheard
all
that
was
said
*punct* .

rapidly
bolting
another
mouthful
at

last
word

passed

the
negro
slowly

changing
his

he
hisself

perhaps
you

no

*break*
the
strongest
and
most
reliable
hold
which
the
ship
has
upon
the
whale
when
moored
alongside
*punct* ,
is
by
the
flukes
or
tail
*punct* ;
and
as
from
its
greater
density
that
part
is
relatively
heavier
than
any
other
*punct* ,
excepting
the
side-fins
*punct* ,
its
flexibility
even
in
death
*punct* ,
causes
it
to
sink
low
beneath
the
surface
*punct* ;
so
that
with
the
hand
you
cannot
get
at
it
from
the
boat
*punct* ,
in
order
to
put
the
chain
round
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
difficulty
is
ingeniously
overcome
*punct* :
a
small
*punct* ,
strong
line
is
prepared
with
a
wooden
float
at
its
outer
end
*punct* ,
and
a
weight
in
its
middle
*punct* ,
while
the
other
end
is
secured
to
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
upon
record
*punct* ,
that
three
centuries
ago
the
tongue
of
the
right
whale
was
esteemed
a
great
delicacy
in
france
*punct* ,
and
commanded
large
prices
there
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
that
in
henry
viiith's
time
*punct* ,
a
certain
cook
of
the
court
obtained
a
handsome
reward
for
inventing
an
admirable
sauce
to
be
eaten
with
barbacued
porpoises
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
you
remember
*punct* ,
are
a
species
of
whale
*punct* .
*break*
porpoises
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
are
to
this
day
considered
fine
eating
*punct* .
*break*
the
meat
is
made
into
balls
about
the
size
of
billiard
balls
*punct* ,
and
being
well
seasoned
and
spiced
might
be
taken
for
turtle-balls
or
veal
balls
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
monks
of
dunfermline
were
very
fond
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
a
great
porpoise
grant
from
the
crown
*punct* .
*break*
the
fact
is
*punct* ,
that
among
his
hunters
at
least
*punct* ,
the
whale
would
by
all
hands
be
considered
a
noble
dish
*punct* ,
were
there
not
so
much
of
him
*punct* ;
but
when
you
come
to
sit
down
before
a
meat-pie
nearly
one
hundred
feet
long
*punct* ,
it
takes
away
your
appetite
*punct* .
*break*
we
all
know
how
they
live
upon
whales
*punct* ,
and
have
rare
old
vintages
of
prime
old
train
oil
*punct* .
*break*
zogranda
*punct* ,
one
of
their
most
famous
doctors
*punct* ,
recommends
strips
of
blubber
for
infants
*punct* ,
as
being
exceedingly
juicy
and
nourishing
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
reminds
me
that
certain
englishmen
*punct* ,
who
long
ago
were
accidentally
left
in
greenland
by
a
whaling
vessel
*punct* ,
that
these
men
actually
lived
for
several
months
on
the
mouldy
scraps
of
whales
which
had
been
left
ashore
after
trying
out
the
blubber
*punct* .
*break*
among
the
dutch
whalemen
these
scraps
are
called
fritters
*punct* ;
which
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
they
greatly
resemble
*punct* ,
being
brown
and
crisp
*punct* ,
and
smelling
something
like
old
amsterdam
housewives
dough-nuts
or
oly-cooks
*punct* ,
when
fresh
*punct* .
*break*
they
have
such
an
eatable
look
that
the
most
self-denying
stranger
can
hardly
keep
his
hands
off
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
further
depreciates
the
whale
as
a
civilized
dish
*punct* ,
is
his
exceeding
richness
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
the
great
prize
ox
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
too
fat
to
be
delicately
good
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
his
hump
*punct* ,
which
would
be
as
fine
eating
as
the
buffalo's
*punct* ,
which
is
esteemed
a
rare
dish
*punct* ,
were
it
not
such
a
solid
pyramid
of
fat
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
spermaceti
itself
*punct* ,
how
bland
and
creamy
that
is
*punct* ;
like
the
transparent
*punct* ,
half-jellied
*punct* ,
white
meat
of
a
cocoanut
in
the
third
month
of
its
growth
*punct* ,
yet
far
too
rich
to
supply
a
substitute
for
butter
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
many
whalemen
have
a
method
of
absorbing
it
into
some
other
substance
*punct* ,
and
then
partaking
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
long
try
watches
of
the
night
it
is
a
common
thing
for
the
seamen
to
dip
their
ship-biscuit
into
the
huge
oil-pots
and
let
them
fry
there
awhile
*punct* .
*break*
many
a
good
supper
have
i
thus
made
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
case
of
a
small
sperm
whale
the
brains
are
accounted
a
fine
dish
*punct* .
*break*
the
casket
of
the
skull
is
broken
into
with
an
axe
*punct* ,
and
the
two
plump
*punct* ,
whitish
lobes
being
withdrawn
*punct* ,
precisely
resembling
two
large
puddings
*punct* ,
they
are
then
mixed
with
flour
*punct* ,
and
cooked
into
a
most
delectable
mess
*punct* ,
in
flavor
somewhat
resembling
calves
head
*punct* ,
which
is
quite
a
dish
among
some
epicures
*punct* ;
and
every
one
knows
that
some
young
bucks
among
the
epicures
*punct* ,
by
continually
dining
upon
calves
brains
*punct* ,
by
and
by
get
to
have
a
little
brains
of
their
own
*punct* ,
so
as
to
be
able
to
tell
a
calf's
head
from
their
own
heads
*punct* ;
which
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
requires
uncommon
discrimination
*punct* .
*break*
the
head
looks
a
sort
of
reproachfully
at
him
*punct* ,
with
an
et
tu
brute
*punct* !
*break*
it
is
not
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
entirely
because
the
whale
is
so
excessively
unctuous
that
landsmen
seem
to
regard
the
eating
of
him
with
abhorrence
*punct* ;
that
appears
to
result
*punct* ,
in
some
way
*punct* ,
from
the
consideration
before
mentioned
*punct* :
i
*punct* .
*break*
that
a
man
should
eat
a
newly
murdered
thing
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
and
eat
it
too
by
its
own
light
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
doubt
the
first
man
that
ever
murdered
an
ox
was
regarded
as
a
murderer
*punct* ;
perhaps
he
was
hung
*punct* ;
and
if
he
had
been
put
on
his
trial
by
oxen
*punct* ,
he
certainly
would
have
been
*punct* ;
and
he
certainly
deserved
it
if
any
murderer
does
*punct* .
*break*
go
to
the
meat-market
of
a
saturday
night
and
see
the
crowds
of
live
bipeds
staring
up
at
the
long
rows
of
dead
quadrupeds
*punct* .
*break*
does
not
that
sight
take
a
tooth
out
of
the
cannibal's
jaw
*punct* ?
*break*
who
is
not
a
cannibal
*punct* ?
*break*
i
tell
you
it
will
be
more
tolerable
for
the
fejee
that
salted
down
a
lean
missionary
in
his
cellar
against
a
coming
famine
*punct* ;
it
will
be
more
tolerable
for
that
provident
fejee
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
in
the
day
of
judgment
*punct* ,
than
for
thee
*punct* ,
civilized
and
enlightened
gourmand
*punct* ,
who
nailest
geese
to
the
ground
and
feastest
on
their
bloated
livers
in
thy
pate-de-foie-gras
*punct* .
*break*
but
stubb
*punct* ,
he
eats
the
whale
by
its
own
light
*punct* ,
does
he
*punct* ?
*break*
and
that
is
adding
insult
to
injury
*punct* ,
is
it
*punct* ?
*break*
look
at
your
knife-handle
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ,
my
civilized
and
enlightened
gourmand
dining
off
that
roast
beef
*punct* ,
what
is
that
handle
made
of?
*punct* ,
what
but
the
bones
of
the
brother
of
the
very
ox
you
are
eating
*punct* ?
*break*
and
what
do
you
pick
your
teeth
with
*punct* ,
after
devouring
that
fat
goose
*punct* ?
*break*
with
a
feather
of
the
same
fowl
*punct* .
*break*
and
with
what
quill
did
the
secretary
of
the
society
for
the
suppression
of
cruelty
to
ganders
formally
indite
his
circulars
*punct* ?
*break*
for
that
business
is
an
exceedingly
laborious
one
*punct* ;
is
not
very
soon
completed
*punct* ;
and
requires
all
hands
to
set
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
*punct* ,
the
common
usage
is
to
take
in
all
sail
*punct* ;
lash
the
helm
a'lee
*punct* ;
and
then
send
every
one
below
to
his
hammock
till
daylight
*punct* ,
with
the
reservation
that
*punct* ,
until
that
time
*punct* ,
anchor-watches
shall
be
kept
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
two
and
two
for
an
hour
*punct* ,
each
couple
*punct* ,
the
crew
in
rotation
shall
mount
the
deck
to
see
that
all
goes
well
*punct* .
*break*
but
sometimes
*punct* ,
especially
upon
the
line
in
the
pacific
*punct* ,
this
plan
will
not
answer
at
all
*punct* ;
because
such
incalculable
hosts
of
sharks
gather
round
the
moored
carcase
*punct* ,
that
were
he
left
so
for
six
hours
*punct* ,
say
*punct* ,
on
a
stretch
*punct* ,
little
more
than
the
skeleton
would
be
visible
by
morning
*punct* .
*break*
in
most
other
parts
of
the
ocean
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
where
these
fish
do
not
so
largely
abound
*punct* ,
their
wondrous
voracity
can
be
at
times
considerably
diminished
*punct* ,
by
vigorously
stirring
them
up
with
sharp
whaling-spades
*punct* ,
a
procedure
notwithstanding
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
in
some
instances
*punct* ,
only
seems
to
tickle
them
into
still
greater
activity
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
was
not
thus
in
the
present
case
with
the
pequod's
sharks
*punct* ;
though
*punct* ,
to
be
sure
*punct* ,
any
man
unaccustomed
to
such
sights
*punct* ,
to
have
looked
over
her
side
that
night
*punct* ,
would
have
almost
thought
the
whole
round
sea
was
one
huge
cheese
*punct* ,
and
those
sharks
the
maggots
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
the
foamy
confusion
of
their
mixed
and
struggling
hosts
*punct* ,
the
marksmen
could
not
always
hit
their
mark
*punct* ;
and
this
brought
about
new
revelations
of
the
incredible
ferocity
of
the
foe
*punct* .
*break*
they
viciously
snapped
*punct* ,
not
only
at
each
other's
disembowelments
*punct* ,
but
like
flexible
bows
*punct* ,
bent
round
*punct* ,
and
bit
their
own
*punct* ;
till
those
entrails
seemed
swallowed
over
and
over
again
by
the
same
mouth
*punct* ,
to
be
oppositely
voided
by
the
gaping
wound
*punct* .
*break*
nor
was
this
all
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
unsafe
to
meddle
with
the
corpses
and
ghosts
of
these
creatures
*punct* .
*break*
a
sort
of
generic
or
pantheistic
vitality
seemed
to
lurk
in
their
very
joints
and
bones
*punct* ,
after
what
might
be
called
the
individual
life
had
departed
*punct* .
*break*
killed
and
hoisted
on
deck
for
the
sake
of
his
skin
*punct* ,
one
of
these
sharks
almost
took
poor
queequeg's
hand
off
*punct* ,
when
he
tried
to
shut
down
the
dead
lid
of
his
murderous
jaw
*punct* .
*break*
this
weapon
is
always
kept
as
sharp
as
possible
*punct* ;
and
when
being
used
is
occasionally
honed
*punct* ,
just
like
a
razor

in

first
place
*punct* ,
the
enormous
cutting
tackles
*punct* ,
among
other
ponderous
things
comprising
a
cluster
of
blocks
generally
painted
green
*punct* ,
and
which
no
single
man
can
possibly
lift
*punct* ,
this
vast
bunch
of
grapes
was
swayed
up
to
the
main-top
and
firmly
lashed
to
the
lower
mast-head
*punct* ,
the
strongest

anywhere
above
a
ship's
deck
*punct* .
*break*
the
end
of
the
hawser-like
rope
winding
through
these
intricacies
*punct* ,
was
then
conducted
to
the
windlass
*punct* ,
and
the
huge
lower
block
of
the
tackles
was
swung
over
the
whale
*punct* ;
to
this
block
the
great
blubber
hook
*punct* ,
weighing
some
one
hundred
pounds

was
attached

the
side
*punct* ,
starbuck

*punct* ,
the
mates
*punct* ,
armed
with
their

*punct* ,
began
cutting
a

for
the
insertion

the
hook
just

at

windlass

*break*
when
instantly
*punct* ,
the
entire
ship
careens
over
on
her
side
*punct* ;
every
bolt
in
her
starts
like
the
nail-heads

old

weather
*punct* ;

trembles

quivers

her
frighted

more

leans
over

gasping
heave

windlass
is
answered
by
a
helping
heave
from

billows

startling
snap
is
heard

rolls
upwards

now
advances
with
a
long
*punct* ,
keen
weapon
called
a
boarding-sword
*punct* ,
and
watching
his
chance
he
dexterously
slices
out
a
considerable
hole
in
the
lower
part
of
the
swaying
mass
*punct* .
*break*
into
this
hole
*punct* ,
the
end
of
the
second
alternating
great
tackle
is
then
hooked
so
as
to
retain
a
hold
upon
the
blubber
*punct* ,
in
order
to
prepare
for
what
follows
*punct* .
*break*
whereupon
*punct* ,
this
accomplished
swordsman
*punct* ,
warning
all
hands
to
stand
off
*punct* ,
once
more
makes
a
scientific
dash
at
the
mass
*punct* ,
and
with
a
few
sidelong
*punct* ,
desperate
*punct* ,
lunging
slicings
*punct* ,
severs
it
completely
in
twain
*punct* ;
so
that
while
the
short
lower
part
is
still
fast
*punct* ,
the
long
upper
strip
*punct* ,
called
a
blanket-piece
*punct* ,
swings
clear
*punct* ,
and
is
all
ready
for
lowering
*punct* .
*break*
the
heavers
forward
now
resume
their
song
*punct* ,
and
while
the
one
tackle
is
peeling
and
hoisting
a
second
strip
from
the
whale
*punct* ,
the
other
is
slowly
slackened
away
*punct* ,
and
down
goes
the
first
strip
through
the
main
hatchway
right
beneath
*punct* ,
into
an
unfurnished
parlor
called
the
blubber-room
*punct* .
*break*
into
this
twilight
apartment
sundry
nimble
hands
keep
coiling
away
the
long
blanket-piece
as
if
it
were
a
great
live
mass
of
plaited
serpents
*punct* .
*break*
the
question
is
*punct* ,
what
and
where
is
the
skin
of
the
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
already
you
know
what
his
blubber
is
*punct* .
*break*
that
blubber
is
something
of
the
consistence
of
firm
*punct* ,
close-grained
beef
*punct* ,
but
tougher
*punct* ,
more
elastic
and
compact
*punct* ,
and
ranges
from
eight
or
ten
to
twelve
and
fifteen
inches
in
thickness
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
however
preposterous
it
may
at
first
seem
to
talk
of
any
creature's
skin
as
being
of
that
sort
of
consistence
and
thickness
*punct* ,
yet
in
point
of
fact
these
are
no
arguments
against
such
a
presumption
*punct* ;
because
you
cannot
raise
any
other
dense
enveloping
layer
from
the
whale's
body
but
that
same
blubber
*punct* ;
and
the
outermost
enveloping
layer
of
any
animal
*punct* ,
if
reasonably
dense
*punct* ,
what
can
that
be
but
the
skin
*punct* ?
*break*
true
*punct* ,
from
the
unmarred
dead
body
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
you
may
scrape
off
with
your
hand
an
infinitely
thin
*punct* ,
transparent
substance
*punct* ,
somewhat
resembling
the
thinnest
shreds
of
isinglass
*punct* ,
only
it
is
almost
as
flexible
and
soft
as
satin
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
previous
to
being
dried
*punct* ,
when
it
not
only
contracts
and
thickens
*punct* ,
but
becomes
rather
hard
and
brittle
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
several
such
dried
bits
*punct* ,
which
i
use
for
marks
in
my
whale-books
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
transparent
*punct* ,
as
i
said
before
*punct* ;
and
being
laid
upon
the
printed
page
*punct* ,
i
have
sometimes
pleased
myself
with
fancying
it
exerted
a
magnifying
influence
*punct* .
*break*
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
it
is
pleasant
to
read
about
whales
through
their
own
spectacles
*punct* ,
as
you
may
say
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
i
am
driving
at
here
is
this
*punct* .
*break*
that
same
infinitely
thin
*punct* ,
isinglass
substance
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
i
admit
*punct* ,
invests
the
entire
body
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
is
not
so
much
to
be
regarded
as
the
skin
of
the
creature
*punct* ,
as
the
skin
of
the
skin
*punct* ,
so
to
speak
*punct* ;
for
it
were
simply
ridiculous
to
say
*punct* ,
that
the
proper
skin
of
the
tremendous
whale
is
thinner
and
more
tender
than
the
skin
of
a
new-born
child
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
more
of
this
*punct* .
*break*
reckoning
ten
barrels
to
the
ton
*punct* ,
you
have
ten
tons
for
the
net
weight
of
only
three
quarters
of
the
stuff
of
the
whale's
skin
*punct* .
*break*
in
life
*punct* ,
the
visible
surface
of
the
sperm
whale
is
not
the
least
among
the
many
marvels
he
presents
*punct* .
*break*
almost
invariably
it
is
all
over
obliquely
crossed
and
re-crossed
with
numberless
straight
marks
in
thick
array
*punct* ,
something
like
those
in
the
finest
italian
line
engravings
*punct* .
*break*
but
these
marks
do
not
seem
to
be
impressed
upon
the
isinglass
substance
above
mentioned
*punct* ,
but
seem
to
be
seen
through
it
*punct* ,
as
if
they
were
engraved
upon
the
body
itself
*punct* .
*break*
nor
is
this
all
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
instances
*punct* ,
to
the
quick
*punct* ,
observant
eye
*punct* ,
those
linear
marks
*punct* ,
as
in
a
veritable
engraving
*punct* ,
but
afford
the
ground
for
far
other
delineations
*punct* .
*break*
these
are
hieroglyphical
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
if
you
call
those
mysterious
cyphers
on
the
walls
of
pyramids
hieroglyphics
*punct* ,
then
that
is
the
proper
word
to
use
in
the
present
connexion
*punct* .
*break*
by
my
retentive
memory
of
the
hieroglyphics
upon
one
sperm
whale
in
particular
*punct* ,
i
was
much
struck
with
a
plate
representing
the
old
indian
characters
chiselled
on
the
famous
hieroglyphic
palisades
on
the
banks
of
the
upper
mississippi
*punct* .
*break*
like
those
mystic
rocks
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
the
mystic-marked
whale
remains
undecipherable
*punct* .
*break*
this
allusion
to
the
indian
rocks
reminds
me
of
another
thing
*punct* .
*break*
besides
all
the
other
phenomena
which
the
exterior
of
the
sperm
whale
presents
*punct* ,
he
not
seldom
displays
the
back
*punct* ,
and
more
especially
his
flanks
*punct* ,
effaced
in
great
part
of
the
regular
linear
appearance
*punct* ,
by
reason
of
numerous
rude
scratches
*punct* ,
altogether
of
an
irregular
*punct* ,
random
aspect
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
say
that
those
new
england
rocks
on
the
sea-coast
*punct* ,
which
agassiz
imagines
to
bear
the
marks
of
violent
scraping
contact
with
vast
floating
icebergs
*punct* ,
i
should
say
*punct* ,
that
those
rocks
must
not
a
little
resemble
the
sperm
whale
in
this
particular
*punct* .
*break*
it
also
seems
to
me
that
such
scratches
in
the
whale
are
probably
made
by
hostile
contact
with
other
whales
*punct* ;
for
i
have
most
remarked
them
in
the
large
*punct* ,
full-grown
bulls
of
the
species
*punct* .
*break*
a
word
or
two
more
concerning
this
matter
of
the
skin
or
blubber
of
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
already
been
said
*punct* ,
that
it
is
stript
from
him
in
long
pieces
*punct* ,
called
blanket-pieces
*punct* .
*break*
like
most
sea-terms
*punct* ,
this
one
is
very
happy
and
significant
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
by
reason
of
this
cosy
blanketing
of
his
body
*punct* ,
that
the
whale
is
enabled
to
keep
himself
comfortable
in
all
weathers
*punct* ,
in
all
seas
*punct* ,
times
*punct* ,
and
tides
*punct* .
*break*
what
would
become
of
a
greenland
whale
*punct* ,
say
*punct* ,
in
those
shuddering
*punct* ,
icy
seas
of
the
north
*punct* ,
if
unsupplied
with
his
cosy
surtout
*punct* ?
*break*
true
*punct* ,
other
fish
are
found
exceedingly
brisk
in
those
hyperborean
waters
*punct* ;
but
these
*punct* ,
be
it
observed
*punct* ,
are
your
cold-blooded
*punct* ,
lungless
fish
*punct* ,
whose
very
bellies
are
refrigerators
*punct* ;
creatures
*punct* ,
that
warm
themselves
under
the
lee
of
an
iceberg
*punct* ,
as
a
traveller
in
winter
would
bask
before
an
inn
fire
*punct* ;
whereas
*punct* ,
like
man
*punct* ,
the
whale
has
lungs
and
warm
blood
*punct* .
*break*
freeze
his
blood
*punct* ,
and
he
dies
*punct* .
*break*
how
wonderful
is
it
then
*punct* ,
except
after
explanation
*punct* ,
that
this
great
monster
*punct* ,
to
whom
corporeal
warmth
is
as
indispensable
as
it
is
to
man
*punct* ;
how
wonderful
that
he
should
be
found
at
home
*punct* ,
immersed
to
his
lips
for
life
in
those
arctic
waters
*punct* !
*break*
where
*punct* ,
when
seamen
fall
overboard
*punct* ,
they
are
sometimes
found
*punct* ,
months
afterwards
*punct* ,
perpendicularly
frozen
into
the
hearts
of
fields
of
ice
*punct* ,
as
a
fly
is
found
glued
in
amber
*punct* .
*break*
but
more
surprising
is
it
to
know
*punct* ,
as
has
been
proved
by
experiment
*punct* ,
that
the
blood
of
a
polar
whale
is
warmer
than
that
of
a
borneo
negro
in
summer
*punct* .
*break*
it
does
seem
to
me
*punct* ,
that
herein
we
see
the
rare
virtue
of
a
strong
individual
vitality
*punct* ,
and
the
rare
virtue
of
thick
walls
*punct* ,
and
the
rare
virtue
of
interior
spaciousness
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
man
*punct* !
*break*
admire
and
model
thyself
after
the
whale
*punct* !
*break*
do
thou
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
remain
warm
among
ice
*punct* .
*break*
do
thou
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
live
in
this
world
without
being
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
be
cool
at
the
equator
*punct* ;
keep
thy
blood
fluid
at
the
pole
*punct* .
*break*
like
the
great
dome
of
st

*break*
peter's
*punct* ,
and
like
the
great
whale
*punct* ,
retain
*punct* ,
o
man
*punct* !
*break*
in
all
seasons
a
temperature
of
thine
own
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
easy
and
how
hopeless
to
teach
these
fine
things
*punct* !
*break*
of
erections
*punct* ,
how
few
are
domed
like
st
*punct* .
*break*

creatures
*punct* ,
how
few
vast

the
whale
*punct* !
*break*
let
the
carcase
go
astern

*break*
the
vast
tackles
have
now
done
their
duty
*punct* .
*break*
the
peeled
white
body
of
the
beheaded
whale
flashes
like
a
marble
sepulchre
*punct* ;
though
changed
in
hue
*punct* ,
it
has
not
perceptibly
lost
anything
in
bulk
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
still
colossal
*punct* .
*break*
slowly
it
floats
more
and
more
away
*punct* ,
the
water
round
it
torn
and
splashed
by
the
insatiate
sharks
*punct* ,
and
the
air
above
vexed
with
rapacious
flights
of
screaming
fowls
*punct* ,
whose
beaks
are
like
so
many
insulting
poniards
in
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
the
vast
white
headless
phantom
floats
further
and
further
from
the
ship
*punct* ,
and
every
rod
that
it
so
floats
*punct* ,
what
seem
square
roods
of
sharks
and
cubic
roods
of
fowls
*punct* ,
augment
the
murderous
din
*punct* .
*break*
for
hours
and
hours
from
the
almost
stationary
ship
that
hideous
sight
is
seen
*punct* .
*break*
beneath
the
unclouded
and
mild
azure
sky
*punct* ,
upon
the
fair
face
of
the
pleasant
sea
*punct* ,
wafted
by
the
joyous
breezes

that
great
mass
of
death
floats
on

*punct* ,
till
lost
in
infinite
perspectives
*punct* .
*break*
there's
a
most
doleful
and
most
mocking
funeral
*punct* !
*break*
the
sea-vultures
all
in
pious
mourning
*punct* ,
the
air-sharks
all
punctiliously
in
black
or
speckled
*punct* .
*break*
in
life
but
few
of
them
would
have
helped
the
whale
*punct* ,
i
ween
*punct* ,
if
peradventure
he
had
needed
it
*punct* ;
but
upon
the
banquet
of
his
funeral
they
most
piously
do
pounce
*punct* .

oh

horrible
vultureism
of
earth

*break*
from
which
not
the
mightiest
whale
is
free

*break*
nor
is
this
the
end
*punct* .
*break*
desecrated
as
the
body
is
*punct* ,
a
vengeful
ghost
survives
and
hovers
over
it
to
scare
*punct* .
*break*
espied
by
some
timid
man-of-war
or
blundering
discovery-vessel
from
afar
*punct* ,
when
the
distance
obscuring
the
swarming
fowls
*punct* ,
nevertheless
still
shows
the
white
mass
floating
in
the
sun
*punct* ,
and
the
white
spray
heaving
high
against
it
*punct* ;
straightway
the
whale's
unharming
corpse
*punct* ,
with
trembling
fingers
is
set
down
in
the
log
*punct* ,
shoals
*punct* ,
rocks

breakers
hereabouts
*punct* :
beware
*punct* !
*break*
there's
your
law
of
precedents
*punct* ;
there's
your
utility
of
traditions
*punct* ;
there's
the
story
of
your
obstinate
survival
of
old
beliefs
never
bottomed
on
the
earth
*punct* ,
and
now
not
even
hovering
in
the
air
*punct* !
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
while
in
life
the
great
whale's
body
may
have
been
a
real
terror
to
his
foes
*punct* ,
in
his
death
his
ghost
becomes
a
powerless
panic
to
a
world
*punct* .
*break*
are
you
a
believer
in
ghosts
*punct* ,
my
friend
*punct* ?
*break*
now
*punct* ,
the
beheading
of
the
sperm
whale
is
a
scientific
anatomical
feat
*punct* ,
upon
which
experienced
whale
surgeons
very
much
pride
themselves
*punct* ;
and
not
without
reason
*punct* .
*break*
consider
that
the
whale
has
nothing
that
can
properly
be
called
a
neck
*punct* ;
on
the
contrary
*punct* ,
where
his
head
and
body
seem
to
join
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ,
in
that
very
place
*punct* ,
is
the
thickest
part
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
remember
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
that
the
surgeon
must
operate
from
above
*punct* ,
some
eight
or
ten
feet
intervening
between
him
and
his
subject
*punct* ,
and
that
subject
almost
hidden
in
a
discolored
*punct* ,
rolling
*punct* ,
and
oftentimes
tumultuous
and
bursting
sea
*punct* .
*break*
bear
in
mind
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
that
under
these
untoward
circumstances
he
has
to
cut
many
feet
deep
in
the
flesh
*punct* ;
and
in
that
subterraneous
manner
*punct* ,
without
so
much
as
getting
one
single
peep
into
the
ever-contracting
gash
thus
made
*punct* ,
he
must
skilfully
steer
clear
of
all
adjacent
*punct* ,
interdicted
parts
*punct* ,
and
exactly
divide
the
spine
at
a
critical
point
hard
by
its
insertion
into
the
skull
*punct* .
*break*
when
first
severed
*punct* ,
the
head
is
dropped
astern
and
held
there
by
a
cable
till
the
body
is
stripped
*punct* .
*break*
that
done
*punct* ,
if
it
belong
to
a
small
whale
it
is
hoisted
on
deck
to
be
deliberately
disposed
of
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
with
a
full
grown
leviathan
this
is
impossible
*punct* ;
for
the
sperm
whale's
head
embraces
nearly
one
third
of
his
entire
bulk
*punct* ,
and
completely
to
suspend
such
a
burden
as
that
*punct* ,
even
by
the
immense
tackles
of
a
whaler
*punct* ,
this
were
as
vain
a
thing
as
to
attempt
weighing
a
dutch
barn
in
jewellers
scales
the
pequod's
whale
being
decapitated
and
the
body
stripped
*punct* ,
the
head
was
hoisted
against
the
ship's
side
*punct* ,
about
half
way
out
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
so
that
it
might
yet
in
great
part
be
buoyed
up
by
its
native
element
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
with
the
strained
craft
steeply
leaning
over
to
it
*punct* ,
by
reason
of
the
enormous
downward
drag
from
the
lower
mast-head
*punct* ,
and
every
yard-arm
on
that
side
projecting
like
a
crane
over
the
waves
*punct* ;
there
*punct* ,
that
blood-dripping
head
hung
to
the
pequod's
waist
like
the
giant
holofernes's
from
the
girdle
of
judith
*punct* .
*break*
when
this
last
task
was
accomplished
it
was
noon
*punct* ,
and
the
seamen
went
below
to
their
dinner
*punct* .
*break*
silence
reigned
over
the
before
tumultuous
but
now
deserted
deck
*punct* .
*break*
an
intense
copper
calm
*punct* ,
like
a
universal
yellow
lotus
*punct* ,
was
more
and
more
unfolding
its
noiseless
measureless
leaves
upon
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
a
short
space
elapsed
*punct* ,
and
up
into
this
noiselessness
came
ahab
alone
from
his
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
taking
a
few
turns
on
the
quarter-deck
*punct* ,
he
paused
to
gaze
over
the
side
*punct* ,
then
slowly
getting
into
the
main-chains
he
took
stubb's
long
spade
*punct* ,
still
remaining
there
after
the
whale's
decapitation
*punct* ,
and
striking
it
into
the
lower
part
of
the
half-suspended
mass
*punct* ,
placed
its
other
end
crutch-wise
under
one
arm
*punct* ,
and
so
stood
leaning
over
with
eyes
attentively
fixed
on
this
head
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
black
and
hooded
head
*punct* ;
and
hanging
there
in
the
midst
of
so
intense
a
calm
*punct* ,
it
seemed
the
sphynx's
in
the
desert
*punct* .
*break*
speak
*punct* ,
thou
vast
and
venerable
head
*punct* ,
muttered
ahab
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
though
ungarnished
with
a
beard
*punct* ,
yet
here
and
there
lookest
hoary
with
mosses
*punct* ;
speak
*punct* ,
mighty
head
*punct* ,
and
tell
us
the
secret
thing
that
is
in
thee
*punct* .
*break*
where
unrecorded
names
and
navies
rust
*punct* ,
and
untold
hopes
and
anchors
rot
*punct* ;
where
in
her
murderous
hold
this
frigate
earth
is
ballasted
with
bones
of
millions
of
the
drowned
*punct* ;
there
*punct* ,
in
that
awful
water-land
*punct* ,
there
was
thy
most
familiar
home
*punct* .
*break*
thou
hast
been
where
bell
or
diver
never
went
*punct* ;
hast
slept
by
many
a
sailor's
side
*punct* ,
where
sleepless
mothers
would
give
their
lives
to
lay
them
down
*punct* .
*break*
thou
saw'st
the
locked
lovers
when
leaping
from
their
flaming
ship
*punct* ;
heart
to
heart
they
sank
beneath
the
exulting
wave
*punct* ;
true
to
each
other
*punct* ,
when
heaven
seemed
false
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
thou
saw'st
the
murdered
mate
when
tossed
by
pirates
from
the
midnight
deck
*punct* ;
for
hours
he
fell
into
the
deeper
midnight
of
the
insatiate
maw
*punct* ;
and
his
murderers
still
sailed
on
unharmed
*punct* ,
while
swift
lightnings
shivered
the
neighboring
ship
that
would
have
borne
a
righteous
husband
to
outstretched
*punct* ,
longing
arms
*punct* .
*break*
thou
hast
seen
enough
to
split
the
planets
and
make
an
infidel
of
abraham
*punct* ,
and
not
one
syllable
is
thine
*punct* !
*break*
cried
a
triumphant
voice
from
the
main-masthead
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
that's
cheering
*punct* ,
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
suddenly
erecting
himself
*punct* ,
while
whole
thunder-clouds
swept
aside
from
his
brow
*punct* .
*break*
that
lively
cry
upon
this
deadly
calm
might
almost
convert
a
better
man.
*punct* ,
where
away
*punct* ?
*break*
three
points
on
the
starboard
bow
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
and
bringing
down
her
breeze
to
us
*punct* !
*break*
better
and
better
*punct* ,
man
*punct* .
*break*
would
now
st
*punct* .
*break*
paul
would
come
along
that
way
*punct* ,
and
to
my
breezelessness
bring
his
breeze
*punct* !
*break*
o
nature
*punct* ,
and
o
soul
of
man
*punct* !
*break*
how
far
beyond
all
utterance
are
your
linked
analogies
*punct* !
*break*
by
and
by
*punct* ,
through
the
glass
the
stranger's
boats
and
manned
mast-heads
proved
her
a
whale-ship
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
she
was
so
far
to
windward
*punct* ,
and
shooting
by
*punct* ,
apparently
making
a
passage
to
some
other
ground
*punct* ,
the
pequod
could
not
hope
to
reach
her
*punct* .
*break*
so
the
signal
was
set
to
see
what
response
would
be
made
*punct* .
*break*
here
be
it
said
*punct* ,
that
like
the
vessels
of
military
marines
*punct* ,
the
ships
of
the
american
whale
fleet
have
each
a
private
signal
*punct* ;
all
which
signals
being
collected
in
a
book
with
the
names
of
the
respective
vessels
attached
*punct* ,
every
captain
is
provided
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
thereby
*punct* ,
the
whale
commanders
are
enabled
to
recognise
each
other
upon
the
ocean
*punct* ,
even
at
considerable
distances
*punct* ,
and
with
no
small
facility
*punct* .
*break*
the
pequod's
signal
was
at
last
responded
to
by
the
stranger's
setting
her
own
*punct* ;
which
proved
the
ship
to
be
the
jeroboam
of
nantucket
*punct* .
*break*
squaring
her
yards
*punct* ,
she
bore
down
*punct* ,
ranged
abeam
under
the
pequod's
lee
*punct* ,
and
lowered
a
boat
*punct* ;
it
soon
drew
nigh
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
the
side-ladder
was
being
rigged
by
starbuck's
order
to
accommodate
the
visiting
captain
*punct* ,
the
stranger
in
question
waved
his
hand
from
his
boat's
stern
in
token
of
that
proceeding
being
entirely
unnecessary
*punct* .
*break*
it
turned
out
that
the
jeroboam
had
a
malignant
epidemic
on
board
*punct* ,
and
that
mayhew
*punct* ,
her
captain
*punct* ,
was
fearful
of
infecting
the
pequod's
company
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
though
himself
and
boat's
crew
remained
untainted
*punct* ,
and
though
his
ship
was
half
a
rifle-shot
off
*punct* ,
and
an
incorruptible
sea
and
air
rolling
and
flowing
between
*punct* ;
yet
conscientiously
adhering
to
the
timid
quarantine
of
the
land
*punct* ,
he
peremptorily
refused
to
come
into
direct
contact
with
the
pequod
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
did
by
no
means
prevent
all
communication
*punct* .
*break*
subject
to
this
*punct* ,
and
other
the
like
interruptions
now
and
then
*punct* ,
a
conversation
was
sustained
between
the
two
parties
*punct* ;
but
at
intervals
not
without
still
another
interruption
of
a
very
different
sort
*punct* .
*break*
pulling
an
oar
in
the
jeroboam's
boat
*punct* ,
was
a
man
of
a
singular
appearance
*punct* ,
even
in
that
wild
whaling
life
where
individual
notabilities
make
up
all
totalities
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
small
*punct* ,
short
*punct* ,
youngish
man
*punct* ,
sprinkled
all
over
his
face
with
freckles
*punct* ,
and
wearing
redundant
yellow
hair
*punct* .
*break*
a
long-skirted
*punct* ,
cabalistically-cut
coat
of
a
faded
walnut
tinge
enveloped
him
*punct* ;
the
overlapping
sleeves
of
which
were
rolled
up
on
his
wrists
*punct* .
*break*
a
deep
*punct* ,
settled
*punct* ,
fanatic
delirium
was
in
his
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
so
soon
as
this
figure
had
been
first
descried
*punct* ,
stubb
had
exclaimed
*punct* ,
that's
he
*punct* !
*break*
the
long-togged
scaramouch
the
town-ho's
company
told
us
of
*punct* !
*break*
stubb
here
alluded
to
a
strange
story
told
of
the
jeroboam
*punct* ,
and
a
certain
man
among
her
crew
*punct* ,
some
time
previous
when
the
pequod
spoke
the
town-ho
*punct* .
*break*
according
to
this
account
and
what
was
subsequently
learned
*punct* ,
it
seemed
that
the
scaramouch
in
question
had
gained
a
wonderful
ascendency
over
almost
everybody
in
the
jeroboam
*punct* .
*break*
his
story
was
this
*punct* :
he
had
been
originally
nurtured
among
the
crazy
society
of
neskyeuna
shakers
*punct* ,
where
he
had
been
a
great
prophet
*punct* ;
in
their
cracked
*punct* ,
secret
meetings
having
several
times
descended
from
heaven
by
the
way
of
a
trap-door
*punct* ,
announcing
the
speedy
opening
of
the
seventh
vial
*punct* ,
which
he
carried
in
his
vest-pocket
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
instead
of
containing
gunpowder
*punct* ,
was
supposed
to
be
charged
with
laudanum
*punct* .
*break*
a
strange
*punct* ,
apostolic
whim
having
seized
him
*punct* ,
he
had
left
neskyeuna
for
nantucket
*punct* ,
where
*punct* ,
with
that
cunning
peculiar
to
craziness
*punct* ,
he
assumed
a
steady
*punct* ,
common
sense
exterior
and
offered
himself
as
a
green-hand
candidate
for
the
jeroboam's
whaling
voyage
*punct* .
*break*
he
announced
himself
as
the
archangel
gabriel
*punct* ,
and
commanded
the
captain
to
jump
overboard
*punct* .
*break*
he
published
his
manifesto
*punct* ,
whereby
he
set
himself
forth
as
the
deliverer
of
the
isles
of
the
sea
and
vicar-general
of
all
oceanica
*punct* .
*break*
the
unflinching
earnestness
with
which
he
declared
these
things;
*punct* ,
the
dark
*punct* ,
daring
play
of
his
sleepless
*punct* ,
excited
imagination
*punct* ,
and
all
the
preternatural
terrors
of
real
delirium
*punct* ,
united
to
invest
this
gabriel
in
the
minds
of
the
majority
of
the
ignorant
crew
*punct* ,
with
an
atmosphere
of
sacredness
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
they
were
afraid
of
him
*punct* .
*break*
as
such
a
man
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
was
not
of
much
practical
use
in
the
ship
*punct* ,
especially
as
he
refused
to
work
except
when
he
pleased
*punct* ,
the
incredulous
captain
would
fain
have
been
rid
of
him
*punct* ;
but
apprised
that
that
individual's
intention
was
to
land
him
in
the
first
convenient
port
*punct* ,
the
archangel
forthwith
opened
all
his
seals
and
vials
*punct* ,
devoting
the
ship
and
all
hands
to
unconditional
perdition
*punct* ,
in
case
this
intention
was
carried
out
*punct* .
*break*
so
strongly
did
he
work
upon
his
disciples
among
the
crew
*punct* ,
that
at
last
in
a
body
they
went
to
the
captain
and
told
him
if
gabriel
was
sent
from
the
ship
*punct* ,
not
a
man
of
them
would
remain
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
therefore
forced
to
relinquish
his
plan
*punct* .
*break*
nor
would
they
permit
gabriel
to
be
any
way
maltreated
*punct* ,
say
or
do
what
he
would
*punct* ;
so
that
it
came
to
pass
that
gabriel
had
the
complete
freedom
of
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
the
consequence
of
all
this
was
*punct* ,
that
the
archangel
cared
little
or
nothing
for
the
captain
and
mates
*punct* ;
and
since
the
epidemic
had
broken
out
*punct* ,
he
carried
a
higher
hand
than
ever
*punct* ;
declaring
that
the
plague
*punct* ,
as
he
called
it
*punct* ,
was
at
his
sole
command
*punct* ;
nor
should
it
be
stayed
but
according
to
his
good
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
the
sailors
*punct* ,
mostly
poor
devils
*punct* ,
cringed
*punct* ,
and
some
of
them
fawned
before
him
*punct* ;
in
obedience
to
his
instructions
*punct* ,
sometimes
rendering
him
personal
homage
*punct* ,
as
to
a
god
*punct* .
*break*
such
things
may
seem
incredible
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
however
wondrous
*punct* ,
they
are
true
*punct* .
*break*
nor
is
the
history
of
fanatics
half
so
striking
in
respect
to
the
measureless
self-deception
of
the
fanatic
himself
*punct* ,
as
his
measureless
power
of
deceiving
and
bedevilling
so
many
others
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
time
to
return
to
the
pequod
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
gabriel
started
to
his
feet
*punct* .
*break*
think
*punct* ,
think
of
the
fevers
*punct* ,
yellow
and
bilious
*punct* !
*break*
beware
of
the
horrible
plague
*punct* !
*break*
gabriel
*punct* ,
gabriel
*punct* !
*break*
cried
captain
mayhew
*punct* ;
thou
must
either
*punct* ,
but
that
instant
a
headlong
wave
shot
the
boat
far
ahead
*punct* ,
and
its
seethings
drowned
all
speech
*punct* .
*break*
hast
thou
seen
the
white
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
demanded
ahab
*punct* ,
when
the
boat
drifted
back
*punct* .
*break*
think
*punct* ,
think
of
thy
whale-boat
*punct* ,
stoven
and
sunk
*punct* !
*break*
beware
of
the
horrible
tail
*punct* !
*break*
i
tell
thee
again
*punct* ,
gabriel
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
but
again
the
boat
tore
ahead
as
if
dragged
by
fiends
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
was
said
for
some
moments
*punct* ,
while
a
succession
of
riotous
waves
rolled
by
*punct* ,
which
by
one
of
those
occasional
caprices
of
the
seas
were
tumbling
*punct* ,
not
heaving
it
*punct* .
*break*
meantime
*punct* ,
the
hoisted
sperm
whale's
head
jogged
about
very
violently
*punct* ,
and
gabriel
was
seen
eyeing
it
with
rather
more
apprehensiveness
than
his
archangel
nature
seemed
to
warrant
*punct* .
*break*
when
this
interlude
was
over
*punct* ,
captain
mayhew
began
a
dark
story
concerning
moby
dick
*punct* ;
not
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
without
frequent
interruptions
from
gabriel
*punct* ,
whenever
his
name
was
mentioned
*punct* ,
and
the
crazy
sea
that
seemed
leagued
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
that
the
jeroboam
had
not
long
left
home
*punct* ,
when
upon
speaking
a
whale-ship
*punct* ,
her
people
were
reliably
apprised
of
the
existence
of
moby
dick
*punct* ,
and
the
havoc
he
had
made
*punct* .
*break*
greedily
sucking
in
this
intelligence
*punct* ,
gabriel
solemnly
warned
the
captain
against
attacking
the
white
whale
*punct* ,
in
case
the
monster
should
be
seen
*punct* ;
in
his
gibbering
insanity
*punct* ,
pronouncing
the
white
whale
to
be
no
less
a
being
than
the
shaker
god
incarnated
*punct* ;
the
shakers
receiving
the
bible
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
*punct* ,
some
year
or
two
afterwards
*punct* ,
moby
dick
was
fairly
sighted
from
the
mast-heads
*punct* ,
macey
*punct* ,
the
chief
mate
*punct* ,
burned
with
ardor
to
encounter
him
*punct* ;
and
the
captain
himself
being
not
unwilling
to
let
him
have
the
opportunity
*punct* ,
despite
all
the
archangel's
denunciations
and
forewarnings
*punct* ,
macey
succeeded
in
persuading
five
men
to
man
his
boat
*punct* .
*break*
meantime
*punct* ,
gabriel
*punct* ,
ascending
to
the
main-royal
mast-head
*punct* ,
was
tossing
one
arm
in
frantic
gestures
*punct* ,
and
hurling
forth
prophecies
of
speedy
doom
to
the
sacrilegious
assailants
of
his
divinity
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
while
macey
*punct* ,
the
mate
*punct* ,
was
standing
up
in
his
boat's
bow
*punct* ,
and
with
all
the
reckless
energy
of
his
tribe
was
venting
his
wild
exclamations
upon
the
whale
*punct* ,
and
essaying
to
get
a
fair
chance
for
his
poised
lance
*punct* ,
lo
*punct* !
*break*
a
broad
white
shadow
rose
from
the
sea
*punct* ;
by
its
quick
*punct* ,
fanning
motion
*punct* ,
temporarily
taking
the
breath
out
of
the
bodies
of
the
oarsmen
*punct* .
*break*
next
instant
*punct* ,
the
luckless
mate
*punct* ,
so
full
of
furious
life
*punct* ,
was
smitten
bodily
into
the
air
*punct* ,
and
making
a
long
arc
in
his
descent
*punct* ,
fell
into
the
sea
at
the
distance
of
about
fifty
yards
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
chip
of
the
boat
was
harmed
*punct* ,
nor
a
hair
of
any
oarsman's
head
*punct* ;
but
the
mate
for
ever
sank
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
well
to
parenthesize
here
*punct* ,
that
of
the
fatal
accidents
in
the
sperm-whale
fishery
*punct* ,
this
kind
is
perhaps
almost
as
frequent
as
any
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
*punct* ,
nothing
is
injured
but
the
man
who
is
thus
annihilated
*punct* ;
oftener
the
boat's
bow
is
knocked
off
*punct* ,
or
the
thigh-board
*punct* ,
in
which
the
headsman
stands
*punct* ,
is
torn
from
its
place
and
accompanies
the
body
*punct* .
*break*
but
strangest
of
all
is
the
circumstance
*punct* ,
that
in
more
instances
than
one
*punct* ,
when
the
body
has
been
recovered
*punct* ,
not
a
single
mark
of
violence
is
discernible
*punct* ;
the
man
being
stark
dead
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
calamity
*punct* ,
with
the
falling
form
of
macey
*punct* ,
was
plainly
descried
from
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
raising
a
piercing
shriek
*punct* ,
the
vial
*punct* !
*break*
gabriel
called
off
the
terror-stricken
crew
from
the
further
hunting
of
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
this
terrible
event
clothed
the
archangel
with
added
influence
*punct* ;
because
his
credulous
disciples
believed
that
he
had
specifically
fore-announced
it
*punct* ,
instead
of
only
making
a
general
prophecy
*punct* ,
which
any
one
might
have
done
*punct* ,
and
so
have
chanced
to
hit
one
of
many
marks
in
the
wide
margin
allowed
*punct* .
*break*
he
became
a
nameless
terror
to
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
mayhew
having
concluded
his
narration
*punct* ,
ahab
put
such
questions
to
him
*punct* ,
that
the
stranger
captain
could
not
forbear
inquiring
whether
he
intended
to
hunt
the
white
whale
*punct* ,
if
opportunity
should
offer
*punct* .
*break*
to
which
ahab
answered
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
stolidly
turned
aside
*punct* ;
then
said
to
mayhew
*punct* ,
captain
*punct* ,
i
have
just
bethought
me
of
my
letter-bag
*punct* ;
there
is
a
letter
for
one
of
thy
officers
*punct* ,
if
i
mistake
not
*punct* .
*break*
starbuck
*punct* ,
look
over
the
bag
*punct* .
*break*
every
whale-ship
takes
out
a
goodly
number
of
letters
for
various
ships
*punct* ,
whose
delivery
to
the
persons
to
whom
they
may
be
addressed
*punct* ,
depends
upon
the
mere
chance
of
encountering
them
in
the
four
oceans
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
most
letters
never
reach
their
mark
*punct* ;
and
many
are
only
received
after
attaining
an
age
of
two
or
three
years
or
more
*punct* .
*break*
soon
starbuck
returned
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
sorely
tumbled
*punct* ,
damp
*punct* ,
and
covered
with
a
dull
*punct* ,
spotted
*punct* ,
green
mould
*punct* ,
in
consequence
of
being
kept
in
a
dark
locker
of
the
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
of
such
a
letter
*punct* ,
death
himself
might
well
have
been
the
post-boy
*punct* .
*break*
can'st
not
read
it
*punct* ?
*break*
give
it
me
*punct* ,
man
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
it's
but
a
dim
scrawl;
*punct* ,
what's
this
*punct* ?
*break*
as
he
was
studying
it
out
*punct* ,
starbuck
took
a
long
cutting-spade
pole
*punct* ,
and
with
his
knife
slightly
split
the
end
*punct* ,
to
insert
the
letter
there
*punct* ,
and
in
that
way
*punct* ,
hand
it
to
the
boat
*punct* ,
without
its
coming
any
closer
to
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
meantime
*punct* ,
ahab
holding
the
letter
*punct* ,
muttered
*punct* ,
mr.
har
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
mr.
harry
*punct* ,
a
woman's
pinny
hand,
*punct* ,
the
man's
wife
*punct* ,
i'll
wager
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
mr.
harry
macey
*punct* ,
ship
jeroboam;
*punct* ,
why
it's
macey
*punct* ,
and
he's
dead
*punct* !
*break*
and
from
his
wife
*punct* ,
sighed
mayhew
*punct* ;
but
let
me
have
it
*punct* .
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
keep
it
thyself
*punct* ,
cried
gabriel
to
ahab
*punct* ;
thou
art
soon
going
that
way
*punct* .
*break*
curses
throttle
thee
*punct* !
*break*
captain
mayhew
*punct* ,
stand
by
now
to
receive
it
*punct* ;
and
taking
the
fatal
missive
from
starbuck's
hands
*punct* ,
he
caught
it
in
the
slit
of
the
pole
*punct* ,
and
reached
it
over
towards
the
boat
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
he
did
so
*punct* ,
the
oarsmen
expectantly
desisted
from
rowing
*punct* ;
the
boat
drifted
a
little
towards
the
ship's
stern
*punct* ;
so
that
*punct* ,
as
if
by
magic
*punct* ,
the
letter
suddenly
ranged
along
with
gabriel's
eager
hand
*punct* .
*break*
he
clutched
it
in
an
instant
*punct* ,
seized
the
boat-knife
*punct* ,
and
impaling
the
letter
on
it
*punct* ,
sent
it
thus
loaded
back
into
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
it
fell
at
ahab's
feet
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
must
let
it
continue
hanging
there
a
while
till
we
can
get
a
chance
to
attend
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
present
other
matters
press
*punct* ,
and
the
best
we
can
do
now
for
the
head
*punct* ,
is
to
pray
heaven
the
tackles
may
hold
*punct* .
*break*
and
though
all
hands
commonly
disdained
the
capture
of
those
inferior
creatures
*punct* ;
and
though
the
pequod
was
not
commissioned
to
cruise
for
them
at
all
*punct* ,
and
though
she
had
passed
numbers
of
them
near
the
crozetts
without
lowering
a
boat
*punct* ;
yet
now
that
a
sperm
whale
had
been
brought
alongside
and
beheaded
*punct* ,
to
the
surprise
of
all
*punct* ,
the
announcement
was
made
that
a
right
whale
should
be
captured
that
day
*punct* ,
if
opportunity
offered
*punct* .
*break*
nor
was
this
long
wanting
*punct* .
*break*
tall
spouts
were
seen
to
leeward
*punct* ;
and
two
boats
*punct* ,
stubb's
and
flask's
*punct* ,
were
detached
in
pursuit
*punct* .
*break*
pulling
further
and
further
away
*punct* ,
they
at
last
became
almost
invisible
to
the
men
at
the
mast-head
*punct* .
*break*
but
suddenly
in
the
distance
*punct* ,
they
saw
a
great
heap
of
tumultuous
white
water
*punct* ,
and
soon
after
news
came
from
aloft
that
one
or
both
the
boats
must
be
fast
*punct* .
*break*
an
interval
passed
and
the
boats
were
in
plain
sight
*punct* ,
in
the
act
of
being
dragged
right
towards
the
ship
by
the
towing
whale
*punct* .
*break*
so
close
did
the
monster
come
to
the
hull
*punct* ,
that
at
first
it
seemed
as
if
he
meant
it
malice
*punct* ;
but
suddenly
going
down
in
a
maelstrom
*punct* ,
within
three
rods
of
the
planks
*punct* ,
he
wholly
disappeared
from
view
*punct* ,
as
if
diving
under
the
keel
*punct* .
*break*
cut
*punct* ,
cut
*punct* !
*break*
was
the
cry
from
the
ship
to
the
boats
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
for
one
instant
*punct* ,
seemed
on
the
point
of
being
brought
with
a
deadly
dash
against
the
vessel's
side
*punct* .
*break*
but
having
plenty
of
line
yet
in
the
tubs
*punct* ,
and
the
whale
not
sounding
very
rapidly
*punct* ,
they
paid
out
abundance
of
rope
*punct* ,
and
at
the
same
time
pulled
with
all
their
might
so
as
to
get
ahead
of
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
few
minutes
the
struggle
was
intensely
critical
*punct* ;
for
while
they
still
slacked
out
the
tightened
line
in
one
direction
*punct* ,
and
still
plied
their
oars
in
another
*punct* ,
the
contending
strain
threatened
to
take
them
under
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
was
only
a
few
feet
advance
they
sought
to
gain
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
fagged
whale
abated
his
speed
*punct* ,
and
blindly
altering
his
course
*punct* ,
went
round
the
stern
of
the
ship
towing
the
two
boats
after
him
*punct* ,
so
that
they
performed
a
complete
circuit
*punct* .
*break*
meantime
*punct* ,
they
hauled
more
and
more
upon
their
lines
*punct* ,
till
close
flanking
him
on
both
sides
*punct* ,
stubb
answered
flask
with
lance
for
lance
*punct* ;
and
thus
round
and
round
the
pequod
the
battle
went
*punct* ,
while
the
multitudes
of
sharks
that
had
before
swum
round
the
sperm
whale's
body
*punct* ,
rushed
to
the
fresh
blood
that
was
spilled
*punct* ,
thirstily
drinking
at
every
new
gash
*punct* ,
as
the
eager
israelites
did
at
the
new
bursting
fountains
that
poured
from
the
smitten
rock
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
his
spout
grew
thick
*punct* ,
and
with
a
frightful
roll
and
vomit
*punct* ,
he
turned
upon
his
back
a
corpse
*punct* .
*break*
while
the
two
headsmen
were
engaged
in
making
fast
cords
to
his
flukes
*punct* ,
and
in
other
ways
getting
the
mass
in
readiness
for
towing
*punct* ,
some
conversation
ensued
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
wonder
what
the
old
man
wants
with
this
lump
of
foul
lard
*punct* ,
said
stubb
*punct* ,
not
without
some
disgust
at
the
thought
of
having
to
do
with
so
ignoble
a
leviathan
*punct* .
*break*
wants
with
it
*punct* ?
*break*
said
flask
*punct* ,
coiling
some
spare
line
in
the
boat's
bow
*punct* ,
did
you
never
hear
that
the
ship
which
but
once
has
a
sperm
whale's
head
hoisted
on
her
starboard
side
*punct* ,
and
at
the
same
time
a
right
whale's
on
the
larboard
*punct* ;
did
you
never
hear
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ,
that
that
ship
can
never
afterwards
capsize
*punct* ?
*break*
i
don't
know
*punct* ,
but
i
heard
that
gamboge
ghost
of
a
fedallah
saying
so
*punct* ,
and
he
seems
to
know
all
about
ships
charms
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
sometimes
think
he'll
charm
the
ship
to
no
good
at
last
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
half
like
that
chap
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* .
*break*
did
you
ever
notice
how
that
tusk
of
his
is
a
sort
of
carved
into
a
snake's
head
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ?
*break*
i
never
look
at
him
at
all
*punct* ;
but
if
ever
i
get
a
chance
of
a
dark
night
*punct* ,
and
he
standing
hard
by
the
bulwarks
*punct* ,
and
no
one
by
*punct* ;
look
down
there
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ,
pointing
into
the
sea
with
a
peculiar
motion
of
both
hands
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
will
i
*punct* !
*break*
flask
*punct* ,
i
take
that
fedallah
to
be
the
devil
in
disguise
*punct* .
*break*
do
you
believe
that
cock
and
bull
story
about
his
having
been
stowed
away
on
board
ship
*punct* ?
*break*
he's
the
devil
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* .
*break*
now
that
i
think
of
it
*punct* ,
he's
always
wanting
oakum
to
stuff
into
the
toes
of
his
boots
*punct* .
*break*
he
sleeps
in
his
boots
*punct* ,
don't
he
*punct* ?
*break*
he
hasn't
got
any
hammock
*punct* ;
but
i've
seen
him
lay
of
nights
in
a
coil
of
rigging
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
*punct* ,
and
it's
because
of
his
cursed
tail
*punct* ;
he
coils
it
down
*punct* ,
do
ye
see
*punct* ,
in
the
eye
of
the
rigging
*punct* .
*break*
what's
the
old
man
have
so
much
to
do
with
him
for
*punct* ?
*break*
striking
up
a
swap
or
a
bargain
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* .
*break*
bargain?
*punct* ,
about
what
*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
do
ye
see
*punct* ,
the
old
man
is
hard
bent
after
that
white
whale
*punct* ,
and
the
devil
there
is
trying
to
come
round
him
*punct* ,
and
get
him
to
swap
away
his
silver
watch
*punct* ,
or
his
soul
*punct* ,
or
something
of
that
sort
*punct* ,
and
then
he'll
surrender
moby
dick
*punct* .
*break*
stubb
*punct* ,
you
are
skylarking
*punct* ;
how
can
fedallah
do
that
*punct* ?
*break*
i
don't
know
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ,
but
the
devil
is
a
curious
chap
*punct* ,
and
a
wicked
one
*punct* ,
i
tell
ye
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
they
say
as
how
he
went
a
sauntering
into
the
old
flag-ship
once
*punct* ,
switching
his
tail
about
devilish
easy
and
gentlemanlike
*punct* ,
and
inquiring
if
the
old
governor
was
at
home
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
he
was
at
home
*punct* ,
and
asked
the
devil
what
he
wanted
*punct* .
*break*
the
devil
*punct* ,
switching
his
hoofs
*punct* ,
up
and
says
*punct* ,
i
want
john
*punct* .
*break*
says
the
old
governor
*punct* ,
what
business
is
that
of
yours
*punct* ,
says
the
devil
*punct* ,
getting
mad,
*punct* ,
i
want
to
use
him
*punct* .
*break*
take
him
*punct* ,
says
the
governor
*punct* ,
and
by
the
lord
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ,
if
the
devil
didn't
give
john
the
asiatic
cholera
before
he
got
through
with
him
*punct* ,
i'll
eat
this
whale
in
one
mouthful
*punct* .
*break*
but
look
sharp
*punct* ,
aint
you
all
ready
there
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
pull
ahead
*punct* ,
and
let's
get
the
whale
alongside
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
i
remember
some
such
story
as
you
were
telling
*punct* ,
said
flask
*punct* ,
when
at
last
the
two
boats
were
slowly
advancing
with
their
burden
towards
the
ship
*punct* ,
but
i
can't
remember
where
*punct* .
*break*
adventures
of
those
three
bloody-minded
soldadoes
*punct* ?
*break*
did
ye
read
it
there
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ?
*break*
i
guess
ye
did
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ;
never
saw
such
a
book
*punct* ;
heard
of
it
*punct* ,
though
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
*punct* ,
tell
me
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ,
do
you
suppose
that
that
devil
you
was
speaking
of
just
now
*punct* ,
was
the
same
you
say
is
now
on
board
the
pequod
*punct* ?
*break*
doesn't
the
devil
live
for
ever
*punct* ;
who
ever
heard
that
the
devil
was
dead
*punct* ?
*break*
did
you
ever
see
any
parson
a
wearing
mourning
for
the
devil
*punct* ?
*break*
and
if
the
devil
has
a
latch-key
to
get
into
the
admiral's
cabin
*punct* ,
don't
you
suppose
he
can
crawl
into
a
port-hole
*punct* ?
*break*
tell
me
that
*punct* ,
mr.
flask
*punct* ?
*break*
how
old
do
you
suppose
fedallah
is
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ?
*break*
do
you
see
that
mainmast
there
*punct* ?
*break*
pointing
to
the
ship
*punct* ;
well
*punct* ,
that's
the
figure
one
*punct* ;
now
take
all
the
hoops
in
the
pequod's
hold
*punct* ,
and
string
em
along
in
a
row
with
that
mast
*punct* ,
for
oughts
*punct* ,
do
you
see
*punct* ;
well
*punct* ,
that
wouldn't
begin
to
be
fedallah's
age
*punct* .
*break*
nor
all
the
coopers
in
creation
couldn't
show
hoops
enough
to
make
oughts
enough
*punct* .
*break*
but
see
here
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ,
i
thought
you
a
little
boasted
just
now
*punct* ,
that
you
meant
to
give
fedallah
a
sea-toss
*punct* ,
if
you
got
a
good
chance
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
if
he's
so
old
as
all
those
hoops
of
yours
come
to
*punct* ,
and
if
he
is
going
to
live
for
ever
*punct* ,
what
good
will
it
do
to
pitch
him
overboard
*punct* ,
tell
me
that
*punct* ?
*break*
give
him
a
good
ducking
*punct* ,
anyhow
*punct* .
*break*
but
he'd
crawl
back
*punct* .
*break*
duck
him
again
*punct* ;
and
keep
ducking
him
*punct* .
*break*
suppose
he
should
take
it
into
his
head
to
duck
you
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
and
drown
you
*punct* ,
what
then
*punct* ?
*break*
i
should
like
to
see
him
try
it
*punct* ;
i'd
give
him
such
a
pair
of
black
eyes
that
he
wouldn't
dare
to
show
his
face
in
the
admiral's
cabin
again
for
a
long
while
*punct* ,
let
alone
down
in
the
orlop
there
*punct* ,
where
he
lives
*punct* ,
and
hereabouts
on
the
upper
decks
where
he
sneaks
so
much
*punct* .
*break*
damn

do
you
suppose
i'm
afraid
of
the
devil
*punct* ?
*break*
who's
afraid
of
him
*punct* ,
except
the
old
governor
who
daresn't
catch
him
and
put
him
in
double-darbies
*punct* ,
as
he
deserves
*punct* ,
but
lets
him
go
about
kidnapping
people
*punct* ;
aye
*punct* ,
and
signed
a
bond
with
him
*punct* ,
that
all
the
people
the
devil
kidnapped
*punct* ,
he'd
roast
for
him
*punct* ?
*break*
there's
a
governor
*punct* !
*break*
do
you
suppose
fedallah
wants
to
kidnap
captain
ahab
*punct* ?
*break*
do
i
suppose
it
*punct* ?
*break*
you'll
know
it
before
long
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
will
you
do
with
the
tail
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ?
*break*
do
with
it
*punct* ?
*break*
sell
it
for
an
ox
whip
when
we
get
home;
*punct* ,
what
else
*punct* ?
*break*
now
*punct* ,
do
you
mean
what
you
say
*punct* ,
and
have
been
saying
all
along
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ?
*break*
mean
or
not
mean
*punct* ,
here
we
are
at
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
the
boats
were
here
hailed
*punct* ,
to
tow
the
whale
on
the
larboard
side
*punct* ,
where
fluke
chains
and
other
necessaries
were
already
prepared
for
securing
him
*punct* .
*break*
didn't
i
tell
you
so
*punct* ?
*break*
said
flask
*punct* ;
yes
*punct* ,
you'll
soon
see
this
right
whale's
head
hoisted
up
opposite
that
parmacetti's
*punct* .
*break*
in
good
time
*punct* ,
flask's
saying
proved
true
*punct* .
*break*
as
before
*punct* ,
the
pequod
steeply
leaned
over
towards
the
sperm
whale's
head
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
by
the
counterpoise
of
both
heads
*punct* ,
she
regained
her
even
keel
*punct* ;
though
sorely
strained
*punct* ,
you
may
well
believe
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
when
on
one
side
you
hoist
in
locke's
head
*punct* ,
you
go
over
that
way
*punct* ;
but
now
*punct* ,
on
the
other
side
*punct* ,
hoist
in
kant's
and
you
come
back
again
*punct* ;
but
in
very
poor
plight
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
some
minds
for
ever
keep
trimming
boat
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
ye
foolish
*punct* !
*break*
throw
all
these
thunder-heads
overboard
*punct* ,
and
then
you
will
float
light
and
right
*punct* .
*break*
in
disposing
of
the
body
of
a
right
whale
*punct* ,
when
brought
alongside
the
ship
*punct* ,
the
same
preliminary
proceedings
commonly
take
place
as
in
the
case
of
a
sperm
whale
*punct* ;
only
*punct* ,
in
the
latter
instance
*punct* ,
the
head
is
cut
off
whole
*punct* ,
but
in
the
former
the
lips
and
tongue
are
separately
removed
and
hoisted
on
deck
*punct* ,
with
all
the
well
known
black
bone
attached
to
what
is
called
the
crown-piece
*punct* .
*break*
but
nothing
like
this
*punct* ,
in
the
present
case
*punct* ,
had
been
done
*punct* .
*break*
the
carcases
of
both
whales
had
dropped
astern
*punct* ;
and
the
head-laden
ship
not
a
little
resembled
a
mule
carrying
a
pair
of
overburdening
panniers
*punct* .
*break*
and
ahab
chanced
so
to
stand
*punct* ,
that
the
parsee
occupied
his
shadow
*punct* ;
while
*punct* ,
if
the
parsee's
shadow
was
there
at
all
it
seemed
only
to
blend
with
*punct* ,
and
lengthen
ahab's
*punct* .
*break*
of
the
grand
order
of
folio
leviathans
*punct* ,
the
sperm
whale
and
the
right
whale
are
by
far
the
most
noteworthy
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
the
only
whales
regularly
hunted
by
man
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
nantucketer
*punct* ,
they
present
the
two
extremes
of
all
the
known
varieties
of
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
external
difference
between
them
is
mainly
observable
in
their
heads
*punct* ;
and
as
a
head
of
each
is
this
moment
hanging
from
the
pequod's
side
*punct* ;
and
as
we
may
freely
go
from
one
to
the
other
*punct* ,
by
merely
stepping
across
the
deck:
*punct* ,
where
*punct* ,
i
should
like
to
know
*punct* ,
will
you
obtain
a
better
chance
to
study
practical
cetology
than
here
*punct* ?
*break*
in
the
first
place
*punct* ,
you
are
struck
by
the
general
contrast
between
these
heads
*punct* .
*break*
both
are
massive
enough
in
all
conscience
*punct* ;
but
there
is
a
certain
mathematical
symmetry
in
the
sperm
whale's
which
the
right
whale's
sadly
lacks
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
more
character
in
the
sperm
whale's
head
*punct* .
*break*
as
you
behold
it
*punct* ,
you
involuntarily
yield
the
immense
superiority
to
him
*punct* ,
in
point
of
pervading
dignity
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
present
instance
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
this
dignity
is
heightened
by
the
pepper
and
salt
color
of
his
head
at
the
summit
*punct* ,
giving
token
of
advanced
age
and
large
experience
*punct* .
*break*
in
short
*punct* ,
he
is
what
the
fishermen
technically
call
a
grey-headed
whale
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
from
this
peculiar
sideway
position
of
the
whale's
eyes
*punct* ,
it
is
plain
that
he
can
never
see
an
object
which
is
exactly
ahead
*punct* ,
no
more
than
he
can
one
exactly
astern
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
word
*punct* ,
the
position
of
the
whale's
eyes
corresponds
to
that
of
a
man's
ears
*punct* ;
and
you
may
fancy
*punct* ,
for
yourself
*punct* ,
how
it
would
fare
with
you
*punct* ,
did
you
sideways
survey
objects
through
your
ears
*punct* .
*break*
you
would
find
that
you
could
only
command
some
thirty
degrees
of
vision
in
advance
of
the
straight
side-line
of
sight
*punct* ;
and
about
thirty
more
behind
it
*punct* .
*break*
if
your
bitterest
foe
were
walking
straight
towards
you
*punct* ,
with
dagger
uplifted
in
broad
day
*punct* ,
you
would
not
be
able
to
see
him
*punct* ,
any
more
than
if
he
were
stealing
upon
you
from
behind
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
while
in
most
other
animals
that
i
can
now
think
of
*punct* ,
the
eyes
are
so
planted
as
imperceptibly
to
blend
their
visual
power
*punct* ,
so
as
to
produce
one
picture
and
not
two
to
the
brain
*punct* ;
the
peculiar
position
of
the
whale's
eyes
*punct* ,
effectually
divided
as
they
are
by
many
cubic
feet
of
solid
head
*punct* ,
which
towers
between
them
like
a
great
mountain
separating
two
lakes
in
valleys
*punct* ;
this
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
must
wholly
separate
the
impressions
which
each
independent
organ
imparts
*punct* .
*break*
the
whale
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
must
see
one
distinct
picture
on
this
side
*punct* ,
and
another
distinct
picture
on
that
side
*punct* ;
while
all
between
must
be
profound
darkness
and
nothingness
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
man
may
*punct* ,
in
effect
*punct* ,
be
said
to
look
out
on
the
world
from
a
sentry-box
with
two
joined
sashes
for
his
window
*punct* .
*break*
but
with
the
whale
*punct* ,
these
two
sashes
are
separately
inserted
*punct* ,
making
two
distinct
windows
*punct* ,
but
sadly
impairing
the
view
*punct* .
*break*
this
peculiarity
of
the
whale's
eyes
is
a
thing
always
to
be
borne
in
mind
in
the
fishery
*punct* ;
and
to
be
remembered
by
the
reader
in
some
subsequent
scenes
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
must
be
content
with
a
hint
*punct* .
*break*
so
long
as
a
man's
eyes
are
open
in
the
light
*punct* ,
the
act
of
seeing
is
involuntary
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
he
cannot
then
help
mechanically
seeing
whatever
objects
are
before
him
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
any
one's
experience
will
teach
him
*punct* ,
that
though
he
can
take
in
an
undiscriminating
sweep
of
things
at
one
glance
*punct* ,
it
is
quite
impossible
for
him
*punct* ,
attentively
*punct* ,
and
completely
*punct* ,
to
examine
any
two
things
*punct* ,
however
large
or
however
small
*punct* ,
at
one
and
the
same
instant
of
time
*punct* ;
never
mind
if
they
lie
side
by
side
and
touch
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
you
now
come
to
separate
these
two
objects
*punct* ,
and
surround
each
by
a
circle
of
profound
darkness
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
in
order
to
see
one
of
them
*punct* ,
in
such
a
manner
as
to
bring
your
mind
to
bear
on
it
*punct* ,
the
other
will
be
utterly
excluded
from
your
contemporary
consciousness
*punct* .
*break*
how
is
it
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
with
the
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
true
*punct* ,
both
his
eyes
*punct* ,
in
themselves
*punct* ,
must
simultaneously
act
*punct* ;
but
is
his
brain
so
much
more
comprehensive
*punct* ,
combining
*punct* ,
and
subtle
than
man's
*punct* ,
that
he
can
at
the
same
moment
of
time
attentively
examine
two
distinct
prospects
*punct* ,
one
on
one
side
of
him
*punct* ,
and
the
other
in
an
exactly
opposite
direction
*punct* ?
*break*
if
he
can
*punct* ,
then
is
it
as
marvellous
a
thing
in
him
*punct* ,
as
if
a
man
were
able
simultaneously
to
go
through
the
demonstrations
of
two
distinct
problems
in
euclid
*punct* .
*break*
nor
*punct* ,
strictly
investigated
*punct* ,
is
there
any
incongruity
in
this
comparison
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
be
but
an
idle
whim
*punct* ,
but
it
has
always
seemed
to
me
*punct* ,
that
the
extraordinary
vacillations
of
movement
displayed
by
some
whales
when
beset
by
three
or
four
boats
*punct* ;
the
timidity
and
liability
to
queer
frights
*punct* ,
so
common
to
such
whales
*punct* ;
i
think
that
all
this
indirectly
proceeds
from
the
helpless
perplexity
of
volition
*punct* ,
in
which
their
divided
and
diametrically
opposite
powers
of
vision
must
involve
them
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
ear
of
the
whale
is
full
as
curious
as
the
eye
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
are
an
entire
stranger
to
their
race
*punct* ,
you
might
hunt
over
these
two
heads
for
hours
*punct* ,
and
never
discover
that
organ
*punct* .
*break*
the
ear
has
no
external
leaf
whatever
*punct* ;
and
into
the
hole
itself
you
can
hardly
insert
a
quill
*punct* ,
so
wondrously
minute
is
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
lodged
a
little
behind
the
eye
*punct* .
*break*
while
the
ear
of
the
former
has
an
external
opening
*punct* ,
that
of
the
latter
is
entirely
and
evenly
covered
over
with
a
membrane
*punct* ,
so
as
to
be
quite
imperceptible
from
without
*punct* .
*break*
is
it
not
curious
*punct* ,
that
so
vast
a
being
as
the
whale
should
see
the
world
through
so
small
an
eye
*punct* ,
and
hear
the
thunder
through
an
ear
which
is
smaller
than
a
hare's
*punct* ?
*break*
but
if
his
eyes
were
broad
as
the
lens
of
herschel's
great
telescope
*punct* ;
and
his
ears
capacious
as
the
porches
of
cathedrals
*punct* ;
would
that
make
him
any
longer
of
sight
*punct* ,
or
sharper
of
hearing
*punct* ?
*break*
not
at
all.
*punct* ,
why
then
do
you
try
to
enlarge
your
mind
*punct* ?
*break*
let
us
now
with
whatever
levers
and
steam-engines
we
have
at
hand
*punct* ,
cant
over
the
sperm
whale's
head
*punct* ,
so
that
it
may
lie
bottom
up
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
ascending
by
a
ladder
to
the
summit
*punct* ,
have
a
peep
down
the
mouth
*punct* ;
and
were
it
not
that
the
body
is
now
completely
separated
from
it
*punct* ,
with
a
lantern
we
might
descend
into
the
great
kentucky
mammoth
cave
of
his
stomach
*punct* .
*break*
but
let
us
hold
on
here
by
this
tooth
*punct* ,
and
look
about
us
where
we
are
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
really
beautiful
and
chaste-looking
mouth
*punct* !
*break*
from
floor
to
ceiling
*punct* ,
lined
*punct* ,
or
rather
papered
with
a
glistening
white
membrane
*punct* ,
glossy
as
bridal
satins
*punct* .
*break*
but
come
out
now
*punct* ,
and
look
at
this
portentous
lower
jaw
*punct* ,
which
seems
like
the
long
narrow
lid
of
an
immense
snuff-box
*punct* ,
with
a
hinge
at
one
end
*punct* ,
instead
of
one
side
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
pry
it
up
*punct* ,
so
as
to
get
it
overhead
*punct* ,
and
expose
its
rows
of
teeth
*punct* ,
it
seems
a
terrific
portcullis
*punct* ;
and
such
*punct* ,
alas
*punct* !
*break*
it
proves
to
many
a
poor
wight
in
the
fishery
*punct* ,
upon
whom
these
spikes
fall
with
impaling
force
*punct* .
*break*
but
far
more
terrible
is
it
to
behold
*punct* ,
when
fathoms
down
in
the
sea
*punct* ,
you
see
some
sulky
whale
*punct* ,
floating
there
suspended
*punct* ,
with
his
prodigious
jaw
*punct* ,
some
fifteen
feet
long
*punct* ,
hanging
straight
down
at
right-angles
with
his
body
*punct* ,
for
all
the
world
like
a
ship's
jib-boom
*punct* .
*break*
this
whale
is
not
dead
*punct* ;
he
is
only
dispirited
*punct* ;
out
of
sorts
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ;
hypochondriac
*punct* ;
and
so
supine
*punct* ,
that
the
hinges
of
his
jaw
have
relaxed
*punct* ,
leaving
him
there
in
that
ungainly
sort
of
plight
*punct* ,
a
reproach
to
all
his
tribe
*punct* ,
who
must
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* ,
imprecate
lock-jaws
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
long
*punct* ,
weary
hoist
the
jaw
is
dragged
on
board
*punct* ,
as
if
it
were
an
anchor
*punct* ;
and
when
the
proper
time
comes
*punct* ,
some
few
days
after
the
other
work
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
daggoo
*punct* ,
and
tashtego
*punct* ,
being
all
accomplished
dentists
*punct* ,
are
set
to
drawing
teeth
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
keen
cutting-spade
*punct* ,
queequeg
lances
the
gums
*punct* ;
then
the
jaw
is
lashed
down
to
ringbolts
*punct* ,
and
a
tackle
being
rigged
from
aloft
*punct* ,
they
drag
out
these
teeth
*punct* ,
as
michigan
oxen
drag
stumps
of
old
oaks
out
of
wild
wood-lands
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
generally
forty-two
teeth
in
all
*punct* ;
in
old
whales
*punct* ,
much
worn
down
*punct* ,
but
undecayed
*punct* ;
nor
filled
after
our
artificial
fashion
*punct* .
*break*
two
hundred
years
ago
an
old
dutch
voyager
likened
its
shape
to
that
of
a
shoemaker's
last
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
this
same
last
or
shoe
*punct* ,
that
old
woman
of
the
nursery
tale
*punct* ,
with
the
swarming
brood
*punct* ,
might
very
comfortably
be
lodged
*punct* ,
she
and
all
her
progeny
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
you
come
nearer
to
this
great
head
it
begins
to
assume
different
aspects
*punct* ,
according
to
your
point
of
view
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
if
you
fix
your
eye
upon
this
strange
*punct* ,
crested
*punct* ,
comb-like
incrustation
on
the
top
of
the
mass
*punct* ,
this
green
*punct* ,
barnacled
thing
*punct* ,
which
the
greenlanders
call
the
crown
*punct* ,
and
the
southern
fishers
the
bonnet
of
the
right
whale
*punct* ;
fixing
your
eyes
solely
on
this
*punct* ,
you
would
take
the
head
for
the
trunk
of
some
huge
oak
*punct* ,
with
a
bird's
nest
in
its
crotch
*punct* .
*break*
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
when
you
watch
those
live
crabs
that
nestle
here
on
this
bonnet
*punct* ,
such
an
idea
will
be
almost
sure
to
occur
to
you
*punct* ;
unless
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
your
fancy
has
been
fixed
by
the
technical
term
crown
also
bestowed
upon
it
*punct* ;
in
which
case
you
will
take
great
interest
in
thinking
how
this
mighty
monster
is
actually
a
diademed
king
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
whose
green
crown
has
been
put
together
for
him
in
this
marvellous
manner
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
this
whale
be
a
king
*punct* ,
he
is
a
very
sulky
looking
fellow
to
grace
a
diadem
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
that
hanging
lower
lip
*punct* !
*break*
what
a
huge
sulk
and
pout
is
there
*punct* !
*break*
a
sulk
and
pout
*punct* ,
by
carpenter's
measurement
*punct* ,
about
twenty
feet
long
and
five
feet
deep
*punct* ;
a
sulk
and
pout
that
will
yield
you
some
500
gallons
of
oil
and
more
*punct* .
*break*
a
great
pity
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
that
this
unfortunate
whale
should
be
hare-lipped
*punct* .
*break*
the
fissure
is
about
a
foot
across
*punct* .
*break*
probably
the
mother
during
an
important
interval
was
sailing
down
the
peruvian
coast
*punct* ,
when
earthquakes
caused
the
beach
to
gape
*punct* .
*break*
over
this
lip
*punct* ,
as
over
a
slippery
threshold
*punct* ,
we
now
slide
into
the
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
upon
my
word
were
i
at
mackinaw
*punct* ,
i
should
take
this
to
be
the
inside
of
an
indian
wigwam
*punct* .
*break*
is
this
the
road
that
jonah
went
*punct* ?
*break*
the
roof
is
about
twelve
feet
high
*punct* ,
and
runs
to
a
pretty
sharp
angle
*punct* ,
as
if
there
were
a
regular
ridge-pole
there
*punct* ;
while
these
ribbed
*punct* ,
arched
*punct* ,
hairy
sides
*punct* ,
present
us
with
those
wondrous
*punct* ,
half
vertical
*punct* ,
scimetar-shaped
slats
of
whale-bone
*punct* ,
say
three
hundred
on
a
side
*punct* ,
which
depending
from
the
upper
part
of
the
head
or
crown
bone
*punct* ,
form
those
venetian
blinds
which
have
elsewhere
been
cursorily
mentioned
*punct* .
*break*
the
edges
of
these
bones
are
fringed
with
hairy
fibres
*punct* ,
through
which
the
right
whale
strains
the
water
*punct* ,
and
in
whose
intricacies
he
retains
the
small
fish
*punct* ,
when
open-mouthed
he
goes
through
the
seas
of
brit
in
feeding
time
*punct* .
*break*
though
the
certainty
of
this
criterion
is
far
from
demonstrable
*punct* ,
yet
it
has
the
savor
of
analogical
probability
*punct* .
*break*
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
if
we
yield
to
it
*punct* ,
we
must
grant
a
far
greater
age
to
the
right
whale
than
at
first
glance
will
seem
reasonable
*punct* .
*break*
in
old
times
*punct* ,
there
seem
to
have
prevailed
the
most
curious
fancies
concerning
these
blinds
*punct* .
*break*
one
voyager
in
purchas
calls
them
the
wondrous
whiskers
inside
of
the
whale's
mouth
*punct* ;
another
*punct* ,
hogs
bristles
*punct* ;
a
third
old
gentleman
in
hackluyt
uses
the
following
elegant
language
*punct* :
there
are
about
two
hundred
and
fifty
fins
growing
on
each
side
of
his
upper
chop
*punct* ,
which
arch
over
his
tongue
on
each
side
of
his
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
as
every
one
knows
*punct* ,
these
same
hogs
bristles
*punct* ,
fins
*punct* ,
whiskers
*punct* ,
blinds
*punct* ,
or
whatever
you
please
*punct* ,
furnish
to
the
ladies
their
busks
and
other
stiffening
contrivances
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
this
particular
*punct* ,
the
demand
has
long
been
on
the
decline
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
in
queen
anne's
time
that
the
bone
was
in
its
glory
*punct* ,
the
farthingale
being
then
all
the
fashion
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
those
ancient
dames
moved
about
gaily
*punct* ,
though
in
the
jaws
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
as
you
may
say
*punct* ;
even
so
*punct* ,
in
a
shower
*punct* ,
with
the
like
thoughtlessness
*punct* ,
do
we
nowadays
fly
under
the
same
jaws
for
protection
*punct* ;
the
umbrella
being
a
tent
spread
over
the
same
bone
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
forget
all
about
blinds
and
whiskers
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
standing
in
the
right
whale's
mouth
*punct* ,
look
around
you
afresh
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
all
these
colonnades
of
bone
so
methodically
ranged
about
*punct* ,
would
you
not
think
you
were
inside
the
great
haarlem
organ
*punct* ,
and
gazing
upon
its
thousand
pipes
*punct* ?
*break*
for
a
carpet
to
the
organ
we
have
a
rug
of
the
softest
turkey
*punct* ,
the
tongue
*punct* ,
which
is
glued
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ,
to
the
floor
of
the
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
very
fat
and
tender
*punct* ,
and
apt
to
tear
in
pieces
in
hoisting
it
on
deck
*punct* .
*break*
this
particular
tongue
now
before
us
*punct* ;
at
a
passing
glance
i
should
say
it
was
a
six-barreler
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
it
will
yield
you
about
that
amount
of
oil
*punct* .
*break*
to
sum
up
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ;
in
the
right
whale's
there
is
no
great
well
of
sperm
*punct* ;
no
ivory
teeth
at
all
*punct* ;
no
long
*punct* ,
slender
mandible
of
a
lower
jaw
*punct* ,
like
the
sperm
whale's
*punct* .
*break*
nor
in
the
sperm
whale
are
there
any
of
those
blinds
of
bone
*punct* ;
no
huge
lower
lip
*punct* ;
and
scarcely
anything
of
a
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
the
right
whale
has
two
external
spout-holes
*punct* ,
the
sperm
whale
only
one
*punct* .
*break*
look
your
last
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
on
these
venerable
hooded
heads
*punct* ,
while
they
yet
lie
together
*punct* ;
for
one
will
soon
sink
*punct* ,
unrecorded
*punct* ,
in
the
sea
*punct* ;
the
other
will
not
be
very
long
in
following
*punct* .
*break*
can
you
catch
the
expression
of
the
sperm
whale's
there
*punct* ?
*break*
it
is
the
same
he
died
with
*punct* ,
only
some
of
the
longer
wrinkles
in
the
forehead
seem
now
faded
away
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
his
broad
brow
to
be
full
of
a
prairie-like
placidity
*punct* ,
born
of
a
speculative
indifference
as
to
death
*punct* .
*break*
but
mark
the
other
head's
expression
*punct* .
*break*
see
that
amazing
lower
lip
*punct* ,
pressed
by
accident
against
the
vessel's
side
*punct* ,
so
as
firmly
to
embrace
the
jaw
*punct* .
*break*
does
not
this
whole
head
seem
to
speak
of
an
enormous
practical
resolution
in
facing
death
*punct* ?
*break*
i
would
have
you
investigate
it
now
with
the
sole
view
of
forming
to
yourself
some
unexaggerated
*punct* ,
intelligent
estimate
of
whatever
battering-ram
power
may
be
lodged
there
*punct* .
*break*
you
observe
that
in
the
ordinary
swimming
position
of
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
the
front
of
his
head
presents
an
almost
wholly
vertical
plane
to
the
water
*punct* ;
you
observe
that
the
lower
part
of
that
front
slopes
considerably
backwards
*punct* ,
so
as
to
furnish
more
of
a
retreat
for
the
long
socket
which
receives
the
boom-like
lower
jaw
*punct* ;
you
observe
that
the
mouth
is
entirely
under
the
head
*punct* ,
much
in
the
same
way
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
as
though
your
own
mouth
were
entirely
under
your
chin
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
you
observe
that
the
whale
has
no
external
nose
*punct* ;
and
that
what
nose
he
has
*punct* ,
his
spout
hole
*punct* ,
is
on
the
top
of
his
head
*punct* ;
you
observe
that
his
eyes
and
ears
are
at
the
sides
of
his
head
*punct* ,
nearly
one
third
of
his
entire
length
from
the
front
*punct* .
*break*
wherefore
*punct* ,
you
must
now
have
perceived
that
the
front
of
the
sperm
whale's
head
is
a
dead
*punct* ,
blind
wall
*punct* ,
without
a
single
organ
or
tender
prominence
of
any
sort
whatsoever
*punct* .
*break*
furthermore
*punct* ,
you
are
now
to
consider
that
only
in
the
extreme
*punct* ,
lower
*punct* ,
backward
sloping
part
of
the
front
of
the
head
*punct* ,
is
there
the
slightest
vestige
of
bone
*punct* ;
and
not
till
you
get
near
twenty
feet
from
the
forehead
do
you
come
to
the
full
cranial
development
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
this
whole
enormous
boneless
mass
is
as
one
wad
*punct* .
*break*
finally
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
as
will
soon
be
revealed
*punct* ,
its
contents
partly
comprise
the
most
delicate
oil
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
you
are
now
to
be
apprised
of
the
nature
of
the
substance
which
so
impregnably
invests
all
that
apparent
effeminacy
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
previous
place
i
have
described
to
you
how
the
blubber
wraps
the
body
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
as
the
rind
wraps
an
orange
*punct* .
*break*
just
so
with
the
head
*punct* ;
but
with
this
difference
*punct* :
about
the
head
this
envelope
*punct* ,
though
not
so
thick
*punct* ,
is
of
a
boneless
toughness
*punct* ,
inestimable
by
any
man
who
has
not
handled
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
severest
pointed
harpoon
*punct* ,
the
sharpest
lance
darted
by
the
strongest
human
arm
*punct* ,
impotently
rebounds
from
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
as
though
the
forehead
of
the
sperm
whale
were
paved
with
horses
hoofs
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
think
that
any
sensation
lurks
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
bethink
yourself
also
of
another
thing
*punct* .
*break*
when
two
large
*punct* ,
loaded
indiamen
chance
to
crowd
and
crush
towards
each
other
in
the
docks
*punct* ,
what
do
the
sailors
do
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
they
hold
there
a
large
*punct* ,
round
wad
of
tow
and
cork
*punct* ,
enveloped
in
the
thickest
and
toughest
of
ox-hide
*punct* .
*break*
that
bravely
and
uninjured
takes
the
jam
which
would
have
snapped
all
their
oaken
handspikes
and
iron
crowbars
*punct* .
*break*
by
itself
this
sufficiently
illustrates
the
obvious
fact
i
drive
at
*punct* .
*break*
but
supplementary
to
this
*punct* ,
it
has
hypothetically
occurred
to
me
*punct* ,
that
as
ordinary
fish
possess
what
is
called
a
swimming
bladder
in
them
*punct* ,
capable
*punct* ,
at
will
*punct* ,
of
distension
or
contraction
*punct* ;
and
as
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
as
far
as
i
know
*punct* ,
has
no
such
provision
in
him
*punct* ;
considering
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
the
otherwise
inexplicable
manner
in
which
he
now
depresses
his
head
altogether
beneath
the
surface
*punct* ,
and
anon
swims
with
it
high
elevated
out
of
the
water
*punct* ;
considering
the
unobstructed
elasticity
of
its
envelop
*punct* ;
considering
the
unique
interior
of
his
head
*punct* ;
it
has
hypothetically
occurred
to
me
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
that
those
mystical
lung-celled
honeycombs
there
may
possibly
have
some
hitherto
unknown
and
unsuspected
connexion
with
the
outer
air
*punct* ,
so
as
to
be
susceptible
to
atmospheric
distension
and
contraction
*punct* .
*break*
if
this
be
so
*punct* ,
fancy
the
irresistibleness
of
that
might
*punct* ,
to
which
the
most
impalpable
and
destructive
of
all
elements
contributes
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
mark
*punct* .
*break*
unerringly
impelling
this
dead
*punct* ,
impregnable
*punct* ,
uninjurable
wall
*punct* ,
and
this
most
buoyant
thing
within
*punct* ;
there
swims
behind
it
all
a
mass
of
tremendous
life
*punct* ,
only
to
be
adequately
estimated
as
piled
wood
is
*punct* ,
by
the
cord
*punct* ;
and
all
obedient
to
one
volition
*punct* ,
as
the
smallest
insect
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
when
i
shall
hereafter
detail
to
you
all
the
specialities
and
concentrations
of
potency
everywhere
lurking
in
this
expansive
monster
*punct* ;
when
i
shall
show
you
some
of
his
more
inconsiderable
braining
feats
*punct* ;
i
trust
you
will
have
renounced
all
ignorant
incredulity
*punct* ,
and
be
ready
to
abide
by
this
*punct* ;
that
though
the
sperm
whale
stove
a
passage
through
the
isthmus
of
darien
*punct* ,
and
mixed
the
atlantic
with
the
pacific
*punct* ,
you
would
not
elevate
one
hair
of
your
eye-brow
*punct* .
*break*
for
unless
you
own
the
whale
*punct* ,
you
are
but
a
provincial
and
sentimentalist
in
truth
*punct* .
*break*
but
clear
truth
is
a
thing
for
salamander
giants
only
to
encounter
*punct* ;
how
small
the
chances
for
the
provincials
then
*punct* ?
*break*
what
befel
the
weakling
youth
lifting
the
dread
goddess's
veil
at
sais
*punct* ?
*break*
but
to
comprehend
it
aright
*punct* ,
you
must
know
something
of
the
curious
internal
structure
of
the
thing
operated
upon
*punct* .
*break*
regarding
the
sperm
whale's
head
as
a
solid
oblong
*punct* ,
you
may
*punct* ,
on
an
inclined
plane
*punct* ,
sideways
divide
it
into
two
quoins
*punct* ,
whereof
the
lower
is
the
bony
structure
*punct* ,
forming
the
cranium
and
jaws
*punct* ,
and
the
upper
an
unctuous
mass
wholly
free
from
bones
*punct* ;
its
broad
forward
end
forming
the
expanded
vertical
apparent
forehead
of
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
middle
of
the
forehead
horizontally
subdivide
this
upper
quoin
*punct* ,
and
then
you
have
two
almost
equal
parts
*punct* ,
which
before
were
naturally
divided
by
an
internal
wall
of
a
thick
tendinous
substance
*punct* .
*break*
the
lower
subdivided
part
*punct* ,
called
the
junk
*punct* ,
is
one
immense
honeycomb
of
oil
*punct* ,
formed
by
the
crossing
and
re-crossing
*punct* ,
into
ten
thousand
infiltrated
cells
*punct* ,
of
tough
elastic
white
fibres
throughout
its
whole
extent
*punct* .
*break*
the
upper
part
*punct* ,
known
as
the
case
*punct* ,
may
be
regarded
as
the
great
heidelburgh
tun
of
the
sperm
whale
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
that
famous
great
tierce
is
mystically
carved
in
front
*punct* ,
so
the
whale's
vast
plaited
forehead
forms
innumerable
strange
devices
for
the
emblematical
adornment
of
his
wondrous
tun
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
as
that
of
heidelburgh
was
always
replenished
with
the
most
excellent
of
the
wines
of
the
rhenish
valleys
*punct* ,
so
the
tun
of
the
whale
contains
by
far
the
most
precious
of
all
his
oily
vintages
*punct* ;
namely
*punct* ,
the
highly-prized
spermaceti
*punct* ,
in
its
absolutely
pure
*punct* ,
limpid
*punct* ,
and
odoriferous
state
*punct* .
*break*
nor
is
this
precious
substance
found
unalloyed
in
any
other
part
of
the
creature
*punct* .
*break*
a
large
whale's
case
generally
yields
about
five
hundred
gallons
of
sperm
*punct* ,
though
from
unavoidable
circumstances
*punct* ,
considerable
of
it
is
spilled
*punct* ,
leaks
*punct* ,
and
dribbles
away
*punct* ,
or
is
otherwise
irrevocably
lost
in
the
ticklish
business
of
securing
what
you
can
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
not
with
what
fine
and
costly
material
the
heidelburgh
tun
was
coated
within
*punct* ,
but
in
superlative
richness
that
coating
could
not
possibly
have
compared
with
the
silken
pearl-colored
membrane
*punct* ,
like
the
line
of
a
fine
pelisse
*punct* ,
forming
the
inner
surface
of
the
sperm
whale's
case
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
have
been
seen
that
the
heidelburgh
tun
of
the
sperm
whale
embraces
the
entire
length
of
the
entire
top
of
the
head
*punct* ;
and
since
*punct* ,
as
has
been
elsewhere
set
forth
*punct* ,
the
head
embraces
one
third
of
the
whole
length
of
the
creature
*punct* ,
then
setting
that
length
down
at
eighty
feet
for
a
good
sized
whale
*punct* ,
you
have
more
than
twenty-six
feet
for
the
depth
of
the
tun
*punct* ,
when
it
is
lengthwise
hoisted
up
and
down
against
a
ship's
side
*punct* .
*break*
as
in
decapitating
the
whale
*punct* ,
the
operator's
instrument
is
brought
close
to
the
spot
where
an
entrance
is
subsequently
forced
into
the
spermaceti
magazine
*punct* ;
he
has
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
to
be
uncommonly
heedful
*punct* ,
lest
a
careless
*punct* ,
untimely
stroke
should
invade
the
sanctuary
and
wastingly
let
out
its
invaluable
contents
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
this
decapitated
end
of
the
head
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
which
is
at
last
elevated
out
of
the
water
*punct* ,
and
retained
in
that
position
by
the
enormous
cutting
tackles
*punct* ,
whose
hempen
combinations
*punct* ,
on
one
side
*punct* ,
make
quite
a
wilderness
of
ropes
in
that
quarter
*punct* .
*break*
it
belongs
to
the
pure
nautical
mathematics
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
not
that
it
has
been
defined
before
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
carried
with
him
a
light
tackle
called
a
whip
*punct* ,
consisting
of
only
two
parts
*punct* ,
travelling
through
a
single-sheaved
block
*punct* .
*break*
securing
this
block
*punct* ,
so
that
it
hangs
down
from
the
yard-arm
*punct* ,
he
swings
one
end
of
the
rope
*punct* ,
till
it
is
caught
and
firmly
held
by
a
hand
on
deck
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
hand-over-hand
*punct* ,
down
the
other
part
*punct* ,
the
indian
drops
through
the
air
*punct* ,
till
dexterously
he
lands
on
the
summit
of
the
head
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
still
high
elevated
above
the
rest
of
the
company
*punct* ,
to
whom
he
vivaciously
cries
*punct* ,
he
seems
some
turkish
muezzin
calling
the
good
people
to
prayers
from
the
top
of
a
tower
*punct* .
*break*
a
short-handled
sharp
spade
being
sent
up
to
him
*punct* ,
he
diligently
searches
for
the
proper
place
to
begin
breaking
into
the
tun
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
business
he
proceeds
very
heedfully
*punct* ,
like
a
treasure-hunter
in
some
old
house
*punct* ,
sounding
the
walls
to
find
where
the
gold
is
masoned
in
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
time
this
cautious
search
is
over
*punct* ,
a
stout
iron-bound
bucket
*punct* ,
precisely
like
a
well-bucket
*punct* ,
has
been
attached
to
one
end
of
the
whip
*punct* ;
while
the
other
end
*punct* ,
being
stretched
across
the
deck
*punct* ,
is
there
held
by
two
or
three
alert
hands
*punct* .
*break*
these
last
now
hoist
the
bucket
within
grasp
of
the
indian
*punct* ,
to
whom
another
person
has
reached
up
a
very
long
pole
*punct* .
*break*
inserting
this
pole
into
the
bucket
*punct* ,
tashtego
downward
guides
the
bucket
into
the
tun
*punct* ,
till
it
entirely
disappears
*punct* ;
then
giving
the
word
to
the
seamen
at
the
whip
*punct* ,
up
comes
the
bucket
again
*punct* ,
all
bubbling
like
a
dairy-maid's
pail
of
new
milk
*punct* .
*break*
carefully
lowered
from
its
height
*punct* ,
the
full-freighted
vessel
is
caught
by
an
appointed
hand
*punct* ,
and
quickly
emptied
into
a
large
tub
*punct* .
*break*
then
re-mounting
aloft
*punct* ,
it
again
goes
through
the
same
round
until
the
deep
cistern
will
yield
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
the
people
of
the
pequod
had
been
baling
some
time
in
this
way
*punct* ;
several
tubs
had
been
filled
with
the
fragrant
sperm
*punct* ;
when
all
at
once
a
queer
accident
happened
*punct* .
*break*
whether
it
was
that
tashtego
*punct* ,
that
wild
indian
*punct* ,
was
so
heedless
and
reckless
as
to
let
go
for
a
moment
his
one-handed
hold
on
the
great
cabled
tackles
suspending
the
head
*punct* ;
or
whether
the
place
where
he
stood
was
so
treacherous
and
oozy
*punct* ;
or
whether
the
evil
one
himself
would
have
it
to
fall
out
so
*punct* ,
without
stating
his
particular
reasons
*punct* ;
how
it
was
exactly
*punct* ,
there
is
no
telling
now
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
on
a
sudden
*punct* ,
as
the
eightieth
or
ninetieth
bucket
came
suckingly
up
*punct* ,
my
god
*punct* !
*break*
poor
tashtego
*punct* ,
like
the
twin
reciprocating
bucket
in
a
veritable
well
*punct* ,
dropped
head-foremost
down
into
this
great
tun
of
heidelburgh
*punct* ,
and
with
a
horrible
oily
gurgling
*punct* ,
went
clean
out
of
sight
*punct* !
*break*
cried
daggoo
*punct* ,
who
amid
the
general
consternation
first
came
to
his
senses
*punct* .
*break*
swing
the
bucket
this
way
*punct* !
*break*
and
putting
one
foot
into
it
*punct* ,
so
as
the
better
to
secure
his
slippery
hand-hold
on
the
whip
itself
*punct* ,
the
hoisters
ran
him
high
up
to
the
top
of
the
head
*punct* ,
almost
before
tashtego
could
have
reached
its
interior
bottom
*punct* .
*break*
meantime
*punct* ,
there
was
a
terrible
tumult
*punct* .
*break*
looking
over
the
side
*punct* ,
they
saw
the
before
lifeless
head
throbbing
and
heaving
just
below
the
surface
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
as
if
that
moment
seized
with
some
momentous
idea
*punct* ;
whereas
it
was
only
the
poor
indian
unconsciously
revealing
by
those
struggles
the
perilous
depth
to
which
he
had
sunk
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
instant
*punct* ,
while
daggoo
*punct* ,
on
the
summit
of
the
head
*punct* ,
was
clearing
the
whip
*punct* ,
which
had
somehow
got
foul
of
the
great
cutting
tackles
*punct* ,
a
sharp
cracking
noise
was
heard
*punct* ;
and
to
the
unspeakable
horror
of
all
*punct* ,
one
of
the
two
enormous
hooks
suspending
the
head
tore
out
*punct* ,
and
with
a
vast
vibration
the
enormous
mass
sideways
swung
*punct* ,
till
the
drunk
ship
reeled
and
shook
as
if
smitten
by
an
iceberg
*punct* .
*break*
the
one
remaining
hook
*punct* ,
upon
which
the
entire
strain
now
depended
*punct* ,
seemed
every
instant
to
be
on
the
point
of
giving
way
*punct* ;
an
event
still
more
likely
from
the
violent
motions
of
the
head
*punct* .
*break*
come
down
*punct* ,
come
down
*punct* !
*break*
in
heaven's
name
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
cried
stubb
*punct* ,
are
you
ramming
home
a
cartridge
there?
*punct* ,
avast
*punct* !
*break*
how
will
that
help
him
*punct* ;
jamming
that
iron-bound
bucket
on
top
of
his
head
*punct* ?
*break*
avast
*punct* ,
will
ye
*punct* !
*break*
stand
clear
of
the
tackle
*punct* !
*break*
cried
a
voice
like
the
bursting
of
a
rocket
*punct* .
*break*
almost
in
the
same
instant
*punct* ,
with
a
thunder-boom
*punct* ,
the
enormous
mass
dropped
into
the
sea
*punct* ,
like
niagara's
table-rock
into
the
whirlpool
*punct* ;
the
suddenly
relieved
hull
rolled
away
from
it
*punct* ,
to
far
down
her
glittering
copper
*punct* ;
and
all
caught
their
breath
*punct* ,
as
half
swinging
*punct* ,
now
over
the
sailors
heads
*punct* ,
and
now
over
the
water
*punct* ,
daggoo
*punct* ,
through
a
thick
mist
of
spray
*punct* ,
was
dimly
beheld
clinging
to
the
pendulous
tackles
*punct* ,
while
poor
*punct* ,
buried-alive
tashtego
was
sinking
utterly
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
*punct* !
*break*
but
hardly
had
the
blinding
vapor
cleared
away
*punct* ,
when
a
naked
figure
with
a
boarding-sword
in
its
hand
*punct* ,
was
for
one
swift
moment
seen
hovering
over
the
bulwarks
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
*punct* ,
a
loud
splash
announced
that
my
brave
queequeg
had
dived
to
the
rescue
*punct* .
*break*
one
packed
rush
was
made
to
the
side
*punct* ,
and
every
eye
counted
every
ripple
*punct* ,
as
moment
followed
moment
*punct* ,
and
no
sign
of
either
the
sinker
or
the
diver
could
be
seen
*punct* .
*break*
some
hands
now
jumped
into
a
boat
alongside
*punct* ,
and
pushed
a
little
off
from
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
cried
daggoo
*punct* ,
all
at
once
*punct* ,
from
his
now
quiet
*punct* ,
swinging
perch
overhead
*punct* ;
and
looking
further
off
from
the
side
*punct* ,
we
saw
an
arm
thrust
upright
from
the
blue
waves
*punct* ;
a
sight
strange
to
see
*punct* ,
as
an
arm
thrust
forth
from
the
grass
over
a
grave
*punct* .
*break*
both!
*punct* ,
it
is
both!
*punct* ,
cried
daggoo
again
with
a
joyful
shout
*punct* ;
and
soon
after
*punct* ,
queequeg
was
seen
boldly
striking
out
with
one
hand
*punct* ,
and
with
the
other
clutching
the
long
hair
of
the
indian
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
diving
after
the
slowly
descending
head
*punct* ,
queequeg
with
his
keen
sword
had
made
side
lunges
near
its
bottom
*punct* ,
so
as
to
scuttle
a
large
hole
there
*punct* ;
then
dropping
his
sword
*punct* ,
had
thrust
his
long
arm
far
inwards
and
upwards
*punct* ,
and
so
hauled
out
our
poor
tash
by
the
head
*punct* .
*break*
he
averred
*punct* ,
that
upon
first
thrusting
in
for
him
*punct* ,
a
leg
was
presented
*punct* ;
but
well
knowing
that
that
was
not
as
it
ought
to
be
*punct* ,
and
might
occasion
great
trouble;
*punct* ,
he
had
thrust
back
the
leg
*punct* ,
and
by
a
dexterous
heave
and
toss
*punct* ,
had
wrought
a
somerset
upon
the
indian
*punct* ;
so
that
with
the
next
trial
*punct* ,
he
came
forth
in
the
good
old
way
*punct* ,
head
foremost
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
the
great
head
itself
*punct* ,
that
was
doing
as
well
as
could
be
expected
*punct* .
*break*
and
thus
*punct* ,
through
the
courage
and
great
skill
in
obstetrics
of
queequeg
*punct* ,
the
deliverance
*punct* ,
or
rather
*punct* ,
delivery
of
tashtego
*punct* ,
was
successfully
accomplished
*punct* ,
in
the
teeth
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
of
the
most
untoward
and
apparently
hopeless
impediments
*punct* ;
which
is
a
lesson
by
no
means
to
be
forgotten
*punct* .
*break*
midwifery
should
be
taught
in
the
same
course
with
fencing
and
boxing
*punct* ,
riding
and
rowing
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
that
this
queer
adventure
of
the
gay-header's
will
be
sure
to
seem
incredible
to
some
landsmen
*punct* ,
though
they
themselves
may
have
either
seen
or
heard
of
some
one's
falling
into
a
cistern
ashore
*punct* ;
an
accident
which
not
seldom
happens
*punct* ,
and
with
much
less
reason
too
than
the
indian's
*punct* ,
considering
the
exceeding
slipperiness
of
the
curb
of
the
sperm
whale's
well
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
peradventure
*punct* ,
it
may
be
sagaciously
urged
*punct* ,
how
is
this
*punct* ?
*break*
we
thought
the
tissued
*punct* ,
infiltrated
head
of
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
was
the
lightest
and
most
corky
part
about
him
*punct* ;
and
yet
thou
makest
it
sink
in
an
element
of
a
far
greater
specific
gravity
than
itself
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
thee
there
*punct* .
*break*
not
at
all
*punct* ,
but
i
have
ye
*punct* ;
for
at
the
time
poor
tash
fell
in
*punct* ,
the
case
had
been
nearly
emptied
of
its
lighter
contents
*punct* ,
leaving
little
but
the
dense
tendinous
wall
of
the
well
*punct* ,
a
double
welded
*punct* ,
hammered
substance
*punct* ,
as
i
have
before
said
*punct* ,
much
heavier
than
the
sea
water
*punct* ,
and
a
lump
of
which
sinks
in
it
like
lead
almost
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
it
was
a
running
delivery
*punct* ,
so
it
was
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
had
tashtego
perished
in
that
head
*punct* ,
it
had
been
a
very
precious
perishing
*punct* ;
smothered
in
the
very
whitest
and
daintiest
of
fragrant
spermaceti
*punct* ;
coffined
*punct* ,
hearsed
*punct* ,
and
tombed
in
the
secret
inner
chamber
and
sanctum
sanctorum
of
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
only
one
sweeter
end
can
readily
be
recalled
*punct* ,
the
delicious
death
of
an
ohio
honey-hunter
*punct* ,
who
seeking
honey
in
the
crotch
of
a
hollow
tree
*punct* ,
found
such
exceeding
store
of
it
*punct* ,
that
leaning
too
far
over
*punct* ,
it
sucked
him
in
*punct* ,
so
that
he
died
embalmed
*punct* .
*break*
how
many
*punct* ,
think
ye
*punct* ,
have
likewise
fallen
into
plato's
honey
head
*punct* ,
and
sweetly
perished
there
*punct* ?
*break*
such
an
enterprise
would
seem
almost
as
hopeful
as
for
lavater
to
have
scrutinized
the
wrinkles
on
the
rock
of
gibraltar
*punct* ,
or
for
gall
to
have
mounted
a
ladder
and
manipulated
the
dome
of
the
pantheon
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
in
that
famous
work
of
his
*punct* ,
lavater
not
only
treats
of
the
various
faces
of
men
*punct* ,
but
also
attentively
studies
the
faces
of
horses
*punct* ,
birds
*punct* ,
serpents
*punct* ,
and
fish
*punct* ;
and
dwells
in
detail
upon
the
modifications
of
expression
discernible
therein
*punct* .
*break*
nor
have
gall
and
his
disciple
spurzheim
failed
to
throw
out
some
hints
touching
the
phrenological
characteristics
of
other
beings
than
man
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
*punct* ,
though
i
am
but
ill
qualified
for
a
pioneer
*punct* ,
in
the
application
of
these
two
semi-sciences
to
the
whale
*punct* ,
i
will
do
my
endeavor
*punct* .
*break*
i
try
all
things
*punct* ;
i
achieve
what
i
can
*punct* .
*break*
physiognomically
regarded
*punct* ,
the
sperm
whale
is
an
anomalous
creature
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
no
proper
nose
*punct* .
*break*
for
as
in
landscape
gardening
*punct* ,
a
spire
*punct* ,
cupola
*punct* ,
monument
*punct* ,
or
tower
of
some
sort
*punct* ,
is
deemed
almost
indispensable
to
the
completion
of
the
scene
*punct* ;
so
no
face
can
be
physiognomically
in
keeping
without
the
elevated
open-work
belfry
of
the
nose
*punct* .
*break*
dash
the
nose
from
phidias's
marble
jove
*punct* ,
and
what
a
sorry
remainder
*punct* !
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
leviathan
is
of
so
mighty
a
magnitude
*punct* ,
all
his
proportions
are
so
stately
*punct* ,
that
the
same
deficiency
which
in
the
sculptured
jove
were
hideous
*punct* ,
in
him
is
no
blemish
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
it
is
an
added
grandeur
*punct* .
*break*
a
nose
to
the
whale
would
have
been
impertinent
*punct* .
*break*
as
on
your
physiognomical
voyage
you
sail
round
his
vast
head
in
your
jolly-boat
*punct* ,
your
noble
conceptions
of
him
are
never
insulted
by
the
reflection
that
he
has
a
nose
to
be
pulled
*punct* .
*break*
a
pestilent
conceit
*punct* ,
which
so
often
will
insist
upon
obtruding
even
when
beholding
the
mightiest
royal
beadle
on
his
throne
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
particulars
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
the
most
imposing
physiognomical
view
to
be
had
of
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
is
that
of
the
full
front
of
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
this
aspect
is
sublime
*punct* .
*break*
in
thought
a
fine
human
brow
is
like
the
east
when
troubled
with
the
morning
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
repose
of
the
pasture
*punct* ,
the
curled
brow
of
the
bull
has
a
touch
of
the
grand
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
pushing
heavy
cannon
up
mountain
defiles
*punct* ,
the
elephant's
brow
is
majestic
*punct* .
*break*
human
or
animal
*punct* ,
the
mystical
brow
is
as
that
great

in

as

this

is
angularly
filled
up

almost
squared
by
the
enormous
superincumbent

*break*
at

the

forms
a

while
under

of
this
crater
*punct* ,
in
another
cavity
seldom
exceeding
ten
inches
in

and
as
many

reposes
the
mere
handful

this

brain

*break*
the
brain
is
at

twenty
feet
from
his
apparent
forehead
in

*punct* ;
it
is
hidden
away
behind
its
vast
outworks
*punct* ,
like
the
innermost
citadel
within
the
amplified
fortifications
of
quebec
*punct* .
*break*
so
like
a
choice
casket
is
it
secreted
in

*punct* ,
that
i
have
known
some
whalemen
who
peremptorily
deny
that
the

whale
has
any
other
brain
than
that
palpable
semblance
of
one
formed

the

of
his
sperm

*punct* .
*break*
lying
in
strange
folds
*punct* ,
courses
*punct* ,
and
convolutions
*punct* ,
to
their
apprehensions
*punct* ,
it
seems
more
in
keeping
with
the
idea
of
his
general
might
to
regard
that
mystic
part
of
him
as
the
seat
of
his
intelligence
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
plain
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
that
phrenologically
the
head
of
this
leviathan
*punct* ,
in
the
creature's
living
intact
state
*punct* ,
is
an
entire
delusion
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
his
true
brain
*punct* ,
you
can
then
see
no
indications
of
it
*punct* ,
nor
feel
any
*punct* .
*break*
the
whale
*punct* ,
like
all
things
that
are
mighty
*punct* ,
wears
a
false
brow
to
the
common
world
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
place
this
reversed
skull
*punct* ,
scaled
down
to
the
human
magnitude
*punct* ,
among
a
plate
of
men's
skulls
*punct* ,
and
you
would
involuntarily
confound
it
with
them
*punct* ;
and
remarking
the
depressions
on
one
part
of
its
summit
*punct* ,
in
phrenological
phrase
you
would
say
*punct* ,
this
man
had
no
self-esteem
*punct* ,
and
no
veneration
*punct* .
*break*
and
by
those
negations
*punct* ,
considered
along
with
the
affirmative
fact
of
his
prodigious
bulk
and
power
*punct* ,
you
can
best
form
to
yourself
the
truest
*punct* ,
though
not
the
most
exhilarating
conception
of
what
the
most
exalted
potency
is
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
from
the
comparative
dimensions
of
the
whale's
proper
brain
*punct* ,
you
deem
it
incapable
of
being
adequately
charted
*punct* ,
then
i
have
another
idea
for
you
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
attentively
regard
almost
any
quadruped's
spine
*punct* ,
you
will
be
struck
with
the
resemblance
of
its
vertebrae
to
a
strung
necklace
of
dwarfed
skulls
*punct* ,
all
bearing
rudimental
resemblance
to
the
skull
proper
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
german
conceit
*punct* ,
that
the
vertebrae
are
absolutely
undeveloped
skulls
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
curious
external
resemblance
*punct* ,
i
take
it
the
germans
were
not
the
first
men
to
perceive
*punct* .
*break*
a
foreign
friend
once
pointed
it
out
to
me
*punct* ,
in
the
skeleton
of
a
foe
he
had
slain
*punct* ,
and
with
the
vertebrae
of
which
he
was
inlaying
*punct* ,
in
a
sort
of
basso-relievo
*punct* ,
the
beaked
prow
of
his
canoe
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
i
consider
that
the
phrenologists
have
omitted
an
important
thing
in
not
pushing
their
investigations
from
the
cerebellum
through
the
spinal
canal
*punct* .
*break*
for
i
believe
that
much
of
a
man's
character
will
be
found
betokened
in
his
backbone
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
rather
feel
your
spine
than
your
skull
*punct* ,
whoever
you
are
*punct* .
*break*
a
thin
joist
of
a
spine
never
yet
upheld
a
full
and
noble
soul
*punct* .
*break*
i
rejoice
in
my
spine
*punct* ,
as
in
the
firm
audacious
staff
of
that
flag
which
i
fling
half
out
to
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
apply
this
spinal
branch
of
phrenology
to
the
sperm
whale
*punct* .
*break*
his
cranial
cavity
is
continuous
with
the
first
neck-vertebra
*punct* ;
and
in
that
vertebra
the
bottom
of
the
spinal
canal
will
measure
ten
inches
across
*punct* ,
being
eight
in
height
*punct* ,
and
of
a
triangular
figure
with
the
base
downwards
*punct* .
*break*
as
it
passes
through
the
remaining
vertebrae
the
canal
tapers
in
size
*punct* ,
but
for
a
considerable
distance
remains
of
large
capacity
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
is
still
more
*punct* ,
for
many
feet
after
emerging
from
the
brain's
cavity
*punct* ,
the
spinal
cord
remains
of
an
undecreasing
girth
*punct* ,
almost
equal
to
that
of
the
brain
*punct* .
*break*
under
all
these
circumstances
*punct* ,
would
it
be
unreasonable
to
survey
and
map
out
the
whale's
spine
phrenologically
*punct* ?
*break*
for
*punct* ,
viewed
in
this
light
*punct* ,
the
wonderful
comparative
smallness
of
his
brain
proper
is
more
than
compensated
by
the
wonderful
comparative
magnitude
of
his
spinal
cord
*punct* .
*break*
but
leaving
this
hint
to
operate
as
it
may
with
the
phrenologists
*punct* ,
i
would
merely
assume
the
spinal
theory
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
in
reference
to
the
sperm
whale's
hump
*punct* .
*break*
this
august
hump
*punct* ,
if
i
mistake
not
*punct* ,
rises
over
one
of
the
larger
vertebrae
*punct* ,
and
is
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
in
some
sort
*punct* ,
the
outer
convex
mould
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
from
its
relative
situation
then
*punct* ,
i
should
call
this
high
hump
the
organ
of
firmness
or
indomitableness
in
the
sperm
whale
*punct* .
*break*
at
one
time
the
greatest
whaling
people
in
the
world
*punct* ,
the
dutch
and
germans
are
now
among
the
least
*punct* ;
but
here
and
there
at
very
wide
intervals
of
latitude
and
longitude
*punct* ,
you
still
occasionally
meet
with
their
flag
in
the
pacific
*punct* .
*break*
for
some
reason
*punct* ,
the
jungfrau
seemed
quite
eager
to
pay
her
respects
*punct* .
*break*

starbuck
*punct* ,
pointing
to
something
wavingly
held
by
the
german
*punct* .
*break*

mr.
starbuck

he's
coming

*punct* ,
that's

*break*
he's

yarman
*punct* .
*break*
go
along
with
you
*punct* ,
cried
flask
*punct* ,
it's
a
lamp-feeder
and
an
oil-can
*punct* .
*break*
he's
out
of
oil
*punct* ,
and
has
come
a-begging
*punct* .
*break*
however
curious
it
may
seem
for
an
oil-ship
to
be
borrowing
oil
on
the
whale-ground
*punct* ,
and
however
much
it
may
invertedly
contradict
the
old
proverb
about
carrying
coals
to
newcastle
*punct* ,
yet
sometimes
such
a
thing
really
happens
*punct* ;
and
in
the
present
case
captain
derick
de
deer
did
indubitably
conduct
a
lamp-feeder
as
flask
did
declare
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
mounted
the
deck
*punct* ,
ahab
abruptly
accosted
him
*punct* ,
without
at
all
heeding
what
he
had
in
his
hand
*punct* ;
but
in
his
broken
lingo
*punct* ,
the
german
soon
evinced
his
complete
ignorance
of
the
white
whale
*punct* ;
immediately
turning
the
conversation
to
his
lamp-feeder
and
oil
can
*punct* ,
with
some
remarks
touching
his
having
to
turn
into
his
hammock
at
night
in
profound
darkness
*punct* ,
his
last
drop
of
bremen
oil
being
gone
*punct* ,
and
not
a
single
flying-fish
yet
captured
to
supply
the
deficiency
*punct* ;
concluding
by
hinting
that
his
ship
was
indeed
what
in
the
fishery
is
technically
called
a
clean
one
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
an
empty
one
*punct* ,
well
deserving
the
name
of
jungfrau
or
the
virgin
*punct* .
*break*
his
necessities
supplied
*punct* ,
derick
departed
*punct* ;
but
he
had
not
gained
his
ship's
side
*punct* ,
when
whales
were
almost
simultaneously
raised
from
the
mast-heads
of
both
vessels
*punct* ;
and
so
eager
for
the
chase
was
derick
*punct* ,
that
without
pausing
to
put
his
oil-can
and
lamp-feeder
aboard
*punct* ,
he
slewed
round
his
boat
and
made
after
the
leviathan
lamp-feeders
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
the
game
having
risen
to
leeward
*punct* ,
he
and
the
other
three
german
boats
that
soon
followed
him
*punct* ,
had
considerably
the
start
of
the
pequod's
keels
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
eight
whales
*punct* ,
an
average
pod
*punct* .
*break*
aware
of
their
danger
*punct* ,
they
were
going
all
abreast
with
great
speed
straight
before
the
wind
*punct* ,
rubbing
their
flanks
as
closely
as
so
many
spans
of
horses
in
harness
*punct* .
*break*
full
in
this
rapid
wake
*punct* ,
and
many
fathoms
in
the
rear
*punct* ,
swam
a
huge
*punct* ,
humped
old
bull
*punct* ,
which
by
his
comparatively
slow
progress
*punct* ,
as
well
as
by
the
unusual
yellowish
incrustations
overgrowing
him
*punct* ,
seemed
afflicted
with
the
jaundice
*punct* ,
or
some
other
infirmity
*punct* .
*break*
whether
this
whale
belonged
to
the
pod
in
advance
*punct* ,
seemed
questionable
*punct* ;
for
it
is
not
customary
for
such
venerable
leviathans
to
be
at
all
social
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
he
stuck
to
their
wake
*punct* ,
though
indeed
their
back
water
must
have
retarded
him
*punct* ,
because
the
white-bone
or
swell
at
his
broad
muzzle
was
a
dashed
one
*punct* ,
like
the
swell
formed
when
two
hostile
currents
meet
*punct* .
*break*
his
spout
was
short
*punct* ,
slow
*punct* ,
and
laborious
*punct* ;
coming
forth
with
a
choking
sort
of
gush
*punct* ,
and
spending
itself
in
torn
shreds
*punct* ,
followed
by
strange
subterranean
commotions
in
him
*punct* ,
which
seemed
to
have
egress
at
his
other
buried
extremity
*punct* ,
causing
the
waters
behind
him
to
upbubble
*punct* .
*break*
who's
got
some
paregoric
*punct* ?
*break*
said
stubb

*break*

it

this

heave
his

now

partly
turning
over
on

cumbrous
rib-ends

expose

have
him
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
juncture
*punct* ,
the
pequod's
keel
had
shot
by
the
three
german
boats
last
lowered
*punct* ;
but
from
the
great
start
he
had
had
*punct* ,
derick's
boat
still
led
the
chase
*punct* ,
though
every
moment
neared
by
his
foreign
rivals
*punct* .
*break*
the
only
thing
they
feared
*punct* ,
was
*punct* ,
that
from
being
already
so
nigh
to
his
mark
*punct* ,
he
would
be
enabled
to
dart
his
iron
before
they
could
completely
overtake
and
pass
him
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
derick
*punct* ,
he
seemed
quite
confident
that
this
would
be
the
case
*punct* ,
and
occasionally
with
a
deriding
gesture
shook
his
lamp-feeder
at
the
other
boats
*punct* .
*break*
the
ungracious
and
ungrateful
dog
*punct* !
*break*
cried
starbuck
*punct* ;
he
mocks
and
dares
me
with
the
very
poor-box
i
filled
for
him
not
five
minutes
ago!
*punct* ,
then
in
his
old
intense
whisper
*punct* ,
give

*punct* !
*break*

cried
stubb
to

*punct* ,
it's

we're
becalmed

*punct* ,
what's
that
yarman
about
now
*punct* ?
*break*
at
this
moment
derick
was
in
the
act
of
pitching
his
lamp-feeder
at
the
advancing
boats
*punct* ,
and
also
his
oil-can
*punct* ;
perhaps
with
the
double
view
of
retarding
his
rivals
way
*punct* ,
and
at
the
same
time
economically
accelerating
his
own
by
the
momentary
impetus
of
the
backward
toss
*punct* .
*break*
the
unmannerly
dutch
dogger
*punct* !
*break*
what
d'ye
say
*punct* ,
tashtego
*punct* ;
are
you
the
man
to
snap
your
spine
in
two-and-twenty
pieces
for
the
honor
of
old
gay-head
*punct* ?
*break*
what
d'ye
say
*punct* ?
*break*
i
say
*punct* ,
pull
like
god-dam,
*punct* ,
cried
the
indian
*punct* .
*break*
fiercely
*punct* ,
but
evenly
incited
by
the
taunts
of
the
german
*punct* ,
the
pequod's
three
boats
now
began
ranging
almost
abreast
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
so
disposed
*punct* ,
momentarily
neared
him
*punct* .
*break*
in
that
fine
*punct* ,
loose
*punct* ,
chivalrous
attitude
of
the
headsman
when
drawing
near
to
his
prey
*punct* ,
the
three
mates
stood
up
proudly
*punct* ,
occasionally
backing
the
after
oarsman
with
an
exhilarating
cry
of
*punct* ,
there
she
slides
*punct* ,
now
*punct* !
*break*
hurrah
for
the
white-ash
breeze
*punct* !
*break*
down
with
the
yarman
*punct* !
*break*
sail
over
him
*punct* !
*break*
but
so
decided
an
original
start
had
derick
had
*punct* ,
that
spite
of
all
their
gallantry
*punct* ,
he
would
have
proved
the
victor
in
this
race
*punct* ,
had
not
a
righteous
judgment
descended
upon
him
in
a
crab
which
caught
the
blade
of
his
midship
oarsman
*punct* .
*break*
while
this
clumsy
lubber
was
striving
to
free
his
white-ash
*punct* ,
and
while
*punct* ,
in
consequence
*punct* ,
derick's
boat
was
nigh
to
capsizing
*punct* ,
and
he
thundering
away
at
his
men
in
a
mighty
rage;
*punct* ,
that
was
a
good
time
for
starbuck
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ,
and
flask
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
shout
*punct* ,
they
took
a
mortal
start
forwards
*punct* ,
and
slantingly
ranged
up
on
the
german's
quarter
*punct* .
*break*
an
instant
more
*punct* ,
and
all
four
boats
were
diagonically
in
the
whale's
immediate
wake
*punct* ,
while
stretching
from
them
*punct* ,
on
both
sides
*punct* ,
was
the
foaming
swell
that
he
made
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
terrific
*punct* ,
most
pitiable
*punct* ,
and
maddening
sight
*punct* .
*break*
the
whale
was
now
going
head
out
*punct* ,
and
sending
his
spout
before
him
in
a
continual
tormented
jet
*punct* ;
while
his
one
poor
fin
beat
his
side
in
an
agony
of
fright
*punct* .
*break*
now
to
this
hand
*punct* ,
now
to
that
*punct* ,
he
yawed
in
his
faltering
flight
*punct* ,
and
still
at
every
billow
that
he
broke
*punct* ,
he
spasmodically
sank
in
the
sea
*punct* ,
or
sideways
rolled
towards
the
sky
his
one
beating
fin
*punct* .
*break*
so
have
i
seen
a
bird
with
clipped
wing
*punct* ,
making
affrighted
broken
circles
in
the
air
*punct* ,
vainly
striving
to
escape
the
piratical
hawks
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
now
that
but
a
very
few
moments
more
would
give
the
pequod's
boats
the
advantage
*punct* ,
and
rather
than
be
thus
foiled
of
his
game
*punct* ,
derick
chose
to
hazard
what
to
him
must
have
seemed
a
most
unusually
long
dart
*punct* ,
ere
the
last
chance
would
for
ever
escape
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
sooner
did
his
harpooneer
stand
up
for
the
stroke
*punct* ,
than
all
three
tigers
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
tashtego
*punct* ,
daggoo
*punct* ,
instinctively
sprang
to
their
feet
*punct* ,
and
standing
in
a
diagonal
row
*punct* ,
simultaneously
pointed
their
barbs
*punct* ;
and
darted
over
the
head
of
the
german
harpooneer
*punct* ,
their
three
nantucket
irons
entered
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
blinding
vapors
of
foam
and
white-fire
*punct* !
*break*
the
three
boats
*punct* ,
in
the
first
fury
of
the
whale's
headlong
rush
*punct* ,
bumped
the
german's
aside
with
such
force
*punct* ,
that
both
derick
and
his
baffled
harpooneer
were
spilled
out
*punct* ,
and
sailed
over
by
the
three
flying
keels
*punct* .
*break*
don't
be
afraid
*punct* ,
my
butter-boxes
*punct* ,
cried
stubb
*punct* ,
casting
a
passing
glance
upon
them
as
he
shot
by
*punct* ;
ye'll
be
picked
up
presently
*punct* ,
all
right
*punct* ,
i
saw
some
sharks
astern
*punct* ,
st
*punct* .
*break*
bernard's
dogs
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
relieve
distressed
travellers
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
the
way
to
sail
now
*punct* .
*break*
every
keel
a
sun-beam
*punct* !
*break*
hurrah!
*punct* ,
here
we
go
like
three
tin
kettles
at
the
tail
of
a
mad
cougar
*punct* !
*break*
this
puts
me
in
mind
of
fastening
to
an
elephant
in
a
tilbury
on
a
plain
*punct* ,
makes
the
wheel-spokes
fly
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* ,
when
you
fasten
to
him
that
way
*punct* ;
and
there's
danger
of
being
pitched
out
too
*punct* ,
when
you
strike
a
hill
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
the
way
a
fellow
feels
when
he's
going
to
davy
jones
*punct* ,
all
a
rush
down
an
endless
inclined
plane
*punct* !
*break*
this
whale
carries
the
everlasting
mail
*punct* !
*break*
but
the
monster's
run
was
a
brief
one
*punct* .
*break*
giving
a
sudden
gasp
*punct* ,
he
tumultuously
sounded
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
whale
soon
ceasing
to
sound
*punct* ,
for
some
time
they
remained
in
that
attitude
*punct* ,
fearful
of
expending
more
line
*punct* ,
though
the
position
was
a
little
ticklish
*punct* .
*break*
but
though
boats
have
been
taken
down
and
lost
in
this
way
*punct* ,
yet
it
is
this
holding
on
*punct* ,
as
it
is
called
*punct* ;
this
hooking
up
by
the
sharp
barbs
of
his
live
flesh
from
the
back
*punct* ;
this
it
is
that
often
torments
the
leviathan
into
soon
rising
again
to
meet
the
sharp
lance
of
his
foes
*punct* .
*break*
yet
not
to
speak
of
the
peril
of
the
thing
*punct* ,
it
is
to
be
doubted
whether
this
course
is
always
the
best
*punct* ;
for
it
is
but
reasonable
to
presume
*punct* ,
that
the
longer
the
stricken
whale
stays
under
water
*punct* ,
the
more
he
is
exhausted
*punct* .
*break*
because
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
enormous
surface
of
him
*punct* ,
in
a
full
grown
sperm
whale
something
less
than
square
feet
*punct* ,
the
pressure
of
the
water
is
immense
*punct* .
*break*
we
all
know
what
an
astonishing
atmospheric
weight
we
ourselves
stand
up
under
*punct* ;
even
here
*punct* ,
above-ground
*punct* ,
in
the
air
*punct* ;
how
vast
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
the
burden
of
a
whale
*punct* ,
bearing
on
his
back
a
column
of
two
hundred
fathoms
of
ocean
*punct* !
*break*
it
must
at
least
equal
the
weight
of
fifty
atmospheres
*punct* .
*break*
one
whaleman
has
estimated
it
at
the
weight
of
twenty
line-of-battle
ships
*punct* ,
with
all
their
guns
*punct* ,
and
stores
*punct* ,
and
men
on
board
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
three
boats
lay
there
on
that
gently
rolling
sea
*punct* ,
gazing
down
into
its
eternal
blue
noon
*punct* ;
and
as
not
a
single
groan
or
cry
of
any
sort
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
not
so
much
as
a
ripple
or
a
bubble
came
up
from
its
depths
*punct* ;
what
landsman
would
have
thought
*punct* ,
that
beneath
all
that
silence
and
placidity
*punct* ,
the
utmost
monster
of
the
seas
was
writhing
and
wrenching
in
agony
*punct* !
*break*
not
eight
inches
of
perpendicular
rope
were
visible
at
the
bows
*punct* .
*break*
seems
it
credible
that
by
three
such
thin
threads
the
great
leviathan
was
suspended
like
the
big
weight
to
an
eight
day
clock
*punct* .
*break*
and
to
what
*punct* ?
*break*
to
three
bits
of
board
*punct* .
*break*
is
this
the
creature
of
whom
it
was
once
so
triumphantly
said
*punct* ,
canst
thou
fill
his
skin
with
barbed
irons
*punct* ?
*break*
or
his
head
with
fish-spears
*punct* ?
*break*
the
sword
of
him
that
layeth
at
him
cannot
hold
*punct* ,
the
spear
*punct* ,
the
dart
*punct* ,
nor
the
habergeon
*punct* :
he
esteemeth
iron
as
straw
*punct* ;
the
arrow
cannot
make
him
flee
*punct* ;
darts
are
counted
as
stubble
*punct* ;
he
laugheth
at
the
shaking
of
a
spear
*punct* !
*break*
this
the
creature
*punct* ?
*break*
for
with
the
strength
of
a
thousand
thighs
in
his
tail
*punct* ,
leviathan
had
run
his
head
under
the
mountains
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
to
hide
him
from
the
pequod's
fish-spears
*punct* !
*break*
in
that
sloping
afternoon
sunlight
*punct* ,
the
shadows
that
the
three
boats
sent
down
beneath
the
surface
*punct* ,
must
have
been
long
enough
and
broad
enough
to
shade
half
xerxes
army
*punct* .
*break*
who
can
tell
how
appalling
to
the
wounded
whale
must
have
been
such
huge
phantoms
flitting
over
his
head
*punct* !
*break*
stand
by
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ;
he
stirs
*punct* ,
cried
starbuck
*punct* ,
as
the
three
lines
suddenly
vibrated
in
the
water
*punct* ,
distinctly
conducting
upwards
to
them
*punct* ,
as
by
magnetic
wires
*punct* ,
the
life
and
death
throbs
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
so
that
every
oarsman
felt
them
in
his
seat
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
moment
*punct* ,
relieved
in
a
great
part
from
the
downward
strain
at
the
bows
*punct* ,
the
boats
gave
a
sudden
bounce
upwards
*punct* ,
as
a
small
ice-field
will
*punct* ,
when
a
dense
herd
of
white
bears
are
scared
from
it
into
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
cried
starbuck
again
*punct* ;
he's
rising
*punct* .
*break*
the
lines
*punct* ,
of
which
*punct* ,
hardly
an
instant
before
*punct* ,
not
one
hand's
breadth
could
have
been
gained
*punct* ,
were
now
in
long
quick
coils
flung
back
all
dripping
into
the
boats
*punct* ,
and
soon
the
whale
broke
water
within
two
ship's
lengths
of
the
hunters
*punct* .
*break*
his
motions
plainly
denoted
his
extreme
exhaustion
*punct* .
*break*
in
most
land
animals
there
are
certain
valves
or
flood-gates
in
many
of
their
veins
*punct* ,
whereby
when
wounded
*punct* ,
the
blood
is
in
some
degree
at
least
instantly
shut
off
in
certain
directions
*punct* .
*break*
not
so
with
the
whale
*punct* ;
one
of
whose
peculiarities
it
is
*punct* ,
to
have
an
entire
nonvalvular
structure
of
the
blood-vessels
*punct* ,
so
that
when
pierced
even
by
so
small
a
point
as
a
harpoon
*punct* ,
a
deadly
drain
is
at
once
begun
upon
his
whole
arterial
system
*punct* ;
and
when
this
is
heightened
by
the
extraordinary
pressure
of
water
at
a
great
distance
below
the
surface
*punct* ,
his
life
may
be
said
to
pour
from
him
in
incessant
streams
*punct* .
*break*
yet
so
vast
is
the
quantity
of
blood
in
him
*punct* ,
and
so
distant
and
numerous
its
interior
fountains
*punct* ,
that
he
will
keep
thus
bleeding
and
bleeding
for
a
considerable
period
*punct* ;
even
as
in
a
drought
a
river
will
flow
*punct* ,
whose
source
is
in
the
well-springs
of
far-off
and
undiscernible
hills
*punct* .
*break*
from
this
last
vent
no
blood
yet
came
*punct* ,
because
no
vital
part
of
him
had
thus
far
been
struck
*punct* .
*break*
his
life
*punct* ,
as
they
significantly
call
it
*punct* ,
was
untouched
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
boats
now
more
closely
surrounded
him
*punct* ,
the
whole
upper
part
of
his
form
*punct* ,
with
much
of
it
that
is
ordinarily
submerged
*punct* ,
was
plainly
revealed
*punct* .
*break*
his
eyes
*punct* ,
or
rather
the
places
where
his
eyes
had
been
*punct* ,
were
beheld
*punct* .
*break*
as
strange
misgrown
masses
gather
in
the
knot-holes
of
the
noblest
oaks
when
prostrate
*punct* ,
so
from
the
points
which
the
whale's
eyes
had
once
occupied
*punct* ,
now
protruded
blind
bulbs
*punct* ,
horribly
pitiable
to
see
*punct* .
*break*
but
pity
there
was
none
*punct* .
*break*
for
all
his
old
age
*punct* ,
and
his
one
arm
*punct* ,
and
his
blind
eyes
*punct* ,
he
must
die
the
death
and
be
murdered
*punct* ,
in
order
to
light
the
gay
bridals
and
other
merry-makings
of
men
*punct* ,
and
also
to
illuminate
the
solemn
churches
that
preach
unconditional
inoffensiveness
by
all
to
all
*punct* .
*break*
still
rolling
in
his
blood
*punct* ,
at
last
he
partially
disclosed
a
strangely
discolored
bunch
or
protuberance
*punct* ,
the
size
of
a
bushel
*punct* ,
low
down
on
the
flank
*punct* .
*break*
a
nice
spot
*punct* ,
cried
flask
*punct* ;
just
let
me
prick
him
there
once
*punct* .
*break*
cried
starbuck
*punct* ,
there's
no
need
of
that
*punct* !
*break*
but
humane
starbuck
was
too
late
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
instant
of
the
dart
an
ulcerous
jet
shot
from
this
cruel
wound
*punct* ,
and
goaded
by
it
into
more
than
sufferable
anguish
*punct* ,
the
whale
now
spouting
thick
blood
*punct* ,
with
swift
fury
blindly
darted
at
the
craft
*punct* ,
bespattering
them
and
their
glorying
crews
all
over
with
showers
of
gore
*punct* ,
capsizing
flask's
boat
and
marring
the
bows
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
his
death
stroke
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
by
this
time
*punct* ,
so
spent
was
he
by
loss
of
blood
*punct* ,
that
he
helplessly
rolled
away
from
the
wreck
he
had
made
*punct* ;
lay
panting
on
his
side
*punct* ,
impotently
flapped
with
his
stumped
fin
*punct* ,
then
over
and
over
slowly
revolved
like
a
waning
world
*punct* ;
turned
up
the
white
secrets
of
his
belly
*punct* ;
lay
like
a
log
*punct* ,
and
died
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
most
piteous
*punct* ,
that
last
expiring
spout
*punct* .
*break*
immediately
*punct* ,
by
starbuck's
orders
*punct* ,
lines
were
secured
to
it
at
different
points
*punct* ,
so
that
ere
long
every
boat
was
a
buoy
*punct* ;
the
sunken
whale
being
suspended
a
few
inches
beneath
them
by
the
cords
*punct* .
*break*
by
very
heedful
management
*punct* ,
when
the
ship
drew
nigh
*punct* ,
the
whale
was
transferred
to
her
side
*punct* ,
and
was
strongly
secured
there
by
the
stiffest
fluke-chains
*punct* ,
for
it
was
plain
that
unless
artificially
upheld
*punct* ,
the
body
would
at
once
sink
to
the
bottom
*punct* .
*break*
it
so
chanced
that
almost
upon
first
cutting
into
him
with
the
spade
*punct* ,
the
entire
length
of
a
corroded
harpoon
was
found
imbedded
in
his
flesh
*punct* ,
on
the
lower
part
of
the
bunch
before
described
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
the
stumps
of
harpoons
are
frequently
found
in
the
dead
bodies
of
captured
whales
*punct* ,
with
the
flesh
perfectly
healed
around
them
*punct* ,
and
no
prominence
of
any
kind
to
denote
their
place
*punct* ;
therefore
*punct* ,
there
must
needs
have
been
some
other
unknown
reason
in
the
present
case
fully
to
account
for
the
ulceration
alluded
to
*punct* .
*break*
but
still
more
curious
was
the
fact
of
a
lance-head
of
stone
being
found
in
him
*punct* ,
not
far
from
the
buried
iron
*punct* ,
the
flesh
perfectly
firm
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
who
had
darted
that
stone
lance
*punct* ?
*break*
it
might
have
been
darted
by
some
nor
west
indian
long
before
america
was
discovered
*punct* .
*break*
what
other
marvels
might
have
been
rummaged
out
of
this
monstrous
cabinet
there
is
no
telling
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
sudden
stop
was
put
to
further
discoveries
*punct* ,
by
the
ship's
being
unprecedentedly
dragged
over
sideways
to
the
sea
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
body's
immensely
increasing
tendency
to
sink
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* ,
who
had
the
ordering
of
affairs
*punct* ,
hung
on
to
it
to
the
last
*punct* ;
hung
on
to
it
so
resolutely
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
that
when
at
length
the
ship
would
have
been
capsized
*punct* ,
if
still
persisting
in
locking
arms
with
the
body
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
when
the
command
was
given
to
break
clear
from
it
*punct* ,
such
was
the
immovable
strain
upon
the
timber-heads
to
which
the
fluke-chains
and
cables
were
fastened
*punct* ,
that
it
was
impossible
to
cast
them
off
*punct* .
*break*
meantime
everything
in
the
pequod
was
aslant
*punct* .
*break*
to
cross
to
the
other
side
of
the
deck
was
like
walking
up
the
steep
gabled
roof
of
a
house
*punct* .
*break*
the
ship
groaned
and
gasped
*punct* .
*break*
many
of
the
ivory
inlayings
of
her
bulwarks
and
cabins
were
started
from
their
places
*punct* ,
by
the
unnatural
dislocation
*punct* .
*break*
hold
on
*punct* ,
hold
on
*punct* ,
won't
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
stubb
to
the
body
*punct* ,
don't
be
in
such
a
devil
of
a
hurry
to
sink
*punct* !
*break*
by
thunder
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
we
must
do
something
or
go
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
no
use
prying
there
*punct* ;
avast
*punct* ,
i
say
with
your
handspikes
*punct* ,
and
run
one
of
ye
for
a
prayer
book
and
a
pen-knife
*punct* ,
and
cut
the
big
chains
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
cried
queequeg
*punct* ,
and
seizing
the
carpenter's
heavy
hatchet
*punct* ,
he
leaned
out
of
a
porthole
*punct* ,
and
steel
to
iron
*punct* ,
began
slashing
at
the
largest
fluke-chains
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
few
strokes
*punct* ,
full
of
sparks
*punct* ,
were
given
*punct* ,
when
the
exceeding
strain
effected
the
rest
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
terrific
snap
*punct* ,
every
fastening
went
adrift
*punct* ;
the
ship
righted
*punct* ,
the
carcase
sank
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
this
occasional
inevitable
sinking
of
the
recently
killed
sperm
whale
is
a
very
curious
thing
*punct* ;
nor
has
any
fisherman
yet
adequately
accounted
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
usually
the
dead
sperm
whale
floats
with
great
buoyancy
*punct* ,
with
its
side
or
belly
considerably
elevated
above
the
surface
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
only
whales
that
thus
sank
were
old
*punct* ,
meagre
*punct* ,
and
broken-hearted
creatures
*punct* ,
their
pads
of
lard
diminished
and
all
their
bones
heavy
and
rheumatic
*punct* ;
then
you
might
with
some
reason
assert
that
this
sinking
is
caused
by
an
uncommon
specific
gravity
in
the
fish
so
sinking
*punct* ,
consequent
upon
this
absence
of
buoyant
matter
in
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
not
so
*punct* .
*break*
for
young
whales
*punct* ,
in
the
highest
health
*punct* ,
and
swelling
with
noble
aspirations
*punct* ,
prematurely
cut
off
in
the
warm
flush
and
may
of
life
*punct* ,
with
all
their
panting
lard
about
them
*punct* ;
even
these
brawny
*punct* ,
buoyant
heroes
do
sometimes
sink
*punct* .
*break*
be
it
said
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
that
the
sperm
whale
is
far
less
liable
to
this
accident
than
any
other
species
*punct* .
*break*
where
one
of
that
sort
go
down
*punct* ,
twenty
right
whales
do
*punct* .
*break*
this
difference
in
the
species
is
no
doubt
imputable
in
no
small
degree
to
the
greater
quantity
of
bone
in
the
right
whale
*punct* ;
his
venetian
blinds
alone
sometimes
weighing
more
than
a
ton
*punct* ;
from
this
incumbrance
the
sperm
whale
is
wholly
free
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
reason
of
this
is
obvious
*punct* .
*break*
gases
are
generated
in
him
*punct* ;
he
swells
to
a
prodigious
magnitude
*punct* ;
becomes
a
sort
of
animal
balloon
*punct* .
*break*
a
line-of-battle
ship
could
hardly
keep
him
under
then
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
shore
whaling
*punct* ,
on
soundings
*punct* ,
among
the
bays
of
new
zealand
*punct* ,
when
a
right
whale
gives
token
of
sinking
*punct* ,
they
fasten
buoys
to
him
*punct* ,
with
plenty
of
rope
*punct* ;
so
that
when
the
body
has
gone
down
*punct* ,
they
know
where
to
look
for
it
when
it
shall
have
ascended
again
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
long
after
the
sinking
of
the
body
that
a
cry
was
heard
from
the
pequod's
mast-heads
*punct* ,
announcing
that
the
jungfrau
was
again
lowering
her
boats
*punct* ;
though
the
only
spout
in
sight
was
that
of
a
fin-back
*punct* ,
belonging
to
the
species
of
uncapturable
whales
*punct* ,
because
of
its
incredible
power
of
swimming
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
the
fin-back's
spout
is
so
similar
to
the
sperm
whale's
*punct* ,
that
by
unskilful
fishermen
it
is
often
mistaken
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
consequently
derick
and
all
his
host
were
now
in
valiant
chase
of
this
unnearable
brute
*punct* .
*break*
the
virgin
crowding
all
sail
*punct* ,
made
after
her
four
young
keels
*punct* ,
and
thus
they
all
disappeared
far
to
leeward
*punct* ,
still
in
bold
*punct* ,
hopeful
chase
*punct* .
*break*
the
gallant
perseus
*punct* ,
a
son
of
jupiter
*punct* ,
was
the
first
whaleman
*punct* ;
and
to
the
eternal
honor
of
our
calling
be
it
said
*punct* ,
that
the
first
whale
attacked
by
our
brotherhood
was
not
killed
with
any
sordid
intent
*punct* .
*break*
those
were
the
knightly
days
of
our
profession
*punct* ,
when
we
only
bore
arms
to
succor
the
distressed
*punct* ,
and
not
to
fill
men's
lamp-feeders
*punct* .
*break*
every
one
knows
the
fine
story
of
perseus
and
andromeda
*punct* ;
how
the
lovely
andromeda
*punct* ,
the
daughter
of
a
king
*punct* ,
was
tied
to
a
rock
on
the
sea-coast
*punct* ,
and
as
leviathan
was
in
the
very
act
of
carrying
her
off
*punct* ,
perseus
*punct* ,
the
prince
of
whalemen
*punct* ,
intrepidly
advancing
*punct* ,
harpooned
the
monster
*punct* ,
and
delivered
and
married
the
maid
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
an
admirable
artistic
exploit
*punct* ,
rarely
achieved
by
the
best
harpooneers
of
the
present
day
*punct* ;
inasmuch
as
this
leviathan
was
slain
at
the
very
first
dart
*punct* .
*break*
and
let
no
man
doubt
this
arkite
story
*punct* ;
for
in
the
ancient
joppa
*punct* ,
now
jaffa
*punct* ,
on
the
syrian
coast
*punct* ,
in
one
of
the
pagan
temples
*punct* ,
there
stood
for
many
ages
the
vast
skeleton
of
a
whale
*punct* ,
which
the
city's
legends
and
all
the
inhabitants
asserted
to
be
the
identical
bones
of
the
monster
that
perseus
slew
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
romans
took
joppa
*punct* ,
the
same
skeleton
was
carried
to
italy
in
triumph
*punct* .
*break*
what
seems
most
singular
and
suggestively
important
in
this
story
*punct* ,
is
this
*punct* :
it
was
from
joppa
that
jonah
set
sail
*punct* .
*break*
akin
to
the
adventure
of
perseus
and
andromeda
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
by
some
supposed
to
be
indirectly
derived
from
it
*punct* ,
is
that
famous
story
of
st
*punct* .
*break*
george
and
the
dragon
*punct* ;
which
dragon
i
maintain
to
have
been
a
whale
*punct* ;
for
in
many
old
chronicles
whales
and
dragons
are
strangely
jumbled
together
*punct* ,
and
often
stand
for
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
thou
art
as
a
lion
of
the
waters
*punct* ,
and
as
a
dragon
of

hereby

plainly
meaning

in
truth

versions
of
the

use

large
seal

bearing
all
this

it
will
not
appear
altogether
incompatible
with
the
sacred
legend
and
the
ancientest
draughts
of
the
scene
*punct* ,
to
hold

so-called
dragon
no
other

the
great
leviathan
himself
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
placed
before
the
strict
and
piercing
truth

this
whole
story
will
fare
like

that

that

swallowed
down

thrown
up
by

*punct* ;
still
*punct* ,
whether
that
strictly
makes
a
whaleman
of
him
*punct* ,
that
might
be
mooted
*punct* .
*break*
it
nowhere
appears
that
he
ever
actually
harpooned
his

*punct* ,
unless
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
from
the
inside
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
he
may
be
deemed
a
sort
of
involuntary
whaleman
*punct* ;
at
any

the
whale
caught
him
*punct* ,
if
he

i
claim

*punct* ,
by
the

this
grecian

is
considered
to
be
derived
from
the
still
more
ancient
hebrew
story

vishnoo
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
by
the
first
of
his
ten
earthly
incarnations
*punct* ,
has
for
ever
set
apart
and
sanctified
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
when
brahma
*punct* ,
or
the
god
of
gods
*punct* ,
saith
the
shaster
*punct* ,
resolved
to
recreate
the
world
after
one
of
its
periodical
dissolutions
*punct* ,
he
gave
birth
to
vishnoo
*punct* ,
to
preside
over
the
work
*punct* ;
but
the
vedas
*punct* ,
or
mystical
books
*punct* ,
whose
perusal
would
seem
to
have
been
indispensable
to
vishnoo
before
beginning
the
creation
*punct* ,
and
which
therefore
must
have
contained
something
in
the
shape
of
practical
hints
to
young
architects
*punct* ,
these
vedas
were
lying
at
the
bottom
of
the
waters
*punct* ;
so
vishnoo
became
incarnate
in
a
whale
*punct* ,
and
sounding
down
in
him
to
the
uttermost
depths
*punct* ,
rescued
the
sacred
volumes
*punct* .
*break*
was
not
this
vishnoo
a
whaleman
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ?
*break*
even
as
a
man
who
rides
a

is
called
a
horseman
*punct* ?
*break*
perseus
*punct* ,
st

*break*
george
*punct* ,
hercules
*punct* ,
jonah
*punct* ,
and
vishnoo
*punct* !
*break*
there's
a
member-roll
for
you
*punct* !
*break*
what
club
but
the
whaleman's
can
head
off
like
that
*punct* ?
*break*
now
some
nantucketers
rather
distrust
this
historical
story
of
jonah
and
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
one
old
sag-harbor
whaleman's
chief
reason
for
questioning
the
hebrew
story
was
this:
*punct* ,
he
had
one
of
those
quaint
old-fashioned
bibles
*punct* ,
embellished
with
curious
*punct* ,
unscientific
plates
*punct* ;
one
of
which
represented
jonah's
whale
with
two
spouts
in
his
head
*punct* ,
a
peculiarity
only
true
with
respect
to
a
species
of
the
leviathan
*punct* ,
the
right
whale
*punct* ,
and
the
varieties
of
that
order
*punct* ,
concerning
which
the
fishermen
have
this
saying
*punct* ,
a
penny
roll
would
choke
him
*punct* ;
his
swallow
is
so
very
small
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
to
this
*punct* ,
bishop
jebb's
anticipative
answer
is
ready
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
necessary
*punct* ,
hints
the
bishop
*punct* ,
that
we
consider
jonah
as
tombed
in
the
whale's
belly
*punct* ,
but
as
temporarily
lodged
in
some
part
of
his
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
seems
reasonable
enough
in
the
good
bishop
*punct* .
*break*
for
truly
*punct* ,
the
right
whale's
mouth
would
accommodate
a
couple
of
whist
tables
*punct* ,
and
comfortably
seat
all
the
players
*punct* .
*break*
possibly
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
jonah
might
have
ensconced
himself
in
a
hollow
tooth
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
on
second
thoughts
*punct* ,
the
right
whale
is
toothless
*punct* .
*break*
another
reason
which
sag-harbor
*punct* ,
he
went
by
that
name
*punct* ,
urged
for
his
want
of
faith
in
this
matter
of
the
prophet
*punct* ,
was
something
obscurely
in
reference
to
his
incarcerated
body
and
the
whale's
gastric
juices
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
objection
likewise
falls
to
the
ground
*punct* ,
because
a
german
exegetist
supposes
that
jonah
must
have
taken
refuge
in
the
floating
body
of
a
dead
whale
*punct* ,
even
as
the
french
soldiers
in
the
russian
campaign
turned
their
dead
horses
into
tents
*punct* ,
and
crawled
into
them
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
it
has
been
divined
by
other
continental
commentators
*punct* ,
that
when
jonah
was
thrown
overboard
from
the
joppa
ship
*punct* ,
he
straightway
effected
his
escape
to
another
vessel
near
by
*punct* ,
some
vessel
with
a
whale
for
a
figure-head
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
i
would
add
*punct* ,
possibly
called
the
whale
*punct* ,
as
some
craft
are
nowadays
christened
the
shark
*punct* ,
the
gull
*punct* ,
the
eagle
*punct* .
*break*
nor
have
there
been
wanting
learned
exegetists
who
have
opined
that
the
whale
mentioned
in
the
book
of
jonah
merely
meant
a
life-preserver
*punct* ,
an
inflated
bag
of
wind
*punct* ,
which
the
endangered
prophet
swam
to
*punct* ,
and
so
was
saved
from
a
watery
doom
*punct* .
*break*
poor
sag-harbor
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
seems
worsted
all
round
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
had
still
another
reason
for
his
want
of
faith
*punct* .
*break*
how
is
that
*punct* ?
*break*
but
was
there
no
other
way
for
the
whale
to
land
the
prophet
within
that
short
distance
of
nineveh
*punct* ?
*break*
he
might
have
carried
him
round
by
the
way
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
*punct* .
*break*
but
not
to
speak
of
the
passage
through
the
whole
length
of
the
mediterranean
*punct* ,
and
another
passage
up
the
persian
gulf
and
red
sea
*punct* ,
such
a
supposition
would
involve
the
complete
circumnavigation
of
all
africa
in
three
days
*punct* ,
not
to
speak
of
the
tigris
waters
*punct* ,
near
the
site
of
nineveh
*punct* ,
being
too
shallow
for
any
whale
to
swim
in
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
this
idea
of
jonah's
weathering
the
cape
of
good
hope
at
so
early
a
day
would
wrest
the
honor
of
the
discovery
of
that
great
headland
from
bartholomew
diaz
*punct* ,
its
reputed
discoverer
*punct* ,
and
so
make
modern
history
a
liar
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
these
foolish
arguments
of
old
sag-harbor
only
evinced
his
foolish
pride
of
reason
*punct* ,
a
thing
still
more
reprehensible
in
him
*punct* ,
seeing
that
he
had
but
little
learning
except
what
he
had
picked
up
from
the
sun
and
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
it
only
shows
his
foolish
*punct* ,
impious
pride
*punct* ,
and
abominable
*punct* ,
devilish
rebellion
against
the
reverend
clergy
*punct* .
*break*
for
by
a
portuguese
catholic
priest
*punct* ,
this
very
idea
of
jonah's
going
to
nineveh
via
the
cape
of
good
hope
was
advanced
as
a
signal
magnification
of
the
general
miracle
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
it
was
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
to
this
day
*punct* ,
the
highly
enlightened
turks
devoutly
believe
in
the
historical
story
of
jonah
*punct* .
*break*
nor
is
it
to
be
doubted
that
as
such
a
procedure
can
do
no
harm
*punct* ,
it
may
possibly
be
of
no
contemptible
advantage
*punct* ;
considering
that
oil
and
water
are
hostile
*punct* ;
that
oil
is
a
sliding
thing
*punct* ,
and
that
the
object
in
view
is
to
make
the
boat
slide
bravely
*punct* .
*break*
queequeg
believed
strongly
in
anointing
his
boat
*punct* ,
and
one
morning
not
long
after
the
german
ship
jungfrau
disappeared
*punct* ,
took
more
than
customary
pains
in
that
occupation
*punct* ;
crawling
under
its
bottom
*punct* ,
where
it
hung
over
the
side
*punct* ,
and
rubbing
in
the
unctuousness
as
though
diligently
seeking
to
insure
a
crop
of
hair
from
the
craft's
bald
keel
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
to
be
working
in
obedience
to
some
particular
presentiment
*punct* .
*break*
nor
did
it
remain
unwarranted
by
the
event
*punct* .
*break*
towards
noon
whales
were
raised
*punct* ;
but
so
soon
as
the
ship
sailed
down
to
them
*punct* ,
they
turned
and
fled
with
swift
precipitancy
*punct* ;
a
disordered
flight
*punct* ,
as
of
cleopatra's
barges
from
actium
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
the
boats
pursued
*punct* ,
and
stubb's
was
foremost
*punct* .
*break*
by
great
exertion
*punct* ,
tashtego
at
last
succeeded
in
planting
one
iron
*punct* ;
but
the
stricken
whale
*punct* ,
without
at
all
sounding
*punct* ,
still
continued
his
horizontal
flight
*punct* ,
with
added
fleetness
*punct* .
*break*
such
unintermitted
strainings
upon
the
planted
iron
must
sooner
or
later
inevitably
extract
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
became
imperative
to
lance
the
flying
whale
*punct* ,
or
be
content
to
lose
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
haul
the
boat
up
to
his
flank
was
impossible
*punct* ,
he
swam
so
fast
and
furious
*punct* .
*break*
what
then
remained
*punct* ?
*break*
of
all
the
wondrous
devices
and
dexterities
*punct* ,
the
sleights
of
hand
and
countless
subtleties
*punct* ,
to
which
the
veteran
whaleman
is
so
often
forced
*punct* ,
none
exceed
that
fine
manoeuvre
with
the
lance
called
pitchpoling
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
only
indispensable
with
an
inveterate
running
whale
*punct* ;
its
grand
fact
and
feature
is
the
wonderful
distance
to
which
the
long
lance
is
accurately
darted
from
a
violently
rocking
*punct* ,
jerking
boat
*punct* ,
under
extreme
headway
*punct* .
*break*
steel
and
wood
included
*punct* ,
the
entire
spear
is
some
ten
or
twelve
feet
in
length
*punct* ;
the
staff
is
much
slighter
than
that
of
the
harpoon
*punct* ,
and
also
of
a
lighter
material
*punct* ,
pine
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
furnished
with
a
small
rope
called
a
warp
*punct* ,
of
considerable
length
*punct* ,
by
which
it
can
be
hauled
back
to
the
hand
after
darting
*punct* .
*break*
but
before
going
further
*punct* ,
it
is
important
to
mention
here
*punct* ,
that
though
the
harpoon
may
be
pitchpoled
in
the
same
way
with
the
lance
*punct* ,
yet
it
is
seldom
done
*punct* ;
and
when
done
*punct* ,
is
still
less
frequently
successful
*punct* ,
on
account
of
the
greater
weight
and
inferior
length
of
the
harpoon
as
compared
with
the
lance
*punct* ,
which
in
effect
become
serious
drawbacks
*punct* .
*break*
as
a
general
thing
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
you
must
first
get
fast
to
a
whale
*punct* ,
before
any
pitchpoling
comes
into
play
*punct* .
*break*
look
now
at
stubb
*punct* ;
a
man
who
from
his
humorous
*punct* ,
deliberate
coolness
and
equanimity
in
the
direst
emergencies
*punct* ,
was
specially
qualified
to
excel
in
pitchpoling
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
him
*punct* ;
he
stands
upright
in
the
tossed
bow
of
the
flying
boat
*punct* ;
wrapt
in
fleecy
foam
*punct* ,
the
towing
whale
is
forty
feet
ahead
*punct* .
*break*
handling
the
long
lance
lightly
*punct* ,
glancing
twice
or
thrice
along
its
length
to
see
if
it
be
exactly
straight
*punct* ,
stubb
whistlingly
gathers
up
the
coil
of
the
warp
in
one
hand
*punct* ,
so
as
to
secure
its
free
end
in
his
grasp
*punct* ,
leaving
the
rest
unobstructed
*punct* .
*break*
then
holding
the
lance
full
before
his
waistband's
middle
*punct* ,
he
levels
it
at
the
whale
*punct* ;
when
*punct* ,
covering
him
with
it
*punct* ,
he
steadily
depresses
the
butt-end
in
his
hand
*punct* ,
thereby
elevating
the
point
till
the
weapon
stands
fairly
balanced
upon
his
palm
*punct* ,
fifteen
feet
in
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
he
minds
you
somewhat
of
a
juggler
*punct* ,
balancing
a
long
staff
on
his
chin
*punct* .
*break*
next
moment
with
a
rapid
*punct* ,
nameless
impulse
*punct* ,
in
a
superb
lofty
arch
the
bright
steel
spans
the
foaming
distance
*punct* ,
and
quivers
in
the
life
spot
of
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
instead
of
sparkling
water
*punct* ,
he
now
spouts
red
blood
*punct* .
*break*
that
drove
the
spigot
out
of
him
*punct* !
*break*
tis
july's
immortal
fourth
*punct* ;
all
fountains
must
run
wine
to-day
*punct* !
*break*
then
*punct* ,
tashtego
*punct* ,
lad
*punct* ,
i'd
have
ye
hold
a
canakin
to
the
jet
*punct* ,
and
we'd
drink
round
it
*punct* !
*break*
yea
*punct* ,
verily
*punct* ,
hearts
alive
*punct* ,
we'd
brew
choice
punch
in
the
spread
of
his
spout-hole
there
*punct* ,
and
from
that
live
punch-bowl
quaff
the
living
stuff
*punct* !
*break*
again
and
again
to
such
gamesome
talk
*punct* ,
the
dexterous
dart
is
repeated
*punct* ,
the
spear
returning
to
its
master
like
a
greyhound
held
in
skilful
leash
*punct* .
*break*
m.
of
this
sixteenth
day
of
december
*punct* ,
a
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
it
should
still
remain
a
problem
*punct* ,
whether
these
spoutings
are
*punct* ,
after
all
*punct* ,
really
water
*punct* ,
or
nothing
but
vapor
*punct* ,
this
is
surely
a
noteworthy
thing
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
look
at
this
matter
*punct* ,
along
with
some
interesting
items
contingent
*punct* .
*break*
every
one
knows
that
by
the
peculiar
cunning
of
their
gills
*punct* ,
the
finny
tribes
in
general
breathe
the
air
which
at
all
times
is
combined
with
the
element
in
which
they
swim
*punct* ,
hence
*punct* ,
a
herring
or
a
cod
might
live
a
century
*punct* ,
and
never
once
raise
its
head
above
the
surface
*punct* .
*break*
but
owing
to
his
marked
internal
structure
which
gives
him
regular
lungs
*punct* ,
like
a
human
being's
*punct* ,
the
whale
can
only
live
by
inhaling
the
disengaged
air
in
the
open
atmosphere
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
cannot
in
any
degree
breathe
through
his
mouth
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
in
his
ordinary
attitude
*punct* ,
the
sperm
whale's
mouth
is
buried
at
least
eight
feet
beneath
the
surface
*punct* ;
and
what
is
still
more
*punct* ,
his
windpipe
has
no
connexion
with
his
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
he
breathes
through
his
spiracle
alone
*punct* ;
and
this
is
on
the
top
of
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
say
*punct* ,
that
in
any
creature
breathing
is
only
a
function
indispensable
to
vitality
*punct* ,
inasmuch
as
it
withdraws
from
the
air
a
certain
element
*punct* ,
which
being
subsequently
brought
into
contact
with
the
blood
imparts
to
the
blood
its
vivifying
principle
*punct* ,
i
do
not
think
i
shall
err
*punct* ;
though
i
may
possibly
use
some
superfluous
scientific
words
*punct* .
*break*
assume
it
*punct* ,
and
it
follows
that
if
all
the
blood
in
a
man
could
be
aerated
with
one
breath
*punct* ,
he
might
then
seal
up
his
nostrils
and
not
fetch
another
for
a
considerable
time
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
to
say
*punct* ,
he
would
then
live
without
breathing
*punct* .
*break*
anomalous
as
it
may
seem
*punct* ,
this
is
precisely
the
case
with
the
whale
*punct* ,
who
systematically
lives
*punct* ,
by
intervals
*punct* ,
his
full
hour
and
more
*punct* ,
when
at
the
bottom
*punct* ,
without
drawing
a
single
breath
*punct* ,
or
so
much
as
in
any
way
inhaling
a
particle
of
air
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
remember
*punct* ,
he
has
no
gills
*punct* .
*break*
how
is
this
*punct* ?
*break*
between
his
ribs
and
on
each
side
of
his
spine
he
is
supplied
with
a
remarkable
involved
cretan
labyrinth
of
vermicelli-like
vessels
*punct* ,
which
vessels
*punct* ,
when
he
quits
the
surface
*punct* ,
are
completely
distended
with
oxygenated
blood
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
for
an
hour
or
more
*punct* ,
a
thousand
fathoms
in
the
sea
*punct* ,
he
carries
a
surplus
stock
of
vitality
in
him
*punct* ,
just
as
the
camel
crossing
the
waterless
desert
carries
a
surplus
supply
of
drink
for
future
use
in
its
four
supplementary
stomachs
*punct* .
*break*
the
anatomical
fact
of
this
labyrinth
is
indisputable
*punct* ;
and
that
the
supposition
founded
upon
it
is
reasonable
and
true
*punct* ,
seems
the
more
cogent
to
me
*punct* ,
when
i
consider
the
otherwise
inexplicable
obstinacy
of
that
leviathan
in
having
his
spoutings
out
*punct* ,
as
the
fishermen
phrase
it
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
what
i
mean
*punct* .
*break*
if
unmolested
*punct* ,
upon
rising
to
the
surface
*punct* ,
the
sperm
whale
will
continue
there
for
a
period
of
time
exactly
uniform
with
all
his
other
unmolested
risings
*punct* .
*break*
say
he
stays
eleven
minutes
*punct* ,
and
jets
seventy
times
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
respires
seventy
breaths
*punct* ;
then
whenever
he
rises
again
*punct* ,
he
will
be
sure
to
have
his
seventy
breaths
over
again
*punct* ,
to
a
minute
*punct* .
*break*
and
not
till
those
seventy
breaths
are
told
*punct* ,
will
he
finally
go
down
to
stay
out
his
full
term
below
*punct* .
*break*
remark
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
that
in
different
individuals
these
rates
are
different
*punct* ;
but
in
any
one
they
are
alike
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
why
should
the
whale
thus
insist
upon
having
his
spoutings
out
*punct* ,
unless
it
be
to
replenish
his
reservoir
of
air
*punct* ,
ere
descending
for
good
*punct* ?
*break*
how
obvious
is
it
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
that
this
necessity
for
the
whale's
rising
exposes
him
to
all
the
fatal
hazards
of
the
chase
*punct* .
*break*
for
not
by
hook
or
by
net
could
this
vast
leviathan
be
caught
*punct* ,
when
sailing
a
thousand
fathoms
beneath
the
sunlight
*punct* .
*break*
not
so
much
thy
skill
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
o
hunter
*punct* ,
as
the
great
necessities
that
strike
the
victory
to
thee
*punct* !
*break*
in
man
*punct* ,
breathing
is
incessantly
going
on
*punct* ,
one
breath
only
serving
for
two
or
three
pulsations
*punct* ;
so
that
whatever
other
business
he
has
to
attend
to
*punct* ,
waking
or
sleeping
*punct* ,
breathe
he
must
*punct* ,
or
die
he
will
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
sperm
whale
only
breathes
about
one
seventh
or
sunday
of
his
time
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
been
said
that
the
whale
only
breathes
through
his
spout-hole
*punct* ;
if
it
could
truthfully
be
added
that
his
spouts
are
mixed
with
water
*punct* ,
then
i
opine
we
should
be
furnished
with
the
reason
why
his
sense
of
smell
seems
obliterated
in
him
*punct* ;
for
the
only
thing
about
him
that
at
all
answers
to
his
nose
is
that
identical
spout-hole
*punct* ;
and
being
so
clogged
with
two
elements
*punct* ,
it
could
not
be
expected
to
have
the
power
of
smelling
*punct* .
*break*
but
owing
to
the
mystery
of
the
spout
*punct* ,
whether
it
be
water
or
whether
it
be
vapor
*punct* ,
no
absolute
certainty
can
as
yet
be
arrived
at
on
this
head
*punct* .
*break*
sure
it
is
*punct* ,
nevertheless
*punct* ,
that
the
sperm
whale
has
no
proper
olfactories
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
does
he
want
of
them
*punct* ?
*break*
no
roses
*punct* ,
no
violets
*punct* ,
no
cologne-water
in
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
furthermore
*punct* ,
as
his
windpipe
solely
opens
into
the
tube
of
his
spouting
canal
*punct* ,
and
as
that
long
canal
*punct* ,
like
the
grand
erie
canal
*punct* ,
is
furnished
with
a
sort
of
locks
*punct* ,
that
open
and
shut
*punct* ,
for
the
downward
retention
of
air
or
the
upward
exclusion
of
water
*punct* ,
therefore
the
whale
has
no
voice
*punct* ;
unless
you
insult
him
by
saying
*punct* ,
that
when
he
so
strangely
rumbles
*punct* ,
he
talks
through
his
nose
*punct* .
*break*
but
then
again
*punct* ,
what
has
the
whale
to
say
*punct* ?
*break*
happy
that
the
world
is
such
an
excellent
listener
*punct* !
*break*
now
*punct* ,
the
spouting
canal
of
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
chiefly
intended
as
it
is
for
the
conveyance
of
air
*punct* ,
and
for
several
feet
laid
along
*punct* ,
horizontally
*punct* ,
just
beneath
the
upper
surface
of
his
head
*punct* ,
and
a
little
to
one
side
*punct* ;
this
curious
canal
is
very
much
like
a
gas-pipe
laid
down
in
a
city
on
one
side
of
a
street
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
question
returns
whether
this
gas-pipe
is
also
a
water-pipe
*punct* ;
in
other
words
*punct* ,
whether
the
spout
of
the
sperm
whale
is
the
mere
vapor
of
the
exhaled
breath
*punct* ,
or
whether
that
exhaled
breath
is
mixed
with
water
taken
in
at
the
mouth
*punct* ,
and
discharged
through
the
spiracle
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
certain
that
the
mouth
indirectly
communicates
with
the
spouting
canal
*punct* ;
but
it
cannot
be
proved
that
this
is
for
the
purpose
of
discharging
water
through
the
spiracle
*punct* .
*break*
because
the
greatest
necessity
for
so
doing
would
seem
to
be
*punct* ,
when
in
feeding
he
accidentally
takes
in
water
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
sperm
whale's
food
is
far
beneath
the
surface
*punct* ,
and
there
he
cannot
spout
even
if
he
would
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
if
you
regard
him
very
closely
*punct* ,
and
time
him
with
your
watch
*punct* ,
you
will
find
that
when
unmolested
*punct* ,
there
is
an
undeviating
rhyme
between
the
periods
of
his
jets
and
the
ordinary
periods
of
respiration
*punct* .
*break*
but
why
pester
one
with
all
this
reasoning
on
the
subject
*punct* ?
*break*
you
have
seen
him
spout
*punct* ;
then
declare
what
the
spout
is
*punct* ;
can
you
not
tell
water
from
air
*punct* ?
*break*
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
in
this
world
it
is
not
so
easy
to
settle
these
plain
things
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
ever
found
your
plain
things
the
knottiest
of
all
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
for
this
whale
spout
*punct* ,
you
might
almost
stand
in
it
*punct* ,
and
yet
be
undecided
as
to
what
it
is
precisely
*punct* .
*break*
the
central
body
of
it
is
hidden
in
the
snowy
sparkling
mist
enveloping
it
*punct* ;
and
how
can
you
certainly
tell
whether
any
water
falls
from
it
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
always
*punct* ,
when
you
are
close
enough
to
a
whale
to
get
a
close
view
of
his
spout
*punct* ,
he
is
in
a
prodigious
commotion
*punct* ,
the
water
cascading
all
around
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
at
such
times
you
should
think
that
you
really
perceived
drops
of
moisture
in
the
spout
*punct* ,
how
do
you
know
that
they
are
not
merely
condensed
from
its
vapor
*punct* ;
or
how
do
you
know
that
they
are
not
those
identical
drops
superficially
lodged
in
the
spout-hole
fissure
*punct* ,
which
is
countersunk
into
the
summit
of
the
whale's
head
*punct* ?
*break*
nor
is
it
at
all
prudent
for
the
hunter
to
be
over
curious
touching
the
precise
nature
of
the
whale
spout
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
not
do
for
him
to
be
peering
into
it
*punct* ,
and
putting
his
face
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
you
cannot
go
with
your
pitcher
to
this
fountain
and
fill
it
*punct* ,
and
bring
it
away
*punct* .
*break*
for
even
when
coming
into
slight
contact
with
the
outer
*punct* ,
vapory
shreds
of
the
jet
*punct* ,
which
will
often
happen
*punct* ,
your
skin
will
feverishly
smart
*punct* ,
from
the
acridness
of
the
thing
so
touching
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
know
one
*punct* ,
who
coming
into
still
closer
contact
with
the
spout
*punct* ,
whether
with
some
scientific
object
in
view
*punct* ,
or
otherwise
*punct* ,
i
cannot
say
*punct* ,
the
skin
peeled
off
from
his
cheek
and
arm
*punct* .
*break*
wherefore
*punct* ,
among
whalemen
*punct* ,
the
spout
is
deemed
poisonous
*punct* ;
they
try
to
evade
it
*punct* .
*break*
another
thing
*punct* ;
i
have
heard
it
said
*punct* ,
and
i
do
not
much
doubt
it
*punct* ,
that
if
the
jet
is
fairly
spouted
into
your
eyes
*punct* ,
it
will
blind
you
*punct* .
*break*
the
wisest
thing
the
investigator
can
do
then
*punct* ,
it
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
is
to
let
this
deadly
spout
alone
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
we
can
hypothesize
*punct* ,
even
if
we
cannot
prove
and
establish
*punct* .
*break*
my
hypothesis
is
this
*punct* :
that
the
spout
is
nothing
but
mist
*punct* .
*break*
and
besides
other
reasons
*punct* ,
to
this
conclusion
i
am
impelled
*punct* ,
by
considerations
touching
the
great
inherent
dignity
and
sublimity
of
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ;
i
account
him
no
common
*punct* ,
shallow
being
*punct* ,
inasmuch
as
it
is
an
undisputed
fact
that
he
is
never
found
on
soundings
*punct* ,
or
near
shores
*punct* ;
all
other
whales
sometimes
are
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
both
ponderous
and
profound
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
am
convinced
that
from
the
heads
of
all
ponderous
profound
beings
*punct* ,
such
as
plato
*punct* ,
pyrrho
*punct* ,
the
devil
*punct* ,
jupiter
*punct* ,
dante
*punct* ,
and
so
on
*punct* ,
there
always
goes
up
a
certain
semi-visible
steam
*punct* ,
while
in
the
act
of
thinking
deep
thoughts
*punct* .
*break*
while
composing
a
little
treatise
on
eternity
*punct* ,
i
had
the
curiosity
to
place
a
mirror
before
me
*punct* ;
and
ere
long
saw
reflected
there
*punct* ,
a
curious
involved
worming
and
undulation
in
the
atmosphere
over
my
head
*punct* .
*break*
the
invariable
moisture
of
my
hair
*punct* ,
while
plunged
in
deep
thought
*punct* ,
after
six
cups
of
hot
tea
in
my
thin
shingled
attic
*punct* ,
of
an
august
noon
*punct* ;
this
seems
an
additional
argument
for
the
above
supposition
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
d'ye
see
*punct* ,
rainbows
do
not
visit
the
clear
air
*punct* ;
they
only
irradiate
vapor
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
*punct* ,
through
all
the
thick
mists
of
the
dim
doubts
in
my
mind
*punct* ,
divine
intuitions
now
and
then
shoot
*punct* ,
enkindling
my
fog
with
a
heavenly
ray
*punct* .
*break*
and
for
this
i
thank
god
*punct* ;
for
all
have
doubts
*punct* ;
many
deny
*punct* ;
but
doubts
or
denials
*punct* ,
few
along
with
them
*punct* ,
have
intuitions
*punct* .
*break*
reckoning
the
largest
sized
sperm
whale's
tail
to
begin
at
that
point
of
the
trunk
where
it
tapers
to
about
the
girth
of
a
man
*punct* ,
it
comprises
upon
its
upper
surface
alone
*punct* ,
an
area
of
at
least
fifty
square
feet
*punct* .
*break*
the
compact
round
body
of
its
root
expands
into
two
broad
*punct* ,
firm
*punct* ,
flat
palms
or
flukes
*punct* ,
gradually
shoaling
away
to
less
than
an
inch
in
thickness
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
crotch
or
junction
*punct* ,
these
flukes
slightly
overlap
*punct* ,
then
sideways
recede
from
each
other
like
wings
*punct* ,
leaving
a
wide
vacancy
between
*punct* .
*break*
in
no
living
thing
are
the
lines
of
beauty
more
exquisitely
defined
than
in
the
crescentic
borders
of
these
flukes
*punct* .
*break*
at
its
utmost
expansion
in
the
full
grown
whale
*punct* ,
the
tail
will
considerably
exceed
twenty
feet
across
*punct* .
*break*
the
fibres
in
the
upper
and
lower
layers
*punct* ,
are
long
and
horizontal
*punct* ;
those
of
the
middle
one
*punct* ,
very
short
*punct* ,
and
running
crosswise
between
the
outside
layers
*punct* .
*break*
this
triune
structure
*punct* ,
as
much
as
anything
else
*punct* ,
imparts
power
to
the
tail
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
student
of
old
roman
walls
*punct* ,
the
middle
layer
will
furnish
a
curious
parallel
to
the
thin
course
of
tiles
always
alternating
with
the
stone
in
those
wonderful
relics
of
the
antique
*punct* ,
and
which
undoubtedly
contribute
so
much
to
the
great
strength
of
the
masonry
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
if
this
vast
local
power
in
the
tendinous
tail
were
not
enough
*punct* ,
the
whole
bulk
of
the
leviathan
is
knit
over
with
a
warp
and
woof
of
muscular
fibres
and
filaments
*punct* ,
which
passing
on
either
side
the
loins
and
running
down
into
the
flukes
*punct* ,
insensibly
blend
with
them
*punct* ,
and
largely
contribute
to
their
might
*punct* ;
so
that
in
the
tail
the
confluent
measureless
force
of
the
whole
whale
seems
concentrated
to
a
point
*punct* .
*break*
could
annihilation
occur
to
matter
*punct* ,
this
were
the
thing
to
do
it
*punct* .
*break*
nor
does
this
*punct* ,
its
amazing
strength
*punct* ,
at
all
tend
to
cripple
the
graceful
flexion
of
its
motions
*punct* ;
where
infantileness
of
ease
undulates
through
a
titanism
of
power
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
contrary
*punct* ,
those
motions
derive
their
most
appalling
beauty
from
it
*punct* .
*break*
real
strength
never
impairs
beauty
or
harmony
*punct* ,
but
it
often
bestows
it
*punct* ;
and
in
everything
imposingly
beautiful
*punct* ,
strength
has
much
to
do
with
the
magic
*punct* .
*break*
take
away
the
tied
tendons
that
all
over
seem
bursting
from
the
marble
in
the
carved
hercules
*punct* ,
and
its
charm
would
be
gone
*punct* .
*break*
as
devout
eckerman
lifted
the
linen
sheet
from
the
naked
corpse
of
goethe
*punct* ,
he
was
overwhelmed
with
the
massive
chest
of
the
man
*punct* ,
that
seemed
as
a
roman
triumphal
arch
*punct* .
*break*
when
angelo
paints
even
god
the
father
in
human
form
*punct* ,
mark
what
robustness
is
there
*punct* .
*break*
and
whatever
they
may
reveal
of
the
divine
love
in
the
son
*punct* ,
the
soft
*punct* ,
curled
*punct* ,
hermaphroditical
italian
pictures
*punct* ,
in
which
his
idea
has
been
most
successfully
embodied
*punct* ;
these
pictures
*punct* ,
so
destitute
as
they
are
of
all
brawniness
*punct* ,
hint
nothing
of
any
power
*punct* ,
but
the
mere
negative
*punct* ,
feminine
one
of
submission
and
endurance
*punct* ,
which
on

hands

conceded
*punct* ,
form
the
peculiar
practical
virtues
of
his
teachings
*punct* .
*break*
therein
no
fairy's
arm
can
transcend
it
*punct* .
*break*
five
great
motions
are
peculiar
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
first
*punct* ,
when
used
as
a
fin
for
progression
*punct* ;
second
*punct* ,
when
used
as
a
mace
in
battle
*punct* ;
third
*punct* ,
in
sweeping
*punct* ;
fourth
*punct* ,
in
lobtailing
*punct* ;
fifth
*punct* ,
in
peaking
flukes
*punct* .
*break*
first
*punct* :
being
horizontal
in
its
position
*punct* ,
the
leviathan's
tail
acts
in
a
different
manner
from
the
tails
of
all
other
sea
creatures
*punct* .
*break*
it
never
wriggles
*punct* .
*break*
in
man
or
fish
*punct* ,
wriggling
is
a
sign
of
inferiority
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
whale
*punct* ,
his
tail
is
the
sole
means
of
propulsion
*punct* .
*break*
scroll-wise
coiled
forwards
beneath
the
body
*punct* ,
and
then
rapidly
sprung
backwards
*punct* ,
it
is
this
which
gives
that
singular
darting
*punct* ,
leaping
motion
to
the
monster
when
furiously
swimming
*punct* .
*break*
his
side-fins
only
serve
to
steer
by
*punct* .
*break*
second
*punct* :
it
is
a
little
significant
*punct* ,
that
while
one
sperm
whale
only
fights
another
sperm
whale
with
his
head
and
jaw
*punct* ,
nevertheless
*punct* ,
in
his
conflicts
with
man
*punct* ,
he
chiefly
and
contemptuously
uses
his
tail
*punct* .
*break*
in
striking
at
a
boat
*punct* ,
he
swiftly
curves
away
his
flukes
from
it
*punct* ,
and
the
blow
is
only
inflicted
by
the
recoil
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
be
made
in
the
unobstructed
air
*punct* ,
especially
if
it
descend
to
its
mark
*punct* ,
the
stroke
is
then
simply
irresistible
*punct* .
*break*
no
ribs
of
man
or
boat
can
withstand
it
*punct* .
*break*
your
only
salvation
lies
in
eluding
it
*punct* ;
but
if
it
comes
sideways
through
the
opposing
water
*punct* ,
then
partly
owing
to
the
light
buoyancy
of
the
whaleboat
*punct* ,
and
the
elasticity
of
its
materials
*punct* ,
a
cracked
rib
or
a
dashed
plank
or
two
*punct* ,
a
sort
of
stitch
in
the
side
*punct* ,
is
generally
the
most
serious
result
*punct* .
*break*
these
submerged
side
blows
are
so
often
received
in
the
fishery
*punct* ,
that
they
are
accounted
mere
child's
play
*punct* .
*break*
some
one
strips
off
a
frock
*punct* ,
and
the
hole
is
stopped
*punct* .
*break*
third
*punct* :
i
cannot
demonstrate
it
*punct* ,
but
it
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
that
in
the
whale
the
sense
of
touch
is
concentrated
in
the
tail
*punct* ;
for
in
this
respect
there
is
a
delicacy
in
it
only
equalled
by
the
daintiness
of
the
elephant's
trunk
*punct* .
*break*
had
this
tail
any
prehensile
power
*punct* ,
i
should
straightway
bethink
me
of
darmonodes
elephant
that
so
frequented
the
flower-market
*punct* ,
and
with
low
salutations
presented
nosegays
to
damsels
*punct* ,
and
then
caressed
their
zones
*punct* .
*break*
on
more
accounts
than
one
*punct* ,
a
pity
it
is
that
the
whale
does
not
possess
this
prehensile
virtue
in
his
tail
*punct* ;
for
i
have
heard
of
yet
another
elephant
*punct* ,
that
when
wounded
in
the
fight
*punct* ,
curved
round
his
trunk
and
extracted
the
dart
*punct* .
*break*
fourth
*punct* :
stealing
unawares
upon
the
whale
in
the
fancied
security
of
the
middle
of
solitary
seas
*punct* ,
you
find
him
unbent
from
the
vast
corpulence
of
his
dignity
*punct* ,
and
kitten-like
*punct* ,
he
plays
on
the
ocean
as
if
it
were
a
hearth
*punct* .
*break*
but
still
you
see
his
power
in
his
play
*punct* .
*break*
the
broad
palms
of
his
tail
are
flirted
high
into
the
air
*punct* ;
then
smiting
the
surface
*punct* ,
the
thunderous
concussion
resounds
for
miles
*punct* .
*break*
you
would
almost
think
a
great
gun
had
been
discharged
*punct* ;
and
if
you
noticed
the
light
wreath
of
vapor
from
the
spiracle
at
his
other
extremity
*punct* ,
you
would
think
that
that
was
the
smoke
from
the
touch-hole
*punct* .
*break*
fifth
*punct* :
as
in
the
ordinary
floating
posture
of
the
leviathan
the
flukes
lie
considerably
below
the
level
of
his
back
*punct* ,
they
are
then
completely
out
of
sight
beneath
the
surface
*punct* ;
but
when
he
is
about
to
plunge
into
the
deeps
*punct* ,
his
entire
flukes
with
at
least
thirty
feet
of
his
body
are
tossed
erect
in
the
air
*punct* ,
and
so
remain
vibrating
a
moment
*punct* ,
till
they
downwards
shoot
out
of
view
*punct* .
*break*
excepting
the
sublime
breach
*punct* ,
somewhere
else
to
be
described
*punct* ,
this
peaking
of
the
whale's
flukes
is
perhaps
the
grandest
sight
to
be
seen
in
all
animated
nature
*punct* .
*break*
out
of
the
bottomless
profundities
the
gigantic
tail
seems
spasmodically
snatching
at
the
highest
heaven
*punct* .
*break*
so
in
dreams
*punct* ,
have
i
seen
majestic
satan
thrusting
forth
his
tormented
colossal
claw
from
the
flame
baltic
of
hell
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
gazing
at
such
scenes
*punct* ,
it
is
all
in
all
what
mood
you
are
in
*punct* ;
if
in
the
dantean
*punct* ,
the
devils
will
occur
to
you
*punct* ;
if
in
that
of
isaiah
*punct* ,
the
archangels
*punct* .
*break*
standing
at
the
mast-head
of
my
ship
during
a
sunrise
that
crimsoned
sky
and
sea
*punct* ,
i
once
saw
a
large
herd
of
whales
in
the
east
*punct* ,
all
heading
towards
the
sun
*punct* ,
and
for
a
moment
vibrating
in
concert
with
peaked
flukes
*punct* .
*break*
as
ptolemy
philopater
testified
of
the
african
elephant
*punct* ,
i
then
testified
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
pronouncing
him
the
most
devout
of
all
beings
*punct* .
*break*
for
according
to
king
juba
*punct* ,
the
military
elephants
of
antiquity
often
hailed
the
morning
with
their
trunks
uplifted
in
the
profoundest
silence
*punct* .
*break*
the
chance
comparison
in
this
chapter
*punct* ,
between
the
whale
and
the
elephant
*punct* ,
so
far
as
some
aspects
of
the
tail
of
the
one
and
the
trunk
of
the
other
are
concerned
*punct* ,
should
not
tend
to
place
those
two
opposite
organs
on
an
equality
*punct* ,
much
less
the
creatures
to
which
they
respectively
belong
*punct* .
*break*
for
as
the
mightiest
elephant
is
but
a
terrier
to
leviathan
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ,
compared
with
leviathan's
tail
*punct* ,
his
trunk
is
but
the
stalk
of
a
lily
*punct* .
*break*
the
most
direful
blow
from
the
elephant's
trunk
were
as
the
playful
tap
of
a
fan
*punct* ,
compared
with
the
measureless
crush
and
crash
of
the
sperm
whale's
ponderous
flukes
*punct* ,
which
in
repeated
instances
have
one
after
the
other
hurled
entire
boats
with
all
their
oars
and
crews
into
the
air
*punct* ,
very
much
as
an
indian
juggler
tosses
his
balls
*punct* .
*break*
the
more
i
consider
this
mighty
tail
*punct* ,
the
more
do
i
deplore
my
inability
to
express
it
*punct* .
*break*
at
times
there
are
gestures
in
it
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
though
they
would
well
grace
the
hand
of
man
*punct* ,
remain
wholly
inexplicable
*punct* .
*break*
in
an
extensive
herd
*punct* ,
so
remarkable
*punct* ,
occasionally
*punct* ,
are
these
mystic
gestures
*punct* ,
that
i
have
heard
hunters
who
have
declared
them
akin
to
free-mason
signs
and
symbols
*punct* ;
that
the
whale
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
by
these
methods
intelligently
conversed
with
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
nor
are
there
wanting
other
motions
of
the
whale
in
his
general
body
*punct* ,
full
of
strangeness
*punct* ,
and
unaccountable
to
his
most
experienced
assailant
*punct* .
*break*
dissect
him
how
i
may
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
i
but
go
skin
deep
*punct* ;
i
know
him
not
*punct* ,
and
never
will
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
i
know
not
even
the
tail
of
this
whale
*punct* ,
how
understand
his
head
*punct* ?
*break*
much
more
*punct* ,
how
comprehend
his
face
*punct* ,
when
face
he
has
none
*punct* ?
*break*
in
a
continuous
line
from
that
peninsula
stretch
the
long
islands
of
sumatra
*punct* ,
java
*punct* ,
bally
*punct* ,
and
timor
*punct* ;
which
*punct* ,
with
many
others

form
a
vast
mole
*punct* ,

rampart
*punct* ,
lengthwise
connecting
asia
with
australia
*punct* ,
and
dividing
the
long
unbroken
indian
ocean
from
the
thickly
studded
oriental
archipelagoes
*punct* .
*break*
this
rampart
is
pierced
by
several
sally-ports
for
the
convenience
of
ships
and
whales
*punct* ;
conspicuous
among
which
are
the

rampart
of
islands

buttressed

that
bold
green
promontory
*punct* ,
known

seamen
as
java

they
not
a

the
central
gateway
opening

some
vast
walled

gold
*punct* ,

with
which
the
thousand
islands
of
that
oriental

are
enriched

it
seems
a
significant
provision
of
nature
*punct* ,
that
such
treasures
*punct* ,
by
the
very
formation
of
the
land
*punct* ,
should
at
least
bear
the
appearance
*punct* ,
however
ineffectual
*punct* ,
of
being
guarded
from
the
all-grasping
western
world
*punct* .
*break*
the

entrances
to
the
mediterranean

*break*
but
while
they
freely
waive
a
ceremonial
like
this
*punct* ,
they
do
by
no
means
renounce
their
claim
to
more
solid
tribute
*punct* .
*break*
time
out
of
mind
the
piratical
proas
of
the
malays
*punct* ,
lurking
among
the
low
shaded
coves
and
islets
of
sumatra
*punct* ,
have
sallied
out
upon
the
vessels
sailing
through
the
straits
*punct* ,
fiercely
demanding
tribute
at
the
point
of
their
spears
*punct* .
*break*
though
by
the
repeated
bloody
chastisements
they
have
received
at
the
hands
of
european
cruisers
*punct* ,
the
audacity
of
these
corsairs
has
of
late
been
somewhat
repressed
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
even
at
the
present
day
*punct* ,
we
occasionally
hear
of
english

american
vessels
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
in
those

*punct* ,
have
been
remorselessly
boarded

pillaged
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
fair
*punct* ,
fresh
wind

the
pequod
was
now
drawing
nigh
to
these
straits

ahab
purposing
to
pass
through

into
the
javan
sea

thence
*punct* ,
cruising
northwards
*punct* ,
over
waters
known
to
be
frequented
here

there
by

sperm
whale
*punct* ,
sweep
inshore

gain
the
far
coast
of
japan

time
for
the
great
whaling
season
there

*break*
by
these
means
*punct* ,
the
circumnavigating
pequod
would
sweep
almost
all
the
known
sperm
whale
cruising
grounds
of
the
world
*punct* ,
previous
to
descending
upon
the
line
in
the
pacific
*punct* ;
where
ahab
*punct* ,
though
everywhere
else
foiled
in
his
pursuit
*punct* ,
firmly
counted
upon
giving
battle
to
moby
dick
*punct* ,
in
the
sea
he
was
most
known
to
frequent
*punct* ;
and
at
a
season
when
he
might
most
reasonably
be
presumed
to
be
haunting
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
now
*punct* ?
*break*
in
this
zoned
quest
*punct* ,
does
ahab
touch
no
land
*punct* ?
*break*
does
his
crew
drink
air
*punct* ?
*break*
surely
*punct* ,
he
will
stop
for
water
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
long
time
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
the
circus-running
sun
has
raced
within
his
fiery
ring
*punct* ,
and
needs
no
sustenance

what's
in
himself
*punct* .
*break*
mark
this
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
in
the
whaler
*punct* .
*break*
while
other
hulls
are
loaded
down
with
alien
stuff
*punct* ,
to
be
transferred
to
foreign
wharves
*punct* ;
the
world-wandering
whale-ship
carries
no
cargo
but
herself
and
crew
*punct* ,
their
weapons
and
their
wants
*punct* .
*break*
she
has
a
whole
lake's
contents
bottled

she

ballasted

not
altogether
with
unusable
pig-lead

kentledge

*break*
she
carries
years
water

*break*
hence
it
is
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
while
other

may
have
gone
to
china
from
new
york
*punct* ,
and
back
again
*punct* ,
touching
at
a
score
of
ports
*punct* ,
the
whale-ship
*punct* ,
in
all
that
interval
*punct* ,
may
not
have
sighted
one
grain
of
soil
*punct* ;
her
crew
having

floating

*break*
so
that

you
carry

the
news
that
another
flood
had
come

only
answer
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* ,
here's
the
ark
*punct* !
*break*
now
*punct* ,
as
many
sperm
whales
had
been
captured
off
the
western
coast
of
java
*punct* ,
in
the
near
vicinity
of
the
straits
of
sunda
*punct* ;
indeed
*punct* ,
as
most
of
the
ground
*punct* ,
roundabout
*punct* ,
was
generally
recognised
by
the
fishermen
as
an
excellent
spot
for
cruising
*punct* ;
therefore
*punct* ,
as
the
pequod
gained
more
and
more
upon
java
head
*punct* ,
the
look-outs
were
repeatedly
hailed
*punct* ,
and
admonished
to
keep
wide
awake
*punct* .
*break*
but
though
the
green
palmy
cliffs
of
the
land
soon
loomed
on
the
starboard
bow
*punct* ,
and
with
delighted
nostrils
the
fresh
cinnamon
was
snuffed
in
the

*punct* ,

not
a
single
jet
was
descried
*punct* .
*break*
almost
renouncing
all
thought
of
falling
in
with
any
game
hereabouts
*punct* ,
the
ship
had
well
nigh
entered
the
straits
*punct* ,
when
the
customary
cheering
cry
was
heard
from
aloft
*punct* ,
and
ere
long
a
spectacle
of
singular
magnificence
saluted
us
*punct* .
*break*
but
here
be
it
premised
*punct* ,
that
owing
to
the
unwearied
activity
with
which
of
late
they
have
been
hunted
over
all
four
oceans
*punct* ,
the
sperm
whales
*punct* ,
instead
of
almost
invariably
sailing
in
small
detached
companies
*punct* ,
as
in
former
times
*punct* ,
are
now
frequently
met
with
in
extensive
herds
*punct* ,
sometimes
embracing
so
great
a
multitude
*punct* ,

it
would
almost
seem
as
if
numerous
nations
of
them
had
sworn
solemn
league
and
covenant
for
mutual
assistance
and
protection
*punct* .
*break*
to
this
aggregation
of
the
sperm
whale
into
such
immense
caravans
*punct* ,
may
be
imputed
the
circumstance
that
even
in
the
best
cruising
grounds
*punct* ,
you
may
now
sometimes
sail
for
weeks
and
months
together
*punct* ,
without
being
greeted
by
a
single
spout
*punct* ;
and
then
be
suddenly
saluted
by
what
sometimes
seems
thousands
on
thousands
*punct* .
*break*
broad
on
both
bows
*punct* ,
at
the
distance
of
some
two
or
three
miles
*punct* ,
and
forming
a
great
semicircle
*punct* ,
embracing
one
half
of
the
level
horizon
*punct* ,
a
continuous
chain
of
whale-jets
were
up-playing
and
sparkling
in
the
noon-day
air
*punct* .
*break*
seen
from
the
pequod's
deck
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
as
she

a
high
hill
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
this
host

vapory
spouts
*punct* ,
individually
curling
up
into
the
air
*punct* ,
and
beheld
through
a
blending
atmosphere
of
bluish
haze

showed
like

cheerful
chimneys

some
dense

*punct* ,
descried
of
a
balmy
autumnal
morning

that
perilous
passage

this
vast

whales
now
seem
hurrying
forward

loudly
cheering

*punct* ,
little
doubt
had
they
*punct* ,
that
chased
through

the
vast
host
would
only
deploy
into
the
oriental
seas
to
witness
the
capture
of
not
a

of
their
number
*punct* .
*break*
and
who
could
tell
whether
*punct* ,
in

congregated
caravan

moby

not
temporarily
be
swimming

worshipped
white-elephant
in
the
coronation
procession
of
the
siamese
*punct* !
*break*
so
with
stun-sail
piled
on
stun-sail
*punct* ,
we
sailed
along
*punct* ,
driving
these
leviathans
before
us
*punct* ;
when
*punct* ,
of
a
sudden
*punct* ,
the
voice
of
tashtego
was
heard
*punct* ,
loudly
directing
attention
to
something
in
our
wake
*punct* .
*break*
corresponding
to
the
crescent
in
our
van
*punct* ,
we
beheld
another
in
our
rear
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
formed
of
detached
white
vapors
*punct* ,
rising
and
falling
something
like
the
spouts
of
the
whales
*punct* ;
only
they
did
not
so
completely
come
and
go
*punct* ;
for
they
constantly
hovered
*punct* ,
without
finally
disappearing
*punct* .
*break*
levelling
his
glass
at
this
sight
*punct* ,
ahab
quickly
revolved
in
his
pivot-hole
*punct* ,
crying
*punct* ,
aloft
there
*punct* ,
and
rig
whips
and
buckets
to
wet
the
sails;
*punct* ,
malays
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
and
after
us
*punct* !
*break*
but
when
the
swift
pequod
*punct* ,
with
a
fresh
leading
wind
*punct* ,
was
herself
in
hot
chase
*punct* ;
how
very
kind
of
these
tawny
philanthropists
to
assist
in
speeding
her
on
to
her
own
chosen
pursuit,
*punct* ,
mere
riding-whips
and
rowels
to
her
*punct* ,
that
they
were
*punct* .
*break*
as
with
glass
under
arm
*punct* ,
ahab
to-and-fro
paced
the
deck
*punct* ;
in
his
forward
turn
beholding
the
monsters
he
chased
*punct* ,
and
in
the
after
one
the
bloodthirsty
pirates
chasing
him
*punct* ;
some
such
fancy
as
the
above
seemed
his
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
he
glanced
upon
the
green
walls
of
the
watery
defile
in
which
the
ship
was
then
sailing
*punct* ,
and
bethought
him
that
through
that
gate
lay
the
route
to
his
vengeance
*punct* ,
and
beheld
*punct* ,
how
that
through
that
same
gate
he
was
now
both
chasing
and
being
chased
to
his
deadly
end
*punct* ;
and
not
only
that
*punct* ,
but
a
herd
of
remorseless
wild
pirates
and
inhuman
atheistical
devils
were
infernally
cheering
him
on
with
their
curses;
*punct* ,
when
all
these
conceits
had
passed
through
his
brain
*punct* ,
ahab's
brow
was
left
gaunt
and
ribbed
*punct* ,
like
the
black
sand
beach
after
some
stormy
tide
has
been
gnawing
it
*punct* ,
without
being
able
to
drag
the
firm
thing
from
its
place
*punct* .
*break*
but
thoughts
like
these
troubled
very
few
of
the
reckless
crew
*punct* ;
and
when
*punct* ,
after
steadily
dropping
and
dropping
the
pirates
astern
*punct* ,
the
pequod
at
last
shot
by
the
vivid
green
cockatoo
point
on
the
sumatra
side
*punct* ,
emerging
at
last
upon
the
broad
waters
beyond
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
the
harpooneers
seemed
more
to
grieve
that
the
swift
whales
had
been
gaining
upon
the
ship
*punct* ,
than
to
rejoice
that
the
ship
had
so
victoriously
gained
upon
the
malays
*punct* .
*break*
but
still
driving
on
in
the
wake
of
the
whales
*punct* ,
at
length
they
seemed
abating
their
speed
*punct* ;
gradually
the
ship
neared
them
*punct* ;
and
the
wind
now
dying
away
*punct* ,
word
was
passed
to
spring
to
the
boats
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
sooner
did
the
herd
*punct* ,
by
some
presumed
wonderful
instinct
of
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
become
notified
of
the
three
keels
that
were
after
them,
*punct* ,
though
as
yet
a
mile
in
their
rear,
*punct* ,
than
they
rallied
again
*punct* ,
and
forming
in
close
ranks
and
battalions
*punct* ,
so
that
their
spouts
all
looked
like
flashing
lines
of
stacked
bayonets
*punct* ,
moved
on
with
redoubled
velocity
*punct* .
*break*
the
compact
martial
columns
in
which
they
had
been
hitherto
rapidly
and
steadily
swimming
*punct* ,
were
now
broken
up
in
one
measureless
rout
*punct* ;
and
like
king
porus
elephants
in
the
indian
battle
with
alexander
*punct* ,
they
seemed
going
mad
with
consternation
*punct* .
*break*
in
all
directions
expanding
in
vast
irregular
circles
*punct* ,
and
aimlessly
swimming
hither
and
thither
*punct* ,
by
their
short
thick
spoutings
*punct* ,
they
plainly
betrayed
their
distraction
of
panic
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
still
more
strangely
evinced
by
those
of
their
number
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
completely
paralysed
as
it
were
*punct* ,
helplessly
floated
like
water-logged
dismantled
ships
on
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
had
these
leviathans
been
but
a
flock
of
simple
sheep
*punct* ,
pursued
over
the
pasture
by
three
fierce
wolves
*punct* ,
they
could
not
possibly
have
evinced
such
excessive
dismay
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
occasional
timidity
is
characteristic
of
almost
all
herding
creatures
*punct* .
*break*
though
banding
together
in
tens
of
thousands
*punct* ,
the
lion-maned
buffaloes
of
the
west
have
fled
before
a
solitary
horseman
*punct* .
*break*
witness
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
all
human
beings
*punct* ,
how
when
herded
together
in
the
sheepfold
of
a
theatre's
pit
*punct* ,
they
will
*punct* ,
at
the
slightest
alarm
of
fire
*punct* ,
rush
helter-skelter
for
the
outlets
*punct* ,
crowding
*punct* ,
trampling
*punct* ,
jamming
*punct* ,
and
remorselessly
dashing
each
other
to
death
*punct* .
*break*
though
many
of
the
whales
*punct* ,
as
has
been
said
*punct* ,
were
in
violent
motion
*punct* ,
yet
it
is
to
be
observed
that
as
a
whole
the
herd
neither
advanced
nor
retreated
*punct* ,
but
collectively
remained
in
one
place
*punct* .
*break*
as
is
customary
in
those
cases
*punct* ,
the
boats
at
once
separated
*punct* ,
each
making
for
some
one
lone
whale
on
the
outskirts
of
the
shoal
*punct* .
*break*
in
about
three
minutes
time
*punct* ,
queequeg's
harpoon
was
flung
*punct* ;
the
stricken
fish
darted
blinding
spray
in
our
faces
*punct* ,
and
then
running
away
with
us
like
light
*punct* ,
steered
straight
for
the
heart
of
the
herd
*punct* .
*break*
though
such
a
movement
on
the
part
of
the
whale
struck
under
such
circumstances
*punct* ,
is
in
no
wise
unprecedented
*punct* ;
and
indeed
is
almost
always
more
or
less
anticipated
*punct* ;
yet
does
it
present
one
of
the
more
perilous
vicissitudes
of
the
fishery
*punct* .
*break*
for
as
the
swift
monster
drags
you
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
frantic
shoal
*punct* ,
you
bid
adieu
to
circumspect
life
and
only
exist
in
a
delirious
throb
*punct* .
*break*
as
*punct* ,
blind
and
deaf
*punct* ,
the
whale
plunged
forward
*punct* ,
as
if
by
sheer
power
of
speed
to
rid
himself
of
the
iron
leech
that
had
fastened
to
him
*punct* ;
as
we
thus
tore
a
white
gash
in
the
sea
*punct* ,
on
all
sides
menaced
as
we
flew
*punct* ,
by
the
crazed
creatures
to
and
fro
rushing
about
us
*punct* ;
our
beset
boat
was
like
a
ship
mobbed
by
ice-isles
in
a
tempest
*punct* ,
and
striving
to
steer
through
their
complicated
channels
and
straits
*punct* ,
knowing
not
at
what
moment
it
may
be
locked
in
and
crushed
*punct* .
*break*
but
not
a
bit
daunted
*punct* ,
queequeg
steered
us
manfully
*punct* ;
now
sheering
off
from
this
monster
directly
across
our
route
in
advance
*punct* ;
now
edging
away
from
that
*punct* ,
whose
colossal
flukes
were
suspended
overhead
*punct* ,
while
all
the
time
*punct* ,
starbuck
stood
up
in
the
bows
*punct* ,
lance
in
hand
*punct* ,
pricking
out
of
our
way
whatever
whales
he
could
reach
by
short
darts
*punct* ,
for
there
was
no
time
to
make
long
ones
*punct* .
*break*
nor
were
the
oarsmen
quite
idle
*punct* ,
though
their
wonted
duty
was
now
altogether
dispensed
with
*punct* .
*break*
they
chiefly
attended
to
the
shouting
part
of
the
business
*punct* .
*break*
out
of
the
way
*punct* ,
commodore
*punct* !
*break*
cried
one
*punct* ,
to
a
great
dromedary
that
of
a
sudden
rose
bodily
to
the
surface
*punct* ,
and
for
an
instant
threatened
to
swamp
us
*punct* .
*break*
hard
down
with
your
tail
*punct* ,
there
*punct* !
*break*
all
whaleboats
carry
certain
curious
contrivances
*punct* ,
originally
invented
by
the
nantucket
indians
*punct* ,
called
druggs
*punct* .
*break*
two
thick
squares
of
wood
of
equal
size
are
stoutly
clenched
together
*punct* ,
so
that
they
cross
each
other's
grain
at
right
angles
*punct* ;
a
line
of
considerable
length
is
then
attached
to
the
middle
of
this
block
*punct* ,
and
the
other
end
of
the
line
being
looped
*punct* ,
it
can
in
a
moment
be
fastened
to
a
harpoon
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
chiefly
among
gallied
whales
that
this
drugg
is
used
*punct* .
*break*
for
then
*punct* ,
more
whales
are
close
round
you
than
you
can
possibly
chase
at
one
time
*punct* .
*break*
but
sperm
whales
are
not
every
day
encountered
*punct* ;
while
you
may
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
you
must
kill
all
you
can
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
you
cannot
kill
them
all
at
once
*punct* ,
you
must
wing
them
*punct* ,
so
that
they
can
be
afterwards
killed
at
your
leisure
*punct* .
*break*
hence
it
is
*punct* ,
that
at
times
like
these
the
drugg
comes
into
requisition
*punct* .
*break*
our
boat
was
furnished
with
three
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
first
and
second
were
successfully
darted
*punct* ,
and
we
saw
the
whales
staggeringly
running
off
*punct* ,
fettered
by
the
enormous
sidelong
resistance
of
the
towing
drugg
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
cramped
like
malefactors
with
the
chain
and
ball
*punct* .
*break*
but
upon
flinging
the
third
*punct* ,
in
the
act
of
tossing
overboard
the
clumsy
wooden
block
*punct* ,
it
caught
under
one
of
the
seats
of
the
boat
*punct* ,
and
in
an
instant
tore
it
out
and
carried
it
away
*punct* ,
dropping
the
oarsman
in
the
boat's
bottom
as
the
seat
slid
from
under
him
*punct* .
*break*
on
both
sides
the
sea
came
in
at
the
wounded
planks
*punct* ,
but
we
stuffed
two
or
three
drawers
and
shirts
in
*punct* ,
and
so
stopped
the
leaks
for
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
been
next
to
impossible
to
dart
these
drugged-harpoons
*punct* ,
were
it
not
that
as
we
advanced
into
the
herd
*punct* ,
our
whale's
way
greatly
diminished
*punct* ;
moreover
*punct* ,
that
as
we
went
still
further
and
further
from
the
circumference
of
commotion
*punct* ,
the
direful
disorders
seemed
waning
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
when
at
last
the
jerking
harpoon
drew
out
*punct* ,
and
the
towing
whale
sideways
vanished
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
with
the
tapering
force
of
his
parting
momentum
*punct* ,
we
glided
between
two
whales
into
the
innermost
heart
of
the
shoal
*punct* ,
as
if
from
some
mountain
torrent
we
had
slid
into
a
serene
valley
lake
*punct* .
*break*
here
the
storms
in
the
roaring
glens
between
the
outermost
whales
*punct* ,
were
heard
but
not
felt
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
we
were
now
in
that
enchanted
calm
which
they
say
lurks
at
the
heart
of
every
commotion
*punct* .
*break*
and
still
in
the
distracted
distance
we
beheld
the
tumults
of
the
outer
concentric
circles
*punct* ,
and
saw
successive
pods
of
whales
*punct* ,
eight
or
ten
in
each
*punct* ,
swiftly
going
round
and
round
*punct* ,
like
multiplied
spans
of
horses
in
a
ring
*punct* ;
and
so
closely
shoulder
to
shoulder
*punct* ,
that
a
titanic
circus-rider
might
easily
have
over-arched
the
middle
ones
*punct* ,
and
so
have
gone
round
on
their
backs
*punct* .
*break*
owing
to
the
density
of
the
crowd
of
reposing
whales
*punct* ,
more
immediately
surrounding
the
embayed
axis
of
the
herd
*punct* ,
no
possible
chance
of
escape
was
at
present
afforded
us
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
watch
for
a
breach
in
the
living
wall
that
hemmed
us
in
*punct* ;
the
wall
that
had
only
admitted
us
in
order
to
shut
us
up
*punct* .
*break*
keeping
at
the
centre
of
the
lake
*punct* ,
we
were
occasionally
visited
by
small
tame
cows
and
calves
*punct* ;
the
women
and
children
of
this
routed
host
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
inclusive
of
the
occasional
wide
intervals
between
the
revolving
outer
circles
*punct* ,
and
inclusive
of
the
spaces
between
the
various
pods
in
any
one
of
those
circles
*punct* ,
the
entire
area
at
this
juncture
*punct* ,
embraced
by
the
whole
multitude
*punct* ,
must
have
contained
at
least
two
or
three
square
miles
*punct* .
*break*
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
though
indeed
such
a
test
at
such
a
time
might
be
deceptive
*punct* ,
spoutings
might
be
discovered
from
our
low
boat
that
seemed
playing
up
almost
from
the
rim
of
the
horizon
*punct* .
*break*
i
mention
this
circumstance
*punct* ,
because
*punct* ,
as
if
the
cows
and
calves
had
been
purposely
locked
up
in
this
innermost
fold
*punct* ;
and
as
if
the
wide
extent
of
the
herd
had
hitherto
prevented
them
from
learning
the
precise
cause
of
its
stopping
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
possibly
*punct* ,
being
so
young
*punct* ,
unsophisticated
*punct* ,
and
every
way
innocent
and
inexperienced
*punct* ;
however
it
may
have
been
*punct* ,
these
smaller
whales
*punct* ,
now
and
then
visiting
our
becalmed
boat
from
the
margin
of
the
lake
*punct* ,
evinced
a
wondrous
fearlessness
and
confidence
*punct* ,
or
else
a
still
becharmed
panic
which
it
was
impossible
not
to
marvel
at
*punct* .
*break*
like
household
dogs
they
came
snuffling
round
us
*punct* ,
right
up
to
our
gunwales
*punct* ,
and
touching
them
*punct* ;
till
it
almost
seemed
that
some
spell
had
suddenly
domesticated
them
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
suspended
in
those
watery
vaults
*punct* ,
floated
the
forms
of
the
nursing
mothers
of
the
whales
*punct* ,
and
those
that
by
their
enormous
girth
seemed
shortly
to
become
mothers
*punct* .
*break*
the
lake
*punct* ,
as
i
have
hinted
*punct* ,
was
to
a
considerable
depth
exceedingly
transparent
*punct* ;
and
as
human
infants
while
suckling
will
calmly
and
fixedly
gaze
away
from
the
breast
*punct* ,
as
if
leading
two
different
lives
at
the
time
*punct* ;
and
while
yet
drawing
mortal
nourishment
*punct* ,
be
still
spiritually
feasting
upon
some
unearthly
reminiscence;
*punct* ,
even
so
did
the
young
of
these
whales
seem
looking
up
towards
us
*punct* ,
but
not
at
us
*punct* ,
as
if
we
were
but
a
bit
of
gulf-weed
in
their
new-born
sight
*punct* .
*break*
floating
on
their
sides
*punct* ,
the
mothers
also
seemed
quietly
eyeing
us
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
these
little
infants
*punct* ,
that
from
certain
queer
tokens
seemed
hardly
a
day
old
*punct* ,
might
have
measured
some
fourteen
feet
in
length
*punct* ,
and
some
six
feet
in
girth
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
little
frisky
*punct* ;
though
as
yet
his
body
seemed
scarce
yet
recovered
from
that
irksome
position
it
had
so
lately
occupied
in
the
maternal
reticule
*punct* ;
where
*punct* ,
tail
to
head
*punct* ,
and
all
ready
for
the
final
spring
*punct* ,
the
unborn
whale
lies
bent
like
a
tartar's
bow
*punct* .
*break*
the
delicate
side-fins
*punct* ,
and
the
palms
of
his
flukes
*punct* ,
still
freshly
retained
the
plaited
crumpled
appearance
of
a
baby's
ears
newly
arrived
from
foreign
parts
*punct* .
*break*
cried
queequeg
*punct* ,
looking
over
the
gunwale
*punct* ;
him
fast
*punct* !
*break*
him
fast!

whale

little

*break*
what
ails
ye
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ?
*break*
look-e
here
*punct* ,
said
queequeg
pointing
down
*punct* .
*break*
as
when
the
stricken
whale
*punct* ,
that
from
the
tub
has
reeled
out
hundreds
of
fathoms
of
rope
*punct* ;
as
*punct* ,
after
deep
sounding
*punct* ,
he
floats
up
again
*punct* ,
and
shows
the
slackened
curling
line
buoyantly
rising
and
spiralling
towards
the
air
*punct* ;
so
now
*punct* ,
starbuck
saw
long
coils
of
the
umbilical
cord
of
madame
leviathan
*punct* ,
by
which
the
young
cub
seemed
still
tethered
to
its
dam
*punct* .
*break*
not
seldom
in
the
rapid
vicissitudes
of
the
chase
*punct* ,
this
natural
line
*punct* ,
with
the
maternal
end
loose
*punct* ,
becomes
entangled
with
the
hempen
one
*punct* ,
so
that
the
cub
is
thereby
trapped
*punct* .
*break*
we
saw
young
leviathan
amours
in
the
deep
*punct* .
*break*
and
thus
*punct* ,
though
surrounded
by
circle
upon
circle
of
consternations
and
affrights
*punct* ,
did
these
inscrutable
creatures
at
the
centre
freely
and
fearlessly
indulge
in
all
peaceful
concernments
*punct* ;
yea
*punct* ,
serenely
revelled
in
dalliance
and
delight
*punct* .
*break*
but
even
so
*punct* ,
amid
the
tornadoed
atlantic
of
my
being
*punct* ,
do
i
myself
still
for
ever
centrally
disport
in
mute
calm
*punct* ;
and
while
ponderous
planets
of
unwaning
woe
revolve
round
me
*punct* ,
deep
down
and
deep
inland
there
i
still
bathe
me
in
eternal
mildness
of
joy
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
*punct* ,
as
we
thus
lay
entranced
*punct* ,
the
occasional
sudden
frantic
spectacles
in
the
distance
evinced
the
activity
of
the
other
boats
*punct* ,
still
engaged
in
drugging
the
whales
on
the
frontier
of
the
host
*punct* ;
or
possibly
carrying
on
the
war
within
the
first
circle
*punct* ,
where
abundance
of
room
and
some
convenient
retreats
were
afforded
them
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
sight
of
the
enraged
drugged
whales
now
and
then
blindly
darting
to
and
fro
across
the
circles
*punct* ,
was
nothing
to
what
at
last
met
our
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
sometimes
the
custom
when
fast
to
a
whale
more
than
commonly
powerful
and
alert
*punct* ,
to
seek
to
hamstring
him
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ,
by
sundering
or
maiming
his
gigantic
tail-tendon
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
done
by
darting
a
short-handled
cutting-spade
*punct* ,
to
which
is
attached
a
rope
for
hauling
it
back
again
*punct* .
*break*
but
agonizing
as
was
the
wound
of
this
whale
*punct* ,
and
an
appalling
spectacle
enough
*punct* ,
any
way
*punct* ;
yet
the
peculiar
horror
with
which
he
seemed
to
inspire
the
rest
of
the
herd
*punct* ,
was
owing
to
a
cause
which
at
first
the
intervening
distance
obscured
from
us
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
length
we
perceived
that
by
one
of
the
unimaginable
accidents
of
the
fishery
*punct* ,
this
whale
had
become
entangled
in
the
harpoon-line
that
he
towed
*punct* ;
he
had
also
run
away
with
the
cutting-spade
in
him
*punct* ;
and
while
the
free
end
of
the
rope
attached
to
that
weapon
*punct* ,
had
permanently
caught
in
the
coils
of
the
harpoon-line
round
his
tail
*punct* ,
the
cutting-spade
itself
had
worked
loose
from
his
flesh
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
tormented
to
madness
*punct* ,
he
was
now
churning
through
the
water
*punct* ,
violently
flailing
with
his
flexible
tail
*punct* ,
and
tossing
the
keen
spade
about
him
*punct* ,
wounding
and
murdering
his
own
comrades
*punct* .
*break*
this
terrific
object
seemed
to
recall
the
whole
herd
from
their
stationary
fright
*punct* .
*break*
first
*punct* ,
the
whales
forming
the
margin
of
our
lake
began
to
crowd
a
little
*punct* ,
and
tumble
against
each
other
*punct* ,
as
if
lifted
by
half
spent
billows
from
afar
*punct* ;
then
the
lake
itself
began
faintly
to
heave
and
swell
*punct* ;
the
submarine
bridal-chambers
and
nurseries
vanished
*punct* ;
in
more
and
more
contracting
orbits
the
whales
in
the
more
central
circles
began
to
swim
in
thickening
clusters
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
the
long
calm
was
departing
*punct* .
*break*
a
low
advancing
hum
was
soon
heard
*punct* ;
and
then
like
to
the
tumultuous
masses
of
block-ice
when
the
great
river
hudson
breaks
up
in
spring
*punct* ,
the
entire
host
of
whales
came
tumbling
upon
their
inner
centre
*punct* ,
as
if
to
pile
themselves
up
in
one
common
mountain
*punct* .
*break*
instantly
starbuck
and
queequeg
changed
places
*punct* ;
starbuck
taking
the
stern
*punct* .
*break*
he
intensely
whispered
*punct* ,
seizing
the
helm
*punct* ,
gripe
your
oars
*punct* ,
and
clutch
your
souls
*punct* ,
now
*punct* !
*break*
my
god
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
stand
by
*punct* !
*break*
shove
him
off
*punct* ,
you
queequeg
*punct* ,
the
whale
there!
*punct* ,
prick
him!
*punct* ,
hit
him
*punct* !
*break*
stand
up
*punct* ,
stand
up
*punct* ,
and
stay
so
*punct* !
*break*
spring
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
pull
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ;
never
mind
their
backs
*punct* ,
scrape
them!
*punct* ,
scrape
away
*punct* !
*break*
the
boat
was
now
all
but
jammed
between
two
vast
black
bulks
*punct* ,
leaving
a
narrow
dardanelles
between
their
long
lengths
*punct* .
*break*
after
many
similar
hair-breadth
escapes
*punct* ,
we
at
last
swiftly
glided
into
what
had
just
been
one
of
the
outer
circles
*punct* ,
but
now
crossed
by
random
whales
*punct* ,
all
violently
making
for
one
centre
*punct* .
*break*
this
lucky
salvation
was
cheaply
purchased
by
the
loss
of
queequeg's
hat
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
while
standing
in
the
bows
to
prick
the
fugitive
whales
*punct* ,
had
his
hat
taken
clean
from
his
head
by
the
air-eddy
made
by
the
sudden
tossing
of
a
pair
of
broad
flukes
close
by
*punct* .
*break*
riotous
and
disordered
as
the
universal
commotion
now
was
*punct* ,
it
soon
resolved
itself
into
what
seemed
a
systematic
movement
*punct* ;
for
having
clumped
together
at
last
in
one
dense
body
*punct* ,
they
then
renewed
their
onward
flight
with
augmented
fleetness
*punct* .
*break*
further
pursuit
was
useless
*punct* ;
but
the
boats
still
lingered
in
their
wake
to
pick
up
what
drugged
whales
might
be
dropped
astern
*punct* ,
and
likewise
to
secure
one
which
flask
had
killed
and
waifed
*punct* .
*break*
the
waif
is
a
pennoned
pole
*punct* ,
two
or
three
of
which
are
carried
by
every
boat
*punct* ;
and
which
*punct* ,
when
additional
game
is
at
hand
*punct* ,
are
inserted
upright
into
the
floating
body
of
a
dead
whale
*punct* ,
both
to
mark
its
place
on
the
sea
*punct* ,
and
also
as
token
of
prior
possession
*punct* ,
should
the
boats
of
any
other
ship
draw
near
*punct* .
*break*
the
result
of
this
lowering
was
somewhat
illustrative
of
that
sagacious
saying
in
the
fishery,
*punct* ,
the
more
whales
the
less
fish
*punct* .
*break*
of
all
the
drugged
whales
only
one
was
captured
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
an
old
saxon
word
*punct* .
*break*
it
occurs
once
in
shakespeare:
*punct* ,
the
wrathful
skies
gallow
the
very
wanderers
of
the
dark
and
make
them
keep
their
caves
*punct* .
*break*
to
common
language
*punct* ,
the
word
is
now
completely
obsolete
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
polite
landsman
first
hears
it
from
the
gaunt
nantucketer
*punct* ,
he
is
apt
to
set
it
down
as
one
of
the
whaleman's
self-derived
savageries
*punct* .
*break*
much
the
same
is
it
with
many
other
sinewy
saxonisms
of
this
sort
*punct* ,
which
emigrated
to
new-england
rocks
with
the
noble
brawn
of
the
old
english
emigrants
in
the
time
of
the
commonwealth
*punct* .
*break*
when
by
chance
these
precious
parts
in
a
nursing
whale
are
cut
by
the
hunter's
lance
*punct* ,
the
mother's
pouring
milk
and
blood
rivallingly
discolor
the
sea
for
rods
*punct* .
*break*
the
milk
is
very
sweet
and
rich
*punct* ;
it
has
been
tasted
by
man
*punct* ;
it
might
do
well
with
strawberries
*punct* .
*break*
such
bands
are
known
as
schools
*punct* .
*break*
they
generally
are
of
two
sorts
*punct* ;
those
composed
almost
entirely
of
females
*punct* ,
and
those
mustering
none
but
young
vigorous
males
*punct* ,
or
bulls
*punct* ,
as
they
are
familiarly
designated
*punct* .
*break*
in
cavalier
attendance
upon
the
school
of
females
*punct* ,
you
invariably
see
a
male
of
full
grown
magnitude
*punct* ,
but
not
old
*punct* ;
who
*punct* ,
upon
any
alarm
*punct* ,
evinces
his
gallantry
by
falling
in
the
rear
and
covering
the
flight
of
his
ladies
*punct* .
*break*
in
truth
*punct* ,
this
gentleman
is
a
luxurious
ottoman
*punct* ,
swimming
about
over
the
watery
world
*punct* ,
surroundingly
accompanied
by
all
the
solaces
and
endearments
of
the
harem
*punct* .
*break*
the
contrast
between
this
ottoman
and
his
concubines
is
striking
*punct* ;
because
*punct* ,
while
he
is
always
of
the
largest
leviathanic
proportions
*punct* ,
the
ladies
*punct* ,
even
at
full
growth
*punct* ,
are
not
more
than
one
third
of
the
bulk
of
an
average-sized
male
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
comparatively
delicate
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ;
i
dare
say
*punct* ,
not
to
exceed
half
a
dozen
yards
round
the
waist
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
it
cannot
be
denied
*punct* ,
that
upon
the
whole
they
are
hereditarily
entitled
to
en
bon
point
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
very
curious
to
watch
this
harem
and
its
lord
in
their
indolent
ramblings
*punct* .
*break*
like
fashionables
*punct* ,
they
are
for
ever
on
the
move
in
leisurely
search
of
variety
*punct* .
*break*
you
meet
them
on
the
line
in
time
for
the
full
flower
of
the
equatorial
feeding
season
*punct* ,
having
just
returned
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
from
spending
the
summer
in
the
northern
seas
*punct* ,
and
so
cheating
summer
of
all
unpleasant
weariness
and
warmth
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
time
they
have
lounged
up
and
down
the
promenade
of
the
equator
awhile
*punct* ,
they
start
for
the
oriental
waters
in
anticipation
of
the
cool
season
there
*punct* ,
and
so
evade
the
other
excessive
temperature
of
the
year
*punct* .
*break*
when
serenely
advancing
on
one
of
these
journeys
*punct* ,
if
any
strange
suspicious
sights
are
seen
*punct* ,
my
lord
whale
keeps
a
wary
eye
on
his
interesting
family
*punct* .
*break*
should
any
unwarrantably
pert
young
leviathan
coming
that
way
*punct* ,
presume
to
draw
confidentially
close
to
one
of
the
ladies
*punct* ,
with
what
prodigious
fury
the
bashaw
assails
him
*punct* ,
and
chases
him
away
*punct* !
*break*
all
fish
bed
in
common
*punct* .
*break*
as
ashore
*punct* ,
the
ladies
often
cause
the
most
terrible
duels
among
their
rival
admirers
*punct* ;
just
so
with
the
whales
*punct* ,
who
sometimes
come
to
deadly
battle
*punct* ,
and
all
for
love
*punct* .
*break*
they
fence
with
their
long
lower
jaws
*punct* ,
sometimes
locking
them
together
*punct* ,
and
so
striving
for
the
supremacy
like
elks
that
warringly
interweave
their
antlers
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
few
are
captured
having
the
deep
scars
of
these
encounters,
*punct* ,
furrowed
heads
*punct* ,
broken
teeth
*punct* ,
scolloped
fins
*punct* ;
and
in
some
instances
*punct* ,
wrenched
and
dislocated
mouths
*punct* .
*break*
but
supposing
the
invader
of
domestic
bliss
to
betake
himself
away
at
the
first
rush
of
the
harem's
lord
*punct* ,
then
is
it
very
diverting
to
watch
that
lord
*punct* .
*break*
gently
he
insinuates
his
vast
bulk
among
them
again
and
revels
there
awhile
*punct* ,
still
in
tantalizing
vicinity
to
young
lothario
*punct* ,
like
pious
solomon
devoutly
worshipping
among
his
thousand
concubines
*punct* .
*break*
granting
other
whales
to
be
in
sight
*punct* ,
the
fishermen
will
seldom
give
chase
to
one
of
these
grand
turks
*punct* ;
for
these
grand
turks
are
too
lavish
of
their
strength
*punct* ,
and
hence
their
unctuousness
is
small
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
the
sons
and
the
daughters
they
beget
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
those
sons
and
daughters
must
take
care
of
themselves
*punct* ;
at
least
*punct* ,
with
only
the
maternal
help
*punct* .
*break*
for
like
certain
other
omnivorous
roving
lovers
that
might
be
named
*punct* ,
my
lord
whale
has
no
taste
for
the
nursery
*punct* ,
however
much
for
the
bower
*punct* ;
and
so
*punct* ,
being
a
great
traveller
*punct* ,
he
leaves
his
anonymous
babies
all
over
the
world
*punct* ;
every
baby
an
exotic
*punct* .
*break*
in
good
time
*punct* ,
nevertheless
*punct* ,
as
the
ardor
of
youth
declines
*punct* ;
as
years
and
dumps
increase
*punct* ;
as
reflection
lends
her
solemn
pauses
*punct* ;
in
short
*punct* ,
as
a
general
lassitude
overtakes
the
sated
turk
*punct* ;
then
a
love
of
ease
and
virtue
supplants
the
love
for
maidens
*punct* ;
our
ottoman
enters
upon
the
impotent
*punct* ,
repentant
*punct* ,
admonitory
stage
of
life
*punct* ,
forswears
*punct* ,
disbands
the
harem
*punct* ,
and
grown
to
an
exemplary
*punct* ,
sulky
old
soul
*punct* ,
goes
about
all
alone
among
the
meridians
and
parallels
saying
his
prayers
*punct* ,
and
warning
each
young
leviathan
from
his
amorous
errors
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
as
the
harem
of
whales
is
called
by
the
fishermen
a
school
*punct* ,
so
is
the
lord
and
master
of
that
school
technically
known
as
the
schoolmaster
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
therefore
not
in
strict
character
*punct* ,
however
admirably
satirical
*punct* ,
that
after
going
to
school
himself
*punct* ,
he
should
then
go
abroad
inculcating
not
what
he
learned
there
*punct* ,
but
the
folly
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
secludedness
and
isolation
to
which
the
schoolmaster
whale
betakes
himself
in
his
advancing
years
*punct* ,
is
true
of
all
aged
sperm
whales
*punct* .
*break*
almost
universally
*punct* ,
a
lone
whale
*punct* ,
as
a
solitary
leviathan
is
called
*punct* ,
proves
an
ancient
one
*punct* .
*break*
like
venerable
moss-bearded
daniel
boone
*punct* ,
he
will
have
no
one
near
him
but
nature
herself
*punct* ;
and
her
he
takes
to
wife
in
the
wilderness
of
waters
*punct* ,
and
the
best
of
wives
she
is
*punct* ,
though
she
keeps
so
many
moody
secrets
*punct* .
*break*
the
schools
composing
none
but
young
and
vigorous
males
*punct* ,
previously
mentioned
*punct* ,
offer
a
strong
contrast
to
the
harem
schools
*punct* .
*break*
for
while
those
female
whales
are
characteristically
timid
*punct* ,
the
young
males
*punct* ,
or
forty-barrel-bulls
*punct* ,
as
they
call
them
*punct* ,
are
by
far
the
most
pugnacious
of
all
leviathans
*punct* ,
and
proverbially
the
most
dangerous
to
encounter
*punct* ;
excepting
those
wondrous
grey-headed
*punct* ,
grizzled
whales
*punct* ,
sometimes
met
*punct* ,
and
these
will
fight
you
like
grim
fiends
exasperated
by
a
penal
gout
*punct* .
*break*
the
forty-barrel-bull
schools
are
larger
than
the
harem
schools
*punct* .
*break*
like
a
mob
of
young
collegians
*punct* ,
they
are
full
of
fight
*punct* ,
fun

and
wickedness

tumbling

at
such
a
reckless
*punct* ,
rollicking
rate
*punct* ,
that
no
prudent
underwriter
would
insure
them
any
more
than
he
would
a
riotous
lad
at
yale
or
harvard
*punct* .
*break*
they
soon
relinquish
this
turbulence
though
*punct* ,
and
when
about
three
fourths
grown
*punct* ,
break
up
*punct* ,
and
separately
go
about
in
quest
of
settlements
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
harems
*punct* .
*break*
another
point
of
difference
between
the
male
and
female
schools
is
still
more
characteristic
of
the
sexes
*punct* .

say
you
strike
a
forty-barrel-bull

poor
devil

all
his
comrades
quit

*break*
it
frequently
happens
that
when
several
ships
are
cruising
in
company
*punct* ,
a
whale
may
be
struck
by
one
vessel
*punct* ,
then
escape
*punct* ,
and
be
finally
killed
and
captured
by
another
vessel
*punct* ;
and
herein
are
indirectly
comprised
many
minor
contingencies
*punct* ,
all
partaking
of
this
one
grand
feature
*punct* .
*break*
for
example,
*punct* ,
after
a
weary
and
perilous
chase
and
capture
of
a
whale
*punct* ,
the
body
may
get
loose
from
the
ship
by
reason
of
a
violent
storm
*punct* ;
and
drifting
far
away
to
leeward
*punct* ,
be
retaken
by
a
second
whaler
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
in
a
calm
*punct* ,
snugly
tows
it
alongside
*punct* ,
without
risk
of
life
or
line
*punct* .
*break*
thus
the
most
vexatious
and
violent
disputes
would
often
arise
between
the
fishermen
*punct* ,
were
there
not
some
written
or
unwritten
*punct* ,
universal
*punct* ,
undisputed
law
applicable
to
all
cases
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
the
only
formal
whaling
code
authorized
by
legislative
enactment
*punct* ,
was
that
of
holland
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
decreed
by
the
states-general
in
a
*punct* .
*break*
but
though
no
other
nation
has
ever
had
any
written
whaling
law
*punct* ,
yet
the
american
fishermen
have
been
their
own
legislators
and
lawyers
in
this
matter
*punct* .
*break*
they
have
provided
a
system
which
for
terse
comprehensiveness
surpasses
justinian's
pandects
and
the
by-laws
of
the
chinese
society
for
the
suppression
of
meddling
with
other
people's
business
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ;
these
laws
might
be
engraven
on
a
queen
anne's
farthing
*punct* ,
or
the
barb
of
a
harpoon
*punct* ,
and
worn
round
the
neck
*punct* ,
so
small
are
they
*punct* .
*break*
a
fast-fish
belongs
to
the
party
fast
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
a
loose-fish
is
fair
game
for
anybody
who
can
soonest
catch
it
*punct* .
*break*
first
*punct* :
what
is
a
fast-fish
*punct* ?
*break*
alive
or
dead
a
fish
is
technically
fast
*punct* ,
when
it
is
connected
with
an
occupied
ship
or
boat
*punct* ,
by
any
medium
at
all
controllable
by
the
occupant
or
occupants,
*punct* ,
a
mast
*punct* ,
an
oar
*punct* ,
a
nine-inch
cable
*punct* ,
a
telegraph
wire
*punct* ,
or
a
strand
of
cobweb
*punct* ,
it
is
all
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
likewise
a
fish
is
technically
fast
when
it
bears
a
waif
*punct* ,
or
any
other
recognised
symbol
of
possession
*punct* ;
so
long
as
the
party
waifing
it
plainly
evince
their
ability
at
any
time
to
take
it
alongside
*punct* ,
as
well
as
their
intention
so
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
these
are
scientific
commentaries
*punct* ;
but
the
commentaries
of
the
whalemen
themselves
sometimes
consist
in
hard
words
and
harder
knocks
*punct* ,
the
coke-upon-littleton
of
the
fist
*punct* .
*break*
true
*punct* ,
among
the
more
upright
and
honorable
whalemen
allowances
are
always
made
for
peculiar
cases
*punct* ,
where
it
would
be
an
outrageous
moral
injustice
for
one
party
to
claim
possession
of
a
whale
previously
chased
or
killed
by
another
party
*punct* .
*break*
but
others
are
by
no
means
so
scrupulous
*punct* .
*break*
some
fifty
years
ago
there
was
a
curious
case
of
whale-trover
litigated
in
england
*punct* ,
wherein
the
plaintiffs
set
forth
that
after
a
hard
chase
of
a
whale
in
the
northern
seas
*punct* ;
and
when
indeed
they
*punct* ,
the
plaintiffs
*punct* ,
had
succeeded
in
harpooning
the
fish
*punct* ;
they
were
at
last
*punct* ,
through
peril
of
their
lives
*punct* ,
obliged
to
forsake
not
only
their
lines
*punct* ,
but
their
boat
itself
*punct* .
*break*
ultimately
the
defendants
*punct* ,
the
crew
of
another
ship
*punct* ,
came
up
with
the
whale
*punct* ,
struck
*punct* ,
killed
*punct* ,
seized
*punct* ,
and
finally
appropriated
it
before
the
very
eyes
of
the
plaintiffs
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
those
defendants
were
remonstrated
with
*punct* ,
their
captain
snapped
his
fingers
in
the
plaintiffs
teeth
*punct* ,
and
assured
them
that
by
way
of
doxology
to
the
deed
he
had
done
*punct* ,
he
would
now
retain
their
line
*punct* ,
harpoons
*punct* ,
and
boat
*punct* ,
which
had
remained
attached
to
the
whale
at
the
time
of
the
seizure
*punct* .
*break*
wherefore
the
plaintiffs
now
sued
for
the
recovery
of
the
value
of
their
whale
*punct* ,
line
*punct* ,
harpoons
*punct* ,
and
boat
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
erskine
was
counsel
for
the
defendants
*punct* ;
lord
ellenborough
was
the
judge
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
course
of
the
defence
*punct* ,
the
witty
erskine
went
on
to
illustrate
his
position
*punct* ,
by
alluding
to
a
recent
crim
*punct* .
*break*
erskine
was
on
the
other
side
*punct* ;
and
he
then
supported
it
by
saying
*punct* ,
that
though
the
gentleman
had
originally
harpooned
the
lady
*punct* ,
and
had
once
had
her
fast
*punct* ,
and
only
by
reason
of
the
great
stress
of
her
plunging
viciousness
*punct* ,
had
as
last
abandoned
her
*punct* ;
yet
abandon
her
he
did
*punct* ,
so
that
she
became
a
loose-fish
*punct* ;
and
therefore
when
a
subsequent
gentleman
re-harpooned
her
*punct* ,
the
lady
then
became
that
subsequent
gentleman's
property
*punct* ,
along
with
whatever
harpoon
might
have
been
found
sticking
in
her
*punct* .
*break*
now
in
the
present
case
erskine
contended
that
the
examples
of
the
whale
and
the
lady
were
reciprocally
illustrative
of
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
these
pleadings
*punct* ,
and
the
counter
pleadings
*punct* ,
being
duly
heard
*punct* ,
the
very
learned
judge
in
set
terms
decided
*punct* ,
to
wit,
*punct* ,
that
as
for
the
boat
*punct* ,
he
awarded
it
to
the
plaintiffs
*punct* ,
because
they
had
merely
abandoned
it
to
save
their
lives
*punct* ;
but
that
with
regard
to
the
controverted
whale
*punct* ,
harpoons
*punct* ,
and
line
*punct* ,
they
belonged
to
the
defendants
*punct* ;
the
whale
*punct* ,
because
it
was
a
loose-fish
at
the
time
of
the
final
capture
*punct* ;
and
the
harpoons
and
line
because
when
the
fish
made
off
with
them
*punct* ,
it
*punct* ,
the
fish
*punct* ,
acquired
a
property
in
those
articles
*punct* ;
and
hence
anybody
who
afterwards
took
the
fish
had
a
right
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
now
the
defendants
afterwards
took
the
fish
*punct* ;
ergo
*punct* ,
the
aforesaid
articles
were
theirs
*punct* .
*break*
a
common
man
looking
at
this
decision
of
the
very
learned
judge
*punct* ,
might
possibly
object
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
ploughed
up
to
the
primary
rock
of
the
matter
*punct* ,
the
two
great
principles
laid
down
in
the
twin
whaling
laws
previously
quoted
*punct* ,
and
applied
and
elucidated
by
lord
ellenborough
in
the
above
cited
case
*punct* ;
these
two
laws
touching
fast-fish
and
loose-fish
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
will
*punct* ,
on
reflection
*punct* ,
be
found
the
fundamentals
of
all
human
jurisprudence
*punct* ;
for
notwithstanding
its
complicated
tracery
of
sculpture
*punct* ,
the
temple
of
the
law
*punct* ,
like
the
temple
of
the
philistines
*punct* ,
has
but
two
props
to
stand
on
*punct* .
*break*
is
it
not
a
saying
in
every
one's
mouth
*punct* ,
possession
is
half
of
the
law
*punct* :
that
is
*punct* ,
regardless
of
how
the
thing
came
into
possession
*punct* ?
*break*
but
often
possession
is
the
whole
of
the
law
*punct* .
*break*
what

what

bankrupt
*punct* ,
on
a
loan

keep
woebegone's
family

starvation
*punct* ;

that
ruinous
discount

and
concerning
all
these

is
not
possession
the
whole
of
the
law
*punct* ?

the
doctrine

fast-fish
be
pretty
generally
applicable

the
kindred
doctrine

loose-fish

still
more
widely
so

applicable

latin
from
the
books
of
the
laws
of
england
*punct* ,
which
taken
along
with
the
context

means
*punct* ,
that
of
all
whales
captured
by
anybody
on
the
coast
of

the
king

apple

intermediate
remainder

now
as
this
law
*punct* ,
under
a
modified
form
*punct* ,
is
to
this
day
in
force
in
england
*punct* ;
and
as
it
offers
in
various
respects
a
strange
anomaly
touching
the
general
law
of
fast
and
loose-fish
*punct* ,
it
is
here
treated
of
in
a
separate
chapter
*punct* ,
on
the
same
courteous
principle
that
prompts
the
english
railways
to
be
at
the
expense
of
a
separate
car
*punct* ,
specially
reserved
for
the
accommodation
of
royalty
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
first
place
*punct* ,
in
curious
proof
of
the
fact
that
the
above-mentioned
law
is
still
in
force
*punct* ,
i
proceed
to
lay
before
you
a
circumstance
that
happened
within
the
last
two
years
*punct* .
*break*
it
seems
that
some
honest
mariners
of
dover
*punct* ,
or
sandwich
*punct* ,
or
some
one
of
the
cinque
ports
*punct* ,
had
after
a
hard
chase
succeeded
in
killing
and
beaching
a
fine
whale
which
they
had
originally
descried
afar
off
from
the
shore
*punct* .
*break*
now
the
cinque
ports
are
partially
or
somehow
under
the
jurisdiction
of
a
sort
of
policeman
or
beadle
*punct* ,
called
a
lord
warden
*punct* .
*break*
holding
the
office
directly
from
the
crown
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
all
the
royal
emoluments
incident
to
the
cinque
port
territories
become
by
assignment
his
*punct* .
*break*
by
some
writers
this
office
is
called
a
sinecure
*punct* .
*break*
but
not
so
*punct* .
*break*
because
the
lord
warden
is
busily
employed
at
times
in
fobbing
his
perquisites
*punct* ;
which
are
his
chiefly
by
virtue
of
that
same
fobbing
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
this
fish
*punct* ,
my
masters
*punct* ,
is
a
fast-fish
*punct* .
*break*
i
seize
it
as
the
lord
warden's
*punct* .
*break*
upon
this
the
poor
mariners
in
their
respectful
consternation
*punct* ,
so
truly
english
*punct* ,
knowing
not
what
to
say
*punct* ,
fall
to
vigorously
scratching
their
heads
all
round
*punct* ;
meanwhile
ruefully
glancing
from
the
whale
to
the
stranger
*punct* .
*break*
but
that
did
in
nowise
mend
the
matter
*punct* ,
or
at
all
soften
the
hard
heart
of
the
learned
gentleman
with
the
copy
of
blackstone
*punct* .
*break*
at
length
one
of
them
*punct* ,
after
long
scratching
about
for
his
ideas
*punct* ,
made
bold
to
speak
*punct* .
*break*
please
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
who
is
the
lord
warden
*punct* ?
*break*
but
the
duke
had
nothing
to
do
with
taking
this
fish
*punct* ?
*break*
it
is
his
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
been
at
great
trouble
*punct* ,
and
peril
*punct* ,
and
some
expense
*punct* ,
and
is
all
that
to
go
to
the
duke's
benefit
*punct* ;
we
getting
nothing
at
all
for
our
pains
but
our
blisters
*punct* ?
*break*
it
is
his
*punct* .
*break*
is
the
duke
so
very
poor
as
to
be
forced
to
this
desperate
mode
of
getting
a
livelihood
*punct* ?
*break*
it
is
his
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
to
relieve
my
old
bed-ridden
mother
by
part
of
my
share
of
this
whale
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
his
*punct* .
*break*
won't
the
duke
be
content
with
a
quarter
or
a
half
*punct* ?
*break*
it
is
his
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
word
*punct* ,
the
whale
was
seized
and
sold
*punct* ,
and
his
grace
the
duke
of
wellington
received
the
money
*punct* .
*break*
to
which
my
lord
duke
in
substance
replied
*punct* ,
both
letters
were
published
*punct* ,
that
he
had
already
done
so
*punct* ,
and
received
the
money
*punct* ,
and
would
be
obliged
to
the
reverend
gentleman
if
for
the
future
he
*punct* ,
the
reverend
gentleman
*punct* ,
would
decline
meddling
with
other
people's
business
*punct* .
*break*
is
this
the
still
militant
old
man
*punct* ,
standing
at
the
corners
of
the
three
kingdoms
*punct* ,
on
all
hands
coercing
alms
of
beggars
*punct* ?
*break*
it
will
readily
be
seen
that
in
this
case
the
alleged
right
of
the
duke
to
the
whale
was
a
delegated
one
from
the
sovereign
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
needs
inquire
then
on
what
principle
the
sovereign
is
originally
invested
with
that
right
*punct* .
*break*
the
law
itself
has
already
been
set
forth
*punct* .
*break*
but
plowdon
gives
us
the
reason
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
says
plowdon
*punct* ,
the
whale
so
caught
belongs
to
the
king
and
queen
*punct* ,
because
of
its
superior
excellence
*punct* .
*break*
and
by
the
soundest
commentators
this
has
ever
been
held
a
cogent
argument
in
such
matters
*punct* .
*break*
but
why
should
the
king
have
the
head
*punct* ,
and
the
queen
the
tail
*punct* ?
*break*
a
reason
for
that
*punct* ,
ye
lawyers
*punct* !
*break*
in
his
treatise
on
queen-gold
*punct* ,
or
queen-pinmoney
*punct* ,
an
old
king's
bench
author
*punct* ,
one
william
prynne
*punct* ,
thus
discourseth
*punct* :
ye
tail
is
ye
queen's
*punct* ,
that
ye
queen's
wardrobe
may
be
supplied
with
ye
whalebone
*punct* .
*break*
now
this
was
written
at
a
time
when
the
black
limber
bone
of
the
greenland
or
right
whale
was
largely
used
in
ladies
bodices
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
same
bone
is
not
in
the
tail
*punct* ;
it
is
in
the
head
*punct* ,
which
is
a
sad
mistake
for
a
sagacious
lawyer
like
prynne
*punct* .
*break*
but
is
the
queen
a
mermaid
*punct* ,
to
be
presented
with
a
tail
*punct* ?
*break*
an
allegorical
meaning
may
lurk
here
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
two
royal
fish
so
styled
by
the
english
law
writers
*punct* ,
the
whale
and
the
sturgeon
*punct* ;
both
royal
property
under
certain
limitations
*punct* ,
and
nominally
supplying
the
tenth
branch
of
the
crown's
ordinary
revenue
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
not
that
any
other
author
has
hinted
of
the
matter
*punct* ;
but
by
inference
it
seems
to
me
that
the
sturgeon
must
be
divided
in
the
same
way
as
the
whale
*punct* ,
the
king
receiving
the
highly
dense
and
elastic
head
peculiar
to
that
fish
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
symbolically
regarded
*punct* ,
may
possibly
be
humorously
grounded
upon
some
presumed
congeniality
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
week
or
two
after
the
last
whaling
scene
recounted
*punct* ,
and
when
we
were
slowly
sailing
over
a
sleepy
*punct* ,
vapory
*punct* ,
mid-day
sea
*punct* ,
that
the
many
noses
on
the
pequod's
deck
proved
more
vigilant
discoverers
than
the
three
pairs
of
eyes
aloft
*punct* .
*break*
a
peculiar
and
not
very
pleasant
smell
was
smelt
in
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
bet
something
now
*punct* ,
said
stubb
*punct* ,
that
somewhere
hereabouts
are
some
of
those
drugged
whales
we
tickled
the
other
day
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
they
would
keel
up
before
long
*punct* .
*break*
presently
*punct* ,
the
vapors
in
advance
slid
aside
*punct* ;
and
there
in
the
distance
lay
a
ship
*punct* ,
whose
furled
sails
betokened
that
some
sort
of
whale
must
be
alongside
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
glided
nearer
*punct* ,
the
stranger
showed
french
colors
from
his
peak
*punct* ;
and
by
the
eddying
cloud
of
vulture
sea-fowl
that
circled
*punct* ,
and
hovered
*punct* ,
and
swooped
around
him
*punct* ,
it
was
plain
that
the
whale
alongside
must
be
what
the
fishermen
call
a
blasted
whale
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
a
whale
that
has
died
unmolested
on
the
sea
*punct* ,
and
so
floated
an
unappropriated
corpse
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
well
be
conceived
*punct* ,
what
an
unsavory
odor
such
a
mass
must
exhale
*punct* ;
worse
than
an
assyrian
city
in
the
plague
*punct* ,
when
the
living
are
incompetent
to
bury
the
departed
*punct* .
*break*
so
intolerable
indeed
is
it
regarded
by
some
*punct* ,
that
no
cupidity
could
persuade
them
to
moor
alongside
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
yet
are
there
those
who
will
still
do
it
*punct* ;
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
oil
obtained
from
such
subjects
is
of
a
very
inferior
quality
*punct* ,
and
by
no
means
of
the
nature
of
attar-of-rose
*punct* .
*break*
coming
still
nearer
with
the
expiring
breeze
*punct* ,
we
saw
that
the
frenchman
had
a
second
whale
alongside
*punct* ;
and
this
second
whale
seemed
even
more
of
a
nosegay
than
the
first
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
in
the
proper
place
we
shall
see
that
no
knowing
fisherman
will
ever
turn
up
his
nose
at
such
a
whale
as
this
*punct* ,
however
much
he
may
shun
blasted
whales
in
general
*punct* .
*break*
the
pequod
had
now
swept
so
nigh
to
the
stranger
*punct* ,
that
stubb
vowed
he
recognized
his
cutting
spade-pole
entangled
in
the
lines
that
were
knotted
round
the
tail
of
one
of
these
whales
*punct* .
*break*
there's
a
pretty
fellow
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
he
banteringly
laughed
*punct* ,
standing
in
the
ship's
bows
*punct* ,
there's
a
jackal
for
ye
*punct* !
*break*
i
well
know
that
these
crappoes
of
frenchmen
are
but
poor
devils
in
the
fishery
*punct* ;
sometimes
lowering
their
boats
for
breakers
*punct* ,
mistaking
them
for
sperm
whale
spouts
*punct* ;
yes
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
sailing
from
their
port
with
their
hold
full
of
boxes
of
tallow
candles
*punct* ,
and
cases
of
snuffers
*punct* ,
foreseeing
that
all
the
oil
they
will
get
won't
be
enough
to
dip
the
captain's
wick
into
*punct* ;
aye
*punct* ,
we
all
know
these
things
*punct* ;
but
look
ye
*punct* ,
here's
a
crappo
that
is
content
with
our
leavings
*punct* ,
the
drugged
whale
there
*punct* ,
i
mean
*punct* ;
aye
*punct* ,
and
is
content
too
with
scraping
the
dry
bones
of
that
other
precious
fish
he
has
there
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
*punct* ,
pass
round
a
hat
*punct* ,
some
one
*punct* ,
and
let's
make
him
a
present
of
a
little
oil
for
dear
charity's
sake
*punct* .
*break*
for
what
oil
he'll
get
from
that
drugged
whale
there
*punct* ,
wouldn't
be
fit
to
burn
in
a
jail
*punct* ;
no
*punct* ,
not
in
a
condemned
cell
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
for
the
other
whale
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
i'll
agree
to
get
more
oil
by
chopping
up
and
trying
out
these
three
masts
of
ours
*punct* ,
than
he'll
get
from
that
bundle
of
bones
*punct* ;
though
*punct* ,
now
that
i
think
of
it
*punct* ,
it
may
contain
something
worth
a
good
deal
more
than
oil
*punct* ;
yes
*punct* ,
ambergris
*punct* .
*break*
i
wonder
now
if
our
old
man
has
thought
of
that
*punct* .
*break*
it's
worth
trying
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i'm
for
it
*punct* ;
and
so
saying
he
started
for
the
quarter-deck
*punct* .
*break*
by
this
time
the
faint
air
had
become
a
complete
calm
*punct* ;
so
that
whether
or
no
*punct* ,
the
pequod
was
now
fairly
entrapped
in
the
smell
*punct* ,
with
no
hope
of
escaping
except
by
its
breezing
up
again
*punct* .
*break*
issuing
from
the
cabin
*punct* ,
stubb
now
called
his
boat's
crew
*punct* ,
and
pulled
off
for
the
stranger
*punct* .
*break*
upon
her
head
boards
*punct* ,
in
large
gilt
letters
*punct* ,
he
read
bouton
de
rose,
*punct* ,
rose-button
*punct* ,
or
rose-bud
*punct* ;
and
this
was
the
romantic
name
of
this
aromatic
ship
*punct* .
*break*
though
stubb
did
not
understand
the
bouton
part
of
the
inscription
*punct* ,
yet
the
word
rose
*punct* ,
and
the
bulbous
figure-head
put
together
*punct* ,
sufficiently
explained
the
whole
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
a
wooden
rose-bud
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
he
cried
with
his
hand
to
his
nose
*punct* ,
that
will
do
very
well
*punct* ;
but
how
like
all
creation
it
smells
*punct* !
*break*
now
in
order
to
hold
direct
communication
with
the
people
on
deck
*punct* ,
he
had
to
pull
round
the
bows
to
the
starboard
side
*punct* ,
and
thus
come
close
to
the
blasted
whale
*punct* ;
and
so
talk
over
it
*punct* .
*break*
arrived
then
at
this
spot
*punct* ,
with
one
hand
still
to
his
nose
*punct* ,
he
bawled
*punct* ,
bouton-de-rose
*punct* ,
ahoy
*punct* !
*break*
are
there
any
of
you
bouton-de-roses
that
speak
english
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
rejoined
a
guernsey-man
from
the
bulwarks
*punct* ,
who
turned
out
to
be
the
chief-mate
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
my
bouton-de-rose-bud
*punct* ,
have
you
seen
the
white
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
the
white
whale
*punct* ,
a
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
moby
dick
*punct* ,
have
ye
seen
him
*punct* ?
*break*
never
heard
of
such
a
whale
*punct* .
*break*
white
whale
*punct* ,
no
*punct* .
*break*
very
good
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ;
good
bye
now
*punct* ,
and
i'll
call
again
in
a
minute
*punct* .
*break*
then
rapidly
pulling
back
towards
the
pequod
*punct* ,
and
seeing
ahab
leaning
over
the
quarter-deck
rail
awaiting
his
report
*punct* ,
he
moulded
his
two
hands
into
a
trumpet
and
shouted
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
upon
which
ahab
retired
*punct* ,
and
stubb
returned
to
the
frenchman
*punct* .
*break*
he
now
perceived
that
the
guernsey-man
*punct* ,
who
had
just
got
into
the
chains
*punct* ,
and
was
using
a
cutting-spade
*punct* ,
had
slung
his
nose
in
a
sort
of
bag
*punct* .
*break*
what's
the
matter
with
your
nose
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ?
*break*
answered
the
guernsey-man
*punct* ,
who
did
not
seem
to
relish
the
job
he
was
at
very
much
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
are
you
holding
yours
for
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
nothing
*punct* !
*break*
it's
a
wax
nose
*punct* ;
i
have
to
hold
it
on
*punct* .
*break*
fine
day
*punct* ,
aint
it
*punct* ?
*break*
air
rather
gardenny
*punct* ,
i
should
say
*punct* ;
throw
us
a
bunch
of
posies
*punct* ,
will
ye
*punct* ,
bouton-de-rose
*punct* ?
*break*
what
in
the
devil's
name
do
you
want
here
*punct* ?
*break*
roared
the
guernsey-man
*punct* ,
flying
into
a
sudden
passion
*punct* .
*break*
keep
cool
*punct* ,
cool
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
that's
the
word
*punct* ;
why
don't
you
pack
those
whales
in
ice
while
you're
working
at
em
*punct* ?
*break*
but
joking
aside
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ;
do
you
know
*punct* ,
rose-bud
*punct* ,
that
it's
all
nonsense
trying
to
get
any
oil
out
of
such
whales
*punct* ?
*break*
as
for
that
dried
up
one
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ,
he
hasn't
a
gill
in
his
whole
carcase
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
that
well
enough
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
d'ye
see
*punct* ,
the
captain
here
won't
believe
it
*punct* ;
this
is
his
first
voyage
*punct* ;
he
was
a
cologne
manufacturer
before
*punct* .
*break*
but
come
aboard
*punct* ,
and
mayhap
he'll
believe
you
*punct* ,
if
he
won't
me
*punct* ;
and
so
i'll
get
out
of
this
dirty
scrape
*punct* .
*break*
anything
to
oblige
ye
*punct* ,
my
sweet
and
pleasant
fellow
*punct* ,
rejoined
stubb
*punct* ,
and
with
that
he
soon
mounted
to
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
there
a
queer
scene
presented
itself
*punct* .
*break*
the
sailors
*punct* ,
in
tasselled
caps
of
red
worsted
*punct* ,
were
getting
the
heavy
tackles
in
readiness
for
the
whales
*punct* .
*break*
but
they
worked
rather
slow
and
talked
very
fast
*punct* ,
and
seemed
in
anything
but
a
good
humor
*punct* .
*break*
all
their
noses
upwardly
projected
from
their
faces
like
so
many
jib-booms
*punct* .
*break*
now
and
then
pairs
of
them
would
drop
their
work
*punct* ,
and
run
up
to
the
mast-head
to
get
some
fresh
air
*punct* .
*break*
some
thinking
they
would
catch
the
plague
*punct* ,
dipped
oakum
in
coal-tar
*punct* ,
and
at
intervals
held
it
to
their
nostrils
*punct* .
*break*
others
having
broken
the
stems
of
their
pipes
almost
short
off
at
the
bowl
*punct* ,
were
vigorously
puffing
tobacco-smoke
*punct* ,
so
that
it
constantly
filled
their
olfactories
*punct* .
*break*
stubb
was
struck
by
a
shower
of
outcries
and
anathemas
proceeding
from
the
captain's
round-house
abaft
*punct* ;
and
looking
in
that
direction
saw
a
fiery
face
thrust
from
behind
the
door
*punct* ,
which
was
held
ajar
from
within
*punct* .
*break*
sounding
him
carefully
*punct* ,
stubb
further
perceived
that
the
guernsey-man
had
not
the
slightest
suspicion
concerning
the
ambergris
*punct* .
*break*
he
therefore
held
his
peace
on
that
head
*punct* ,
but
otherwise
was
quite
frank
and
confidential
with
him
*punct* ,
so
that
the
two
quickly
concocted
a
little
plan
for
both
circumventing
and
satirizing
the
captain
*punct* ,
without
his
at
all
dreaming
of
distrusting
their
sincerity
*punct* .
*break*
according
to
this
little
plan
of
theirs
*punct* ,
the
guernsey-man
*punct* ,
under
cover
of
an
interpreter's
office
*punct* ,
was
to
tell
the
captain
what
he
pleased
*punct* ,
but
as
coming
from
stubb
*punct* ;
and
as
for
stubb
*punct* ,
he
was
to
utter
any
nonsense
that
should
come
uppermost
in
him
during
the
interview
*punct* .
*break*
by
this
time
their
destined
victim
appeared
from
his
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
small
and
dark
*punct* ,
but
rather
delicate
looking
man
for
a
sea-captain
*punct* ,
with
large
whiskers
and
moustache
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ;
and
wore
a
red
cotton
velvet
vest
with
watch-seals
at
his
side
*punct* .
*break*
to
this
gentleman
*punct* ,
stubb
was
now
politely
introduced
by
the
guernsey-man
*punct* ,
who
at
once
ostentatiously
put
on
the
aspect
of
interpreting
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
what
shall
i
say
to
him
first
*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
said
stubb
*punct* ,
eyeing
the
velvet
vest
and
the
watch
and
seals
*punct* ,
you
may
as
well
begin
by
telling
him
that
he
looks
a
sort
of
babyish
to
me
*punct* ,
though
i
don't
pretend
to
be
a
judge
*punct* .
*break*
he
says
*punct* ,
monsieur
*punct* ,
said
the
guernsey-man
*punct* ,
in
french
*punct* ,
turning
to
his
captain
*punct* ,
that
only
yesterday
his
ship
spoke
a
vessel
*punct* ,
whose
captain
and
chief-mate
*punct* ,
with
six
sailors
*punct* ,
had
all
died
of
a
fever
caught
from
a
blasted
whale
they
had
brought
alongside
*punct* .
*break*
upon
this
the
captain
started
*punct* ,
and
eagerly
desired
to
know
more
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
guernsey-man
to
stubb
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
since
he
takes
it
so
easy
*punct* ,
tell
him
that
now
i
have
eyed
him
carefully
*punct* ,
i'm
quite
certain
that
he's
no
more
fit
to
command
a
whale-ship
than
a
st
*punct* .
*break*
instantly
the
captain
ran
forward
*punct* ,
and
in
a
loud
voice
commanded
his
crew
to
desist
from
hoisting
the
cutting-tackles
*punct* ,
and
at
once
cast
loose
the
cables
and
chains
confining
the
whales
to
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
guernsey-man
*punct* ,
when
the
captain
had
returned
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
let
me
see
*punct* ;
yes
*punct* ,
you
may
as
well
tell
him
now
that
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
in

him
i've
diddled
him
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
aside
to
himself
*punct* ,
perhaps
somebody
else
*punct* .
*break*
he
says
*punct* ,
monsieur
*punct* ,
that
he's
very
happy
to
have
been
of
any
service
to
us
*punct* .
*break*
hearing
this
*punct* ,
the
captain
vowed
that
they
were
the
grateful
parties
*punct* ,
meaning
himself
and
mate
*punct* ,
and
concluded
by
inviting
stubb
down
into
his
cabin
to
drink
a
bottle
of
bordeaux
*punct* .
*break*
he
wants
you
to
take
a
glass
of
wine
with
him
*punct* ,
said
the
interpreter
*punct* .
*break*
thank
him
heartily
*punct* ;
but
tell
him
it's
against
my
principles
to
drink
with
the
man
i've
diddled
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
tell
him
i
must
go
*punct* .
*break*
he
says
*punct* ,
monsieur
*punct* ,
that
his
principles
won't
admit
of
his
drinking
*punct* ;
but
that
if
monsieur
wants
to
live
another
day
to
drink
*punct* ,
then
monsieur
had
best
drop
all
four
boats
*punct* ,
and
pull
the
ship
away
from
these
whales
*punct* ,
for
it's
so
calm
they
won't
drift
*punct* .
*break*
by
this
time
stubb
was
over
the
side
*punct* ,
and
getting
into
his
boat
*punct* ,
hailed
the
guernsey-man
to
this
effect,
*punct* ,
that
having
a
long
tow-line
in
his
boat
*punct* ,
he
would
do
what
he
could
to
help
them
*punct* ,
by
pulling
out
the
lighter
whale
of
the
two
from
the
ship's
side
*punct* .
*break*
while
the
frenchman's
boats
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
were
engaged
in
towing
the
ship
one
way
*punct* ,
stubb
benevolently
towed
away
at
his
whale
the
other
way
*punct* ,
ostentatiously
slacking
out
a
most
unusually
long
tow-line
*punct* .
*break*
presently
a
breeze
sprang
up
*punct* ;
stubb
feigned
to
cast
off
from
the
whale
*punct* ;
hoisting
his
boats
*punct* ,
the
frenchman
soon
increased
his
distance
*punct* ,
while
the
pequod
slid
in
between
him
and
stubb's
whale
*punct* .
*break*
seizing
his
sharp
boat-spade
*punct* ,
he
commenced
an
excavation
in
the
body
*punct* ,
a
little
behind
the
side
fin
*punct* .
*break*
you
would
almost
have
thought
he
was
digging
a
cellar
there
in
the
sea
*punct* ;
and
when
at
length
his
spade
struck
against
the
gaunt
ribs
*punct* ,
it
was
like
turning
up
old
roman
tiles
and
pottery
buried
in
fat
english
loam
*punct* .
*break*
his
boat's
crew
were
all
in
high
excitement
*punct* ,
eagerly
helping
their
chief
*punct* ,
and
looking
as
anxious
as
gold-hunters
*punct* .
*break*
and
all
the
time
numberless
fowls
were
diving
*punct* ,
and
ducking
*punct* ,
and
screaming
*punct* ,
and
yelling
*punct* ,
and
fighting
around
them
*punct* .
*break*
stubb
was
beginning
to
look
disappointed
*punct* ,
especially
as
the
horrible
nosegay
increased
*punct* ,
when
suddenly
from
out
the
very
heart
of
this
plague
*punct* ,
there
stole
a
faint
stream
of
perfume
*punct* ,
which
flowed
through
the
tide
of
bad
smells
without
being
absorbed
by
it
*punct* ,
as
one
river
will
flow
into
and
then
along
with
another
*punct* ,
without
at
all
blending
with
it
for
a
time
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
it
*punct* ,
i
have
it
*punct* ,
cried
stubb
*punct* ,
with
delight
*punct* ,
striking
something
in
the
subterranean
regions
*punct* ,
a
purse
*punct* !
*break*
dropping
his
spade
*punct* ,
he
thrust
both
hands
in
*punct* ,
and
drew
out
handfuls
of
something
that
looked
like
ripe
windsor
soap
*punct* ,
or
rich
mottled
old
cheese
*punct* ;
very
unctuous
and
savory
withal
*punct* .
*break*
you
might
easily
dent
it
with
your
thumb
*punct* ;
it
is
of
a
hue
between
yellow
and
ash
color
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
*punct* ,
good
friends
*punct* ,
is
ambergris
*punct* ,
worth
a
gold
guinea
an
ounce
to
any
druggist
*punct* .
*break*
for
at
that
time
*punct* ,
and
indeed
until
a
comparatively
late
day
*punct* ,
the
precise
origin
of
ambergris
remained
*punct* ,
like
amber
itself
*punct* ,
a
problem
to
the
learned
*punct* .
*break*
though
the
word
ambergris
is
but
the
french
compound
for
grey
amber
*punct* ,
yet
the
two
substances
are
quite
distinct
*punct* .
*break*
for
amber
*punct* ,
though
at
times
found
on
the
sea-coast
*punct* ,
is
also
dug
up
in
some
far
inland
soils
*punct* ,
whereas
ambergris
is
never
found
except
upon
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
amber
is
a
hard
*punct* ,
transparent
*punct* ,
brittle
*punct* ,
odorless
substance
*punct* ,
used
for
mouth-pieces
to
pipes
*punct* ,
for
beads
and
ornaments
*punct* ;
but
ambergris
is
soft
*punct* ,
waxy
*punct* ,
and
so
highly
fragrant
and
spicy
*punct* ,
that
it
is
largely
used
in
perfumery
*punct* ,
in
pastiles
*punct* ,
precious
candles
*punct* ,
hair-powders
*punct* ,
and
pomatum
*punct* .
*break*
the
turks
use
it
in
cooking
*punct* ,
and
also
carry
it
to
mecca
*punct* ,
for
the
same
purpose
that
frankincense
is
carried
to
st
*punct* .
*break*
peter's
in
rome
*punct* .
*break*
some
wine
merchants
drop
a
few
grains
into
claret
*punct* ,
to
flavor
it
*punct* .
*break*
who
would
think
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
that
such
fine
ladies
and
gentlemen
should
regale
themselves
with
an
essence
found
in
the
inglorious
bowels
of
a
sick
whale
*punct* !
*break*
yet
so
it
is
*punct* .
*break*
by
some
*punct* ,
ambergris
is
supposed
to
be
the
cause
*punct* ,
and
by
others
the
effect
*punct* ,
of
the
dyspepsia
in
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
how
to
cure
such
a
dyspepsia
it
were
hard
to
say
*punct* ,
unless
by
administering
three
or
four
boat
loads
of
brandreth's
pills
*punct* ,
and
then
running
out
of
harm's
way
*punct* ,
as
laborers
do
in
blasting
rocks
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
forgotten
to
say
that
there
were
found
in
this
ambergris
*punct* ,
certain
hard
*punct* ,
round
*punct* ,
bony
plates
*punct* ,
which
at
first
stubb
thought
might
be
sailors
trousers
buttons
*punct* ;
but
it
afterwards
turned
out
that
they
were
nothing
more
than
pieces
of
small
squid
bones
embalmed
in
that
manner
*punct* .
*break*
now
that
the
incorruption
of
this
most
fragrant
ambergris
should
be
found
in
the
heart
of
such
decay
*punct* ;
is
this
nothing
*punct* ?
*break*
bethink
thee
of
that
saying
of
st
*punct* .
*break*
paul
in
corinthians
*punct* ,
about
corruption
and
incorruption
*punct* ;
how
that
we
are
sown
in
dishonor
*punct* ,
but
raised
in
glory
*punct* .
*break*
and
likewise
call
to
mind
that
saying
of
paracelsus
about
what
it
is
that
maketh
the
best
musk
*punct* .
*break*
also
forget
not
the
strange
fact
that
of
all
things
of
ill-savor
*punct* ,
cologne-water
*punct* ,
in
its
rudimental
manufacturing
stages
*punct* ,
is
the
worst
*punct* .
*break*
elsewhere
in
this
volume
the
slanderous
aspersion
has
been
disproved
*punct* ,
that
the
vocation
of
whaling
is
throughout
a
slatternly
*punct* ,
untidy
business
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
is
another
thing
to
rebut
*punct* .
*break*
they
hint
that
all
whales
always
smell
bad
*punct* .
*break*
now
how
did
this
odious
stigma
originate
*punct* ?
*break*
i
opine
*punct* ,
that
it
is
plainly
traceable
to
the
first
arrival
of
the
greenland
whaling
ships
in
london
*punct* ,
more
than
two
centuries
ago
*punct* .
*break*
because
those
whalemen
did
not
then
*punct* ,
and
do
not
now
*punct* ,
try
out
their
oil
at
sea
as
the
southern
ships
have
always
done
*punct* ;
but
cutting
up
the
fresh
blubber
in
small
bits
*punct* ,
thrust
it
through
the
bung
holes
of
large
casks
*punct* ,
and
carry
it
home
in
that
manner
*punct* ;
the
shortness
of
the
season
in
those
icy
seas
*punct* ,
and
the
sudden
and
violent
storms
to
which
they
are
exposed
*punct* ,
forbidding
any
other
course
*punct* .
*break*
the
consequence
is
*punct* ,
that
upon
breaking
into
the
hold
*punct* ,
and
unloading
one
of
these
whale
cemeteries
*punct* ,
in
the
greenland
dock
*punct* ,
a
savor
is
given
forth
somewhat
similar
to
that
arising
from
excavating
an
old
city
grave-yard
*punct* ,
for
the
foundations
of
a
lying-in
hospital
*punct* .
*break*
i
partly
surmise
also
*punct* ,
that
this
wicked
charge
against
whalers
may
be
likewise
imputed
to
the
existence
on
the
coast
of
greenland
*punct* ,
in
former
times
*punct* ,
of
a
dutch
village
called
schmerenburgh
or
smeerenberg
*punct* ,
which
latter
name
is
the
one
used
by
the
learned
fogo
von
slack
*punct* ,
in
his
great
work
on
smells
*punct* ,
a
textbook
on
that
subject
*punct* .
*break*
as
its
name
imports
*punct* ,
smeer
*punct* ,
fat
*punct* ;
berg
*punct* ,
to
put
up
*punct* ,
this
village
was
founded
in
order
to
afford
a
place
for
the
blubber
of
the
dutch
whale
fleet
to
be
tried
out
*punct* ,
without
being
taken
home
to
holland
for
that
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
collection
of
furnaces
*punct* ,
fat-kettles
*punct* ,
and
oil
sheds
*punct* ;
and
when
the
works
were
in
full
operation
certainly
gave
forth
no
very
pleasant
savor
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
this
is
quite
different
from
a
south
sea
sperm
whaler
*punct* ;
which
in
a
voyage
of
four
years
perhaps
*punct* ,
after
completely
filling
her
hold
with
oil
*punct* ,
does
not
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
consume
fifty
days
in
the
business
of
boiling
out
*punct* ;
and
in
the
state
that
it
is
casked
*punct* ,
the
oil
is
nearly
scentless
*punct* .
*break*
nor
indeed
can
the
whale
possibly
be
otherwise
than
fragrant
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
as
a
general
thing
*punct* ,
he
enjoys
such
high
health
*punct* ;
taking
abundance
of
exercise
*punct* ;
always
out
of
doors
*punct* ;
though
*punct* ,
it
is
true
*punct* ,
seldom
in
the
open
air
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
*punct* ,
that
the
motion
of
a
sperm
whale's
flukes
above
water
dispenses
a
perfume
*punct* ,
as
when
a
musk-scented
lady
rustles
her
dress
in
a
warm
parlor
*punct* .
*break*
what
then
shall
i
liken
the
sperm
whale
to
for
fragrance
*punct* ,
considering
his
magnitude
*punct* ?
*break*
must
it
not
be
to
that
famous
elephant
*punct* ,
with
jewelled
tusks
*punct* ,
and
redolent
with
myrrh
*punct* ,
which
was
led
out
of
an
indian
town
to
do
honor
to
alexander
the
great
*punct* ?
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
the
whale
ship
*punct* ,
it
is
not
every
one
that
goes
in
the
boats
*punct* .
*break*
some
few
hands
are
reserved
called
ship-keepers
*punct* ,
whose
province
it
is
to
work
the
vessel
while
the
boats
are
pursuing
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
as
a
general
thing
*punct* ,
these
ship-keepers
are
as
hardy
fellows
as
the
men
comprising
the
boats
crews
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
there
happen
to
be
an
unduly
slender
*punct* ,
clumsy
*punct* ,
or
timorous
wight
in
the
ship
*punct* ,
that
wight
is
certain
to
be
made
a
ship-keeper
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
so
in
the
pequod
with
the
little
negro
pippin
by
nick-name
*punct* ,
pip
by
abbreviation
*punct* .
*break*
but
while
hapless
dough-boy
was
by
nature
dull
and
torpid
in
his
intellects
*punct* ,
pip
*punct* ,
though
over
tender-hearted
*punct* ,
was
at
bottom
very
bright
*punct* ,
with
that
pleasant
*punct* ,
genial
*punct* ,
jolly
brightness
peculiar
to
his
tribe
*punct* ;
a
tribe
*punct* ,
which
ever
enjoy
all
holidays
and
festivities
with
finer
*punct* ,
freer
relish
than
any
other
race
*punct* .
*break*
for
blacks
*punct* ,
the
year's
calendar
should
show
naught
but
three
hundred
and
sixty-five
fourth
of
julys
and
new
year's
days
*punct* .
*break*
nor
smile
so
*punct* ,
while
i
write
that
this
little
black
was
brilliant
*punct* ,
for
even
blackness
has
its
brilliancy
*punct* ;
behold
yon
lustrous
ebony
*punct* ,
panelled
in
king's
cabinets
*punct* .
*break*
but
pip
loved
life
*punct* ,
and
all
life's
peaceable
securities
*punct* ;
so
that
the
panic-striking
business
in
which
he
had
somehow
unaccountably
become
entrapped
*punct* ,
had
most
sadly
blurred
his
brightness
*punct* ;
though
*punct* ,
as
ere
long
will
be
seen
*punct* ,
what
was
thus
temporarily
subdued
in
him
*punct* ,
in
the
end
was
destined
to
be
luridly
illumined
by
strange
wild
fires
*punct* ,
that
fictitiously
showed
him
off
to
ten
times
the
natural
lustre
with
which
in
his
native
tolland
county
in
connecticut
*punct* ,
he
had
once
enlivened
many
a
fiddler's
frolic
on
the
green
*punct* ;
and
at
melodious
even-tide
*punct* ,
with
his
gay
ha-ha
*punct* !
*break*
had
turned
the
round
horizon
into
one
star-belled
tambourine
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
though
in
the
clear
air
of
day
*punct* ,
suspended
against
a
blue-veined
neck
*punct* ,
the
pure-watered
diamond
drop
will
healthful
glow
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
when
the
cunning
jeweller
would
show
you
the
diamond
in
its
most
impressive
lustre
*punct* ,
he
lays
it
against
a
gloomy
ground
*punct* ,
and
then
lights
it
up
*punct* ,
not
by
the
sun
*punct* ,
but
by
some
unnatural
gases
*punct* .
*break*
then
come
out
those
fiery
effulgences
*punct* ,
infernally
superb
*punct* ;
then
the
evil-blazing
diamond
*punct* ,
once
the
divinest
symbol
of
the
crystal
skies
*punct* ,
looks
like
some
crown-jewel
stolen
from
the
king
of
hell
*punct* .
*break*
but
let
us
to
the
story
*punct* .
*break*
it
came
to
pass
*punct* ,
that
in
the
ambergris
affair
stubb's
after-oarsman
chanced
so
to
sprain
his
hand
*punct* ,
as
for
a
time
to
become
quite
maimed
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
temporarily
*punct* ,
pip
was
put
into
his
place
*punct* .
*break*
now
upon
the
second
lowering
*punct* ,
the
boat
paddled
upon
the
whale
*punct* ;
and
as
the
fish
received
the
darted
iron
*punct* ,
it
gave
its
customary
rap
*punct* ,
which
happened
*punct* ,
in
this
instance
*punct* ,
to
be
right
under
poor
pip's
seat
*punct* .
*break*
the
involuntary
consternation
of
the
moment
caused
him
to
leap
*punct* ,
paddle
in
hand
*punct* ,
out
of
the
boat
*punct* ;
and
in
such
a
way
*punct* ,
that
part
of
the
slack
whale
line
coming
against
his
chest
*punct* ,
he
breasted
it
overboard
with
him
*punct* ,
so
as
to
become
entangled
in
it
*punct* ,
when
at
last
plumping
into
the
water
*punct* .
*break*
that
instant
the
stricken
whale
started
on
a
fierce
run
*punct* ,
the
line
swiftly
straightened
*punct* ;
and
presto
*punct* !
*break*
poor
pip
came
all
foaming
up
to
the
chocks
of
the
boat
*punct* ,
remorselessly
dragged
there
by
the
line
*punct* ,
which
had
taken
several
turns
around
his
chest
and
neck
*punct* .
*break*
tashtego
stood
in
the
bows
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
full
of
the
fire
of
the
hunt
*punct* .
*break*
he
hated
pip
for
a
poltroon
*punct* .
*break*
snatching
the
boat-knife
from
its
sheath
*punct* ,
he
suspended
its
sharp
edge
over
the
line
*punct* ,
and
turning
towards
stubb
*punct* ,
exclaimed
interrogatively
*punct* ,
cut
*punct* ?
*break*
meantime
pip's
blue
*punct* ,
choked
face
plainly
looked
*punct* ,
do
*punct* ,
for
god's
sake
*punct* !
*break*
all
passed
in
a
flash
*punct* .
*break*
in
less
than
half
a
minute
*punct* ,
this
entire
thing
happened
*punct* .
*break*
damn
him
*punct* ,
cut
*punct* !
*break*
roared
stubb
*punct* ;
and
so
the
whale
was
lost
and
pip
was
saved
*punct* .
*break*
so
soon
as
he
recovered
himself
*punct* ,
the
poor
little
negro
was
assailed
by
yells
and
execrations
from
the
crew
*punct* .
*break*
tranquilly
permitting
these
irregular
cursings
to
evaporate
*punct* ,
stubb
then
in
a
plain
*punct* ,
business-like
*punct* ,
but
still
half
humorous
manner
*punct* ,
cursed
pip
officially
*punct* ;
and
that
done
*punct* ,
unofficially
gave
him
much
wholesome
advice
*punct* .
*break*
the
substance
was
*punct* ,
never
jump
from
a
boat
*punct* ,
pip
*punct* ,
except
*punct* ,
but
all
the
rest
was
indefinite
*punct* ,
as
the
soundest
advice
ever
is
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
general
*punct* ,
stick
to
the
boat
*punct* ,
is
your
true
motto
in
whaling
*punct* ;
but
cases
will
sometimes
happen
when
leap
from
the
boat
*punct* ,
is
still
better
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
as
if
perceiving
at
last
that
if
he
should
give
undiluted
conscientious
advice
to
pip
*punct* ,
he
would
be
leaving
him
too
wide
a
margin
to
jump
in
for
the
future
*punct* ;
stubb
suddenly
dropped
all
advice
*punct* ,
and
concluded
with
a
peremptory
command
*punct* ,
stick
to
the
boat
*punct* ,
pip
*punct* ,
or
by
the
lord
*punct* ,
i
wont
pick
you
up
if
you
jump
*punct* ;
mind
that
*punct* .
*break*
bear
that
in
mind
*punct* ,
and
don't
jump
any
more
*punct* .
*break*
hereby
perhaps
stubb
indirectly
hinted
*punct* ,
that
though
man
loved
his
fellow
*punct* ,
yet
man
is
a
money-making
animal
*punct* ,
which
propensity
too
often
interferes
with
his
benevolence
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
are
all
in
the
hands
of
the
gods
*punct* ;
and
pip
jumped
again
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
under
very
similar
circumstances
to
the
first
performance
*punct* ;
but
this
time
he
did
not
breast
out
the
line
*punct* ;
and
hence
*punct* ,
when
the
whale
started
to
run
*punct* ,
pip
was
left
behind
on
the
sea
*punct* ,
like
a
hurried
traveller's
trunk
*punct* .
*break*
stubb
was
but
too
true
to
his
word
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
beautiful
*punct* ,
bounteous
*punct* ,
blue
day
*punct* ;
the
spangled
sea
calm
and
cool
*punct* ,
and
flatly
stretching
away
*punct* ,
all
round
*punct* ,
to
the
horizon
*punct* ,
like
gold-beater's
skin
hammered
out
to
the
extremest
*punct* .
*break*
bobbing
up
and
down
in
that
sea
*punct* ,
pip's
ebon
head
showed
like
a
head
of
cloves
*punct* .
*break*
no
boat-knife
was
lifted
when
he
fell
so
rapidly
astern
*punct* .
*break*
stubb's
inexorable
back
was
turned
upon
him
*punct* ;
and
the
whale
was
winged
*punct* .
*break*
in
three
minutes
*punct* ,
a
whole
mile
of
shoreless
ocean
was
between
pip
and
stubb
*punct* .
*break*
out
from
the
centre
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
poor
pip
turned
his
crisp
*punct* ,
curling
*punct* ,
black
head
to
the
sun
*punct* ,
another
lonely
castaway
*punct* ,
though
the
loftiest
and
the
brightest
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
calm
weather
*punct* ,
to
swim
in
the
open
ocean
is
as
easy
to
the
practised
swimmer
as
to
ride
in
a
spring-carriage
ashore
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
awful
lonesomeness
is
intolerable
*punct* .
*break*
the
intense
concentration
of
self
in
the
middle
of
such
a
heartless
immensity
*punct* ,
my
god
*punct* !
*break*
who
can
tell
it
*punct* ?
*break*
mark
*punct* ,
how
when
sailors
in
a
dead
calm
bathe
in
the
open
sea
*punct* ,
mark
how
closely
they
hug
their
ship
and
only
coast
along
her
sides
*punct* .
*break*
but
had
stubb
really
abandoned
the
poor
little
negro
to
his
fate
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ;
he
did
not
mean
to
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
merest
chance
the
ship
itself
at
last
rescued
him
*punct* ;
but
from
that
hour
the
little
negro
went
about
the
deck
an
idiot
*punct* ;
such
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
they
said
he
was
*punct* .
*break*
the
sea
had
jeeringly
kept
his
finite
body
up
*punct* ,
but
drowned
the
infinite
of
his
soul
*punct* .
*break*
not
drowned
entirely
*punct* ,
though
*punct* .
*break*
rather
carried
down
alive
to
wondrous
depths
*punct* ,
where
strange
shapes
of
the
unwarped
primal
world
glided
to
and
fro
before
his
passive
eyes
*punct* ;
and
the
miser-merman
*punct* ,
wisdom
*punct* ,
revealed
his
hoarded
heaps
*punct* ;
and
among
the
joyous
*punct* ,
heartless
*punct* ,
ever-juvenile
eternities
*punct* ,
pip
saw
the
multitudinous
*punct* ,
god-omnipresent
*punct* ,
coral
insects
*punct* ,
that
out
of
the
firmament
of
waters
heaved
the
colossal
orbs
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
god's
foot
upon
the
treadle
of
the
loom
*punct* ,
and
spoke
it
*punct* ;
and
therefore
his
shipmates
called
him
mad
*punct* .
*break*
so
man's
insanity
is
heaven's
sense
*punct* ;
and
wandering
from
all
mortal
reason
*punct* ,
man
comes
at
last
to
that
celestial
thought
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
to
reason
*punct* ,
is
absurd
and
frantic
*punct* ;
and
weal
or
woe
*punct* ,
feels
then
uncompromised
*punct* ,
indifferent
as
his
god
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
rest
*punct* ,
blame
not
stubb
too
hardly
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
cooled
and
crystallized
to
such
a
degree
*punct* ,
that
when
*punct* ,
with
several
others
*punct* ,
i
sat
down
before
a
large
constantine's
bath
of
it
*punct* ,
i
found
it
strangely
concreted
into
lumps
*punct* ,
here
and
there
rolling
about
in
the
liquid
part
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
our
business
to
squeeze
these
lumps
back
into
fluid
*punct* .
*break*
a
sweet
and
unctuous
duty
*punct* !
*break*
no
wonder
that
in
old
times
this
sperm
was
such
a
favorite
cosmetic
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
clearer
*punct* !
*break*
such
a
sweetener
*punct* !
*break*
such
a
softener
*punct* !
*break*
such
a
delicious
mollifier
*punct* !
*break*
after
having
my
hands
in
it
for
only
a
few
minutes
*punct* ,
my
fingers
felt
like
eels
*punct* ,
and
began
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ,
to
serpentine
and
spiralize
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
sat
there
at
my
ease
*punct* ,
cross-legged
on
the
deck
*punct* ;
after
the
bitter
exertion
at
the
windlass
*punct* ;
under
a
blue
tranquil
sky
*punct* ;
the
ship
under
indolent
sail
*punct* ,
and
gliding
so
serenely
along
*punct* ;
as
i
bathed
my
hands
among
those
soft
*punct* ,
gentle
globules
of
infiltrated
tissues
*punct* ,
woven
almost
within
the
hour
*punct* ;
as
they
richly
broke
to
my
fingers
*punct* ,
and
discharged
all
their
opulence
*punct* ,
like
fully
ripe
grapes
their
wine
*punct* ;
as
i
snuffed
up
that
uncontaminated
aroma,
*punct* ,
literally
and
truly
*punct* ,
like
the
smell
of
spring
violets
*punct* ;
i
declare
to
you
*punct* ,
that
for
the
time
i
lived
as
in
a
musky
meadow
*punct* ;
i
forgot
all
about
our
horrible
oath
*punct* ;
in
that
inexpressible
sperm
*punct* ,
i
washed
my
hands
and
my
heart
of
it
*punct* ;
i
almost
began
to
credit
the
old
paracelsan
superstition
that
sperm
is
of
rare
virtue
in
allaying
the
heat
of
anger
*punct* :
while
bathing
in
that
bath
*punct* ,
i
felt
divinely
free
from
all
ill-will
*punct* ,
or
petulence
*punct* ,
or
malice
*punct* ,
of
any
sort
whatsoever
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
morning
long
*punct* ;
i
squeezed
that
sperm
till
i
myself
almost
melted
into
it
*punct* ;
i
squeezed
that
sperm
till
a
strange
sort
of
insanity
came
over
me
*punct* ;
and
i
found
myself
unwittingly
squeezing
my
co-laborers
hands
in
it
*punct* ,
mistaking
their
hands
for
the
gentle
globules
*punct* .
*break*
such
an
abounding
*punct* ,
affectionate
*punct* ,
friendly
*punct* ,
loving
feeling
did
this
avocation
beget
*punct* ;
that
at
last
i
was
continually
squeezing
their
hands
*punct* ,
and
looking
up
into
their
eyes
sentimentally
*punct* ;
as
much
as
to
say,
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
my
dear
fellow
beings
*punct* ,
why
should
we
longer
cherish
any
social
acerbities
*punct* ,
or
know
the
slightest
ill-humor
or
envy
*punct* !
*break*
would
that
i
could
keep
squeezing
that
sperm
for
ever
*punct* !
*break*
for
now
*punct* ,
since
by
many
prolonged
*punct* ,
repeated
experiences
*punct* ,
i
have
perceived
that
in
all
cases
man
must
eventually
lower
*punct* ,
or
at
least
shift
*punct* ,
his
conceit
of
attainable
felicity
*punct* ;
not
placing
it
anywhere
in
the
intellect
or
the
fancy
*punct* ;
but
in
the
wife
*punct* ,
the
heart
*punct* ,
the
bed
*punct* ,
the
table
*punct* ,
the
saddle
*punct* ,
the
fire-side
*punct* ,
the
country
*punct* ;
now
that
i
have
perceived
all
this
*punct* ,
i
am
ready
to
squeeze
case
eternally
*punct* .
*break*
in
thoughts
of
the
visions
of
the
night
*punct* ,
i
saw
long
rows
of
angels
in
paradise
*punct* ,
each
with
his
hands
in
a
jar
of
spermaceti
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
while
discoursing
of
sperm
*punct* ,
it
behooves
to
speak
of
other
things
akin
to
it
*punct* ,
in
the
business
of
preparing
the
sperm
whale
for
the
try-works
*punct* .
*break*
first
comes
white-horse
*punct* ,
so
called
*punct* ,
which
is
obtained
from
the
tapering
part
of
the
fish
*punct* ,
and
also
from
the
thicker
portions
of
his
flukes
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
tough
with
congealed
tendons
*punct* ,
a
wad
of
muscle
*punct* ,
but
still
contains
some
oil
*punct* .
*break*
after
being
severed
from
the
whale
*punct* ,
the
white-horse
is
first
cut
into
portable
oblongs
ere
going
to
the
mincer
*punct* .
*break*
they
look
much
like
blocks
of
berkshire
marble
*punct* .
*break*
plum-pudding
is
the
term
bestowed
upon
certain
fragmentary
parts
of
the
whale's
flesh
*punct* ,
here
and
there
adhering
to
the
blanket
of
blubber
*punct* ,
and
often
participating
to
a
considerable
degree
in
its
unctuousness
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
most
refreshing
*punct* ,
convivial
*punct* ,
beautiful
object
to
behold
*punct* .
*break*
as
its
name
imports
*punct* ,
it
is
of
an
exceedingly
rich
*punct* ,
mottled
tint
*punct* ,
with
a
bestreaked
snowy
and
golden
ground
*punct* ,
dotted
with
spots
of
the
deepest
crimson
and
purple
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
plums
of
rubies
*punct* ,
in
pictures
of
citron
*punct* .
*break*
spite
of
reason
*punct* ,
it
is
hard
to
keep
yourself
from
eating
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
confess
*punct* ,
that
once
i
stole
behind
the
foremast
to
try
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
called
slobgollion
*punct* ;
an
appellation
original
with
the
whalemen
*punct* ,
and
even
so
is
the
nature
of
the
substance
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
an
ineffably
oozy
*punct* ,
stringy
affair
*punct* ,
most
frequently
found
in
the
tubs
of
sperm
*punct* ,
after
a
prolonged
squeezing
*punct* ,
and
subsequent
decanting
*punct* .
*break*
i
hold
it
to
be
the
wondrously
thin
*punct* ,
ruptured
membranes
of
the
case
*punct* ,
coalescing
*punct* .
*break*
gurry
*punct* ,
so
called
*punct* ,
is
a
term
properly
belonging
to
right
whalemen
*punct* ,
but
sometimes
incidentally
used
by
the
sperm
fishermen
*punct* .
*break*
it
designates
the
dark
*punct* ,
glutinous
substance
which
is
scraped
off
the
back
of
the
greenland
or
right
whale
*punct* ,
and
much
of
which
covers
the
decks
of
those
inferior
souls
who
hunt
that
ignoble
leviathan
*punct* .
*break*
strictly
this
word
is
not
indigenous
to
the
whale's
vocabulary
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
applied
by
whalemen
*punct* ,
it
becomes
so
*punct* .
*break*
a
whaleman's
nipper
is
a
short
firm
strip
of
tendinous
stuff
cut
from
the
tapering
part
of
leviathan's
tail
*punct* :
it
averages
an
inch
in
thickness
*punct* ,
and
for
the
rest
*punct* ,
is
about
the
size
of
the
iron
part
of
a
hoe
*punct* .
*break*
edgewise
moved
along
the
oily
deck
*punct* ,
it
operates
like
a
leathern
squilgee
*punct* ;
and
by
nameless
blandishments
*punct* ,
as
of
magic
*punct* ,
allures
along
with
it
all
impurities
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
learn
all
about
these
recondite
matters
*punct* ,
your
best
way
is
at
once
to
descend
into
the
blubber-room
*punct* ,
and
have
a
long
talk
with
its
inmates
*punct* .
*break*
this
place
has
previously
been
mentioned
as
the
receptacle
for
the
blanket-pieces
*punct* ,
when
stript
and
hoisted
from
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
proper
time
arrives
for
cutting
up
its
contents
*punct* ,
this
apartment
is
a
scene
of
terror
to
all
tyros
*punct* ,
especially
by
night
*punct* .
*break*
on
one
side
*punct* ,
lit
by
a
dull
lantern
*punct* ,
a
space
has
been
left
clear
for
the
workmen
*punct* .
*break*
they
generally
go
in
pairs,
*punct* ,
a
pike-and-gaff-man
and
a
spade-man
*punct* .
*break*
the
whaling-pike
is
similar
to
a
frigate's
boarding-weapon
of
the
same
name
*punct* .
*break*
the
gaff
is
something
like
a
boat-hook
*punct* .
*break*
with
his
gaff
*punct* ,
the
gaffman
hooks
on
to
a
sheet
of
blubber
*punct* ,
and
strives
to
hold
it
from
slipping
*punct* ,
as
the
ship
pitches
and
lurches
about
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
*punct* ,
the
spade-man
stands
on
the
sheet
itself
*punct* ,
perpendicularly
chopping
it
into
the
portable
horse-pieces
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
cuts
off
one
of
his
own
toes
*punct* ,
or
one
of
his
assistants'
*punct* ,
would
you
be
very
much
astonished
*punct* ?
*break*
not
the
wondrous
cistern
in
the
whale's
huge
head
*punct* ;
not
the
prodigy
of
his
unhinged
lower
jaw
*punct* ;
not
the
miracle
of
his
symmetrical
tail
*punct* ;
none
of
these
would
so
surprise
you
*punct* ,
as
half
a
glimpse
of
that
unaccountable
cone,
*punct* ,
longer
than
a
kentuckian
is
tall
*punct* ,
nigh
a
foot
in
diameter
at
the
base
*punct* ,
and
jet-black
as
yojo
*punct* ,
the
ebony
idol
of
queequeg
*punct* .
*break*
and
an
idol
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
it
is
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
rather
*punct* ,
in
old
times
*punct* ,
its
likeness
was
*punct* .
*break*
such
an
idol
as
that
found
in
the
secret
groves
of
queen
maachah
in
judea
*punct* ;
and
for
worshipping
which
*punct* ,
king
asa
*punct* ,
her
son
*punct* ,
did
depose
her
*punct* ,
and
destroyed
the
idol
*punct* ,
and
burnt
it
for
an
abomination
at
the
brook
kedron
*punct* ,
as
darkly
set
forth
in
the
15th
chapter
of
the
first
book
of
kings
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
the
sailor
*punct* ,
called
the
mincer
*punct* ,
who
now
comes
along
*punct* ,
and
assisted
by
two
allies
*punct* ,
heavily
backs
the
grandissimus
*punct* ,
as
the
mariners
call
it
*punct* ,
and
with
bowed
shoulders
*punct* ,
staggers
off
with
it
as
if
he
were
a
grenadier
carrying
a
dead
comrade
from
the
field
*punct* .
*break*
extending
it
upon
the
forecastle
deck
*punct* ,
he
now
proceeds
cylindrically
to
remove
its
dark
pelt
*punct* ,
as
an
african
hunter
the
pelt
of
a
boa
*punct* .
*break*
ere
long
*punct* ,
it
is
taken
down
*punct* ;
when
removing
some
three
feet
of
it
*punct* ,
towards
the
pointed
extremity
*punct* ,
and
then
cutting
two
slits
for
arm-holes
at
the
other
end
*punct* ,
he
lengthwise
slips
himself
bodily
into
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
mincer
now
stands
before
you
invested
in
the
full
canonicals
of
his
calling
*punct* .
*break*
immemorial
to
all
his
order
*punct* ,
this
investiture
alone
will
adequately
protect
him
*punct* ,
while
employed
in
the
peculiar
functions
of
his
office
*punct* .
*break*
that
office
consists
in
mincing
the
horse-pieces
of
blubber
for
the
pots
*punct* ;
an
operation
which
is
conducted
at
a
curious
wooden
horse
*punct* ,
planted
endwise
against
the
bulwarks
*punct* ,
and
with
a
capacious
tub
beneath
it
*punct* ,
into
which
the
minced
pieces
drop
*punct* ,
fast
as
the
sheets
from
a
rapt
orator's
desk
*punct* .
*break*
arrayed
in
decent
black
*punct* ;
occupying
a
conspicuous
pulpit
*punct* ;
intent
on
bible
leaves
*punct* ;
what
a
candidate
for
an
archbishoprick
*punct* ,
what
a
lad
for
a
pope
were
this
mincer
*punct* !
*break*
this
is
the
invariable
cry
from
the
mates
to
the
mincer
*punct* .
*break*
she
presents
the
curious
anomaly
of
the
most
solid
masonry
joining
with
oak
and
hemp
in
constituting
the
completed
ship
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
as
if
from
the
open
field
a
brick-kiln
were
transported
to
her
planks
*punct* .
*break*
the
try-works
are
planted
between
the
foremast
and
main-mast
*punct* ,
the
most
roomy
part
of
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
the
timbers
beneath
are
of
a
peculiar
strength
*punct* ,
fitted
to
sustain
the
weight
of
an
almost
solid
mass
of
brick
and
mortar
*punct* ,
some
ten
feet
by
eight
square
*punct* ,
and
five
in
height
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
flanks
it
is
cased
with
wood
*punct* ,
and
at
top
completely
covered
by
a
large
*punct* ,
sloping
*punct* ,
battened
hatchway
*punct* .
*break*
removing
this
hatch
we
expose
the
great
try-pots
*punct* ,
two
in
number
*punct* ,
and
each
of
several
barrels
capacity
*punct* .
*break*
when
not
in
use
*punct* ,
they
are
kept
remarkably
clean
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
they
are
polished
with
soapstone
and
sand
*punct* ,
till
they
shine
within
like
silver
punch-bowls
*punct* .
*break*
during
the
night-watches
some
cynical
old
sailors
will
crawl
into
them
and
coil
themselves
away
there
for
a
nap
*punct* .
*break*
while
employed
in
polishing
them
*punct* ,
one
man
in
each
pot
*punct* ,
side
by
side
*punct* ,
many
confidential
communications
are
carried
on
*punct* ,
over
the
iron
lips
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
place
also
for
profound
mathematical
meditation
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
in
the
left
hand
try-pot
of
the
pequod
*punct* ,
with
the
soapstone
diligently
circling
round
me
*punct* ,
that
i
was
first
indirectly
struck
by
the
remarkable
fact
*punct* ,
that
in
geometry
all
bodies
gliding
along
the
cycloid
*punct* ,
my
soapstone
for
example
*punct* ,
will
descend
from
any
point
in
precisely
the
same
time
*punct* .
*break*
removing
the
fire-board
from
the
front
of
the
try-works
*punct* ,
the
bare
masonry
of
that
side
is
exposed
*punct* ,
penetrated
by
the
two
iron
mouths
of
the
furnaces
*punct* ,
directly
underneath
the
pots
*punct* .
*break*
these
mouths
are
fitted
with
heavy
doors
of
iron
*punct* .
*break*
the
intense
heat
of
the
fire
is
prevented
from
communicating
itself
to
the
deck
*punct* ,
by
means
of
a
shallow
reservoir
extending
under
the
entire
inclosed
surface
of
the
works
*punct* .
*break*
by
a
tunnel
inserted
at
the
rear
*punct* ,
this
reservoir
is
kept
replenished
with
water
as
fast
as
it
evaporates
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
no
external
chimneys
*punct* ;
they
open
direct
from
the
rear
wall
*punct* .
*break*
and
here
let
us
go
back
for
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
about
nine
o'clock
at
night
that
the
pequod's
try-works
were
first
started
on
this
present
voyage
*punct* .
*break*
it
belonged
to
stubb
to
oversee
the
business
*punct* .
*break*
all
ready
there
*punct* ?
*break*
off
hatch
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
and
start
her
*punct* .
*break*
you
cook
*punct* ,
fire
the
works
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
an
easy
thing
*punct* ,
for
the
carpenter
had
been
thrusting
his
shavings
into
the
furnace
throughout
the
passage
*punct* .
*break*
here
be
it
said
that
in
a
whaling
voyage
the
first
fire
in
the
try-works
has
to
be
fed
for
a
time
with
wood
*punct* .
*break*
after
that
no
wood
is
used
*punct* ,
except
as
a
means
of
quick
ignition
to
the
staple
fuel
*punct* .
*break*
these
fritters
feed
the
flames
*punct* .
*break*
like
a
plethoric
burning
martyr
*punct* ,
or
a
self-consuming
misanthrope
*punct* ,
once
ignited
*punct* ,
the
whale
supplies
his
own
fuel
and
burns
by
his
own
body
*punct* .
*break*
would
that
he
consumed
his
own
smoke
*punct* !
*break*
for
his
smoke
is
horrible
to
inhale
*punct* ,
and
inhale
it
you
must
*punct* ,
and
not
only
that
*punct* ,
but
you
must
live
in
it
for
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
an
unspeakable
*punct* ,
wild
*punct* ,
hindoo
odor
about
it
*punct* ,
such
as
may
lurk
in
the
vicinity
of
funereal
pyres
*punct* .
*break*
it
smells
like
the
left
wing
of
the
day
of
judgment
*punct* ;
it
is
an
argument
for
the
pit
*punct* .
*break*
by
midnight
the
works
were
in
full
operation
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
clear
from
the
carcase
*punct* ;
sail
had
been
made
*punct* ;
the
wind
was
freshening
*punct* ;
the
wild
ocean
darkness
was
intense
*punct* .
*break*
but
that
darkness
was
licked
up
by
the
fierce
flames
*punct* ,
which
at
intervals
forked
forth
from
the
sooty
flues
*punct* ,
and
illuminated
every
lofty
rope
in
the
rigging
*punct* ,
as
with
the
famed
greek
fire
*punct* .
*break*
the
burning
ship
drove
on
*punct* ,
as
if
remorselessly
commissioned
to
some
vengeful
deed
*punct* .
*break*
so
the
pitch
and
sulphur-freighted
brigs
of
the
bold
hydriote
*punct* ,
canaris
*punct* ,
issuing
from
their
midnight
harbors
*punct* ,
with
broad
sheets
of
flame
for
sails
*punct* ,
bore
down
upon
the
turkish
frigates
*punct* ,
and
folded
them
in
conflagrations
*punct* .
*break*
the
hatch
*punct* ,
removed
from
the
top
of
the
works
*punct* ,
now
afforded
a
wide
hearth
in
front
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
standing
on
this
were
the
tartarean
shapes
of
the
pagan
harpooneers
*punct* ,
always
the
whale-ship's
stokers
*punct* .
*break*
with
huge
pronged
poles
they
pitched
hissing
masses
of
blubber
into
the
scalding
pots
*punct* ,
or
stirred
up
the
fires
beneath
*punct* ,
till
the
snaky
flames
darted
*punct* ,
curling
*punct* ,
out
of
the
doors
to
catch
them
by
the
feet
*punct* .
*break*
the
smoke
rolled
away
in
sullen
heaps
*punct* .
*break*
to
every
pitch
of
the
ship
there
was
a
pitch
of
the
boiling
oil
*punct* ,
which
seemed
all
eagerness
to
leap
into
their
faces
*punct* .
*break*
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
works
*punct* ,
on
the
further
side
of
the
wide
wooden
hearth
*punct* ,
was
the
windlass
*punct* .
*break*
this
served
for
a
sea-sofa
*punct* .
*break*
here
lounged
the
watch
*punct* ,
when
not
otherwise
employed
*punct* ,
looking
into
the
red
heat
of
the
fire
*punct* ,
till
their
eyes
felt
scorched
in
their
heads
*punct* .
*break*
their
tawny
features
*punct* ,
now
all
begrimed
with
smoke
and
sweat
*punct* ,
their
matted
beards
*punct* ,
and
the
contrasting
barbaric
brilliancy
of
their
teeth
*punct* ,
all
these
were
strangely
revealed
in
the
capricious
emblazonings
of
the
works
*punct* .
*break*
so
seemed
it
to
me
*punct* ,
as
i
stood
at
her
helm
*punct* ,
and
for
long
hours
silently
guided
the
way
of
this
fire-ship
on
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
wrapped
*punct* ,
for
that
interval
*punct* ,
in
darkness
myself
*punct* ,
i
but
the
better
saw
the
redness
*punct* ,
the
madness
*punct* ,
the
ghastliness
of
others
*punct* .
*break*
the
continual
sight
of
the
fiend
shapes
before
me
*punct* ,
capering
half
in
smoke
and
half
in
fire
*punct* ,
these
at
last
begat
kindred
visions
in
my
soul
*punct* ,
so
soon
as
i
began
to
yield
to
that
unaccountable
drowsiness
which
ever
would
come
over
me
at
a
midnight
helm
*punct* .
*break*
but
that
night
*punct* ,
in
particular
*punct* ,
a
strange
*punct* ,
and
ever
since
inexplicable
*punct* ,
thing
occurred
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
starting
from
a
brief
standing
sleep
*punct* ,
i
was
horribly
conscious
of
something
fatally
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
the
jaw-bone
tiller
smote
my
side
*punct* ,
which
leaned
against
it
*punct* ;
in
my
ears
was
the
low
hum
of
sails
*punct* ,
just
beginning
to
shake
in
the
wind
*punct* ;
i
thought
my
eyes
were
open
*punct* ;
i
was
half
conscious
of
putting
my
fingers
to
the
lids
and
mechanically
stretching
them
still
further
apart
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
spite
of
all
this
*punct* ,
i
could
see
no
compass
before
me
to
steer
by
*punct* ;
though
it
seemed
but
a
minute
since
i
had
been
watching
the
card
*punct* ,
by
the
steady
binnacle
lamp
illuminating
it
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
seemed
before
me
but
a
jet
gloom
*punct* ,
now
and
then
made
ghastly
by
flashes
of
redness
*punct* .
*break*
uppermost
was
the
impression
*punct* ,
that
whatever
swift
*punct* ,
rushing
thing
i
stood
on
was
not
so
much
bound
to
any
haven
ahead
as
rushing
from
all
havens
astern
*punct* .
*break*
a
stark
*punct* ,
bewildered
feeling
*punct* ,
as
of
death
*punct* ,
came
over
me
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
the
matter
with
me
*punct* ?
*break*
in
my
brief
sleep
i
had
turned
myself
about
*punct* ,
and
was
fronting
the
ship's
stern
*punct* ,
with
my
back
to
her
prow
and
the
compass
*punct* .
*break*
in
an
instant
i
faced
back
*punct* ,
just
in
time
to
prevent
the
vessel
from
flying
up
into
the
wind
*punct* ,
and
very
probably
capsizing
her
*punct* .
*break*
how
glad
and
how
grateful
the
relief
from
this
unnatural
hallucination
of
the
night
*punct* ,
and
the
fatal
contingency
of
being
brought
by
the
lee
*punct* !
*break*
look
not
too
long
in
the
face
of
the
fire
*punct* ,
o
man
*punct* !
*break*
never
dream
with
thy
hand
on
the
helm
*punct* !
*break*
turn
not
thy
back
to
the
compass
*punct* ;
accept
the
first
hint
of
the
hitching
tiller
*punct* ;
believe
not
the
artificial
fire
*punct* ,
when
its
redness
makes
all
things
look
ghastly
*punct* .
*break*
to-morrow
*punct* ,
in
the
natural
sun
*punct* ,
the
skies
will
be
bright
*punct* ;
those
who
glared
like
devils
in
the
forking
flames
*punct* ,
the
morn
will
show
in
far
other
*punct* ,
at
least
gentler
*punct* ,
relief
*punct* ;
the
glorious
*punct* ,
golden
*punct* ,
glad
sun
*punct* ,
the
only
true
lamp
*punct* ,
all
others
but
liars
*punct* !
*break*
nevertheless
the
sun
hides
not
virginia's
dismal
swamp
*punct* ,
nor
rome's
accursed
campagna
*punct* ,
nor
wide
sahara
*punct* ,
nor
all
the
millions
of
miles
of
deserts
and
of
griefs
beneath
the
moon
*punct* .
*break*
the
sun
hides
not
the
ocean
*punct* ,
which
is
the
dark
side
of
this
earth
*punct* ,
and
which
is
two
thirds
of
this
earth
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
that
mortal
man
who
hath
more
of
joy
than
sorrow
in
him
*punct* ,
that
mortal
man
cannot
be
true
*punct* ,
not
true
*punct* ,
or
undeveloped
*punct* .
*break*
with
books
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
the
truest
of
all
men
was
the
man
of
sorrows
*punct* ,
and
the
truest
of
all
books
is
solomon's
*punct* ,
and
ecclesiastes
is
the
fine
hammered
steel
of
woe
*punct* .
*break*
all
is
vanity
*punct* .
*break*
this
wilful
world
hath
not
got
hold
of
unchristian
solomon's
wisdom
yet
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
who
dodges
hospitals
and
jails
*punct* ,
and
walks
fast
crossing
grave-yards
*punct* ,
and
would
rather
talk
of
operas
than
hell
*punct* ;
calls
cowper
*punct* ,
young
*punct* ,
pascal
*punct* ,
rousseau
*punct* ,
poor
devils
all
of
sick
men
*punct* ;
and
throughout
a
care-free
lifetime
swears
by
rabelais
as
passing
wise
*punct* ,
and
therefore
jolly;
*punct* ,
not
that
man
is
fitted
to
sit
down
on
tomb-stones
*punct* ,
and
break
the
green
damp
mould
with
unfathomably
wondrous
solomon
*punct* .
*break*
but
even
solomon
*punct* ,
he
says
*punct* ,
the
man
that
wandereth
out
of
the
way
of
understanding
shall
remain
*punct* ,
i
*punct* .
*break*
even
while
living
*punct* ,
in
the
congregation
of
the
dead
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
is
a
catskill
eagle
in
some
souls
that
can
alike
dive
down
into
the
blackest
gorges
*punct* ,
and
soar
out
of
them
again
and
become
invisible
in
the
sunny
spaces
*punct* .
*break*
there
they
lay
in
their
triangular
oaken
vaults
*punct* ,
each
mariner
a
chiselled
muteness
*punct* ;
a
score
of
lamps
flashing
upon
his
hooded
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
in
merchantmen
*punct* ,
oil
for
the
sailor
is
more
scarce
than
the
milk
of
queens
*punct* .
*break*
to
dress
in
the
dark
*punct* ,
and
eat
in
the
dark
*punct* ,
and
stumble
in
darkness
to
his
pallet
*punct* ,
this
is
his
usual
lot
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
whaleman
*punct* ,
as
he
seeks
the
food
of
light
*punct* ,
so
he
lives
in
light
*punct* .
*break*
he
makes
his
berth
an
aladdin's
lamp
*punct* ,
and
lays
him
down
in
it
*punct* ;
so
that
in
the
pitchiest
night
the
ship's
black
hull
still
houses
an
illumination
*punct* .
*break*
see
with
what
entire
freedom
the
whaleman
takes
his
handful
of
lamps
*punct* ,
often
but
old
bottles
and
vials
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
to
the
copper
cooler
at
the
try-works
*punct* ,
and
replenishes
them
there
*punct* ,
as
mugs
of
ale
at
a
vat
*punct* .
*break*
he
burns
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
the
purest
of
oil
*punct* ,
in
its
unmanufactured
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
unvitiated
state
*punct* ;
a
fluid
unknown
to
solar
*punct* ,
lunar
*punct* ,
or
astral
contrivances
ashore

*break*
it
is
sweet

butter

*break*
never
more

rise

blow
*punct* .
*break*
while
still
warm
*punct* ,
the
oil
*punct* ,
like
hot
punch
*punct* ,
is
received
into
the
six-barrel
casks
*punct* ;
and
while
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
the
ship
is
pitching
and
rolling
this
way
and
that
in
the
midnight
sea
*punct* ,
the
enormous
casks
are
slewed
round
and
headed
over
*punct* ,
end
for
end
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
perilously
scoot
across
the
slippery
deck
*punct* ,
like
so
many
land
slides
*punct* ,
till
at
last
man-handled
and
stayed
in
their
course
*punct* ;
and
all
round
the
hoops
*punct* ,
rap
*punct* ,
rap
*punct* ,
go
as
many
hammers
as
can
play
upon
them
*punct* ,
for
now
*punct* ,
ex
officio
*punct* ,
every
sailor
is
a
cooper
*punct* .
*break*
at
length
*punct* ,
when
the
last
pint
is
casked
*punct* ,
and
all
is
cool
*punct* ,
then
the
great
hatchways
are
unsealed
*punct* ,
the
bowels
of
the
ship
are
thrown
open
*punct* ,
and
down
go
the
casks
to
their
final
rest
in
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
this
done
*punct* ,
the
hatches
are
replaced
*punct* ,
and
hermetically
closed
*punct* ,
like
a
closet
walled
up
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
sperm
fishery
*punct* ,
this
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
remarkable
incidents
in
all
the
business
of
whaling
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
day
or
two
after
*punct* ,
you
look
about
you
*punct* ,
and
prick
your
ears
in
this
self-same
ship
*punct* ;
and
were
it
not
for
the
tell-tale
boats
and
try-works
*punct* ,
you
would
all
but
swear
you
trod
some
silent
merchant
vessel
*punct* ,
with
a
most
scrupulously
neat
commander
*punct* .
*break*
the
unmanufactured
sperm
oil
possesses
a
singularly
cleansing
virtue
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
the
reason
why
the
decks
never
look
so
white
as
just
after
what
they
call
an
affair
of
oil
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
from
the
ashes
of
the
burned
scraps
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
a
potent
ley
is
readily
made
*punct* ;
and
whenever
any
adhesiveness
from
the
back
of
the
whale
remains
clinging
to
the
side
*punct* ,
that
ley
quickly
exterminates
it
*punct* .
*break*
hands
go
diligently
along
the
bulwarks
*punct* ,
and
with
buckets
of
water
and
rags
restore
them
to
their
full
tidiness
*punct* .
*break*
the
soot
is
brushed
from
the
lower
rigging
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
numerous
implements
which
have
been
in
use
are
likewise
faithfully
cleansed
and
put
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
great
hatch
is
scrubbed
and
placed
upon
the
try-works
*punct* ,
completely
hiding
the
pots
*punct* ;
every
cask
is
out
of
sight
*punct* ;
all
tackles
are
coiled
in
unseen
nooks
*punct* ;
and
when
by
the
combined
and
simultaneous
industry
of
almost
the
entire
ship's
company
*punct* ,
the
whole
of
this
conscientious
duty
is
at
last
concluded
*punct* ,
then
the
crew
themselves
proceed
to
their
own
ablutions
*punct* ;
shift
themselves
from
top
to
toe
*punct* ;
and
finally
issue
to
the
immaculate
deck
*punct* ,
fresh
and
all
aglow
*punct* ,
as
bridegrooms
new-leaped
from
out
the
daintiest
holland
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
with
elated
step
*punct* ,
they
pace
the
planks
in
twos
and
threes
*punct* ,
and
humorously
discourse
of
parlors
*punct* ,
sofas
*punct* ,
carpets
*punct* ,
and
fine
cambrics
*punct* ;
propose
to
mat
the
deck
*punct* ;
think
of
having
hangings
to
the
top
*punct* ;
object
not
to
taking
tea
by
moonlight
on
the
piazza
of
the
forecastle
*punct* .
*break*
to
hint
to
such
musked
mariners
of
oil
*punct* ,
and
bone
*punct* ,
and
blubber
*punct* ,
were
little
short
of
audacity
*punct* .
*break*
they
know
not
the
thing
you
distantly
allude
to
*punct* .
*break*
away
*punct* ,
and
bring
us
napkins
*punct* !
*break*
yes
*punct* ;
and
many
is
the
time
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
after
the
severest
uninterrupted
labors
*punct* ,
which
know
no
night
*punct* ;
continuing
straight
through
for
ninety-six
hours
*punct* ;
when
from
the
boat
*punct* ,
where
they
have
swelled
their
wrists
with
all
day
rowing
on
the
line,
*punct* ,
they
only
step
to
the
deck
to
carry
vast
chains
*punct* ,
and
heave
the
heavy
windlass
*punct* ,
and
cut
and
slash
*punct* ,
yea
*punct* ,
and
in
their
very
sweatings
to
be
smoked
and
burned
anew
by
the
combined
fires
of
the
equatorial
sun
and
the
equatorial
try-works
*punct* ;
when
*punct* ,
on
the
heel
of
all
this
*punct* ,
they
have
finally
bestirred
themselves
to
cleanse
the
ship
*punct* ,
and
make
a
spotless
dairy
room
of
it
*punct* ;
many
is
the
time
the
poor
fellows
*punct* ,
just
buttoning
the
necks
of
their
clean
frocks
*punct* ,
are
startled
by
the
cry
of
there
she
blows
*punct* !
*break*
and
away
they
fly
to
fight
another
whale
*punct* ,
and
go
through
the
whole
weary
thing
again
*punct* .
*break*
my
friends
*punct* ,
but
this
is
man-killing
*punct* !
*break*
yet
this
is
life
*punct* .
*break*
for
hardly
have
we
mortals
by
long
toilings
extracted
from
the
world's
vast
bulk
its
small
but
valuable
sperm
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
with
weary
patience
*punct* ,
cleansed
ourselves
from
its
defilements
*punct* ,
and
learned
to
live
here
in
clean
tabernacles
of
the
soul
*punct* ;
hardly
is
this
done
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
there
she
blows!
*punct* ,
the
ghost
is
spouted
up
*punct* ,
and
away
we
sail
to
fight
some
other
world
*punct* ,
and
go
through
young
life's
old
routine
again
*punct* .
*break*
pythagoras
*punct* ,
that
in
bright
greece
*punct* ,
two
thousand
years
ago
*punct* ,
did
die
*punct* ,
so
good
*punct* ,
so
wise
*punct* ,
so
mild
*punct* ;
i
sailed
with
thee
along
the
peruvian
coast
last
voyage
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
foolish
as
i
am
*punct* ,
taught
thee
*punct* ,
a
green
simple
boy
*punct* ,
how
to
splice
a
rope
*punct* !
*break*
when
he
halted
before
the
binnacle
*punct* ,
with
his
glance
fastened
on
the
pointed
needle
in
the
compass
*punct* ,
that
glance
shot
like
a
javelin
with
the
pointed
intensity
of
his
purpose
*punct* ;
and
when
resuming
his
walk
he
again
paused
before
the
mainmast
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
as
the
same
riveted
glance
fastened
upon
the
riveted
gold
coin
there
*punct* ,
he
still
wore
the
same
aspect
of
nailed
firmness
*punct* ,
only
dashed
with
a
certain
wild
longing
*punct* ,
if
not
hopefulness
*punct* .
*break*
but
one
morning
*punct* ,
turning
to
pass
the
doubloon
*punct* ,
he
seemed
to
be
newly
attracted
by
the
strange
figures
and
inscriptions
stamped
on
it
*punct* ,
as
though
now
for
the
first
time
beginning
to
interpret
for
himself
in
some
monomaniac
way
whatever
significance
might
lurk
in
them
*punct* .
*break*
and
some
certain
significance
lurks
in
all
things
*punct* ,
else
all
things
are
little
worth
*punct* ,
and
the
round
world
itself
but
an
empty
cipher
*punct* ,
except
to
sell
by
the
cartload
*punct* ,
as
they
do
hills
about
boston
*punct* ,
to
fill
up
some
morass
in
the
milky
way
*punct* .
*break*
now
this
doubloon
was
of
purest
*punct* ,
virgin
gold
*punct* ,
raked
somewhere
out
of
the
heart
of
gorgeous
hills
*punct* ,
whence
*punct* ,
east
and
west
*punct* ,
over
golden
sands
*punct* ,
the
head-waters
of
many
a
pactolus
flows
*punct* .
*break*
and
though
now
nailed
amidst
all
the
rustiness
of
iron
bolts
and
the
verdigris
of
copper
spikes
*punct* ,
yet
*punct* ,
untouchable
and
immaculate
to
any
foulness
*punct* ,
it
still
preserved
its
quito
glow
*punct* .
*break*
nor
*punct* ,
though
placed
amongst
a
ruthless
crew
and
every
hour
passed
by
ruthless
hands
*punct* ,
and
through
the
livelong
nights
shrouded
with
thick
darkness
which
might
cover
any
pilfering
approach
*punct* ,
nevertheless
every
sunrise
found
the
doubloon
where
the
sunset
left
it
last
*punct* .
*break*
for
it
was
set
apart
and
sanctified
to
one
awe-striking
end
*punct* ;
and
however
wanton
in
their
sailor
ways
*punct* ,
one
and
all
*punct* ,
the
mariners
revered
it
as
the
white
whale's
talisman
*punct* .
*break*
sometimes
they
talked
it
over
in
the
weary
watch
by
night
*punct* ,
wondering
whose
it
was
to
be
at
last
*punct* ,
and
whether
he
would
ever
live
to
spend
it
*punct* .
*break*
here
palms
*punct* ,
alpacas
*punct* ,
and
volcanoes
*punct* ;
sun's
disks
and
stars
*punct* ;
ecliptics
*punct* ,
horns-of-plenty
*punct* ,
and
rich
banners
waving
*punct* ,
are
in
luxuriant
profusion
stamped
*punct* ;
so
that
the
precious
gold
seems
almost
to
derive
an
added
preciousness
and
enhancing
glories
*punct* ,
by
passing
through
those
fancy
mints
*punct* ,
so
spanishly
poetic
*punct* .
*break*
it
so
chanced
that
the
doubloon
of
the
pequod
was
a
most
wealthy
example
of
these
things
*punct* .
*break*
on
its
round
border
it
bore
the
letters
*punct* ,
republica
del
ecuador
*punct* :
quito
*punct* .
*break*
so
this
bright
coin
came
from
a
country
planted
in
the
middle
of
the
world
*punct* ,
and
beneath
the
great
equator
*punct* ,
and
named
after
it
*punct* ;
and
it
had
been
cast
midway
up
the
andes
*punct* ,
in
the
unwaning
clime
that
knows
no
autumn
*punct* .
*break*
zoned
by
those
letters
you
saw
the
likeness
of
three
andes
summits
*punct* ;
from
one
a
flame
*punct* ;
a
tower
on
another
*punct* ;
on
the
third
a
crowing
cock
*punct* ;
while
arching
over
all
was
a
segment
of
the
partitioned
zodiac
*punct* ,
the
signs
all
marked
with
their
usual
cabalistics
*punct* ,
and
the
keystone
sun
entering
the
equinoctial
point
at
libra
*punct* .
*break*
before
this
equatorial
coin
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* ,
not
unobserved
by
others
*punct* ,
was
now
pausing
*punct* .
*break*
there's
something
ever
egotistical
in
mountain-tops
and
towers
*punct* ,
and
all
other
grand
and
lofty
things
*punct* ;
look
here,
*punct* ,
three
peaks
as
proud
as
lucifer
*punct* .
*break*
the
firm
tower
*punct* ,
that
is
ahab
*punct* ;
the
volcano
*punct* ,
that
is
ahab
*punct* ;
the
courageous
*punct* ,
the
undaunted
*punct* ,
and
victorious
fowl
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
is
ahab
*punct* ;
all
are
ahab
*punct* ;
and
this
round
gold
is
but
the
image
of
the
rounder
globe
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
like
a
magician's
glass
*punct* ,
to
each
and
every
man
in
turn
but
mirrors
back
his
own
mysterious
self
*punct* .
*break*
great
pains
*punct* ,
small
gains
for
those
who
ask
the
world
to
solve
them
*punct* ;
it
cannot
solve
itself
*punct* .
*break*
methinks
now
this
coined
sun
wears
a
ruddy
face
*punct* ;
but
see
*punct* !
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
he
enters
the
sign
of
storms
*punct* ,
the
equinox
*punct* !
*break*
and
but
six
months
before
he
wheeled
out
of
a
former
equinox
at
aries
*punct* !
*break*
from
storm
to
storm
*punct* !
*break*
so
be
it
*punct* ,
then
*punct* .
*break*
so
be
it
*punct* ,
then
*punct* !
*break*
here's
stout
stuff
for
woe
to
work
on
*punct* .
*break*
so
be
it
*punct* ,
then
*punct* .
*break*
no
fairy
fingers
can
have
pressed
the
gold
*punct* ,
but
devil's
claws
must
have
left
their
mouldings
there
since
yesterday
*punct* ,
murmured
starbuck
to
himself
*punct* ,
leaning
against
the
bulwarks
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
never
marked
the
coin
inspectingly
*punct* .
*break*
he
goes
below
*punct* ;
let
me
read
*punct* .
*break*
a
dark
valley
between
three
mighty
*punct* ,
heaven-abiding
peaks
*punct* ,
that
almost
seem
the
trinity
*punct* ,
in
some
faint
earthly
symbol
*punct* .
*break*
so
in
this
vale
of
death
*punct* ,
god
girds
us
round
*punct* ;
and
over
all
our
gloom
*punct* ,
the
sun
of
righteousness
still
shines
a
beacon
and
a
hope
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
bend
down
our
eyes
*punct* ,
the
dark
vale
shows
her
mouldy
soil
*punct* ;
but
if
we
lift
them
*punct* ,
the
bright
sun
meets
our
glance
half
way
*punct* ,
to
cheer
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
the
great
sun
is
no
fixture
*punct* ;
and
if
*punct* ,
at
midnight
*punct* ,
we
would
fain
snatch
some
sweet
solace
from
him
*punct* ,
we
gaze
for
him
in
vain
*punct* !
*break*
this
coin
speaks
wisely
*punct* ,
mildly
*punct* ,
truly
*punct* ,
but
still
sadly
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
quit
it
*punct* ,
lest
truth
shake
me
falsely
*punct* .
*break*
there
now's
the
old
mogul
*punct* ,
soliloquized
stubb
by
the
try-works
*punct* ,
he's
been
twigging
it
*punct* ;
and
there
goes
starbuck
from
the
same
*punct* ,
and
both
with
faces
which
i
should
say
might
be
somewhere
within
nine
fathoms
long
*punct* .
*break*
and
all
from
looking
at
a
piece
of
gold
*punct* ,
which
did
i
have
it
now
on
negro
hill
or
in
corlaer's
hook
*punct* ,
i'd
not
look
at
it
very
long
ere
spending
it
*punct* .
*break*
in
my
poor
*punct* ,
insignificant
opinion
*punct* ,
i
regard
this
as
queer
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
seen
doubloons
before
now
in
my
voyagings
*punct* ;
your
doubloons
of
old
spain
*punct* ,
your
doubloons
of
peru
*punct* ,
your
doubloons
of
chili
*punct* ,
your
doubloons
of
bolivia
*punct* ,
your
doubloons
of
popayan
*punct* ;
with
plenty
of
gold
moidores
and
pistoles
*punct* ,
and
joes
*punct* ,
and
half
joes
*punct* ,
and
quarter
joes
*punct* .
*break*
what
then
should
there
be
in
this
doubloon
of
the
equator
that
is
so
killing
wonderful
*punct* ?
*break*
let
me
read
it
once
*punct* .
*break*
here's
signs
and
wonders
truly
*punct* !
*break*
that
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
is
what
old
bowditch
in
his
epitome
calls
the
zodiac
*punct* ,
and
what
my
almanack
below
calls
ditto
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
get
the
almanack
and
as
i
have
heard
devils
can
be
raised
with
daboll's
arithmetic
*punct* ,
i'll
try
my
hand
at
raising
a
meaning
out
of
these
queer
curvicues
here
with
the
massachusetts
calendar
*punct* .
*break*
here's
the
book
*punct* .
*break*
let's
see
now
*punct* .
*break*
signs
and
wonders
*punct* ;
and
the
sun
*punct* ,
he's
always
among
em
*punct* .
*break*
hem
*punct* ,
hem
*punct* ,
hem
*punct* ;
here
they
are
*punct* ,
here
they
go
*punct* ,
all
alive:
*punct* ,
aries
*punct* ,
or
the
ram
*punct* ;
taurus
*punct* ,
or
the
bull
and
jimimi
*punct* !
*break*
here's
gemini
himself
*punct* ,
or
the
twins
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ;
the
sun
he
wheels
among
em
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
here
on
the
coin
he's
just
crossing
the
threshold
between
two
of
twelve
sitting-rooms
all
in
a
ring
*punct* .
*break*
you'll
do
to
give
us
the
bare
words
and
facts
*punct* ,
but
we
come
in
to
supply
the
thoughts
*punct* .
*break*
that's
my
small
experience
*punct* ,
so
far
as
the
massachusetts
calendar
*punct* ,
and
bowditch's
navigator
*punct* ,
and
daboll's
arithmetic
go
*punct* .
*break*
signs
and
wonders
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
pity
if
there
is
nothing
wonderful
in
signs
*punct* ,
and
significant
in
wonders
*punct* !
*break*
there's
a
clue
somewhere
*punct* ;
wait
a
bit
*punct* ;
hist
*punct* ,
hark
*punct* !
*break*
by
jove
*punct* ,
i
have
it
*punct* !
*break*
look
you
*punct* ,
doubloon
*punct* ,
your
zodiac
here
is
the
life
of
man
in
one
round
chapter
*punct* ;
and
now
i'll
read
it
off
*punct* ,
straight
out
of
the
book
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
almanack
*punct* !
*break*
to
begin
*punct* :
there's
aries
*punct* ,
or
the
ram
*punct* ,
lecherous
dog
*punct* ,
he
begets
us
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
taurus
*punct* ,
or
the
bull
*punct* ,
he
bumps
us
the
first
thing
*punct* ;
then
gemini
*punct* ,
or
the
twins
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
virtue
and
vice
*punct* ;
we
try
to
reach
virtue
*punct* ,
when
lo
*punct* !
*break*
comes
cancer
the
crab
*punct* ,
and
drags
us
back
*punct* ;
and
here
*punct* ,
going
from
virtue
*punct* ,
leo
*punct* ,
a
roaring
lion
*punct* ,
lies
in
the
path
*punct* ,
he
gives
a
few
fierce
bites
and
surly
dabs
with
his
paw
*punct* ;
we
escape
*punct* ,
and
hail
virgo
*punct* ,
the
virgin
*punct* !
*break*
that's
our
first
love
*punct* ;
we
marry
and
think
to
be
happy
for
aye
*punct* ,
when
pop
comes
libra
*punct* ,
or
the
scales
*punct* ,
happiness
weighed
and
found
wanting
*punct* ;
and
while
we
are
very
sad
about
that
*punct* ,
lord
*punct* !
*break*
how
we
suddenly
jump
*punct* ,
as
scorpio
*punct* ,
or
the
scorpion
*punct* ,
stings
us
in
rear
*punct* ;
we
are
curing
the
wound
*punct* ,
when
whang
come
the
arrows
all
round
*punct* ;
sagittarius
*punct* ,
or
the
archer
*punct* ,
is
amusing
himself
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
pluck
out
the
shafts
*punct* ,
stand
aside
*punct* ;
here's
the
battering-ram
*punct* ,
capricornus
*punct* ,
or
the
goat
*punct* ;
full
tilt
*punct* ,
he
comes
rushing
*punct* ,
and
headlong
we
are
tossed
*punct* ;
when
aquarius
*punct* ,
or
the
water-bearer
*punct* ,
pours
out
his
whole
deluge
and
drowns
us
*punct* ;
and
to
wind
up
with
pisces
*punct* ,
or
the
fishes
*punct* ,
we
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
there's
a
sermon
now
*punct* ,
writ
in
high
heaven
*punct* ,
and
the
sun
goes
through
it
every
year
*punct* ,
and
yet
comes
out
of
it
all
alive
and
hearty
*punct* .
*break*
jollily
he
*punct* ,
aloft
there
*punct* ,
wheels
through
toil
and
trouble
*punct* ;
and
so
*punct* ,
alow
here
*punct* ,
does
jolly
stubb
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
jolly's
the
word
for
aye
*punct* !
*break*
adieu
*punct* ,
doubloon
*punct* !
*break*
but
stop
*punct* ;
here
comes
little
king-post
*punct* ;
dodge
round
the
try-works
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
and
let's
hear
what
he'll
have
to
say
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ;
he's
before
it
*punct* ;
he'll
out
with
something
presently
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ;
he's
beginning
*punct* .
*break*
i
see
nothing
here
*punct* ,
but
a
round
thing
made
of
gold
*punct* ,
and
whoever
raises
a
certain
whale
*punct* ,
this
round
thing
belongs
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
what's
all
this
staring
been
about
*punct* ?
*break*
i
wont
smoke
dirty
pipes
like
stubb
*punct* ,
but
i
like
cigars
*punct* ,
and
here's
nine
hundred
and
sixty
of
them
*punct* ;
so
here
goes
flask
aloft
to
spy
em
out
*punct* .
*break*
shall
i
call
that
wise
or
foolish
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ;
if
it
be
really
wise
it
has
a
foolish
look
to
it
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
if
it
be
really
foolish
*punct* ,
then
has
it
a
sort
of
wiseish
look
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
avast
*punct* ;
here
comes
our
old
manxman
*punct* ,
the
old
hearse-driver
*punct* ,
he
must
have
been
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
before
he
took
to
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
he
luffs
up
before
the
doubloon
*punct* ;
halloa
*punct* ,
and
goes
round
on
the
other
side
of
the
mast
*punct* ;
why
*punct* ,
there's
a
horse-shoe
nailed
on
that
side
*punct* ;
and
now
he's
back
again
*punct* ;
what
does
that
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
he's
muttering
*punct* ,
voice
like
an
old
worn-out
coffee-mill
*punct* .
*break*
prick
ears
*punct* ,
and
listen
*punct* !
*break*
if
the
white
whale
be
raised
*punct* ,
it
must
be
in
a
month
and
a
day
*punct* ,
when
the
sun
stands
in
some
one
of
these
signs
*punct* .
*break*
i've
studied
signs
*punct* ,
and
know
their
marks
*punct* ;
they
were
taught
me
two
score
years
ago
*punct* ,
by
the
old
witch
in
copenhagen
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
what
sign
will
the
sun
then
be
*punct* ?
*break*
the
horse-shoe
sign
*punct* ;
for
there
it
is
*punct* ,
right
opposite
the
gold
*punct* .
*break*
and
what's
the
horse-shoe
sign
*punct* ?
*break*
the
lion
is
the
horse-shoe
sign
*punct* ,
the
roaring
and
devouring
lion
*punct* .
*break*
ship
*punct* ,
old
ship
*punct* !
*break*
my
old
head
shakes
to
think
of
thee
*punct* .
*break*
there's
another
rendering
now
*punct* ;
but
still
one
text
*punct* .
*break*
all
sorts
of
men
in
one
kind
of
world
*punct* ,
you
see
*punct* .
*break*
here
comes
queequeg
*punct* ,
all
tattooing
*punct* ,
looks
like
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
himself
*punct* .
*break*
what
says
the
cannibal
*punct* ?
*break*
as
i
live
he's
comparing
notes
*punct* ;
looking
at
his
thigh
bone
*punct* ;
thinks
the
sun
is
in
the
thigh
*punct* ,
or
in
the
calf
*punct* ,
or
in
the
bowels
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
as
the
old
women
talk
surgeon's
astronomy
in
the
back
country
*punct* .
*break*
and
by
jove
*punct* ,
he's
found
something
there
in
the
vicinity
of
his
thigh
*punct* ,
i
guess
it's
sagittarius
*punct* ,
or
the
archer
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* :
he
don't
know
what
to
make
of
the
doubloon
*punct* ;
he
takes
it
for
an
old
button
off
some
king's
trowsers
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
aside
again
*punct* !
*break*
here
comes
that
ghost-devil
*punct* ,
fedallah
*punct* ;
tail
coiled
out
of
sight
as
usual
*punct* ,
oakum
in
the
toes
of
his
pumps
as
usual
*punct* .
*break*
what
does
he
say
*punct* ,
with
that
look
of
his
*punct* ?
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
only
makes
a
sign
to
the
sign
and
bows
himself
*punct* ;
there
is
a
sun
on
the
coin
*punct* ,
fire
worshipper
*punct* ,
depend
upon
it
*punct* .
*break*
more
and
more
*punct* .
*break*
this
way
comes
pip
*punct* ,
poor
boy
*punct* !
*break*
would
he
had
died
*punct* ,
or
i
*punct* ;
he's
half
horrible
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
stand
away
again
and
hear
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
look
*punct* ,
you
look
*punct* ,
he
looks
*punct* ;
we
look
*punct* ,
ye
look
*punct* ,
they
look
*punct* .
*break*
upon
my
soul
*punct* ,
he's
been
studying
murray's
grammar
*punct* !
*break*
improving
his
mind
*punct* ,
poor
fellow
*punct* !
*break*
but
what's
that
he
says
now
*punct* ,
hist
*punct* !
*break*
i
look
*punct* ,
you
look
*punct* ,
he
looks
*punct* ;
we
look
*punct* ,
ye
look
*punct* ,
they
look
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
he's
getting
it
by
heart
*punct* ,
hist
*punct* !
*break*
i
look
*punct* ,
you
look
*punct* ,
he
looks
*punct* ;
we
look
*punct* ,
ye
look
*punct* ,
they
look
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
that's
funny
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
*punct* ,
you
*punct* ,
and
he
*punct* ;
and
we
*punct* ,
ye
*punct* ,
and
they
*punct* ,
are
all
bats
*punct* ;
and
i'm
a
crow
*punct* ,
especially
when
i
stand
a'top
of
this
pine
tree
here
*punct* .
*break*
ain't
i
a
crow
*punct* ?
*break*
and
where's
the
scare-crow
*punct* ?
*break*
there
he
stands
*punct* ;
two
bones
stuck
into
a
pair
of
old
trowsers
*punct* ,
and
two
more
poked
into
the
sleeves
of
an
old
jacket
*punct* .
*break*
wonder
if
he
means
me?
*punct* ,
complimentary!
*punct* ,
poor
lad!
*punct* ,
i
could
go
hang
myself
*punct* .
*break*
any
way
*punct* ,
for
the
present
*punct* ,
i'll
quit
pip's
vicinity
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
stand
the
rest
*punct* ,
for
they
have
plain
wits
*punct* ;
but
he's
too
crazy-witty
for
my
sanity
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ,
i
leave
him
muttering
*punct* .
*break*
here's
the
ship's
navel
*punct* ,
this
doubloon
here
*punct* ,
and
they
are
all
on
fire
to
unscrew
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
unscrew
your
navel
*punct* ,
and
what's
the
consequence
*punct* ?
*break*
then
again
*punct* ,
if
it
stays
here
*punct* ,
that
is
ugly
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
for
when
aught's
nailed
to
the
mast
it's
a
sign
that
things
grow
desperate
*punct* .
*break*
ha
*punct* ,
ha
*punct* !
*break*
the
white
whale
*punct* ;
he'll
nail
ye
*punct* !
*break*
this
is
a
pine
tree
*punct* .
*break*
my
father
*punct* ,
in
old
tolland
county
*punct* ,
cut
down
a
pine
tree
once
*punct* ,
and
found
a
silver
ring
grown
over
in
it
*punct* ;
some
old
darkey's
wedding
ring
*punct* .
*break*
how
did
it
get
there
*punct* ?
*break*
and
so
they'll
say
in
the
resurrection
*punct* ,
when
they
come
to
fish
up
this
old
mast
*punct* ,
and
find
a
doubloon
lodged
in
it
*punct* ,
with
bedded
oysters
for
the
shaggy
bark
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
the
gold
*punct* !
*break*
the
precious
*punct* ,
precious
gold!
*punct* ,
the
green
miser
ll
hoard
ye
soon
*punct* !
*break*
god
goes
mong
the
worlds
blackberrying
*punct* .
*break*
ho
*punct* ,
cook
*punct* !
*break*
and
cook
us
*punct* !
*break*
hey
*punct* ,
hey
*punct* ,
hey
*punct* ,
hey
*punct* ,
hey
*punct* ,
jenny
*punct* ,
jenny
*punct* !
*break*
and
get
your
hoe-cake
done
*punct* !
*break*
hast
seen
the
white
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
so
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
once
more
hailing
a
ship
showing
english
colors
*punct* ,
bearing
down
under
the
stern
*punct* .
*break*
trumpet
to
mouth
*punct* ,
the
old
man
was
standing
in
his
hoisted
quarter-boat
*punct* ,
his
ivory
leg
plainly
revealed
to
the
stranger
captain
*punct* ,
who
was
carelessly
reclining
in
his
own
boat's
bow
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
darkly-tanned
*punct* ,
burly
*punct* ,
good-natured
*punct* ,
fine-looking
man
*punct* ,
of
sixty
or
thereabouts
*punct* ,
dressed
in
a
spacious
roundabout
*punct* ,
that
hung
round
him
in
festoons
of
blue
pilot-cloth
*punct* ;
and
one
empty
arm
of
this
jacket
streamed
behind
him
like
the
broidered
arm
of
a
huzzar's
surcoat
*punct* .
*break*
hast
seen
the
white
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
see
you
this
*punct* ?
*break*
and
withdrawing
it
from
the
fold
that
had
hidden
it
*punct* ,
he
held
up
a
white
arm
of
sperm
whale
bone
*punct* ,
terminating
in
a
wooden
head
like
a
mallet
*punct* .
*break*
man
my
boat
*punct* !
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
impetuously
*punct* ,
and
tossing
about
the
oars
near
him
*punct* ,
stand
by
to
lower
*punct* !
*break*
in
less
than
a
minute
*punct* ,
without
quitting
his
little
craft
*punct* ,
he
and
his
crew
were
dropped
to
the
water
*punct* ,
and
were
soon
alongside
of
the
stranger
*punct* .
*break*
but
here
a
curious
difficulty
presented
itself
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
*punct* ,
ahab
had
forgotten
that
since
the
loss
of
his
leg
he
had
never
once
stepped
on
board
of
any
vessel
at
sea
but
his
own
*punct* ,
and
then
it
was
always
by
an
ingenious
and
very
handy
mechanical
contrivance
peculiar
to
the
pequod
*punct* ,
and
a
thing
not
to
be
rigged
and
shipped
in
any
other
vessel
at
a
moment's
warning
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
deprived
of
one
leg
*punct* ,
and
the
strange
ship
of
course
being
altogether
unsupplied
with
the
kindly
invention
*punct* ,
ahab
now
found
himself
abjectly
reduced
to
a
clumsy
landsman
again
*punct* ;
hopelessly
eyeing
the
uncertain
changeful
height
he
could
hardly
hope
to
attain
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
before
been
hinted
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
that
every
little
untoward
circumstance
that
befel
him
*punct* ,
and
which
indirectly
sprang
from
his
luckless
mishap
*punct* ,
almost
invariably
irritated
or
exasperated
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
the
present
instance
*punct* ,
all
this
was
heightened
by
the
sight
of
the
two
officers
of
the
strange
ship
*punct* ,
leaning
over
the
side
*punct* ,
by
the
perpendicular
ladder
of
nailed
cleets
there
*punct* ,
and
swinging
towards
him
a
pair
of
tastefully-ornamented
man-ropes
*punct* ;
for
at
first
they
did
not
seem
to
bethink
them
that
a
one-legged
man
must
be
too
much
of
a
cripple
to
use
their
sea
bannisters
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
awkwardness
only
lasted
a
minute
*punct* ,
because
the
strange
captain
*punct* ,
observing
at
a
glance
how
affairs
stood
*punct* ,
cried
out
*punct* ,
i
see
*punct* ,
i
see!
*punct* ,
avast
heaving
there
*punct* !
*break*
jump
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* ,
and
swing
over
the
cutting-tackle
*punct* .
*break*
as
good
luck
would
have
it
*punct* ,
they
had
had
a
whale
alongside
a
day
or
two
previous
*punct* ,
and
the
great
tackles
were
still
aloft
*punct* ,
and
the
massive
curved
blubber-hook
*punct* ,
now
clean
and
dry
*punct* ,
was
still
attached
to
the
end
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
quickly
lowered
to
ahab
*punct* ,
who
at
once
comprehending
it
all
*punct* ,
slid
his
solitary
thigh
into
the
curve
of
the
hook
*punct* ,
it
was
like
sitting
in
the
fluke
of
an
anchor
*punct* ,
or
the
crotch
of
an
apple
tree
*punct* ,
and
then
giving
the
word
*punct* ,
held
himself
fast
*punct* ,
and
at
the
same
time
also
helped
to
hoist
his
own
weight
*punct* ,
by
pulling
hand-over-hand
upon
one
of
the
running
parts
of
the
tackle
*punct* .
*break*
soon
he
was
carefully
swung
inside
the
high
bulwarks
*punct* ,
and
gently
landed
upon
the
capstan
head
*punct* .
*break*
with
his
ivory
arm
frankly
thrust
forth
in
welcome
*punct* ,
the
other
captain
advanced
*punct* ,
and
ahab
*punct* ,
putting
out
his
ivory
leg
*punct* ,
and
crossing
the
ivory
arm
*punct* ,
like
two
sword-fish
blades
*punct* ,
cried
out
in
his
walrus
way
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
hearty
*punct* !
*break*
let
us
shake
bones
together!
*punct* ,
an
arm
and
a
leg!
*punct* ,
an
arm
that
never
can
shrink
*punct* ,
d'ye
see
*punct* ;
and
a
leg
that
never
can
run
*punct* .
*break*
where
did'st
thou
see
the
white
whale?
*punct* ,
how
long
ago
*punct* ?
*break*
and
he
took
that
arm
off
*punct* ,
did
he
*punct* ?
*break*
asked
ahab
*punct* ,
now
sliding
down
from
the
capstan
*punct* ,
and
resting
on
the
englishman's
shoulder
*punct* ,
as
he
did
so
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
he
was
the
cause
of
it
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ;
and
that
leg
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ?
*break*
spin
me
the
yarn
*punct* ,
said
ahab
*punct* ;
how
was
it
*punct* ?
*break*
it
was
the
first
time
in
my
life
that
i
ever
cruised
on
the
line
*punct* ,
began
the
englishman
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
ignorant
of
the
white
whale
at
that
time
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
one
day
we
lowered
for
a
pod
of
four
or
five
whales
*punct* ,
and
my
boat
fastened
to
one
of
them
*punct* ;
a
regular
circus
horse
he
was
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
that
went
milling
and
milling
round
so
*punct* ,
that
my
boat's
crew
could
only
trim
dish
*punct* ,
by
sitting
all
their
sterns
on
the
outer
gunwale
*punct* .
*break*
presently
up
breaches
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
a
bouncing
great
whale
*punct* ,
with
a
milky-white
head
and
hump
*punct* ,
all
crows
feet
and
wrinkles
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
he
*punct* ,
it
was
he
*punct* !
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
suddenly
letting
out
his
suspended
breath
*punct* .
*break*
and
harpoons
sticking
in
near
his
starboard
fin
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
they
were
mine
*punct* ,
my
irons
*punct* ,
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
exultingly
*punct* ,
but
on
*punct* !
*break*
give
me
a
chance
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
said
the
englishman
*punct* ,
good-humoredly
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
this
old
great-grandfather
*punct* ,
with
the
white
head
and
hump
*punct* ,
runs
all
afoam
into
the
pod
*punct* ,
and
goes
to
snapping
furiously
at
my
fast-line
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
i
see!
*punct* ,
wanted
to
part
it
*punct* ;
free
the
fast-fish
*punct* ,
an
old
trick
*punct* ,
i
know
him
*punct* .
*break*
instead
of
the
other
whale's
that
went
off
to
windward
*punct* ,
all
fluking
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
how
matters
stood
*punct* ,
and
what
a
noble
great
whale
it
was
*punct* ,
the
noblest
and
biggest
i
ever
saw
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
in
my
life
*punct* ,
i
resolved
to
capture
him
*punct* ,
spite
of
the
boiling
rage
he
seemed
to
be
in
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
lord
*punct* ,
look
you
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
hearts
and
souls
alive
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
the
next
instant
*punct* ,
in
a
jiff
*punct* ,
i
was
blind
as
a
bat
*punct* ,
both
eyes
out
*punct* ,
all
befogged
and
bedeadened
with
black
foam
*punct* ,
the
whale's
tail
looming
straight
up
out
of
it
*punct* ,
perpendicular
in
the
air
*punct* ,
like
a
marble
steeple
*punct* .
*break*
no
use
sterning
all
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ;
but
as
i
was
groping
at
midday
*punct* ,
with
a
blinding
sun
*punct* ,
all
crown-jewels
*punct* ;
as
i
was
groping
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
after
the
second
iron
*punct* ,
to
toss
it
overboard
*punct* ,
down
comes
the
tail
like
a
lima
tower
*punct* ,
cutting
my
boat
in
two
*punct* ,
leaving
each
half
in
splinters
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
flukes
first
*punct* ,
the
white
hump
backed
through
the
wreck
*punct* ,
as
though
it
was
all
chips
*punct* .
*break*
we
all
struck
out
*punct* .
*break*
to
escape
his
terrible
flailings
*punct* ,
i
seized
hold
of
my
harpoon-pole
sticking
in
him
*punct* ,
and
for
a
moment
clung
to
that
like
a
sucking
fish
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
bunger
boy
*punct* ,
spin
your
part
of
the
yarn
*punct* .
*break*
the
professional
gentleman
thus
familiarly
pointed
out
*punct* ,
had
been
all
the
time
standing
near
them
*punct* ,
with
nothing
specific
visible
*punct* ,
to
denote
his
gentlemanly
rank
on
board
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
was
an
exceedingly
round
but
sober
one
*punct* ;
he
was
dressed
in
a
faded
blue
woollen
frock
or
shirt
*punct* ,
and
patched
trowsers
*punct* ;
and
had
thus
far
been
dividing
his
attention
between
a
marlingspike
he
held
in
one
hand
*punct* ,
and
a
pill-box
held
in
the
other
*punct* ,
occasionally
casting
a
critical
glance
at
the
ivory
limbs
of
the
two
crippled
captains
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
shocking
bad
wound
*punct* ,
began
the
whale-surgeon
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
taking
my
advice
*punct* ,
captain
boomer
here
*punct* ,
stood
our
old
sammy
*punct* ,
samuel
enderby
is
the
name
of
my
ship
*punct* ,
interrupted
the
one-armed
captain
*punct* ,
addressing
ahab
*punct* ;
go
on
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* .
*break*
stood
our
old
sammy
off
to
the
northward
*punct* ,
to
get
out
of
the
blazing
hot
weather
there
on
the
line
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
was
no
use
*punct* ,
i
did
all
i
could
*punct* ;
sat
up
with
him
nights
*punct* ;
was
very
severe
with
him
in
the
matter
of
diet
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
very
severe
*punct* !
*break*
chimed
in
the
patient
himself
*punct* ;
then
suddenly
altering
his
voice
*punct* ,
drinking
hot
rum
toddies
with
me
every
night
*punct* ,
till
he
couldn't
see
to
put
on
the
bandages
*punct* ;
and
sending
me
to
bed
*punct* ,
half
seas
over
*punct* ,
about
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
ye
stars
*punct* !
*break*
he
sat
up
with
me
indeed
*punct* ,
and
was
very
severe
in
my
diet
*punct* .
*break*
a
great
watcher
*punct* ,
and
very
dietetically
severe
*punct* ,
is
dr.
bunger
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
bunger
*punct* ,
you
dog
*punct* ,
laugh
out
*punct* !
*break*
why
don't
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
you
know
you're
a
precious
jolly
rascal.
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
heave
ahead
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* ,
i'd
rather
be
killed
by
you
than
kept
alive
by
any
other
man
*punct* .
*break*
my
captain
*punct* ,
you
must
have
ere
this
perceived
*punct* ,
respected
sir
*punct* ,
said
the
imperturbable
godly-looking
bunger
*punct* ,
slightly
bowing
to
ahab
*punct* ,
is
apt
to
be
facetious
at
times
*punct* ;
he
spins
us
many
clever
things
of
that
sort
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
may
as
well
say
*punct* ,
en
passant
*punct* ,
as
the
french
remark
*punct* ,
that
i
myself
*punct* ,
that
is
to
say
*punct* ,
jack
bunger
*punct* ,
late
of
the
reverend
clergy
*punct* ,
am
a
strict
total
abstinence
man
*punct* ;
i
never
drink
*punct* ,
water
*punct* !
*break*
cried
the
captain
*punct* ;
he
never
drinks
it
*punct* ;
it's
a
sort
of
fits
to
him
*punct* ;
fresh
water
throws
him
into
the
hydrophobia
*punct* ;
but
go
on
*punct* ,
go
on
with
the
arm
story
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
may
as
well
*punct* ,
said
the
surgeon
*punct* ,
coolly
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
about
observing
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
before
captain
boomer's
facetious
interruption
*punct* ,
that
spite
of
my
best
and
severest
endeavors
*punct* ,
the
wound
kept
getting
worse
and
worse
*punct* ;
the
truth
was
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
it
was
as
ugly
gaping
wound
as
surgeon
ever
saw
*punct* ;
more
than
two
feet
and
several
inches
long
*punct* .
*break*
i
measured
it
with
the
lead
line
*punct* .
*break*
he
flies
into
diabolical
passions
sometimes
*punct* .
*break*
do
ye
see
this
dent
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
removing
his
hat
*punct* ,
and
brushing
aside
his
hair
*punct* ,
and
exposing
a
bowl-like
cavity
in
his
skull
*punct* ,
but
which
bore
not
the
slightest
scarry
trace
*punct* ,
or
any
token
of
ever
having
been
a
wound
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
the
captain
there
will
tell
you
how
that
came
here
*punct* ;
he
knows
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
i
don't
*punct* ,
said
the
captain
*punct* ,
but
his
mother
did
*punct* ;
he
was
born
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
you
solemn
rogue
*punct* ,
you
*punct* ,
you
bunger
*punct* !
*break*
was
there
ever
such
another
bunger
in
the
watery
world
*punct* ?
*break*
bunger
*punct* ,
when
you
die
*punct* ,
you
ought
to
die
in
pickle
*punct* ,
you
dog
*punct* ;
you
should
be
preserved
to
future
ages
*punct* ,
you
rascal
*punct* .
*break*
what
became
of
the
white
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
now
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
who
thus
far
had
been
impatiently
listening
to
this
bye-play
between
the
two
englishmen
*punct* .
*break*
cried
the
one-armed
captain
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* !
*break*
well
*punct* ;
after
he
sounded
*punct* ,
we
didn't
see
him
again
for
some
time
*punct* ;
in
fact
*punct* ,
as
i
before
hinted
*punct* ,
i
didn't
then
know
what
whale
it
was
that
had
served
me
such
a
trick
*punct* ,
till
some
time
afterwards
*punct* ,
when
coming
back
to
the
line
*punct* ,
we
heard
about
moby
dick
*punct* ,
as
some
call
him
*punct* ,
and
then
i
knew
it
was
he
*punct* .
*break*
did'st
thou
cross
his
wake
again
*punct* ?
*break*
but
could
not
fasten
*punct* ?
*break*
didn't
want
to
try
to
*punct* :
ain't
one
limb
enough
*punct* ?
*break*
what
should
i
do
without
this
other
arm
*punct* ?
*break*
and
i'm
thinking
moby
dick
doesn't
bite
so
much
as
he
swallows
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
interrupted
bunger
*punct* ,
give
him
your
left
arm
for
bait
to
get
the
right
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
knows
it
too
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
what
you
take
for
the
white
whale's
malice
is
only
his
awkwardness
*punct* .
*break*
for
he
never
means
to
swallow
a
single
limb
*punct* ;
he
only
thinks
to
terrify
by
feints
*punct* .
*break*
but
sometimes
he
is
like
the
old
juggling
fellow
*punct* ,
formerly
a
patient
of
mine
in
ceylon
*punct* ,
that
making
believe
swallow
jack-knives
*punct* ,
once
upon
a
time
let
one
drop
into
him
in
good
earnest
*punct* ,
and
there
it
stayed
for
a
twelvemonth
or
more
*punct* ;
when
i
gave
him
an
emetic
*punct* ,
and
he
heaved
it
up
in
small
tacks
*punct* ,
d'ye
see
*punct* .
*break*
no
possible
way
for
him
to
digest
that
jack-knife
*punct* ,
and
fully
incorporate
it
into
his
general
bodily
system
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
captain
boomer
*punct* ,
if
you
are
quick
enough
about
it
*punct* ,
and
have
a
mind
to
pawn
one
arm
for
the
sake
of
the
privilege
of
giving
decent
burial
to
the
other
*punct* ,
why
in
that
case
the
arm
is
yours
*punct* ;
only
let
the
whale
have
another
chance
at
you
shortly
*punct* ,
that's
all
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
thank
ye
*punct* ,
bunger
*punct* ,
said
the
english
captain
*punct* ,
he's
welcome
to
the
arm
he
has
*punct* ,
since
i
can't
help
it
*punct* ,
and
didn't
know
him
then
*punct* ;
but
not
to
another
one
*punct* .
*break*
no
more
white
whales
for
me
*punct* ;
i've
lowered
for
him
once
*punct* ,
and
that
has
satisfied
me
*punct* .
*break*
there
would
be
great
glory
in
killing
him
*punct* ,
i
know
that
*punct* ;
and
there
is
a
ship-load
of
precious
sperm
in
him
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
hark
ye
*punct* ,
he's
best
let
alone
*punct* ;
don't
you
think
so
*punct* ,
captain?
*punct* ,
glancing
at
the
ivory
leg
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
will
still
be
hunted
*punct* ,
for
all
that
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
best
let
alone
*punct* ,
that
accursed
thing
is
not
always
what
least
allures
*punct* .
*break*
he's
all
a
magnet
*punct* !
*break*
how
long
since
thou
saw'st
him
last
*punct* ?
*break*
which
way
heading
*punct* ?
*break*
bless
my
soul
*punct* ,
and
curse
the
foul
fiend's
*punct* ,
cried
bunger
*punct* ,
stoopingly
walking
round
ahab
*punct* ,
and
like
a
dog
*punct* ,
strangely
snuffing
*punct* ;
this
man's
blood
*punct* ,
bring
the
thermometer;
*punct* ,
it's
at
the
boiling
point!
*punct* ,
his
pulse
makes
these
planks
beat!
*punct* ,
sir!
*punct* ,
taking
a
lancet
from
his
pocket
*punct* ,
and
drawing
near
to
ahab's
arm
*punct* .
*break*
roared
ahab
*punct* ,
dashing
him
against
the
bulwarks
*punct* ,
man
the
boat
*punct* !
*break*
which
way
heading
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
the
english
captain
*punct* ,
to
whom
the
question
was
put
*punct* .
*break*
what's
the
matter
*punct* ?
*break*
he
was
heading
east
*punct* ,
i
think.
*punct* ,
is
your
captain
crazy
*punct* ?
*break*
in
a
moment
he
was
standing
in
the
boat's
stern
*punct* ,
and
the
manilla
men
were
springing
to
their
oars
*punct* .
*break*
in
vain
the
english
captain
hailed
him
*punct* .
*break*
how
long
*punct* ,
prior
to
the
year
of
our
lord
0083
*punct* ,
this
great
whaling
house
was
in
existence
*punct* ,
my
numerous
fish-documents
do
not
make
plain
*punct* ;
but
in
that
year
*punct* ,
it
fitted
out
the
first
english
ships
that
ever
regularly
hunted
the
sperm
whale
*punct* ;
though
for
some
score
of
years
previous
*punct* ,
ever
since
*punct* ,
our
valiant
coffins
and
maceys
of
nantucket
and
the
vineyard
had
in
large
fleets
pursued
that
leviathan
*punct* ,
but
only
in
the
north
and
south
atlantic
*punct* :
not
elsewhere
*punct* .
*break*
be
it
distinctly
recorded
here
*punct* ,
that
the
nantucketers
were
the
first
among
mankind
to
harpoon
with
civilized
steel
the
great
sperm
whale
*punct* ;
and
that
for
half
a
century
they
were
the
only
people
of
the
whole
globe
who
so
harpooned
him
*punct* .
*break*
in
*punct* ,
a
fine
ship
*punct* ,
the
amelia
*punct* ,
fitted
out
for
the
express
purpose
*punct* ,
and
at
the
sole
charge
of
the
vigorous
enderbys
*punct* ,
boldly
rounded
cape
horn
*punct* ,
and
was
the
first
among
the
nations
to
lower
a
whale-boat
of
any
sort
in
the
great
south
sea
*punct* .
*break*
but
not
content
with
this
good
deed
*punct* ,
the
indefatigable
house
again
bestirred
itself
*punct* :
samuel
and
all
his
sons
*punct* ,
how
many
*punct* ,
their
mother
only
knows
*punct* ,
and
under
their
immediate
auspices
*punct* ,
and
partly
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
at
their
expense
*punct* ,
the
british
government
was
induced
to
send
the
sloop-of-war
rattler
on
a
whaling
voyage
of
discovery
into
the
south
sea
*punct* .
*break*
commanded
by
a
naval
post-captain
*punct* ,
the
rattler
made
a
rattling
voyage
of
it
*punct* ,
and
did
some
service
*punct* ;
how
much
does
not
appear
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
is
not
all
*punct* .
*break*
in
0084
*punct* ,
the
same
house
fitted
out
a
discovery
whale
ship
of
their
own
*punct* ,
to
go
on
a
tasting
cruise
to
the
remote
waters
of
japan
*punct* .
*break*
that
ship
*punct* ,
well
called
the
syren
*punct* ,
made
a
noble
experimental
cruise
*punct* ;
and
it
was
thus
that
the
great
japanese
whaling
ground
first
became
generally
known
*punct* .
*break*
the
syren
in
this
famous
voyage
was
commanded
by
a
captain
coffin
*punct* ,
a
nantucketer
*punct* .
*break*
all
honor
to
the
enderbies
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
whose
house
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
exists
to
the
present
day
*punct* ;
though
doubtless
the
original
samuel
must
long
ago
have
slipped
his
cable
for
the
great
south
sea
of
the
other
world
*punct* .
*break*
the
ship
named
after
him
was
worthy
of
the
honor
*punct* ,
being
a
very
fast
sailer
and
a
noble
craft
every
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
boarded
her
once
at
midnight
somewhere
off
the
patagonian
coast
*punct* ,
and
drank
good
flip
down
in
the
forecastle
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
fine
gam
we
had
*punct* ,
and
they
were
all
trumps
*punct* ,
every
soul
on
board
*punct* .
*break*
a
short
life
to
them
*punct* ,
and
a
jolly
death
*punct* .
*break*
and
that
fine
gam
i
had
*punct* ,
long
*punct* ,
very
long
after
old
ahab
touched
her
planks
with
his
ivory
heel
*punct* ,
it
minds
me
of
the
noble
*punct* ,
solid
*punct* ,
saxon
hospitality
of
that
ship
*punct* ;
and
may
my
parson
forget
me
*punct* ,
and
the
devil
remember
me
*punct* ,
if
i
ever
lose
sight
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
did
i
say
we
had
flip
*punct* ?
*break*
however
*punct* ,
the
masts
did
not
go
overboard
*punct* ;
and
by
and
bye
we
scrambled
down
*punct* ,
so
sober
*punct* ,
that
we
had
to
pass
the
flip
again
*punct* ,
though
the
savage
salt
spray
bursting
down
the
forecastle
scuttle
*punct* ,
rather
too
much
diluted
and
pickled
it
to
my
taste
*punct* .
*break*
the
beef
was
fine
*punct* ,
tough
*punct* ,
but
with
body
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
they
said
it
was
bull-beef
*punct* ;
others
*punct* ,
that
it
was
dromedary
beef
*punct* ;
but
i
do
not
know
*punct* ,
for
certain
*punct* ,
how
that
was
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
dumplings
too
*punct* ;
small
*punct* ,
but
substantial
*punct* ,
symmetrically
globular
*punct* ,
and
indestructible
dumplings
*punct* .
*break*
i
fancied
that
you
could
feel
them
*punct* ,
and
roll
them
about
in
you
after
they
were
swallowed
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
stooped
over
too
far
forward
*punct* ,
you
risked
their
pitching
out
of
you
like
billiard-balls
*punct* .
*break*
the
bread
*punct* ,
but
that
couldn't
be
helped
*punct* ;
besides
*punct* ,
it
was
an
anti-scorbutic
*punct* ;
in
short
*punct* ,
the
bread
contained
the
only
fresh
fare
they
had
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
forecastle
was
not
very
light
*punct* ,
and
it
was
very
easy
to
step
over
into
a
dark
corner
when
you
ate
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
in
all
*punct* ,
taking
her
from
truck
to
helm
*punct* ,
considering
the
dimensions
of
the
cook's
boilers
*punct* ,
including
his
own
live
parchment
boilers
*punct* ;
fore
and
aft
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
the
samuel
enderby
was
a
jolly
ship
*punct* ;
of
good
fare
and
plenty
*punct* ;
fine
flip
and
strong
*punct* ;
crack
fellows
all
*punct* ,
and
capital
from
boot
heels
to
hat-band
*punct* .
*break*
but
why
was
it
*punct* ,
think
ye
*punct* ,
that
the
samuel
enderby
*punct* ,
and
some
other
english
whalers
i
know
of
*punct* ,
not
all
though
*punct* ,
were
such
famous
*punct* ,
hospitable
ships
*punct* ;
that
passed
round
the
beef
*punct* ,
and
the
bread
*punct* ,
and
the
can
*punct* ,
and
the
joke
*punct* ;
and
were
not
soon
weary
of
eating
*punct* ,
and
drinking
*punct* ,
and
laughing
*punct* ?
*break*
i
will
tell
you
*punct* .
*break*
the
abounding
good
cheer
of
these
english
whalers
is
matter
for
historical
research
*punct* .
*break*
nor
have
i
been
at
all
sparing
of
historical
whale
research
*punct* ,
when
it
has
seemed
needed
*punct* .
*break*
the
english
were
preceded
in
the
whale
fishery
by
the
hollanders
*punct* ,
zealanders
*punct* ,
and
danes
*punct* ;
from
whom
they
derived
many
terms
still
extant
in
the
fishery
*punct* ;
and
what
is
yet
more
*punct* ,
their
fat
old
fashions
*punct* ,
touching
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
as
a
general
thing
*punct* ,
the
english
merchant-ship
scrimps
her
crew
*punct* ;
but
not
so
the
english
whaler
*punct* .
*break*
during
my
researches
in
the
leviathanic
histories
*punct* ,
i
stumbled
upon
an
ancient
dutch
volume
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
by
the
musty
whaling
smell
of
it
*punct* ,
i
knew
must
be
about
whalers
*punct* .
*break*
the
title
was
*punct* ,
dan
coopman
*punct* ,
wherefore
i
concluded
that
this
must
be
the
invaluable
memoirs
of
some
amsterdam
cooper
in
the
fishery
*punct* ,
as
every
whale
ship
must
carry
its
cooper
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
reinforced
in
this
opinion
by
seeing
that
it
was
the
production
of
one
fitz
swackhammer
*punct* .
*break*
but
my
friend
dr.
snodhead
*punct* ,
a
very
learned
man
*punct* ,
professor
of
low
dutch
and
high
german
in
the
college
of
santa
claus
and
st
*punct* .
*break*
pott's
*punct* ,
to
whom
i
handed
the
work
for
translation
*punct* ,
giving
him
a
box
of
sperm
candles
for
his
trouble
*punct* ,
this
same
dr.
snodhead
*punct* ,
so
soon
as
he
spied
the
book
*punct* ,
assured
me
that
dan
coopman
did
not
mean
the
cooper
*punct* ,
but
the
merchant
*punct* .
*break*
in
short
*punct* ,
this
ancient
and
learned
low
dutch
book
treated
of
the
commerce
of
holland
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
among
other
subjects
*punct* ,
contained
a
very
interesting
account
of
its
whale
fishery
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
this
chapter
it
was
*punct* ,
headed
smeer
*punct* ,
or
fat
*punct* ,
that
i
found
a
long
detailed
list
of
the
outfits
for
the
larders
and
cellars
of
180
sail
of
dutch
whalemen
*punct* ;
from
which
list
*punct* ,
as
translated
by
dr.
snodhead
*punct* .
*break*
i
transcribe
the
following
*punct* :
0084400,000
lbs
*punct* .
*break*
of
stock
fish
*punct* .
*break*
of
soft
bread
*punct* .
*break*
2,800
firkins
of
butter
*punct* .
*break*
of
texel
and
leyden
cheese
*punct* .
*break*
550
ankers
of
geneva
*punct* .
*break*
10,800
barrels
of
beer
*punct* .
*break*
most
statistical
tables
are
parchingly
dry
in
the
reading
*punct* ;
not
so
in
the
present
case
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
where
the
reader
is
flooded
with
whole
pipes
*punct* ,
barrels
*punct* ,
quarts
*punct* ,
and
gills
of
good
gin
and
good
cheer
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
first
place
*punct* ,
the
amount
of
butter
*punct* ,
and
texel
and
leyden
cheese
consumed
*punct* ,
seems
amazing
*punct* .
*break*
i
impute
it
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
to
their
naturally
unctuous
natures
*punct* ,
being
rendered
still
more
unctuous
by
the
nature
of
their
vocation
*punct* ,
and
especially
by
their
pursuing
their
game
in
those
frigid
polar
seas
*punct* ,
on
the
very
coasts
of
that
esquimaux
country
where
the
convivial
natives
pledge
each
other
in
bumpers
of
train
oil
*punct* .
*break*
the
quantity
of
beer
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
is
very
large
*punct* ,
10,800
barrels
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
as
those
polar
fisheries
could
only
be
prosecuted
in
the
short
summer
of
that
climate
*punct* ,
so
that
the
whole
cruise
of
one
of
these
dutch
whalemen
*punct* ,
including
the
short
voyage
to
and
from
the
spitzbergen
sea
*punct* ,
did
not
much
exceed
three
months
*punct* ,
say
*punct* ,
and
reckoning
30
men
to
each
of
their
fleet
of
180
sail
*punct* ,
we
have
5,400
low
dutch
seamen
in
all
*punct* ;
therefore
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
we
have
precisely
two
barrels
of
beer
per
man
*punct* ,
for
a
twelve
weeks
allowance
*punct* ,
exclusive
of
his
fair
proportion
of
that
550
ankers
of
gin
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
whether
these
gin
and
beer
harpooneers
*punct* ,
so
fuddled
as
one
might
fancy
them
to
have
been
*punct* ,
were
the
right
sort
of
men
to
stand
up
in
a
boat's
head
*punct* ,
and
take
good
aim
at
flying
whales
*punct* ;
this
would
seem
somewhat
improbable
*punct* .
*break*
yet
they
did
aim
at
them
*punct* ,
and
hit
them
too
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
was
very
far
north
*punct* ,
be
it
remembered
*punct* ,
where
beer
agrees
well
with
the
constitution
*punct* ;
upon
the
equator
*punct* ,
in
our
southern
fishery
*punct* ,
beer
would
be
apt
to
make
the
harpooneer
sleepy
at
the
mast-head
and
boozy
in
his
boat
*punct* ;
and
grievous
loss
might
ensue
to
nantucket
and
new
bedford
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
more
*punct* ;
enough
has
been
said
to
show
that
the
old
dutch
whalers
of
two
or
three
centuries
ago
were
high
livers
*punct* ;
and
that
the
english
whalers
have
not
neglected
so
excellent
an
example
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
say
they
*punct* ,
when
cruising
in
an
empty
ship
*punct* ,
if
you
can
get
nothing
better
out
of
the
world
*punct* ,
get
a
good
dinner
out
of
it
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
a
large
and
thorough
sweeping
comprehension
of
him
*punct* ,
it
behoves
me
now
to
unbutton
him
still
further
*punct* ,
and
untagging
the
points
of
his
hose
*punct* ,
unbuckling
his
garters
*punct* ,
and
casting
loose
the
hooks
and
the
eyes
of
the
joints
of
his
innermost
bones
*punct* ,
set
him
before
you
in
his
ultimatum
*punct* ;
that
is
to
say
*punct* ,
in
his
unconditional
skeleton
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
now
*punct* ,
ishmael
*punct* ?
*break*
how
is
it
*punct* ,
that
you
*punct* ,
a
mere
oarsman
in
the
fishery
*punct* ,
pretend
to
know
aught
about
the
subterranean
parts
of
the
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
did
erudite
stubb
*punct* ,
mounted
upon
your
capstan
*punct* ,
deliver
lectures
on
the
anatomy
of
the
cetacea
*punct* ;
and
by
help
of
the
windlass
*punct* ,
hold
up
a
specimen
rib
for
exhibition
*punct* ?
*break*
explain
thyself
*punct* ,
ishmael
*punct* .
*break*
can
you
land
a
full-grown
whale
on
your
deck
for
examination
*punct* ,
as
a
cook
dishes
a
roast-pig
*punct* ?
*break*
a
veritable
witness
have
you
hitherto
been
*punct* ,
ishmael
*punct* ;
but
have
a
care
how
you
seize
the
privilege
of
jonah
alone
*punct* ;
the
privilege
of
discoursing
upon
the
joists
and
beams
*punct* ;
the
rafters
*punct* ,
ridge-pole
*punct* ,
sleepers
*punct* ,
and
under-pinnings
*punct* ,
making
up
the
frame-work
of
leviathan
*punct* ;
and
belike
of
the
tallow-vats
*punct* ,
dairy-rooms
*punct* ,
butteries
*punct* ,
and
cheeseries
in
his
bowels
*punct* .
*break*
i
confess
*punct* ,
that
since
jonah
*punct* ,
few
whalemen
have
penetrated
very
far
beneath
the
skin
of
the
adult
whale
*punct* ;
nevertheless
*punct* ,
i
have
been
blessed
with
an
opportunity
to
dissect
him
in
miniature
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
ship
i
belonged
to
*punct* ,
a
small
cub
sperm
whale
was
once
bodily
hoisted
to
the
deck
for
his
poke
or
bag
*punct* ,
to
make
sheaths
for
the
barbs
of
the
harpoons
*punct* ,
and
for
the
heads
of
the
lances
*punct* .
*break*
think
you
i
let
that
chance
go
*punct* ,
without
using
my
boat-hatchet
and
jack-knife
*punct* ,
and
breaking
the
seal
and
reading
all
the
contents
of
that
young
cub
*punct* ?
*break*
for
being
at
tranque
*punct* ,
years
ago
*punct* ,
when
attached
to
the
trading-ship
dey
of
algiers
*punct* ,
i
was
invited
to
spend
part
of
the
arsacidean
holidays
with
the
lord
of
tranque
*punct* ,
at
his
retired
palm
villa
at
pupella
*punct* ;
a
sea-side
glen
not
very
far
distant
from
what
our
sailors
called
bamboo-town
*punct* ,
his
capital
*punct* .
*break*
among
many
other
fine
qualities
*punct* ,
my
royal
friend
tranquo
*punct* ,
being
gifted
with
a
devout
love
for
all
matters
of
barbaric
vertu
*punct* ,
had
brought
together
in
pupella
whatever
rare
things
the
more
ingenious
of
his
people
could
invent
*punct* ;
chiefly
carved
woods
of
wonderful
devices
*punct* ,
chiselled
shells
*punct* ,
inlaid
spears
*punct* ,
costly
paddles
*punct* ,
aromatic
canoes
*punct* ;
and
all
these
distributed
among
whatever
natural
wonders
*punct* ,
the
wonder-freighted
*punct* ,
tribute-rendering
waves
had
cast
upon
his
shores
*punct* .
*break*
chief
among
these
latter
was
a
great
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
after
an
unusually
long
raging
gale
*punct* ,
had
been
found
dead
and
stranded
*punct* ,
with
his
head
against
a
cocoa-nut
tree
*punct* ,
whose
plumage-like
*punct* ,
tufted
droopings
seemed
his
verdant
jet
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
vast
body
had
at
last
been
stripped
of
its
fathom-deep
enfoldings
*punct* ,
and
the
bones
become
dust
dry
in
the
sun
*punct* ,
then
the
skeleton
was
carefully
transported
up
the
pupella
glen
*punct* ,
where
a
grand
temple
of
lordly
palms
now
sheltered
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
ribs
were
hung
with
trophies
*punct* ;
the
vertebrae
were
carved
with
arsacidean
annals
*punct* ,
in
strange
hieroglyphics
*punct* ;
in
the
skull
*punct* ,
the
priests
kept
up
an
unextinguished
aromatic
flame
*punct* ,
so
that
the
mystic
head
again
sent
forth
its
vapory
spout
*punct* ;
while
*punct* ,
suspended
from
a
bough
*punct* ,
the
terrific
lower
jaw
vibrated
over
all
the
devotees
*punct* ,
like
the
hair-hung
sword
that
so
affrighted
damocles
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
wondrous
sight
*punct* .
*break*
the
wood
was
green
as
mosses
of
the
icy
glen
*punct* ;
the
trees
stood
high
and
haughty
*punct* ,
feeling
their
living
sap
*punct* ;
the
industrious
earth
beneath
was
as
a
weaver's
loom
*punct* ,
with
a
gorgeous
carpet
on
it
*punct* ,
whereof
the
ground-vine
tendrils
formed
the
warp
and
woof
*punct* ,
and
the
living
flowers
the
figures
*punct* .
*break*
through
the
lacings
of
the
leaves
*punct* ,
the
great
sun
seemed
a
flying
shuttle
weaving
the
unwearied
verdure
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
busy
weaver
*punct* !
*break*
unseen
weaver!
*punct* ,
pause!
*punct* ,
one
word!
*punct* ,
whither
flows
the
fabric
*punct* ?
*break*
what
palace
may
it
deck
*punct* ?
*break*
wherefore
all
these
ceaseless
toilings
*punct* ?
*break*
speak
*punct* ,
weaver!
*punct* ,
stay
thy
hand!
*punct* ,
but
one
single
word
with
thee
*punct* !
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
the
shuttle
flies
*punct* ,
the
figures
float
from
forth
the
loom
*punct* ;
the
freshet-rushing
carpet
for
ever
slides
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
weaver-god
*punct* ,
he
weaves
*punct* ;
and
by
that
weaving
is
he
deafened
*punct* ,
that
he
hears
no
mortal
voice
*punct* ;
and
by
that
humming
*punct* ,
we
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
who
look
on
the
loom
are
deafened
*punct* ;
and
only
when
we
escape
it
shall

for
even
so
it
is
in
all
material
factories
*punct* .
*break*
the
spoken
words
that
are
inaudible
among
the
flying
spindles
*punct* ;
those
same
words
are
plainly
heard
without
the
walls
*punct* ,
bursting
from
the
opened
casements
*punct* .
*break*
thereby
have
villanies
been
detected
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
mortal
*punct* !
*break*
then
*punct* ,
be
heedful
*punct* ;
for
so
*punct* ,
in
all
this
din
of
the
great
world's
loom
*punct* ,
thy
subtlest
thinkings
may
be
overheard
afar
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
amid
the
green
*punct* ,
life-restless
loom
of
that
arsacidean
wood
*punct* ,
the
great
*punct* ,
white
*punct* ,
worshipped
skeleton
lay
lounging
*punct* ,
a
gigantic
idler
*punct* !
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
as
the
ever-woven
verdant
warp
and
woof
intermixed
and
hummed
around
him
*punct* ,
the
mighty
idler
seemed
the
cunning
weaver
*punct* ;
himself
all
woven
over
with
the
vines
*punct* ;
every
month
assuming
greener
*punct* ,
fresher
verdure
*punct* ;
but
himself
a
skeleton
*punct* .
*break*
life
folded
death
*punct* ;
death
trellised
life
*punct* ;
the
grim
god
wived
with
youthful
life
*punct* ,
and
begat
him
curly-headed
glories
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
when
with
royal
tranquo
i
visited
this
wondrous
whale
*punct* ,
and
saw
the
skull
an
altar
*punct* ,
and
the
artificial
smoke
ascending
from
where
the
real
jet
had
issued
*punct* ,
i
marvelled
that
the
king
should
regard
a
chapel
as
an
object
of
vertu
*punct* .
*break*
but
more
i
marvelled
that
the
priests
should
swear
that
smoky
jet
of
his
was
genuine
*punct* .
*break*
to
and
fro
i
paced
before
this
skeleton
*punct* ,
brushed
the
vines
aside
*punct* ,
broke
through
the
ribs
*punct* ,
and
with
a
ball
of
arsacidean
twine
*punct* ,
wandered
*punct* ,
eddied
long
amid
its
many
winding
*punct* ,
shaded
collonades
and
arbors
*punct* .
*break*
but
soon
my
line
was
out
*punct* ;
and
following
it
back
*punct* ,
i
emerged
from
the
opening
where
i
entered
*punct* .
*break*
from
their
arrow-slit
in
the
skull
*punct* ,
the
priests
perceived
me
taking
the
altitude
of
the
final
rib
*punct* .
*break*
they
shouted
*punct* ;
dar'st
thou
measure
this
our
god
*punct* !
*break*
that's
for
us
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
priests
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
how
long
do
ye
make
him
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ?
*break*
but
hereupon
a
fierce
contest
rose
among
them
*punct* ,
concerning
feet
and
inches
*punct* ;
they
cracked
each
other's
sconces
with
their
yard-sticks
*punct* ,
the
great
skull
echoed
*punct* ,
and
seizing
that
lucky
chance
*punct* ,
i
quickly
concluded
my
own
admeasurements
*punct* .
*break*
these
admeasurements
i
now
propose
to
set
before
you
*punct* .
*break*
but
first
*punct* ,
be
it
recorded
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
in
this
matter
*punct* ,
i
am
not
free
to
utter
any
fancied
measurement
i
please
*punct* .
*break*
because
there
are
skeleton
authorities
you
can
refer
to
*punct* ,
to
test
my
accuracy
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
a
leviathanic
museum
*punct* ,
they
tell
me
*punct* ,
in
hull
*punct* ,
england
*punct* ,
one
of
the
whaling
ports
of
that
country
*punct* ,
where
they
have
some
fine
specimens
of
fin-backs
and
other
whales
*punct* .
*break*
likewise
*punct* ,
i
have
heard
that
in
the
museum
of
manchester
*punct* ,
in
new
hampshire
*punct* ,
they
have
what
the
proprietors
call
the
only
perfect
specimen
of
a
greenland
or
river
whale
in
the
united
states
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
at
a
place
in
yorkshire
*punct* ,
england
*punct* ,
burton
constable
by
name
*punct* ,
a
certain
sir
clifford
constable
has
in
his
possession
the
skeleton
of
a
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
but
of
moderate
size
*punct* ,
by
no
means
of
the
full-grown
magnitude
of
my
friend
king
tranquo's
*punct* .
*break*
in
both
cases
*punct* ,
the
stranded
whales
to
which
these
two
skeletons
belonged
*punct* ,
were
originally
claimed
by
their
proprietors
upon
similar
grounds
*punct* .
*break*
king
tranquo
seizing
his
because
he
wanted
it
*punct* ;
and
sir
clifford
*punct* ,
because
he
was
lord
of
the
seignories
of
those
parts
*punct* .
*break*
sir
clifford's
whale
has
been
articulated
throughout
*punct* ;
so
that
*punct* ,
like
a
great
chest
of
drawers
*punct* ,
you
can
open
and
shut
him
*punct* ,
in
all
his
bony
cavities
*punct* ,
spread
out
his
ribs
like
a
gigantic
fan
*punct* ,
and
swing
all
day
upon
his
lower
jaw
*punct* .
*break*
locks
are
to
be
put
upon
some
of
his
trap-doors
and
shutters
*punct* ;
and
a
footman
will
show
round
future
visitors
with
a
bunch
of
keys
at
his
side
*punct* .
*break*
sir
clifford
thinks
of
charging
twopence
for
a
peep
at
the
whispering
gallery
in
the
spinal
column
*punct* ;
threepence
to
hear
the
echo
in
the
hollow
of
his
cerebellum
*punct* ;
and
sixpence
for
the
unrivalled
view
from
his
forehead
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
statement
may
prove
useful
here
*punct* .
*break*
according
to
a
careful
calculation
i
have
made
*punct* ,
and
which
i
partly
base
upon
captain
scoresby's
estimate
*punct* ,
of
seventy
tons
for
the
largest
sized
greenland
whale
of
sixty
feet
in
length
*punct* ;
according
to
my
careful
calculation
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
a
sperm
whale
of
the
largest
magnitude
*punct* ,
between
eighty-five
and
ninety
feet
in
length
*punct* ,
and
something
less
than
forty
feet
in
its
fullest
circumference
*punct* ,
such
a
whale
will
weigh
at
least
ninety
tons
*punct* ;
so
that
reckoning
thirteen
men
to
a
ton
*punct* ,
he
would
considerably
outweigh
the
combined
population
of
a
whole
village
of
one
thousand
one
hundred
inhabitants
*punct* .
*break*
think
you
not
then
that
brains
*punct* ,
like
yoked
cattle
*punct* ,
should
be
put
to
this
leviathan
*punct* ,
to
make
him
at
all
budge
to
any
landsman's
imagination
*punct* ?
*break*
having
already
in
various
ways
put
before
you
his
skull
*punct* ,
spout-hole
*punct* ,
jaw
*punct* ,
teeth
*punct* ,
tail
*punct* ,
forehead
*punct* ,
fins
*punct* ,
and
divers
other
parts
*punct* ,
i
shall
now
simply
point
out
what
is
most
interesting
in
the
general
bulk
of
his
unobstructed
bones
*punct* .
*break*
in
length
*punct* ,
the
sperm
whale's
skeleton
at
tranque
measured
seventy-two
feet
*punct* ;
so
that
when
fully
invested
and
extended
in
life
*punct* ,
he
must
have
been
ninety
feet
long
*punct* ;
for
in
the
whale
*punct* ,
the
skeleton
loses
about
one
fifth
in
length
compared
with
the
living
body
*punct* .
*break*
of
this
seventy-two
feet
*punct* ,
his
skull
and
jaw
comprised
some
twenty
feet
*punct* ,
leaving
some
fifty
feet
of
plain
back-bone
*punct* .
*break*
attached
to
this
back-bone
*punct* ,
for
something
less
than
a
third
of
its
length
*punct* ,
was
the
mighty
circular
basket
of
ribs
which
once
enclosed
his
vitals
*punct* .
*break*
to
me
this
vast
ivory-ribbed
chest
*punct* ,
with
the
long
*punct* ,
unrelieved
spine
*punct* ,
extending
far
away
from
it
in
a
straight
line
*punct* ,
not
a
little
resembled
the
hull
of
a
great
ship
new-laid
upon
the
stocks
*punct* ,
when
only
some
twenty
of
her
naked
bow-ribs
are
inserted
*punct* ,
and
the
keel
is
otherwise
*punct* ,
for
the
time
*punct* ,
but
a
long
*punct* ,
disconnected
timber
*punct* .
*break*
the
ribs
were
ten
on
a
side
*punct* .
*break*
the
first
*punct* ,
to
begin
from
the
neck
*punct* ,
was
nearly
six
feet
long
*punct* ;
the
second
*punct* ,
third
*punct* ,
and
fourth
were
each
successively
longer
*punct* ,
till
you
came
to
the
climax
of
the
fifth
*punct* ,
or
one
of
the
middle
ribs
*punct* ,
which
measured
eight
feet
and
some
inches
*punct* .
*break*
from
that
part
*punct* ,
the
remaining
ribs
diminished
*punct* ,
till
the
tenth
and
last
only
spanned
five
feet
and
some
inches
*punct* .
*break*
in
general
thickness
*punct* ,
they
all
bore
a
seemly
correspondence
to
their
length
*punct* .
*break*
the
middle
ribs
were
the
most
arched
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
of
the
arsacides
they
are
used
for
beams
whereon
to
lay
foot-path
bridges
over
small
streams
*punct* .
*break*
in
considering
these
ribs
*punct* ,
i
could
not
but
be
struck
anew
with
the
circumstance
*punct* ,
so
variously
repeated
in
this
book
*punct* ,
that
the
skeleton
of
the
whale
is
by
no
means
the
mould
of
his
invested
form
*punct* .
*break*
the
largest
of
the
tranque
ribs
*punct* ,
one
of
the
middle
ones
*punct* ,
occupied
that
part
of
the
fish
which
*punct* ,
in
life
*punct* ,
is
greatest
in
depth
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
the
greatest
depth
of
the
invested
body
of
this
particular
whale
must
have
been
at
least
sixteen
feet
*punct* ;
whereas
*punct* ,
the
corresponding
rib
measured
but
little
more
than
eight
feet
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
for
some
way
*punct* ,
where
i
now
saw
but
a
naked
spine
*punct* ,
all
that
had
been
once
wrapped
round
with
tons
of
added
bulk
in
flesh
*punct* ,
muscle
*punct* ,
blood
*punct* ,
and
bowels
*punct* .
*break*
still
more
*punct* ,
for
the
ample
fins
*punct* ,
i
here
saw
but
a
few
disordered
joints
*punct* ;
and
in
place
of
the
weighty
and
majestic
*punct* ,
but
boneless
flukes
*punct* ,
an
utter
blank
*punct* !
*break*
how
vain
and
foolish
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
thought
i
*punct* ,
for
timid
untravelled
man
to
try
to
comprehend
aright
this
wondrous
whale
*punct* ,
by
merely
poring
over
his
dead
attenuated
skeleton
*punct* ,
stretched
in
this
peaceful
wood
*punct* .
*break*
only
in
the
heart
of
quickest
perils
*punct* ;
only
when
within
the
eddyings
of
his
angry
flukes
*punct* ;
only
on
the
profound
unbounded
sea
*punct* ,
can
the
fully
invested
whale
be
truly
and
livingly
found
out
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
spine
*punct* .
*break*
for
that
*punct* ,
the
best
way
we
can
consider
it
is
*punct* ,
with
a
crane
*punct* ,
to
pile
its
bones
high
up
on
end
*punct* .
*break*
no
speedy
enterprise
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
it's
done
*punct* ,
it
looks
much
like
pompey's
pillar
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
forty
and
odd
vertebrae
in
all
*punct* ,
which
in
the
skeleton
are
not
locked
together
*punct* .
*break*
they
mostly
lie
like
the
great
knobbed
blocks
on
a
gothic
spire
*punct* ,
forming
solid
courses
of
heavy
masonry
*punct* .
*break*
the
largest
*punct* ,
a
middle
one
*punct* ,
is
in
width
something
less
than
three
feet
*punct* ,
and
in
depth
more
than
four
*punct* .
*break*
the
smallest
*punct* ,
where
the
spine
tapers
away
into
the
tail
*punct* ,
is
only
two
inches
in
width
*punct* ,
and
looks
something
like
a
white
billiard-ball
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
told
that
there
were
still
smaller
ones
*punct* ,
but
they
had
been
lost
by
some
little
cannibal
urchins
*punct* ,
the
priest's
children
*punct* ,
who
had
stolen
them
to
play
marbles
with
*punct* .
*break*
would
you
*punct* ,
you
could
not
compress
him
*punct* .
*break*
not
to
tell
over
again
his
furlongs
from
spiracle
to
tail
*punct* ,
and
the
yards
he
measures
about
the
waist
*punct* ;
only
think
of
the
gigantic
involutions
of
his
intestines
*punct* ,
where
they
lie
in
him
like
great
cables
and
hausers
coiled
away
in
the
subterranean
orlop-deck
of
a
line-of-battle-ship
*punct* .
*break*
since
i
have
undertaken
to
manhandle
this
leviathan
*punct* ,
it
behoves
me
to
approve
myself
omnisciently
exhaustive
in
the
enterprise
*punct* ;
not
overlooking
the
minutest
seminal
germs
of
his
blood
*punct* ,
and
spinning
him
out
to
the
uttermost
coil
of
his
bowels
*punct* .
*break*
having
already
described
him
in
most
of
his
present
habitatory
and
anatomical
peculiarities
*punct* ,
it
now
remains
to
magnify
him
in
an
archaeological
*punct* ,
fossiliferous
*punct* ,
and
antediluvian
point
of
view
*punct* .
*break*
applied
to
any
other
creature
than
the
leviathan
*punct* ,
to
an
ant
or
a
flea
*punct* ,
such
portly
terms
might
justly
be
deemed
unwarrantably
grandiloquent
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
leviathan
is
the
text
*punct* ,
the
case
is
altered
*punct* .
*break*
fain
am
i
to
stagger
to
this
emprise
under
the
weightiest
words
of
the
dictionary
*punct* .
*break*
and
here
be
it
said
*punct* ,
that
whenever
it
has
been
convenient
to
consult
one
in
the
course
of
these
dissertations
*punct* ,
i
have
invariably
used
a
huge
quarto
edition
of
johnson
*punct* ,
expressly
purchased
for
that
purpose
*punct* ;
because
that
famous
lexicographer's
uncommon
personal
bulk
more
fitted
him
to
compile
a
lexicon
to
be
used
by
a
whale
author
like
me
*punct* .
*break*
one
often
hears
of
writers
that
rise
and
swell
with
their
subject
*punct* ,
though
it
may
seem
but
an
ordinary
one
*punct* .
*break*
how
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
with
me
*punct* ,
writing
of
this
leviathan
*punct* ?
*break*
unconsciously
my
chirography
expands
into
placard
capitals
*punct* .
*break*
give
me
a
condor's
quill
*punct* !
*break*
give
me
vesuvius
crater
for
an
inkstand
*punct* !
*break*
friends
*punct* ,
hold
my
arms
*punct* !
*break*
for
in
the
mere
act
of
penning
my
thoughts
of
this
leviathan
*punct* ,
they
weary
me
*punct* ,
and
make
me
faint
with
their
out-reaching
comprehensiveness
of
sweep
*punct* ,
as
if
to
include
the
whole
circle
of
the
sciences
*punct* ,
and
all
the
generations
of
whales
*punct* ,
and
men
*punct* ,
and
mastodons
*punct* ,
past
*punct* ,
present
*punct* ,
and
to
come
*punct* ,
with
all
the
revolving
panoramas
of
empire
on
earth
*punct* ,
and
throughout
the
whole
universe
*punct* ,
not
excluding
its
suburbs
*punct* .
*break*
such
*punct* ,
and
so
magnifying
*punct* ,
is
the
virtue
of
a
large
and
liberal
theme
*punct* !
*break*
we
expand
to
its
bulk
*punct* .
*break*
no
great
and
enduring
volume
can
ever
be
written
on
the
flea
*punct* ,
though
many
there
be
who
have
tried
it
*punct* .
*break*
ere
entering
upon
the
subject
of
fossil
whales
*punct* ,
i
present
my
credentials
as
a
geologist
*punct* ,
by
stating
that
in
my
miscellaneous
time
i
have
been
a
stone-mason
*punct* ,
and
also
a
great
digger
of
ditches
*punct* ,
canals
*punct* ,
and
wells
*punct* ,
wine-vaults
*punct* ,
cellars
*punct* ,
and
cisterns
of
all
sorts
*punct* .
*break*
likewise
*punct* ,
by
way
of
preliminary
*punct* ,
i
desire
to
remind
the
reader
*punct* ,
that
while
in
the
earlier
geological
strata
there
are
found
the
fossils
of
monsters
now
almost
completely
extinct
*punct* ;
the
subsequent
relics
discovered
in
what
are
called
the
tertiary
formations
seem
the
connecting
*punct* ,
or
at
any
rate
intercepted
links
*punct* ,
between
the
antichronical
creatures
*punct* ,
and
those
whose
remote
posterity
are
said
to
have
entered
the
ark
*punct* ;
all
the
fossil
whales
hitherto
discovered
belong
to
the
tertiary
period
*punct* ,
which
is
the
last
preceding
the
superficial
formations
*punct* .
*break*
and
though
none
of
them
precisely
answer
to
any
known

not

has
this
leviathan
left
his
pre-adamite
traces
in
the
stereotype
plates
of
nature
*punct* ,
and
in
limestone

bequeathed
his
ancient
bust

upon

seems
to
claim

an
almost
fossiliferous

we
find
the
unmistakable
print

*break*
in
an
apartment
of
the
great
temple
of
denderah
*punct* ,
some
fifty
years
ago
*punct* ,
there
was
discovered
upon
the

a
sculptured

painted
planisphere
*punct* ,
abounding
in
centaurs

griffins

similar
to

*break*
not

from

*punct* ,
they
have
a
temple
*punct* ,
the
rafters
and
beams
of
which
are
made
of
whale-bones
*punct* ;
for
whales
of
a
monstrous
size
are
oftentimes
cast
up
dead
upon
that
shore
*punct* .
*break*
the
common
people
imagine
*punct* ,
that
by
a
secret
power
bestowed
by
god
upon
the
temple
*punct* ,
no
whale
can
pass
it
without
immediate
death
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
*punct* ,
that
on
either
side
of
the
temple
*punct* ,
there
are
rocks
that
shoot
two
miles
into
the
sea
*punct* ,
and
wound
the
whales
when
they
light
upon

*break*
they
keep
a
whale's
rib
of
an
incredible
length
for
a
miracle
*punct* ,
which
lying
upon
the

its
convex

uppermost
*punct* ,
makes
an
arch
*punct* ,
the

of
which
cannot

*break*
this
rib
*punct* ,
says
john

*punct* ,
is
said
to
have
layn
there
a
hundred
years
before
i
saw
it

*break*
their
historians
affirm
*punct* ,
that
a
prophet
who
prophesy'd
of
mahomet
*punct* ,
came
from
this
temple
*punct* ,
and
some
do
not
stand
to
assert
*punct* ,
that
the
prophet
jonas
was
cast
forth
by
the
whale
at
the
base
of
the
temple
*punct* .
*break*
of
all
the
pre-adamite
whales
yet
exhumed
*punct* ,
by
far
the
largest
is
the
alabama
one
mentioned
in
the
last
chapter
*punct* ,
and
that
was
less
than
seventy
feet
in
length
in
the
skeleton
*punct* .
*break*
whereas
*punct* ,
we
have
already
seen
*punct* ,
that
the
tape-measure
gives
seventy-two
feet
for
the
skeleton
of
a
large
sized
modern
whale
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
have
heard
*punct* ,
on
whalemen's
authority
*punct* ,
that
sperm
whales
have
been
captured
near
a
hundred
feet
long
at
the
time
of
capture
*punct* .
*break*
but
may
it
not
be
*punct* ,
that
while
the
whales
of
the
present
hour
are
an
advance
in
magnitude
upon
those
of
all
previous
geological
periods
*punct* ;
may
it
not
be
*punct* ,
that
since
adam's
time
they
have
degenerated
*punct* ?
*break*
assuredly
*punct* ,
we
must
conclude
so
*punct* ,
if
we
are
to
credit
the
accounts
of
such
gentlemen
as
pliny
*punct* ,
and
the
ancient
naturalists
generally
*punct* .
*break*
for
pliny
tells
us
of
whales
that
embraced
acres
of

others
which
measured
eight
hundred
feet
in

*break*
and
even
in
the
days
of
banks

solander
*punct* ,
cooke's
naturalists
*punct* ,
we
find
a
danish
member

reydan-siskur

elaborate
history
of

*punct* ,
in
the
very
beginning
of

sets
down
the

one
hundred

*break*
and
this
work
was
published
so
late
as
a
*punct* .
*break*
but
will
any
whaleman
believe
these
stories
*punct* ?
*break*
the
whale
of
to-day
is
as
big
as
his
ancestors
in
pliny's
time
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
ever
i
go
where
pliny
is
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
a
whaleman
*punct* ,
more
than
he
was
*punct* ,
will
make
bold
to
tell
him
so
*punct* .
*break*
but
still
another
inquiry
remains
*punct* ;
one
often
agitated
by
the
more
recondite
nantucketers
*punct* .
*break*
whether
owing
to
the
almost
omniscient
look-outs
at
the
mast-heads
of
the
whale-ships
*punct* ,
now
penetrating
even
through
behring's
straits
*punct* ,
and
into
the
remotest
secret
drawers
and
lockers
of
the
world
*punct* ;
and
the
thousand
harpoons
and
lances
darted
along
all
continental
coasts
*punct* ;
the
moot
point
is
*punct* ,
whether
leviathan
can
long
endure
so
wide
a
chase
*punct* ,
and
so
remorseless
a
havoc
*punct* ;
whether
he
must
not
at
last
be
exterminated
from
the
waters
*punct* ,
and
the
last
whale
*punct* ,
like
the
last
man
*punct* ,
smoke
his
last
pipe
*punct* ,
and
then
himself
evaporate
in
the
final
puff
*punct* .
*break*
comparing
the
humped
herds
of
whales
with
the
humped
herds
of
buffalo
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
not
forty
years
ago
*punct* ,
overspread
by
tens
of
thousands
the
prairies
of
illinois
and
missouri
*punct* ,
and
shook
their
iron
manes
and
scowled
with
their
thunder-clotted
brows
upon
the
sites
of
populous
river-capitals
*punct* ,
where
now
the
polite
broker
sells
you
land
at
a
dollar
an
inch
*punct* ;
in
such
a
comparison
an
irresistible
argument
would
seem
furnished
*punct* ,
to
show
that
the
hunted
whale
cannot
now
escape
speedy
extinction
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
must
look
at
this
matter
in
every
light
*punct* .
*break*
though
so
short
a
period
ago
*punct* ,
not
a
good
life-time
*punct* ,
the
census
of
the
buffalo
in
illinois
exceeded
the
census
of
men
now
in
london
*punct* ,
and
though
at
the
present
day
not
one
horn
or
hoof
of
them
remains
in
all
that
region
*punct* ;
and
though
the
cause
of
this
wondrous
extermination
was
the
spear
of
man
*punct* ;
yet
the
far
different
nature
of
the
whale-hunt
peremptorily
forbids
so
inglorious
an
end
to
the
leviathan
*punct* .
*break*
forty
men
in
one
ship
hunting
the
sperm
whale
for
forty-eight
months
think
they
have
done
extremely
well
*punct* ,
and
thank
god
*punct* ,
if
at
last
they
carry
home
the
oil
of
forty
fish
*punct* .
*break*
whereas
*punct* ,
in
the
days
of
the
old
canadian
and
indian
hunters
and
trappers
of
the
west
*punct* ,
when
the
far
west
*punct* ,
in
whose
sunset
suns
still
rise
*punct* ,
was
a
wilderness
and
a
virgin
*punct* ,
the
same
number
of
moccasined
men
*punct* ,
for
the
same
number
of
months
*punct* ,
mounted
on
horse
instead
of
sailing
in
ships
*punct* ,
would
have
slain
not
forty
*punct* ,
but
forty
thousand
and
more
buffaloes
*punct* ;
a
fact
that
*punct* ,
if
need
were
*punct* ,
could
be
statistically
stated
*punct* .
*break*
because
*punct* ,
as
has
been
elsewhere
noticed
*punct* ,
those
whales
*punct* ,
influenced
by
some
views
to
safety
*punct* ,
now
swim
the
seas
in
immense
caravans
*punct* ,
so
that
to
a
large
degree
the
scattered
solitaries
*punct* ,
yokes
*punct* ,
and
pods
*punct* ,
and
schools
of
other
days
are
now
aggregated
into
vast
but
widely
separated
*punct* ,
unfrequent
armies
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
all
*punct* .
*break*
and
equally
fallacious
seems
the
conceit
*punct* ,
that
because
the
so-called
whale-bone
whales
no
longer
haunt
many
grounds
in
former
years
abounding
with
them
*punct* ,
hence
that
species
also
is
declining
*punct* .
*break*
for
they
are
only
being
driven
from
promontory
to
cape
*punct* ;
and
if
one
coast
is
no
longer
enlivened
with
their
jets
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
be
sure
*punct* ,
some
other
and
remoter
strand
has
been
very
recently
startled
by
the
unfamiliar
spectacle
*punct* .
*break*
furthermore
*punct* :
concerning
these
last
mentioned
leviathans
*punct* ,
they
have
two
firm
fortresses
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
in
all
human
probability
*punct* ,
will
for
ever
remain
impregnable
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
upon
the
invasion
of
their
valleys
*punct* ,
the
frosty
swiss
have
retreated
to
their
mountains
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
hunted
from
the
savannas
and
glades
of
the
middle
seas
*punct* ,
the
whale-bone
whales
can
at
last
resort
to
their
polar
citadels
*punct* ,
and
diving
under
the
ultimate
glassy
barriers
and
walls
there
*punct* ,
come
up
among
icy
fields
and
floes
*punct* ;
and
in
a
charmed
circle
of
everlasting
december
*punct* ,
bid
defiance
to
all
pursuit
from
man
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
perhaps
fifty
of
these
whale-bone
whales
are
harpooned
for
one
cachalot
*punct* ,
some
philosophers
of
the
forecastle
have
concluded
that
this
positive
havoc
has
already
very
seriously
diminished
their
battalions
*punct* .
*break*
but
though
for
some
time
past
a
number
of
these
whales
*punct* ,
not
less
than
13,000
have
been
annually
slain
on
the
nor
west
coast
by
the
americans
alone
*punct* ;
yet
there
are
considerations
which
render
even
this
circumstance
of
little
or
no
account
as
an
opposing
argument
in
this
matter
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
seems
no
reason
to
doubt
that
if
these
elephants
*punct* ,
which
have
now
been
hunted
for
thousands
of
years
*punct* ,
by
semiramis
*punct* ,
by
porus
*punct* ,
by
hannibal
*punct* ,
and
by
all
the
successive
monarchs
of
the
east
*punct* ,
if
they
still
survive
there
in
great
numbers
*punct* ,
much
more
may
the
great
whale
outlast
all
hunting
*punct* ,
since
he
has
a
pasture
to
expatiate
in
*punct* ,
which
is
precisely
twice
as
large
as
all
asia
*punct* ,
both
americas
*punct* ,
europe
and
africa
*punct* ,
new
holland
*punct* ,
and
all
the
isles
of
the
sea
combined
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* :
we
are
to
consider
*punct* ,
that
from
the
presumed
great
longevity
of
whales
*punct* ,
their
probably
attaining
the
age
of
a
century
and
more
*punct* ,
therefore
at
any
one
period
of
time
*punct* ,
several
distinct
adult
generations
must
be
contemporary
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
that
is
*punct* ,
we
may
soon
gain
some
idea
of
*punct* ,
by
imagining
all
the
grave-yards
*punct* ,
cemeteries
*punct* ,
and
family
vaults
of
creation
yielding
up
the
live
bodies
of
all
the
men
*punct* ,
women
*punct* ,
and
children
who
were
alive
seventy-five
years
ago
*punct* ;
and
adding
this
countless
host
to
the
present
human
population
of
the
globe
*punct* .
*break*
wherefore
*punct* ,
for
all
these
things
*punct* ,
we
account
the
whale
immortal
in
his
species
*punct* ,
however
perishable
in
his
individuality
*punct* .
*break*
he
swam
the
seas
before
the
continents
broke
water
*punct* ;
he
once
swam
over
the
site
of
the
tuileries
*punct* ,
and
windsor
castle
*punct* ,
and
the
kremlin
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
it
seemed
small
matter
for
wonder
*punct* ,
that
for
all
his
pervading
*punct* ,
mad
recklessness
*punct* ,
ahab
did
at
times
give
careful
heed
to
the
condition
of
that
dead
bone
upon
which
he
partly
stood
*punct* .
*break*
for
it
had
not
been
very
long
prior
to
the
pequod's
sailing
from
nantucket
*punct* ,
that
he
had
been
found
one
night
lying
prone
upon
the
ground
*punct* ,
and
insensible
*punct* ;
by
some
unknown
*punct* ,
and
seemingly
inexplicable
*punct* ,
unimaginable
casualty
*punct* ,
his
ivory
limb
having
been
so
violently
displaced
*punct* ,
that
it
had
stake-wise
smitten
*punct* ,
and
all
but
pierced
his
groin
*punct* ;
nor
was
it
without
extreme
difficulty
that
the
agonizing
wound
was
entirely
cured
*punct* .
*break*
nor
*punct* ,
at
the
time
*punct* ,
had
it
failed
to
enter
his
monomaniac
mind
*punct* ,
that
all
the
anguish
of
that
then
present
suffering
was
but
the
direct
issue
of
a
former
woe
*punct* ;
and
he
too
plainly
seemed
to
see
*punct* ,
that
as
the
most
poisonous
reptile
of
the
marsh
perpetuates
his
kind
as
inevitably
as
the
sweetest
songster
of
the
grove
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
equally
with
every
felicity
*punct* ,
all
miserable
events
do
naturally
beget
their
like
*punct* .
*break*
yea
*punct* ,
more
than
equally
*punct* ,
thought
ahab
*punct* ;
since
both
the
ancestry
and
posterity
of
grief
go
further
than
the
ancestry
and
posterity
of
joy
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
not
to
hint
of
this
*punct* :
that
it
is
an
inference
from
certain
canonic
teachings
*punct* ,
that
while
some
natural
enjoyments
here
shall
have
no
children
born
to
them
for
the
other
world
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
on
the
contrary
*punct* ,
shall
be
followed
by
the
joy-childlessness
of
all
hell's
despair
*punct* ;
whereas
*punct* ,
some
guilty
mortal
miseries
shall
still
fertilely
beget
to
themselves
an
eternally
progressive
progeny
of
griefs
beyond
the
grave
*punct* ;
not
at
all
to
hint
of
this
*punct* ,
there
still
seems
an
inequality
in
the
deeper
analysis
of
the
thing
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
thought
ahab
*punct* ,
while
even
the
highest
earthly
felicities
ever
have
a
certain
unsignifying
pettiness
lurking
in
them
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
at
bottom
*punct* ,
all
heart-woes
*punct* ,
a
mystic
significance
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
some
men
*punct* ,
an
archangelic
grandeur
*punct* ;
so
do
their
diligent
tracings-out
not
belie
the
obvious
deduction
*punct* .
*break*
the
ineffaceable
*punct* ,
sad
birth-mark
in
the
brow
of
man
*punct* ,
is
but
the
stamp
of
sorrow
in
the
signers
*punct* .
*break*
unwittingly
here
a
secret
has
been
divulged
*punct* ,
which
perhaps
might
more
properly
*punct* ,
in
set
way
*punct* ,
have
been
disclosed
before
*punct* .
*break*
with
many
other
particulars
concerning
ahab
*punct* ,
always
had
it
remained
a
mystery
to
some
*punct* ,
why
it
was
*punct* ,
that
for
a
certain
period
*punct* ,
both
before
and
after
the
sailing
of
the
pequod
*punct* ,
he
had
hidden
himself
away
with
such
grand-lama-like
exclusiveness
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
for
that
one
interval
*punct* ,
sought
speechless
refuge
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ,
among
the
marble
senate
of
the
dead
*punct* .
*break*
captain
peleg's
bruited
reason
for
this
thing
appeared
by
no
means
adequate
*punct* ;
though
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
as
touching
all
ahab's
deeper
part
*punct* ,
every
revelation
partook
more
of
significant
darkness
than
of
explanatory
light
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
in
the
end
*punct* ,
it
all
came
out
*punct* ;
this
one
matter
did
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* .
*break*
that
direful
mishap
was
at
the
bottom
of
his
temporary
recluseness
*punct* .
*break*
and
not
only
this
*punct* ,
but
to
that
ever-contracting
*punct* ,
dropping
circle
ashore
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
for
any
reason
*punct* ,
possessed
the
privilege
of
a
less
banned
approach
to
him
*punct* ;
to
that
timid
circle
the
above
hinted
casualty
*punct* ,
remaining
*punct* ,
as
it
did
*punct* ,
moodily
unaccounted
for
by
ahab
*punct* ,
invested
itself
with
terrors
*punct* ,
not
entirely
underived
from
the
land
of
spirits
and
of
wails
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
*punct* ,
through
their
zeal
for
him
*punct* ,
they
had
all
conspired
*punct* ,
so
far
as
in
them
lay
*punct* ,
to
muffle
up
the
knowledge
of
this
thing
from
others
*punct* ;
and
hence
it
was
*punct* ,
that
not
till
a
considerable
interval
had
elapsed
*punct* ,
did
it
transpire
upon
the
pequod's
decks
*punct* .
*break*
but
be
all
this
as
it
may
*punct* ;
let
the
unseen
*punct* ,
ambiguous
synod
in
the
air
*punct* ,
or
the
vindictive
princes
and
potentates
of
fire
*punct* ,
have
to
do
or
not
with
earthly
ahab
*punct* ,
yet
*punct* ,
in
this
present
matter
of
his
leg
*punct* ,
he
took
plain
practical
procedures;
*punct* ,
he
called
the
carpenter
*punct* .
*break*
this
done
*punct* ,
the
carpenter
received
orders
to
have
the
leg
completed
that
night
*punct* ;
and
to
provide
all
the
fittings
for
it
*punct* ,
independent
of
those
pertaining
to
the
distrusted
one
in
use
*punct* .
*break*
but
from
the
same
point
*punct* ,
take
mankind
in
mass
*punct* ,
and
for
the
most
part
*punct* ,
they
seem
a
mob
of
unnecessary
duplicates
*punct* ,
both
contemporary
and
hereditary
*punct* .
*break*
but
most
humble
though
he
was
*punct* ,
and
far
from
furnishing
an
example
of
the
high
*punct* ,
humane
abstraction
*punct* ;
the
pequod's
carpenter
was
no
duplicate
*punct* ;
hence
*punct* ,
he
now
comes
in
person
on
this
stage
*punct* .
*break*
like
all
sea-going
ship
carpenters
*punct* ,
and
more
especially
those
belonging
to
whaling
vessels
*punct* ,
he
was
*punct* ,
to
a
certain
off-handed
*punct* ,
practical
extent
*punct* ,
alike
experienced
in
numerous
trades
and
callings
collateral
to
his
own
*punct* ;
the
carpenter's
pursuit
being
the
ancient
and
outbranching
trunk
of
all
those
numerous
handicrafts
which
more
or
less
have
to
do
with
wood
as
an
auxiliary
material
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
besides
the
application
to
him
of
the
generic
remark
above
*punct* ,
this
carpenter
of
the
pequod
was
singularly
efficient
in
those
thousand
nameless
mechanical
emergencies
continually
recurring
in
a
large
ship
*punct* ,
upon
a
three
or
four
years
voyage
*punct* ,
in
uncivilized
and
far-distant
seas
*punct* .
*break*
the
one
grand
stage
where
he
enacted
all
his
various
parts
so
manifold
*punct* ,
was
his
vice-bench
*punct* ;
a
long
rude
ponderous
table
furnished
with
several
vices
*punct* ,
of
different
sizes
*punct* ,
and
both
of
iron
and
of
wood
*punct* .
*break*
at
all
times
except
when
whales
were
alongside
*punct* ,
this
bench
was
securely
lashed
athwartships
against
the
rear
of
the
try-works
*punct* .
*break*
a
belaying
pin
is
found
too
large
to
be
easily
inserted
into
its
hole
*punct* :
the
carpenter
claps
it
into
one
of
his
ever-ready
vices
*punct* ,
and
straightway
files
it
smaller
*punct* .
*break*
a
lost
land-bird
of
strange
plumage
strays
on
board
*punct* ,
and
is
made
a
captive
*punct* :
out
of
clean
shaved
rods
of
right-whale
bone
*punct* ,
and
cross-beams
of
sperm
whale
ivory
*punct* ,
the
carpenter
makes
a
pagoda-looking
cage
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
an
oarsman
sprains
his
wrist
*punct* :
the
carpenter
concocts
a
soothing
lotion
*punct* .
*break*
stubb
longed
for
vermillion
stars
to
be
painted
upon
the
blade
of
his
every
oar
*punct* ;
screwing
each
oar
in
his
big
vice
of
wood
*punct* ,
the
carpenter
symmetrically
supplies
the
constellation
*punct* .
*break*
a
sailor
takes
a
fancy
to
wear
shark-bone
ear-rings
*punct* :
the
carpenter
drills
his
ears
*punct* .
*break*
another
has
the
toothache
*punct* :
the
carpenter
out
pincers
*punct* ,
and
clapping
one
hand
upon
his
bench
bids
him
be
seated
there
*punct* ;
but
the
poor
fellow
unmanageably
winces
under
the
unconcluded
operation
*punct* ;
whirling
round
the
handle
of
his
wooden
vice
*punct* ,
the
carpenter
signs
him
to
clap
his
jaw
in
that
*punct* ,
if
he
would
have
him
draw
the
tooth
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
this
carpenter
was
prepared
at
all
points
*punct* ,
and
alike
indifferent
and
without
respect
in
all
*punct* .
*break*
teeth
he
accounted
bits
of
ivory
*punct* ;
heads
he
deemed
but
top-blocks
*punct* ;
men
themselves
he
lightly
held
for
capstans
*punct* .
*break*
but
while
now
upon
so
wide
a
field
thus
variously
accomplished
*punct* ,
and
with
such
liveliness
of
expertness
in
him
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ;
all
this
would
seem
to
argue
some
uncommon
vivacity
of
intelligence
*punct* .
*break*
but
not
precisely
so
*punct* .
*break*
yet
was
this
half-horrible
stolidity
in
him
*punct* ,
involving
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
as
it
appeared
*punct* ,
an
all-ramifying
heartlessness;
*punct* ,
yet
was
it
oddly
dashed
at
times
*punct* ,
with
an
old
*punct* ,
crutch-like
*punct* ,
antediluvian
*punct* ,
wheezing
humorousness
*punct* ,
not
unstreaked
now
and
then
with
a
certain
grizzled
wittiness
*punct* ;
such
as
might
have
served
to
pass
the
time
during
the
midnight
watch
on
the
bearded
forecastle
of
noah's
ark
*punct* .
*break*
was
it
that
this
old
carpenter
had
been
a
life-long
wanderer
*punct* ,
whose
much
rolling
*punct* ,
to
and
fro
*punct* ,
not
only
had
gathered
no
moss
*punct* ;
but
what
is
more
*punct* ,
had
rubbed
off
whatever
small
outward
clingings
might
have
originally
pertained
to
him
*punct* ?
*break*
he
was
a
stript
abstract
*punct* ;
an
unfractioned
integral
*punct* ;
uncompromised
as
a
new-born
babe
*punct* ;
living
without
premeditated
reference
to
this
world
or
the
next
*punct* .
*break*
you
might
almost
say
*punct* ,
that
this
strange
uncompromisedness
in
him
involved
a
sort
of
unintelligence
*punct* ;
for
in
his
numerous
trades
*punct* ,
he
did
not
seem
to
work
so
much
by
reason
or
by
instinct
*punct* ,
or
simply
because
he
had
been
tutored
to
it
*punct* ,
or
by
any
intermixture
of
all
these
*punct* ,
even
or
uneven
*punct* ;
but
merely
by
a
kind
of
deaf
and
dumb
*punct* ,
spontaneous
literal
process
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
pure
manipulator
*punct* ;
his
brain
*punct* ,
if
he
had
ever
had
one
*punct* ,
must
have
early
oozed
along
into
the
muscles
of
his
fingers
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
like
one
of
those
unreasoning
but
still
highly
useful
*punct* ,
multum
in
parvo
*punct* ,
sheffield
contrivances
*punct* ,
assuming
the
exterior
*punct* ,
though
a
little
swelled
*punct* ,
of
a
common
pocket
knife
*punct* ;
but
containing
*punct* ,
not
only
blades
of
various
sizes
*punct* ,
but
also
screw-drivers
*punct* ,
cork-screws
*punct* ,
tweezers
*punct* ,
awls
*punct* ,
pens
*punct* ,
rulers
*punct* ,
nail-filers
*punct* ,
counter-sinkers
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
if
his
superiors
wanted
to
use
the
carpenter
for
a
screw-driver
*punct* ,
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
open
that
part
of
him
*punct* ,
and
the
screw
was
fast
*punct* :
or
if
for
tweezers
*punct* ,
take
him
up
by
the
legs
*punct* ,
and
there
they
were
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
as
previously
hinted
*punct* ,
this
omnitooled
*punct* ,
open-and-shut
carpenter
*punct* ,
was
*punct* ,
after
all
*punct* ,
no
mere
machine
of
an
automaton
*punct* .
*break*
if
he
did
not
have
a
common
soul
in
him
*punct* ,
he
had
a
subtle
something
that
somehow
anomalously
did
its
duty
*punct* .
*break*
what
that
was
*punct* ,
whether
essence
of
quicksilver
*punct* ,
or
a
few
drops
of
hartshorn
*punct* ,
there
is
no
telling
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
it
was
*punct* ;
and
there
it
had
abided
for
now
some
sixty
years
or
more
*punct* .
*break*
slabs
of
ivory
*punct* ,
leather
straps
*punct* ,
pads
*punct* ,
screws
*punct* ,
and
various
tools
of
all
sorts
lying
about
the
bench
*punct* .
*break*
forward
*punct* ,
the
red
flame
of
the
forge
is
seen
*punct* ,
where
the
blacksmith
is
at
work.
*punct* ,
drat
the
file
*punct* ,
and
drat
the
bone
*punct* !
*break*
that
is
hard
which
should
be
soft
*punct* ,
and
that
soft
which
should
be
hard
*punct* .
*break*
so
we
go
*punct* ,
who
file
old
jaws
and
shinbones
*punct* .
*break*
let's
try
another
*punct* .
*break*
halloa
*punct* ,
this
bone
dust
is

sneezes
*punct* ,
why
it's
*punct* ,
sneezes
*punct* ,
yes
it's
*punct* ,
sneezes
*punct* ,
bless
my
soul
*punct* ,
it
won't
let
me
speak
*punct* !
*break*
this
is
what
an
old
fellow
gets
now
for
working
in
dead
lumber
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
come
*punct* ,
you
old
smut
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ,
bear
a
hand
*punct* ,
and
let's
have
that
ferule
and
buckle-screw
*punct* ;
i'll
be
ready
for
them
presently
*punct* .
*break*
lucky
now
*punct* ,
sneezes
*punct* ,
there's
no
knee-joint
to
make
*punct* ;
that
might
puzzle
a
little
*punct* ;
but
a
mere
shinbone
*punct* ,
why
it's
easy
as
making
hop-poles
*punct* ;
only
i
should
like
to
put
a
good
finish
on
*punct* .
*break*
time
*punct* ,
time
*punct* ;
if
i
but
only
had
the
time
*punct* ,
i
could
turn
him
out
as
neat
a
leg
now
as
ever
*punct* ,
sneezes
*punct* ,
scraped
to
a
lady
in
a
parlor
*punct* .
*break*
those
buckskin
legs
and
calves
of
legs
i've
seen
in
shop
windows
wouldn't
compare
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ;
before
i
saw
it
off
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
i
must
call
his
old
mogulship
*punct* ,
and
see
whether
the
length
will
be
all
right
*punct* ;
too
short
*punct* ,
if
anything
*punct* ,
i
guess
*punct* .
*break*
that's
the
heel
*punct* ;
we
are
in
luck
*punct* ;
here
he
comes
*punct* ,
or
it's
somebody
else
*punct* ,
that's
certain
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
manmaker
*punct* !
*break*
just
in
time
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
captain
pleases
*punct* ,
i
will
now
mark
the
length
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
measure
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
measured
for
a
leg
*punct* !
*break*
well
*punct* ,
it's
not
the
first
time
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ;
keep
thy
finger
on
it
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
a
cogent
vice
thou
hast
here
*punct* ,
carpenter
*punct* ;
let
me
feel
its
grip
once
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ;
it
does
pinch
some
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
it
will
break
bones
*punct* ,
beware
*punct* ,
beware
*punct* !
*break*
no
fear
*punct* ;
i
like
a
good
grip
*punct* ;
i
like
to
feel
something
in
this
slippery
world
that
can
hold
*punct* ,
man
*punct* .
*break*
what's
prometheus
about
there?
*punct* ,
the
blacksmith
*punct* ,
i
mean
*punct* ,
what's
he
about
*punct* ?
*break*
he
must
be
forging
the
buckle-screw
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
now
*punct* .
*break*
it's
a
partnership
*punct* ;
he
supplies
the
muscle
part
*punct* .
*break*
he
makes
a
fierce
red
flame
there
*punct* !
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
he
must
have
the
white
heat
for
this
kind
of
fine
work
*punct* .
*break*
so
he
must
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
deem
it
now
a
most
meaning
thing
*punct* ,
that
that
old
greek
*punct* ,
prometheus
*punct* ,
who
made
men
*punct* ,
they
say
*punct* ,
should
have
been
a
blacksmith
*punct* ,
and
animated
them
with
fire
*punct* ;
for
what's
made
in
fire
must
properly
belong
to
fire
*punct* ;
and
so
hell's
probable
*punct* .
*break*
how
the
soot
flies
*punct* !
*break*
this

be
the
remainder

*punct* ,
when
he's
through
with
that
buckle
*punct* ,
tell
him
to
forge
a
pair
of
steel
shoulder-blades
*punct* ;
there's
a
pedlar
aboard
with
a
crushing
pack
*punct* .
*break*
hold
*punct* ;
while
prometheus
is
about
it
*punct* ,
i'll
order
a
complete
man
after
a
desirable
pattern
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
but
put
a
sky-light
on
top
of
his
head
to
illuminate
inwards
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
take
the
order
*punct* ,
and
away
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
what's
he
speaking
about
*punct* ,
and
who's
he
speaking
to
*punct* ,
i
should
like
to
know
*punct* ?
*break*
shall
i
keep
standing
here
*punct* ?
*break*
tis
but
indifferent
architecture
to
make
a
blind
dome
*punct* ;
here's
one
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ;
i
must
have
a
lantern
*punct* .
*break*
ho
*punct* ,
ho
*punct* !
*break*
that's
it
*punct* ,
hey
*punct* ?
*break*
here
are
two
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
one
will
serve
my
turn
*punct* .
*break*
what
art
thou
thrusting
that
thief-catcher
into
my
face
for
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ?
*break*
thrusted
light
is
worse
than
presented
pistols
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
that
you
spoke
to
carpenter
*punct* .
*break*
why
that's
*punct* ,
but
no;
*punct* ,
a
very
tidy
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
i
may
say
*punct* ,
an
extremely
gentlemanlike
sort
of
business
thou
art
in
here
*punct* ,
carpenter;
*punct* ,
or
would'st
thou
rather
work
in
clay
*punct* ?
*break*
sir?
*punct* ,
clay
*punct* ?
*break*
clay
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
that's
mud
*punct* ;
we
leave
clay
to
ditchers
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
the
fellow's
impious
*punct* !
*break*
what
art
thou
sneezing
about
*punct* ?
*break*
bone
is
rather
dusty
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
take
the
hint
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ;
and
when
thou
art
dead
*punct* ,
never
bury
thyself
under
living
people's
noses
*punct* .
*break*
sir?
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
ah!
*punct* ,
i
guess
so
*punct* ;
so;
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
oh
dear
*punct* !
*break*
look
ye
*punct* ,
carpenter
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
thou
callest
thyself
a
right
good
workmanlike
workman
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* !
*break*
well
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
will
it
speak
thoroughly
well
for
thy
work
*punct* ,
if
*punct* ,
when
i
come
to
mount
this
leg
thou
makest
*punct* ,
i
shall
nevertheless
feel
another
leg
in
the
same
identical
place
with
it
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
carpenter
*punct* ,
my
old
lost
leg
*punct* ;
the
flesh
and
blood
one
*punct* ,
i
mean
*punct* .
*break*
canst
thou
not
drive
that
old
adam
away
*punct* ?
*break*
truly
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
i
begin
to
understand
somewhat
now
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
have
heard
something
curious
on
that
score
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
how
that
a
dismasted
man
never
entirely
loses
the
feeling
of
his
old
spar
*punct* ,
but
it
will
be
still
pricking
him
at
times
*punct* .
*break*
may
i
humbly
ask
if
it
be
really
so
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
it
is
*punct* ,
man
*punct* .
*break*
where
thou
feelest
tingling
life
*punct* ;
there
*punct* ,
exactly
there
*punct* ,
there
to
a
hair
*punct* ,
do
i
*punct* .
*break*
is't
a
riddle
*punct* ?
*break*
i
should
humbly
call
it
a
poser
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
hist
*punct* ,
then
*punct* .
*break*
how
dost
thou
know
that
some
entire
*punct* ,
living
*punct* ,
thinking
thing
may
not
be
invisibly
and
uninterpenetratingly
standing
precisely
where
thou
now
standest
*punct* ;
aye
*punct* ,
and
standing
there
in
thy
spite
*punct* ?
*break*
in
thy
most
solitary
hours
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
dost
thou
not
fear
eavesdroppers
*punct* ?
*break*
hold
*punct* ,
don't
speak
*punct* !
*break*
and
if
i
still
feel
the
smart
of
my
crushed
leg
*punct* ,
though
it
be
now
so
long
dissolved
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
why
mayest
not
thou
*punct* ,
carpenter
*punct* ,
feel
the
fiery
pains
of
hell
for
ever
*punct* ,
and
without
a
body
*punct* ?
*break*
truly
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
if
it
comes
to
that
*punct* ,
i
must
calculate
over
again
*punct* ;
i
think
i
didn't
carry
a
small
figure
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
look
ye
*punct* ,
pudding-heads
should
never
grant
premises.
*punct* ,
how
long
before
this
leg
is
done
*punct* ?
*break*
perhaps
an
hour
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
life
*punct* !
*break*
here
i
am
*punct* ,
proud
as
greek
god
*punct* ,
and
yet
standing
debtor
to
this
blockhead
for
a
bone
to
stand
on
*punct* !
*break*
cursed
be
that
mortal
inter-indebtedness
which
will
not
do
away
with
ledgers
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
be
free
as
air
*punct* ;
and
i'm
down
in
the
whole
world's
books
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
get
a
crucible
*punct* ,
and
into
it
*punct* ,
and
dissolve
myself
down
to
one
small
*punct* ,
compendious
vertebra
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* !
*break*
stubb
knows
him
best
of
all
*punct* ,
and
stubb
always
says
he's
queer
*punct* ;
says
nothing
but
that
one
sufficient
little
word
queer
*punct* ;
he's
queer
*punct* ,
says
stubb
*punct* ;
he's
queer
*punct* ,
queer
*punct* ,
queer
*punct* ;
and
keeps
dinning
it
into
mr.
starbuck
all
the
time
*punct* ,
queer
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
queer
*punct* ,
queer
*punct* ,
very
queer
*punct* .
*break*
and
here's
his
leg
*punct* !
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
now
that
i
think
of
it
*punct* ,
here's
his
bedfellow
*punct* !
*break*
has
a
stick
of
whale's
jaw-bone
for
a
wife
*punct* !
*break*
and
this
is
his
leg
*punct* ;
he'll
stand
on
this
*punct* .
*break*
what
was
that
now
about
one
leg
standing
in
three
places
*punct* ,
and
all
three
places
standing
in
one
hell
*punct* ,
how
was
that
*punct* ?
*break*
i
don't
wonder
he
looked
so
scornful
at
me
*punct* !
*break*
then
*punct* ,
a
short
*punct* ,
little
old
body
like
me
*punct* ,
should
never
undertake
to
wade
out
into
deep
waters
with
tall
*punct* ,
heron-built
captains
*punct* ;
the
water
chucks
you
under
the
chin
pretty
quick
*punct* ,
and
there's
a
great
cry
for
life-boats
*punct* .
*break*
and
here's
the
heron's
leg
*punct* !
*break*
long
and
slim
*punct* ,
sure
enough
*punct* !
*break*
now
*punct* ,
for
most
folks
one
pair
of
legs
lasts
a
lifetime
*punct* ,
and
that
must
be
because
they
use
them
mercifully
*punct* ,
as
a
tender-hearted
old
lady
uses
her
roly-poly
old
coach-horses
*punct* .
*break*
but
ahab
*punct* ;
oh
he's
a
hard
driver
*punct* .
*break*
look
*punct* ,
driven
one
leg
to
death
*punct* ,
and
spavined
the
other
for
life
*punct* ,
and
now
wears
out
bone
legs
by
the
cord
*punct* .
*break*
halloa
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ,
you
smut
*punct* !
*break*
bear
a
hand
there
with
those
screws
*punct* ,
and
let's
finish
it
before
the
resurrection
fellow
comes
a-calling
with
his
horn
for
all
legs
*punct* ,
true
or
false
*punct* ,
as
brewery-men
go
round
collecting
old
beer
barrels
*punct* ,
to
fill
em
up
again
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
leg
this
is
*punct* !
*break*
it
looks
like
a
real
live
leg
*punct* ,
filed
down
to
nothing
but
the
core
*punct* ;
he'll
be
standing
on
this
to-morrow
*punct* ;
he'll
be
taking
altitudes
on
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
almost
forgot
the
little
oval
slate
*punct* ,
smoothed
ivory
*punct* ,
where
he
figures
up
the
latitude
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ;
chisel
*punct* ,
file
*punct* ,
and
sand-paper
*punct* ,
now
*punct* !
*break*
no
inconsiderable
oil
came
up
with
the
water
*punct* ;
the
casks
below
must
have
sprung
a
bad
leak
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
starbuck
found
ahab
with
a
general
chart
of
the
oriental
archipelagoes
spread
before
him
*punct* ;
and
another
separate
one
representing
the
long
eastern
coasts
of
the
japanese
islands
*punct* ,
niphon
*punct* ,
matsmai
*punct* ,
and
sikoke
*punct* .
*break*
with
his
snow-white
new
ivory
leg
braced
against
the
screwed
leg
of
his
table
*punct* ,
and
with
a
long
pruning-hook
of
a
jack-knife
in
his
hand
*punct* ,
the
wondrous
old
man
*punct* ,
with
his
back
to
the
gangway
door
*punct* ,
was
wrinkling
his
brow
*punct* ,
and
tracing
his
old
courses
again
*punct* .
*break*
hearing
the
footstep
at
the
door
*punct* ,
but
not
turning
round
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
captain
ahab
mistakes
*punct* ;
it
is
i
*punct* .
*break*
the
oil
in
the
hold
is
leaking
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
up
burtons
and
break
out
*punct* .
*break*
up
burtons
and
break
out
*punct* ?
*break*
now
that
we
are
nearing
japan
*punct* ;
heave-to
here
for
a
week
to
tinker
a
parcel
of
old
hoops
*punct* ?
*break*
either
do
that
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
or
waste
in
one
day
more
oil
than
we
may
make
good
in
a
year
*punct* .
*break*
what
we
come
twenty
thousand
miles
to
get
is
worth
saving
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
is
*punct* ,
so
it
is
*punct* ;
if
we
get
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
speaking
of
the
oil
in
the
hold
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
was
not
speaking
or
thinking
of
that
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
let
it
leak
*punct* !
*break*
i'm
all
aleak
myself
*punct* .
*break*
leaks
in
leaks
*punct* !
*break*
not
only
full
of
leaky
casks
*punct* ,
but
those
leaky
casks
are
in
a
leaky
ship
*punct* ;
and
that's
a
far
worse
plight
than
the
pequod's
*punct* ,
man
*punct* .
*break*
yet
i
don't
stop
to
plug
my
leak
*punct* ;
for
who
can
find
it
in
the
deep-loaded
hull
*punct* ;
or
how
hope
to
plug
it
*punct* ,
even
if
found
*punct* ,
in
this
life's
howling
gale
*punct* ?
*break*
i'll
not
have
the
burtons
hoisted
*punct* .
*break*
what
will
the
owners
say
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
let
the
owners
stand
on
nantucket
beach
and
outyell
the
typhoons
*punct* .
*break*
what
cares
ahab
*punct* ?
*break*
owners
*punct* ,
owners
*punct* ?
*break*
thou
art
always
prating
to
me
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* ,
about
those
miserly
owners
*punct* ,
as
if
the
owners
were
my
conscience
*punct* .
*break*
but
look
ye
*punct* ,
the
only
real
owner
of
anything
is
its
commander
*punct* ;
and
hark
ye
*punct* ,
my
conscience
is
in
this
ship's
keel.
*punct* ,
on
deck
*punct* !
*break*
and
in
a
happier
*punct* ,
captain
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
dost
thou
then
so
much
as
dare
to
critically
think
of
me?
*punct* ,
on
deck
*punct* !
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
not
yet
*punct* ;
i
do
entreat
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
do
dare
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
to
be
forbearing
*punct* !
*break*
shall
we
not
understand
each
other
better
than
hitherto
*punct* ,
captain
ahab
*punct* ?
*break*
ahab
seized
a
loaded
musket
from
the
rack
*punct* ,
forming
part
of
most
south-sea-men's
cabin
furniture
*punct* ,
and
pointing
it
towards
starbuck
*punct* ,
exclaimed
*punct* :
there
is
one
god
that
is
lord
over
the
earth
*punct* ,
and
one
captain
that
is
lord
over
the
pequod.
*punct* ,
on
deck
*punct* !
*break*
for
an
instant
in
the
flashing
eyes
of
the
mate
*punct* ,
and
his
fiery
cheeks
*punct* ,
you
would
have
almost
thought
that
he
had
really
received
the
blaze
of
the
levelled
tube
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
mastering
his
emotion
*punct* ,
he
half
calmly
rose
*punct* ,
and
as
he
quitted
the
cabin
*punct* ,
paused
for
an
instant
and
said
*punct* :
thou
hast
outraged
*punct* ,
not
insulted
me
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
but
for
that
i
ask
thee
not
to
beware
of
starbuck
*punct* ;
thou
wouldst
but
laugh
*punct* ;
but
let
ahab
beware
of
ahab
*punct* ;
beware
of
thyself
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* .
*break*
he
waxes
brave
*punct* ,
but
nevertheless
obeys
*punct* ;
most
careful
bravery
that
*punct* !
*break*
murmured
ahab
*punct* ,
as
starbuck
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
what's
that
he
said
*punct* ,
ahab
beware
of
ahab
*punct* ,
there's
something
there
*punct* !
*break*
then
unconsciously
using
the
musket
for
a
staff
*punct* ,
with
an
iron
brow
he
paced
to
and
fro
in
the
little
cabin
*punct* ;
but
presently
the
thick
plaits
of
his
forehead
relaxed
*punct* ,
and
returning
the
gun
to
the
rack
*punct* ,
he
went
to
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
thou
art
but
too
good
a
fellow
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* ,
he
said
lowly
to
the
mate
*punct* ;
then
raising
his
voice
to
the
crew
*punct* :
furl
the
t'gallant-sails
and
close-reef
the
top-sails
*punct* ,
fore
and
aft
*punct* ;
back
the
main-yard
*punct* ;
up
burtons
*punct* ,
and
break
out
in
the
main-hold
*punct* .
*break*
it
were
perhaps
vain
to
surmise
exactly
why
it
was
*punct* ,
that
as
respecting
starbuck
*punct* ,
ahab
thus
acted
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
it
being
calm
weather
*punct* ,
they
broke
out
deeper
and
deeper
*punct* ,
disturbing
the
slumbers
of
the
huge
ground-tier
butts
*punct* ;
and
from
that
black
midnight
sending
those
gigantic
moles
into
the
daylight
above
*punct* .
*break*
so
deep
did
they
go
*punct* ;
and
so
ancient
*punct* ,
and
corroded
*punct* ,
and
weedy
the
aspect
of
the
lowermost
puncheons
*punct* ,
that
you
almost
looked
next
for
some
mouldy
corner-stone
cask
containing
coins
of
captain
noah
*punct* ,
with
copies
of
the
posted
placards
*punct* ,
vainly
warning
the
infatuated
old
world
from
the
flood
*punct* .
*break*
tierce
after
tierce
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
of
water
*punct* ,
and
bread
*punct* ,
and
beef
*punct* ,
and
shooks
of
staves
*punct* ,
and
iron
bundles
of
hoops
*punct* ,
were
hoisted
out
*punct* ,
till
at
last
the
piled
decks
were
hard
to
get
about
*punct* ;
and
the
hollow
hull
echoed
under
foot
*punct* ,
as
if
you
were
treading
over
empty
catacombs
*punct* ,
and
reeled
and
rolled
in
the
sea
like
an
air-freighted
demijohn
*punct* .
*break*
top-heavy
was
the
ship
as
a
dinnerless
student
with
all
aristotle
in
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
well
was
it
that
the
typhoons
did
not
visit
them
then
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
at
this
time
it
was
that
my
poor
pagan
companion
*punct* ,
and
fast
bosom-friend
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
was
seized
with
a
fever
*punct* ,
which
brought
him
nigh
to
his
endless
end
*punct* .
*break*
be
it
said
*punct* ,
that
in
this
vocation
of
whaling
*punct* ,
sinecures
are
unknown
*punct* ;
dignity
and
danger
go
hand
in
hand
*punct* ;
till
you
get
to
be
captain
*punct* ,
the
higher
you
rise
the
harder
you
toil
*punct* .
*break*
to
be
short
*punct* ,
among
whalemen
*punct* ,
the
harpooneers
are
the
holders
*punct* ,
so
called
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
ship
was
about
half
disembowelled
*punct* ,
you
should
have
stooped
over
the
hatchway
*punct* ,
and
peered
down
upon
him
there
*punct* ;
where
*punct* ,
stripped
to
his
woollen
drawers
*punct* ,
the
tattooed
savage
was
crawling
about
amid
that
dampness
and
slime
*punct* ,
like
a
green
spotted
lizard
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
*punct* .
*break*
and
a
well
*punct* ,
or
an
ice-house
*punct* ,
it
somehow
proved
to
him
*punct* ,
poor
pagan
*punct* ;
where
*punct* ,
strange
to
say
*punct* ,
for
all
the
heat
of
his
sweatings
*punct* ,
he
caught
a
terrible
chill
which
lapsed
into
a
fever
*punct* ;
and
at
last
*punct* ,
after
some
days
suffering
*punct* ,
laid
him
in
his
hammock
*punct* ,
close
to
the
very
sill
of
the
door
of
death
*punct* .
*break*
how
he
wasted
and
wasted
away
in
those
few
long-lingering
days
*punct* ,
till
there
seemed
but
little
left
of
him
but
his
frame
and
tattooing
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
all
else
in
him
thinned
*punct* ,
and
his
cheek-bones
grew
sharper
*punct* ,
his
eyes
*punct* ,
nevertheless
*punct* ,
seemed
growing
fuller
and
fuller
*punct* ;
they
became
of
a
strange
softness
of
lustre
*punct* ;
and
mildly
but
deeply
looked
out
at
you
there
from
his
sickness
*punct* ,
a
wondrous
testimony
to
that
immortal
health
in
him
which
could
not
die
*punct* ,
or
be
weakened
*punct* .
*break*
and
like
circles
on
the
water
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
as
they
grow
fainter
*punct* ,
expand
*punct* ;
so
his
eyes
seemed
rounding
and
rounding
*punct* ,
like
the
rings
of
eternity
*punct* .
*break*
an
awe
that
cannot
be
named
would
steal
over
you
as
you
sat
by
the
side
of
this
waning
savage
*punct* ,
and
saw
as
strange
things
in
his
face
*punct* ,
as
any
beheld
who
were
bystanders
when
zoroaster
died
*punct* .
*break*
for
whatever
is
truly
wondrous
and
fearful
in
man
*punct* ,
never
yet
was
put
into
words
or
books
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
drawing
near
of
death
*punct* ,
which
alike
levels
all
*punct* ,
alike
impresses
all
with
a
last
revelation
*punct* ,
which
only
an
author
from
the
dead
could
adequately
tell
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
*punct* ,
let
us
say
it
again
*punct* ,
no
dying
chaldee
or
greek
had
higher
and
holier
thoughts
than
those
*punct* ,
whose
mysterious
shades
you
saw
creeping
over
the
face
of
poor
queequeg
*punct* ,
as
he
quietly
lay
in
his
swaying
hammock
*punct* ,
and
the
rolling
sea
seemed
gently
rocking
him
to
his
final
rest
*punct* ,
and
the
ocean's
invisible
flood-tide
lifted
him
higher
and
higher
towards
his
destined
heaven
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
man
of
the
crew
but
gave
him
up
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
as
for
queequeg
himself
*punct* ,
what
he
thought
of
his
case
was
forcibly
shown
by
a
curious
favor
he
asked
*punct* .
*break*
he
added
*punct* ,
that
he
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
being
buried
in
his
hammock
*punct* ,
according
to
the
usual
sea-custom
*punct* ,
tossed
like
something
vile
to
the
death-devouring
sharks
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* :
he
desired
a
canoe
like
those
of
nantucket
*punct* ,
all
the
more
congenial
to
him
*punct* ,
being
a
whaleman
*punct* ,
that
like
a
whale-boat
these
coffin-canoes
were
without
a
keel
*punct* ;
though
that
involved
but
uncertain
steering
*punct* ,
and
much
lee-way
adown
the
dim
ages
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
when
this
strange
circumstance
was
made
known
aft
*punct* ,
the
carpenter
was
at
once
commanded
to
do
queequeg's
bidding
*punct* ,
whatever
it
might
include
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
some
heathenish
*punct* ,
coffin-colored
old
lumber
aboard
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
upon
a
long
previous
voyage
*punct* ,
had
been
cut
from
the
aboriginal
groves
of
the
lackaday
islands
*punct* ,
and
from
these
dark
planks
the
coffin
was
recommended
to
be
made
*punct* .
*break*
no
sooner
was
the
carpenter
apprised
of
the
order
*punct* ,
than
taking
his
rule
*punct* ,
he
forthwith
with
all
the
indifferent
promptitude
of
his
character
*punct* ,
proceeded
into
the
forecastle
and
took
queequeg's
measure
with
great
accuracy
*punct* ,
regularly
chalking
queequeg's
person
as
he
shifted
the
rule
*punct* .
*break*
he'll
have
to
die
now
*punct* ,
ejaculated
the
long
island
sailor
*punct* .
*break*
going
to
his
vice-bench
*punct* ,
the
carpenter
for
convenience
sake
and
general
reference
*punct* ,
now
transferringly
measured
on
it
the
exact
length
the
coffin
was
to
be
*punct* ,
and
then
made
the
transfer
permanent
by
cutting
two
notches
at
its
extremities
*punct* .
*break*
overhearing
the
indignant
but
half-humorous
cries
with
which
the
people
on
deck
began
to
drive
the
coffin
away
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
to
every
one's
consternation
*punct* ,
commanded
that
the
thing
should
be
instantly
brought
to
him
*punct* ,
nor
was
there
any
denying
him
*punct* ;
seeing
that
*punct* ,
of
all
mortals
*punct* ,
some
dying
men
are
the
most
tyrannical
*punct* ;
and
certainly
*punct* ,
since
they
will
shortly
trouble
us
so
little
for
evermore
*punct* ,
the
poor
fellows
ought
to
be
indulged
*punct* .
*break*
leaning
over
in
his
hammock
*punct* ,
queequeg
long
regarded
the
coffin
with
an
attentive
eye
*punct* .
*break*
he
then
called
for
his
harpoon
*punct* ,
had
the
wooden
stock
drawn
from
it
*punct* ,
and
then
had
the
iron
part
placed
in
the
coffin
along
with
one
of
the
paddles
of
his
boat
*punct* .
*break*
all
by
his
own
request
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
biscuits
were
then
ranged
round
the
sides
within
*punct* :
a
flask
of
fresh
water
was
placed
at
the
head
*punct* ,
and
a
small
bag
of
woody
earth
scraped
up
in
the
hold
at
the
foot
*punct* ;
and
a
piece
of
sail-cloth
being
rolled
up
for
a
pillow
*punct* ,
queequeg
now
entreated
to
be
lifted
into
his
final
bed
*punct* ,
that
he
might
make
trial
of
its
comforts
*punct* ,
if
any
it
had
*punct* .
*break*
he
lay
without
moving
a
few
minutes
*punct* ,
then
told
one
to
go
to
his
bag
and
bring
out
his
little
god
*punct* ,
yojo
*punct* .
*break*
then
crossing
his
arms
on
his
breast
with
yojo
between
*punct* ,
he
called
for
the
coffin
lid
*punct* ,
hatch
he
called
it
*punct* ,
to
be
placed
over
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
head
part
turned
over
with
a
leather
hinge
*punct* ,
and
there
lay
queequeg
in
his
coffin
with
little
but
his
composed
countenance
in
view
*punct* .
*break*
rarmai
*punct* ,
it
will
do
*punct* ;
it
is
easy
*punct* ,
he
murmured
at
last
*punct* ,
and
signed
to
be
replaced
in
his
hammock
*punct* .
*break*
but
ere
this
was
done
*punct* ,
pip
*punct* ,
who
had
been
slily
hovering
near
by
all
this
while
*punct* ,
drew
nigh
to
him
where
he
lay
*punct* ,
and
with
soft
sobbings
*punct* ,
took
him
by
the
hand
*punct* ;
in
the
other
*punct* ,
holding
his
tambourine
*punct* .
*break*
will
ye
never
have
done
with
all
this
weary
roving
*punct* ?
*break*
where
go
ye
now
*punct* ?
*break*
but
if
the
currents
carry
ye
to
those
sweet
antilles
where
the
beaches
are
only
beat
with
water-lilies
*punct* ,
will
ye
do
one
little
errand
for
me
*punct* ?
*break*
seek
out
one
pip
*punct* ,
who's
now
been
missing
long
*punct* :
i
think
he's
in
those
far
antilles
*punct* .
*break*
if
ye
find
him
*punct* ,
then
comfort
him
*punct* ;
for
he
must
be
very
sad
*punct* ;
for
look
*punct* !
*break*
rig-a-dig
*punct* ,
dig
*punct* ,
dig
*punct* !
*break*
now
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
die
*punct* ;
and
i'll
beat
ye
your
dying
march
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
heard
*punct* ,
murmured
starbuck
*punct* ,
gazing
down
the
scuttle
*punct* ,
that
in
violent
fevers
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
all
ignorance
*punct* ,
have
talked
in
ancient
tongues
*punct* ;
and
that
when
the
mystery
is
probed
*punct* ,
it
turns
out
always
that
in
their
wholly
forgotten
childhood
those
ancient
tongues
had
been
really
spoken
in
their
hearing
by
some
lofty
scholars
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
to
my
fond
faith
*punct* ,
poor
pip
*punct* ,
in
this
strange
sweetness
of
his
lunacy
*punct* ,
brings
heavenly
vouchers
of
all
our
heavenly
homes
*punct* .
*break*
where
learned
he
that
*punct* ,
but
there?
*punct* ,
hark
*punct* !
*break*
he
speaks
again
*punct* :
but
more
wildly
now
*punct* .
*break*
form
two
and
two
*punct* !
*break*
let's
make
a
general
of
him
*punct* !
*break*
ho
*punct* ,
where's
his
harpoon
*punct* ?
*break*
lay
it
across
here.
*punct* ,
rig-a-dig
*punct* ,
dig
*punct* ,
dig
*punct* !
*break*
oh
for
a
game
cock
now
to
sit
upon
his
head
and
crow
*punct* !
*break*
queequeg
dies
game!
*punct* ,
mind
ye
that
*punct* ;
queequeg
dies
game!
*punct* ,
take
ye
good
heed
of
that
*punct* ;
queequeg
dies
game
*punct* !
*break*
i
say
*punct* ;
game
*punct* ,
game
*punct* ,
game
*punct* !
*break*
but
base
little
pip
*punct* ,
he
died
a
coward
*punct* ;
died
all
a'shiver;
*punct* ,
out
upon
pip
*punct* !
*break*
hark
ye
*punct* ;
if
ye
find
pip
*punct* ,
tell
all
the
antilles
he's
a
runaway
*punct* ;
a
coward
*punct* ,
a
coward
*punct* ,
a
coward
*punct* !
*break*
tell
them
he
jumped
from
a
whale-boat
*punct* !
*break*
i'd
never
beat
my
tambourine
over
base
pip
*punct* ,
and
hail
him
general
*punct* ,
if
he
were
once
more
dying
here
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* !
*break*
shame
upon
all
cowards
*punct* ,
shame
upon
them
*punct* !
*break*
let
em
go
drown
like
pip
*punct* ,
that
jumped
from
a
whale-boat
*punct* .
*break*
during
all
this
*punct* ,
queequeg
lay
with
closed
eyes
*punct* ,
as
if
in
a
dream
*punct* .
*break*
pip
was
led
away
*punct* ,
and
the
sick
man
was
replaced
in
his
hammock
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
that
he
had
apparently
made
every
preparation
for
death
*punct* ;
now
that
his
coffin
was
proved
a
good
fit
*punct* ,
queequeg
suddenly
rallied
*punct* ;
soon
there
seemed
no
need
of
the
carpenter's
box
*punct* :
and
thereupon
*punct* ,
when
some
expressed
their
delighted
surprise
*punct* ,
he
*punct* ,
in
substance
*punct* ,
said
*punct* ,
that
the
cause
of
his
sudden
convalescence
was
this;
*punct* ,
at
a
critical
moment
*punct* ,
he
had
just
recalled
a
little
duty
ashore
*punct* ,
which
he
was
leaving
undone
*punct* ;
and
therefore
had
changed
his
mind
about
dying
*punct* :
he
could
not
die
yet
*punct* ,
he
averred
*punct* .
*break*
they
asked
him
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
whether
to
live
or
die
was
a
matter
of
his
own
sovereign
will
and
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
he
answered
*punct* ,
certainly
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
there
is
this
noteworthy
difference
between
savage
and
civilized
*punct* ;
that
while
a
sick
*punct* ,
civilized
man
may
be
six
months
convalescing
*punct* ,
generally
speaking
*punct* ,
a
sick
savage
is
almost
half-well
again
in
a
day
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
in
good
time
my
queequeg
gained
strength
*punct* ;
and
at
length
after
sitting
on
the
windlass
for
a
few
indolent
days
*punct* ,
but
eating
with
a
vigorous
appetite
*punct* ,
he
suddenly
leaped
to
his
feet
*punct* ,
threw
out
arms
and
legs
*punct* ,
gave
himself
a
good
stretching
*punct* ,
yawned
a
little
bit
*punct* ,
and
then
springing
into
the
head
of
his
hoisted
boat
*punct* ,
and
poising
a
harpoon
*punct* ,
pronounced
himself
fit
for
a
fight
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
wild
whimsiness
*punct* ,
he
now
used
his
coffin
for
a
sea-chest
*punct* ;
and
emptying
into
it
his
canvas
bag
of
clothes
*punct* ,
set
them
in
order
there
*punct* .
*break*
many
spare
hours
he
spent
*punct* ,
in
carving
the
lid
with
all
manner
of
grotesque
figures
and
drawings
*punct* ;
and
it
seemed
that
hereby
he
was
striving
*punct* ,
in
his
rude
way
*punct* ,
to
copy
parts
of
the
twisted
tattooing
on
his
body
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
tattooing
*punct* ,
had
been
the
work
of
a
departed
prophet
and
seer
of
his
island
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
by
those
hieroglyphic
marks
*punct* ,
had
written
out
on
his
body
a
complete
theory
of
the
heavens
and
the
earth
*punct* ,
and
a
mystical
treatise
on
the
art
of
attaining
truth
*punct* ;
so
that
queequeg
in
his
own
proper
person
was
a
riddle
to
unfold
*punct* ;
a
wondrous
work
in
one
volume
*punct* ;
but
whose
mysteries
not
even
himself
could
read
*punct* ,
though
his
own
live
heart
beat
against
them
*punct* ;
and
these
mysteries
were
therefore
destined
in
the
end
to
moulder
away
with
the
living
parchment
whereon
they
were
inscribed
*punct* ,
and
so
be
unsolved
to
the
last
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
thought
it
must
have
been
which
suggested
to
ahab
that
wild
exclamation
of
his
*punct* ,
when
one
morning
turning
away
from
surveying
poor
queequeg
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
devilish
tantalization
of
the
gods
*punct* !
*break*
there
is
*punct* ,
one
knows
not
what
sweet
mystery
about
this
sea
*punct* ,
whose
gently
awful
stirrings
seem
to
speak
of
some
hidden
soul
beneath
*punct* ;
like
those
fabled
undulations
of
the
ephesian
sod
over
the
buried
evangelist
st
*punct* .
*break*
and
meet
it
is
*punct* ,
that
over
these
sea-pastures
*punct* ,
wide-rolling
watery
prairies
and
potters
fields
of
all
four
continents
*punct* ,
the
waves
should
rise
and
fall
*punct* ,
and
ebb
and
flow
unceasingly
*punct* ;
for
here
*punct* ,
millions
of
mixed
shades
and
shadows
*punct* ,
drowned
dreams
*punct* ,
somnambulisms
*punct* ,
reveries
*punct* ;
all
that
we
call
lives
and
souls
*punct* ,
lie
dreaming
*punct* ,
dreaming
*punct* ,
still
*punct* ;
tossing
like
slumberers
in
their
beds
*punct* ;
the
ever-rolling
waves
but
made
so
by
their
restlessness
*punct* .
*break*
to
any
meditative
magian
rover
*punct* ,
this
serene
pacific
*punct* ,
once
beheld
*punct* ,
must
ever
after
be
the
sea
of
his
adoption
*punct* .
*break*
it
rolls
the
midmost
waters
of
the
world
*punct* ,
the
indian
ocean
and
atlantic
being
but
its
arms
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
waves
wash
the
moles
of
the
new-built
californian
towns
*punct* ,
but
yesterday
planted
by
the
recentest
race
of
men
*punct* ,
and
lave
the
faded
but
still
gorgeous
skirts
of
asiatic
lands
*punct* ,
older
than
abraham
*punct* ;
while
all
between
float
milky-ways
of
coral
isles
*punct* ,
and
low-lying
*punct* ,
endless
*punct* ,
unknown
archipelagoes
*punct* ,
and
impenetrable
japans
*punct* .
*break*
thus
this
mysterious
*punct* ,
divine
pacific
zones
the
world's
whole
bulk
about
*punct* ;
makes
all
coasts
one
bay
to
it
*punct* ;
seems
the
tide-beating
heart
of
earth
*punct* .
*break*
lifted
by
those
eternal
swells
*punct* ,
you
needs
must
own
the
seductive
god
*punct* ,
bowing
your
head
to
pan
*punct* .
*break*
launched
at
length
upon
these
almost
final
waters
*punct* ,
and
gliding
towards
the
japanese
cruising-ground
*punct* ,
the
old
man's
purpose
intensified
itself
*punct* .
*break*
his
firm
lips
met
like
the
lips
of
a
vice
*punct* ;
the
delta
of
his
forehead's
veins
swelled
like
overladen
brooks
*punct* ;
in
his
very
sleep
*punct* ,
his
ringing
cry
ran
through
the
vaulted
hull
*punct* ,
stern
all
*punct* !
*break*
the
white
whale
spouts
thick
blood
*punct* !
*break*
often
he
would
be
surrounded
by
an
eager
circle
*punct* ,
all
waiting
to
be
served
*punct* ;
holding
boat-spades
*punct* ,
pike-heads
*punct* ,
harpoons
*punct* ,
and
lances
*punct* ,
and
jealously
watching
his
every
sooty
movement
*punct* ,
as
he
toiled
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
this
old
man's
was
a
patient
hammer
wielded
by
a
patient
arm
*punct* .
*break*
no
murmur
*punct* ,
no
impatience
*punct* ,
no
petulence
did
come
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
silent
*punct* ,
slow
*punct* ,
and
solemn
*punct* ;
bowing
over
still
further
his
chronically
broken
back
*punct* ,
he
toiled
away
*punct* ,
as
if
toil
were
life
itself
*punct* ,
and
the
heavy
beating
of
his
hammer
the
heavy
beating
of
his
heart
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
it
was.
*punct* ,
most
miserable
*punct* !
*break*
and
to
the
importunity
of
their
persisted
questionings
he
had
finally
given
in
*punct* ;
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
every
one
now
knew
the
shameful
story
of
his
wretched
fate
*punct* .
*break*
belated
*punct* ,
and
not
innocently
*punct* ,
one
bitter
winter's
midnight
*punct* ,
on
the
road
running
between
two
country
towns
*punct* ,
the
blacksmith
half-stupidly
felt
the
deadly
numbness
stealing
over
him
*punct* ,
and
sought
refuge
in
a
leaning
*punct* ,
dilapidated
barn
*punct* .
*break*
the
issue
was
*punct* ,
the
loss
of
the
extremities
of
both
feet
*punct* .
*break*
out
of
this
revelation
*punct* ,
part
by
part
*punct* ,
at
last
came
out
the
four
acts
of
the
gladness
*punct* ,
and
the
one
long
*punct* ,
and
as
yet
uncatastrophied
fifth
act
of
the
grief
of
his
life's
drama
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
an
old
man
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
at
the
age
of
nearly
sixty
*punct* ,
had
postponedly
encountered
that
thing
in
sorrow's
technicals
called
ruin
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
been
an
artisan
of
famed
excellence
*punct* ,
and
with
plenty
to
do
*punct* ;
owned
a
house
and
garden
*punct* ;
embraced
a
youthful
*punct* ,
daughter-like
*punct* ,
loving
wife
*punct* ,
and
three
blithe
*punct* ,
ruddy
children
*punct* ;
every
sunday
went
to
a
cheerful-looking
church
*punct* ,
planted
in
a
grove
*punct* .
*break*
but
one
night
*punct* ,
under
cover
of
darkness
*punct* ,
and
further
concealed
in
a
most
cunning
disguisement
*punct* ,
a
desperate
burglar
slid
into
his
happy
home
*punct* ,
and
robbed
them
all
of
everything
*punct* .
*break*
and
darker
yet
to
tell
*punct* ,
the
blacksmith
himself
did
ignorantly
conduct
this
burglar
into
his
family's
heart
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
bottle
conjuror
*punct* !
*break*
upon
the
opening
of
that
fatal
cork
*punct* ,
forth
flew
the
fiend
*punct* ,
and
shrivelled
up
his
home
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
for
prudent
*punct* ,
most
wise
*punct* ,
and
economic
reasons
*punct* ,
the
blacksmith's
shop
was
in
the
basement
of
his
dwelling
*punct* ,
but
with
a
separate
entrance
to
it
*punct* ;
so
that
always
had
the
young
and
loving
healthy
wife
listened
with
no
unhappy
nervousness
*punct* ,
but
with
vigorous
pleasure
*punct* ,
to
the
stout
ringing
of
her
young-armed
old
husband's
hammer
*punct* ;
whose
reverberations
*punct* ,
muffled
by
passing
through
the
floors
and
walls
*punct* ,
came
up
to
her
*punct* ,
not
unsweetly
*punct* ,
in
her
nursery
*punct* ;
and
so
*punct* ,
to
stout
labor's
iron
lullaby
*punct* ,
the
blacksmith's
infants
were
rocked
to
slumber
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
woe
on
woe
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
death
*punct* ,
why
canst
thou
not
sometimes
be
timely
*punct* ?
*break*
but
death
plucked
down
some
virtuous
elder
brother
*punct* ,
on
whose
whistling
daily
toil
solely
hung
the
responsibilities
of
some
other
family
*punct* ,
and
left
the
worse
than
useless
old
man
standing
*punct* ,
till
the
hideous
rot
of
life
should
make
him
easier
to
harvest
*punct* .
*break*
why
tell
the
whole
*punct* ?
*break*
the
blows
of
the
basement
hammer
every
day
grew
more
and
more
between
*punct* ;
and
each
blow
every
day
grew
fainter
than
the
last
*punct* ;
the
wife
sat
frozen
at
the
window
*punct* ,
with
tearless
eyes
*punct* ,
glitteringly
gazing
into
the
weeping
faces
of
her
children
*punct* ;
the
bellows
fell
*punct* ;
the
forge
choked
up
with
cinders
*punct* ;
the
house
was
sold
*punct* ;
the
mother
dived
down
into
the
long
church-yard
grass
*punct* ;
her
children
twice
followed
her
thither
*punct* ;
and
the
houseless
*punct* ,
familyless
old
man
staggered
off
a
vagabond
in
crape
*punct* ;
his
every
woe
unreverenced
*punct* ;
his
grey
head
a
scorn
to
flaxen
curls
*punct* !
*break*
death
seems
the
only
desirable
sequel
for
a
career
like
this
*punct* ;
but
death
is
only
a
launching
into
the
region
of
the
strange
untried
*punct* ;
it
is
but
the
first
salutation
to
the
possibilities
of
the
immense
remote
*punct* ,
the
wild
*punct* ,
the
watery
*punct* ,
the
unshored
*punct* ;
therefore
*punct* ,
to
the
death-longing
eyes
of
such
men
*punct* ,
who
still
have
left
in
them
some
interior
compunctions
against
suicide
*punct* ,
does
the
all-contributed
and
all-receptive
ocean
alluringly
spread
forth
his
whole
plain
of
unimaginable
*punct* ,
taking
terrors
*punct* ,
and
wonderful
*punct* ,
new-life
adventures
*punct* ;
and
from
the
hearts
of
infinite
pacifics
*punct* ,
the
thousand
mermaids
sing
to
them
*punct* ,
come
hither
*punct* ,
broken-hearted
*punct* ;
here
is
another
life
without
the
guilt
of
intermediate
death
*punct* ;
here
are
wonders
supernatural
*punct* ,
without
dying
for
them
*punct* .
*break*
bury
thyself
in
a
life
which
*punct* ,
to
your
now
equally
abhorred
and
abhorring
*punct* ,
landed
world
*punct* ,
is
more
oblivious
than
death
*punct* .
*break*
put
up
thy
grave-stone
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
within
the
churchyard
*punct* ,
and
come
hither
*punct* ,
till
we
marry
thee
*punct* !
*break*
hearkening
to
these
voices
*punct* ,
east
and
west
*punct* ,
by
early
sun-rise
*punct* ,
and
by
fall
of
eve
*punct* ,
the
blacksmith's
soul
responded
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
i
come
*punct* !
*break*
while
yet
a
little
distance
from
the
forge
*punct* ,
moody
ahab
paused
*punct* ;
till
at
last
*punct* ,
perth
*punct* ,
withdrawing
his
iron
from
the
fire
*punct* ,
began
hammering
it
upon
the
anvil
*punct* ,
the
red
mass
sending
off
the
sparks
in
thick
hovering
flights
*punct* ,
some
of
which
flew
close
to
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
are
these
thy
mother
carey's
chickens
*punct* ,
perth
*punct* ?
*break*
they
are
always
flying
in
thy
wake
*punct* ;
birds
of
good
omen
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
but
not
to
all;
*punct* ,
look
here
*punct* ,
they
burn
*punct* ;
but
thou
*punct* ,
thou
liv'st
among
them
without
a
scorch
*punct* .
*break*
because
i
am
scorched
all
over
*punct* ,
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
answered
perth
*punct* ,
resting
for
a
moment
on
his
hammer
*punct* ;
i
am
past
scorching
*punct* ;
not
easily
can'st
thou
scorch
a
scar
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ;
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
thy
shrunk
voice
sounds
too
calmly
*punct* ,
sanely
woful
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
in
no
paradise
myself
*punct* ,
i
am
impatient
of
all
misery
in
others
that
is
not
mad
*punct* .
*break*
thou
should'st
go
mad
*punct* ,
blacksmith
*punct* ;
say
*punct* ,
why
dost
thou
not
go
mad
*punct* ?
*break*
how
can'st
thou
endure
without
being
mad
*punct* ?
*break*
do
the
heavens
yet
hate
thee
*punct* ,
that
thou
can'st
not
go
mad?
*punct* ,
what
wert
thou
making
there
*punct* ?
*break*
welding
an
old
pike-head
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
there
were
seams
and
dents
in
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
can'st
thou
make
it
all
smooth
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
blacksmith
*punct* ,
after
such
hard
usage
as
it
had
*punct* ?
*break*
i
think
so
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
suppose
thou
can'st
smoothe
almost
any
seams
and
dents
*punct* ;
never
mind
how
hard
the
metal
*punct* ,
blacksmith
*punct* ?
*break*
can'st
thou
smoothe
this
seam
*punct* ?
*break*
that
is
the
one
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
said
i
not
all
seams
and
dents
but
one
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
blacksmith
*punct* ,
it
is
the
one
*punct* ;
aye
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
it
is
unsmoothable
*punct* ;
for
though
thou
only
see'st
it
here
in
my
flesh
*punct* ,
it
has
worked
down
into
the
bone
of
my
skull
*punct* ,
that
is
all
wrinkles
*punct* !
*break*
but
*punct* ,
away
with
child's
play
*punct* ;
no
more
gaffs
and
pikes
to-day
*punct* .
*break*
look
ye
here
*punct* !
*break*
jingling
the
leathern
bag
*punct* ,
as
if
it
were
full
of
gold
coins
*punct* .
*break*
i
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
want
a
harpoon
made
*punct* ;
one
that
a
thousand
yoke
of
fiends
could
not
part
*punct* ,
perth
*punct* ;
something
that
will
stick
in
a
whale
like
his
own
fin-bone
*punct* .
*break*
there's
the
stuff
*punct* ,
flinging
the
pouch
upon
the
anvil
*punct* .
*break*
look
ye
*punct* ,
blacksmith
*punct* ,
these
are
the
gathered
nail-stubbs
of
the
steel
shoes
of
racing
horses
*punct* .
*break*
horse-shoe
stubbs
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
thou
hast
here
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
the
best
and
stubbornest
stuff
we
blacksmiths
ever
work
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
it
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ;
these
stubbs
will
weld
together
like
glue
from
the
melted
bones
of
murderers
*punct* .
*break*
forge
me
the
harpoon
*punct* .
*break*
and
forge
me
first
*punct* ,
twelve
rods
for
its
shank
*punct* ;
then
wind
*punct* ,
and
twist
*punct* ,
and
hammer
these
twelve
together
like
the
yarns
and
strands
of
a
tow-line
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
blow
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
when
at
last
the
twelve
rods
were
made
*punct* ,
ahab
tried
them
*punct* ,
one
by
one
*punct* ,
by
spiralling
them
*punct* ,
with
his
own
hand
*punct* ,
round
a
long
*punct* ,
heavy
iron
bolt
*punct* .
*break*
rejecting
the
last
one
*punct* .
*break*
work
that
over
again
*punct* ,
perth
*punct* .
*break*
this
done
*punct* ,
perth
was
about
to
begin
welding
the
twelve
into
one
*punct* ,
when
ahab
stayed
his
hand
*punct* ,
and
said
he
would
weld
his
own
iron
*punct* .
*break*
as
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
with
regular
*punct* ,
gasping
hems
*punct* ,
he
hammered
on
the
anvil
*punct* ,
perth
passing
to
him
the
glowing
rods
*punct* ,
one
after
the
other
*punct* ,
and
the
hard
pressed
forge
shooting
up
its
intense
straight
flame
*punct* ,
the
parsee
passed
silently
*punct* ,
and
bowing
over
his
head
towards
the
fire
*punct* ,
seemed
invoking
some
curse
or
some
blessing
on
the
toil
*punct* .
*break*
muttered
stubb
*punct* ,
looking
on
from
the
forecastle
*punct* .
*break*
that
parsee
smells
fire
like
a
fusee
*punct* ;
and
smells
of
it
himself
*punct* ,
like
a
hot
musket's
powder-pan
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
the
shank
*punct* ,
in
one
complete
rod
*punct* ,
received
its
final
heat
*punct* ;
and
as
perth
*punct* ,
to
temper
it
*punct* ,
plunged
it
all
hissing
into
the
cask
of
water
near
by
*punct* ,
the
scalding
steam
shot
up
into
ahab's
bent
face
*punct* .
*break*
would'st
thou
brand
me
*punct* ,
perth
*punct* ?
*break*
wincing
for
a
moment
with
the
pain
*punct* ;
have
i
been
but
forging
my
own
branding-iron
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ?
*break*
pray
god
*punct* ,
not
that
*punct* ;
yet
i
fear
something
*punct* ,
captain
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
is
not
this
harpoon
for
the
white
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
for
the
white
fiend
*punct* !
*break*
but
now
for
the
barbs
*punct* ;
thou
must
make
them
thyself
*punct* ,
man
*punct* .
*break*
here
are
my
razors
*punct* ,
the
best
of
steel
*punct* ;
here
*punct* ,
and
make
the
barbs
sharp
as
the
needle-sleet
of
the
icy
sea
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
the
old
blacksmith
eyed
the
razors
as
though
he
would
fain
not
use
them
*punct* .
*break*
take
them
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
i
have
no
need
for
them
*punct* ;
for
i
now
neither
shave
*punct* ,
sup
*punct* ,
nor
pray
till
*punct* ,
but
here
*punct* ,
to
work
*punct* !
*break*
fashioned
at
last
into
an
arrowy
shape
*punct* ,
and
welded
by
perth
to
the
shank
*punct* ,
the
steel
soon
pointed
the
end
of
the
iron
*punct* ;
and
as
the
blacksmith
was
about
giving
the
barbs
their
final
heat
*punct* ,
prior
to
tempering
them
*punct* ,
he
cried
to
ahab
to
place
the
water-cask
near
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
no
water
for
that
*punct* ;
i
want
it
of
the
true
death-temper
*punct* .
*break*
ahoy
*punct* ,
there
*punct* !
*break*
tashtego
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
daggoo
*punct* !
*break*
what
say
ye
*punct* ,
pagans
*punct* !
*break*
will
ye
give
me
as
much
blood
as
will
cover
this
barb
*punct* ?
*break*
holding
it
high
up
*punct* .
*break*
a
cluster
of
dark
nods
replied
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* .
*break*
three
punctures
were
made
in
the
heathen
flesh
*punct* ,
and
the
white
whale's
barbs
were
then
tempered
*punct* .
*break*
ego
non
baptizo
te
in
nomine
patris
*punct* ,
sed
in
nomine
diaboli
*punct* !
*break*
deliriously
howled
ahab
*punct* ,
as
the
malignant
iron
scorchingly
devoured
the
baptismal
blood
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
mustering
the
spare
poles
from
below
*punct* ,
and
selecting
one
of
hickory
*punct* ,
with
the
bark
still
investing
it
*punct* ,
ahab
fitted
the
end
to
the
socket
of
the
iron
*punct* .
*break*
pressing
his
foot
upon
it
*punct* ,
till
the
rope
hummed
like
a
harp-string
*punct* ,
then
eagerly
bending
over
it
*punct* ,
and
seeing
no
strandings
*punct* ,
ahab
exclaimed
*punct* ,
good
*punct* !
*break*
and
now
for
the
seizings
*punct* .
*break*
at
one
extremity
the
rope
was
unstranded
*punct* ,
and
the
separate
spread
yarns
were
all
braided
and
woven
round
the
socket
of
the
harpoon
*punct* ;
the
pole
was
then
driven
hard
up
into
the
socket
*punct* ;
from
the
lower
end
the
rope
was
traced
half
way
along
the
pole's
length
*punct* ,
and
firmly
secured
so
*punct* ,
with
intertwistings
of
twine
*punct* .
*break*
this
done
*punct* ,
pole
*punct* ,
iron
*punct* ,
and
rope
*punct* ,
like
the
three
fates
*punct* ,
remained
inseparable
*punct* ,
and
ahab
moodily
stalked
away
with
the
weapon
*punct* ;
the
sound
of
his
ivory
leg
*punct* ,
and
the
sound
of
the
hickory
pole
*punct* ,
both
hollowly
ringing
along
every
plank
*punct* .
*break*
but
ere
he
entered
his
cabin
*punct* ,
a
light
*punct* ,
unnatural
*punct* ,
half-bantering
*punct* ,
yet
most
piteous
sound
was
heard
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
pip
*punct* !
*break*
thy
wretched
laugh
*punct* ,
thy
idle
but
unresting
eye
*punct* ;
all
thy
strange
mummeries
not
unmeaningly
blended
with
the
black
tragedy
of
the
melancholy
ship
*punct* ,
and
mocked
it
*punct* !
*break*
often
*punct* ,
in
mild
*punct* ,
pleasant
weather
*punct* ,
for
twelve
*punct* ,
fifteen
*punct* ,
eighteen
*punct* ,
and
twenty
hours
on
the
stretch
*punct* ,
they
were
engaged
in
the
boats
*punct* ,
steadily
pulling
*punct* ,
or
sailing
*punct* ,
or
paddling
after
the
whales
*punct* ,
or
for
an
interlude
of
sixty
or
seventy
minutes
calmly
awaiting
their
uprising
*punct* ;
though
with
but
small
success
for
their
pains
*punct* .
*break*
these
are
the
times
*punct* ,
when
in
his
whale-boat
the
rover
softly
feels
a
certain
filial
*punct* ,
confident
*punct* ,
land-like
feeling
towards
the
sea
*punct* ;
that
he
regards
it
as
so
much
flowery
earth
*punct* ;
and
the
distant
ship
revealing
only
the
tops
of
her
masts
*punct* ,
seems
struggling
forward
*punct* ,
not
though
high
rolling
waves
*punct* ,
but
through
the
tall
grass
of
a
rolling
prairie
*punct* :
as
when
the
western
emigrants
horses
only
show
their
erected
ears
*punct* ,
while
their
hidden
bodies
widely
wade
through
the
amazing
verdure
*punct* .
*break*
the
long-drawn
virgin
vales
*punct* ;
the
mild
blue
hill-sides
*punct* ;
as
over
these
there
steals
the
hush
*punct* ,
the
hum
*punct* ;
you
almost
swear
that
play-wearied
children
lie
sleeping
in
these
solitudes
*punct* ,
in
some
glad
may-time
*punct* ,
when
the
flowers
of
the
woods
are
plucked
*punct* .
*break*
and
all
this
mixes
with
your
most
mystic
mood
*punct* ;
so
that
fact
and
fancy
*punct* ,
half-way
meeting
*punct* ,
interpenetrate
*punct* ,
and
form
one
seamless
whole
*punct* .
*break*
nor
did
such
soothing
scenes
*punct* ,
however
temporary
*punct* ,
fail
of
at
least
as
temporary
an
effect
on
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
these
secret
golden
keys
did
seem
to
open
in
him
his
own
secret
golden
treasuries
*punct* ,
yet
did
his
breath
upon
them
prove
but
tarnishing
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
grassy
glades
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
ever
vernal
endless
landscapes
in
the
soul
*punct* ;
in
ye,
*punct* ,
though
long
parched
by
the
dead
drought
of
the
earthy
life,
*punct* ,
in
ye
*punct* ,
men
yet
may
roll
*punct* ,
like
young
horses
in
new
morning
clover
*punct* ;
and
for
some
few
fleeting
moments
*punct* ,
feel
the
cool
dew
of
the
life
immortal
on
them
*punct* .
*break*
would
to
god
these
blessed
calms
would
last
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
mingled
*punct* ,
mingling
threads
of
life
are
woven
by
warp
and
woof
*punct* :
calms
crossed
by
storms
*punct* ,
a
storm
for
every
calm
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
steady
unretracing
progress
in
this
life
*punct* ;
we
do
not
advance
through
fixed
gradations
*punct* ,
and
at
the
last
one
pause:
*punct* ,
through
infancy's
unconscious
spell
*punct* ,
boyhood's
thoughtless
faith
*punct* ,
adolescence
doubt
*punct* ,
the
common
doom
*punct* ,
then
scepticism
*punct* ,
then
disbelief
*punct* ,
resting
at
last
in
manhood's
pondering
repose
of
if
*punct* .
*break*
but
once
gone
through
*punct* ,
we
trace
the
round
again
*punct* ;
and
are
infants
*punct* ,
boys
*punct* ,
and
men
*punct* ,
and
ifs
eternally
*punct* .
*break*
where
lies
the
final
harbor
*punct* ,
whence
we
unmoor
no
more
*punct* ?
*break*
where
is
the
foundling's
father
hidden
*punct* ?
*break*
our
souls
are
like
those
orphans
whose
unwedded
mothers
die
in
bearing
them
*punct* :
the
secret
of
our
paternity
lies
in
their
grave
*punct* ,
and
we
must
there
to
learn
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
that
same
day
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
gazing
far
down
from
his
boat's
side
into
that
same
golden
sea
*punct* ,
starbuck
lowly
murmured:
*punct* ,
loveliness
unfathomable
*punct* ,
as
ever
lover
saw
in
his
young
bride's
eye!
*punct* ,
tell
me
not
of
thy
teeth-tiered
sharks
*punct* ,
and
thy
kidnapping
cannibal
ways
*punct* .
*break*
let
faith
oust
fact
*punct* ;
let
fancy
oust
memory
*punct* ;
i
look
deep
down
and
do
believe
*punct* .
*break*
and
stubb
*punct* ,
fish-like
*punct* ,
with
sparkling
scales
*punct* ,
leaped
up
in
that
same
golden
light:
*punct* ,
i
am
stubb
*punct* ,
and
stubb
has
his
history
*punct* ;
but
here
stubb
takes
oaths
that
he
has
always
been
jolly
*punct* !
*break*
it
was
a
nantucket
ship
*punct* ,
the
bachelor
*punct* ,
which
had
just
wedged
in
her
last
cask
of
oil
*punct* ,
and
bolted
down
her
bursting
hatches
*punct* ;
and
now
*punct* ,
in
glad
holiday
apparel
*punct* ,
was
joyously
*punct* ,
though
somewhat
vain-gloriously
*punct* ,
sailing
round
among
the
widely-separated
ships
on
the
ground
*punct* ,
previous
to
pointing
her
prow
for
home
*punct* .
*break*
the
three
men
at
her
mast-head
wore
long
streamers
of
narrow
red
bunting
at
their
hats
*punct* ;
from
the
stern
*punct* ,
a
whale-boat
was
suspended
*punct* ,
bottom
down
*punct* ;
and
hanging
captive
from
the
bowsprit
was
seen
the
long
lower
jaw
of
the
last
whale
they
had
slain
*punct* .
*break*
signals
*punct* ,
ensigns
*punct* ,
and
jacks
of
all
colors
were
flying
from
her
rigging
*punct* ,
on
every
side
*punct* .
*break*
as
was
afterwards
learned
*punct* ,
the
bachelor
had
met
with
the
most
surprising
success
*punct* ;
all
the
more
wonderful
*punct* ,
for
that
while
cruising
in
the
same
seas
numerous
other
vessels
had
gone
entire
months
without
securing
a
single
fish
*punct* .
*break*
not
only
had
barrels
of
beef
and
bread
been
given
away
to
make
room
for
the
far
more
valuable
sperm
*punct* ,
but
additional
supplemental
casks
had
been
bartered
for
*punct* ,
from
the
ships
she
had
met
*punct* ;
and
these
were
stowed
along
the
deck
*punct* ,
and
in
the
captain's
and
officers
staterooms
*punct* .
*break*
even
the
cabin
table
itself
had
been
knocked
into
kindling-wood
*punct* ;
and
the
cabin
mess
dined
off
the
broad
head
of
an
oil-butt
*punct* ,
lashed
down
to
the
floor
for
a
centrepiece
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
forecastle
*punct* ,
the
sailors
had
actually
caulked
and
pitched
their
chests
*punct* ,
and
filled
them
*punct* ;
it
was
humorously
added
*punct* ,
that
the
cook
had
clapped
a
head
on
his
largest
boiler
*punct* ,
and
filled
it
*punct* ;
that
the
steward
had
plugged
his
spare
coffee-pot
and
filled
it
*punct* ;
that
the
harpooneers
had
headed
the
sockets
of
their
irons
and
filled
them
*punct* ;
that
indeed
everything
was
filled
with
sperm
*punct* ,
except
the
captain's
pantaloons
pockets
*punct* ,
and
those
he
reserved
to
thrust
his
hands
into
*punct* ,
in
self-complacent
testimony
of
his
entire
satisfaction
*punct* .
*break*
as
this
glad
ship
of
good
luck
bore
down
upon
the
moody
pequod
*punct* ,
the
barbarian
sound
of
enormous
drums
came
from
her
forecastle
*punct* ;
and
drawing
still
nearer
*punct* ,
a
crowd
of
her
men
were
seen
standing
round
her
huge
try-pots
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
covered
with
the
parchment-like
poke
or
stomach
skin
of
the
black
fish
*punct* ,
gave
forth
a
loud
roar
to
every
stroke
of
the
clenched
hands
of
the
crew
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
quarter-deck
*punct* ,
the
mates
and
harpooneers
were
dancing
with
the
olive-hued
girls
who
had
eloped
with
them
from
the
polynesian
isles
*punct* ;
while
suspended
in
an
ornamented
boat
*punct* ,
firmly
secured
aloft
between
the
foremast
and
mainmast
*punct* ,
three
long
island
negroes
*punct* ,
with
glittering
fiddle-bows
of
whale
ivory
*punct* ,
were
presiding
over
the
hilarious
jig
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
*punct* ,
others
of
the
ship's
company
were
tumultuously
busy
at
the
masonry
of
the
try-works
*punct* ,
from
which
the
huge
pots
had
been
removed
*punct* .
*break*
and
ahab
*punct* ,
he
too
was
standing
on
his
quarter-deck
*punct* ,
shaggy
and
black
*punct* ,
with
a
stubborn
gloom
*punct* ;
and
as
the
two
ships
crossed
each
other's
wakes
*punct* ,
one
all
jubilations
for
things
passed
*punct* ,
the
other
all
forebodings
as
to
things
to
come
*punct* ,
their
two
captains
in
themselves
impersonated
the
whole
striking
contrast
of
the
scene
*punct* .
*break*
come
aboard
*punct* ,
come
aboard
*punct* !
*break*
cried
the
gay
bachelor's
commander
*punct* ,
lifting
a
glass
and
a
bottle
in
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
hast
seen
the
white
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
gritted
ahab
in
reply
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ;
only
heard
of
him
*punct* ;
but
don't
believe
in
him
at
all
*punct* ,
said
the
other
good-humoredly
*punct* .
*break*
thou
are
too
damned
jolly
*punct* .
*break*
hast
lost
any
men
*punct* ?
*break*
not
enough
to
speak
of
*punct* ,
two
islanders
*punct* ,
that's
all;
*punct* ,
but
come
aboard
*punct* ,
old
hearty
*punct* ,
come
along
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
soon
take
that
black
from
your
brow
*punct* .
*break*
how
wondrous
familiar
is
a
fool
*punct* !
*break*
muttered
ahab
*punct* ;
then
aloud
*punct* ,
thou
art
a
full
ship
and
homeward
bound
*punct* ,
thou
sayest
*punct* ;
well
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
call
me
an
empty
ship
*punct* ,
and
outward-bound
*punct* .
*break*
so
go
thy
ways
*punct* ,
and
i
will
mine
*punct* .
*break*
set
all
sail
*punct* ,
and
keep
her
to
the
wind
*punct* !
*break*
and
thus
*punct* ,
while
the
one
ship
went
cheerily
before
the
breeze
*punct* ,
the
other
stubbornly
fought
against
it
*punct* ;
and
so
the
two
vessels
parted
*punct* ;
the
crew
of
the
pequod
looking
with
grave
*punct* ,
lingering
glances
towards
the
receding
bachelor
*punct* ;
but
the
bachelor's
men
never
heeding
their
gaze
for
the
lively
revelry
they
were
in
*punct* .
*break*
so
seemed
it
with
the
pequod
*punct* .
*break*
for
next
day
after
encountering
the
gay
bachelor
*punct* ,
whales
were
seen
and
four
were
slain
*punct* ;
and
one
of
them
by
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
far
down
the
afternoon
*punct* ;
and
when
all
the
spearings
of
the
crimson
fight
were
done
*punct* :
and
floating
in
the
lovely
sunset
sea
and
sky
*punct* ,
sun
and
whale
both
stilly
died
together
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
such
a
sweetness
and
such
plaintiveness
*punct* ,
such
inwreathing
orisons
curled
up
in
that
rosy
air
*punct* ,
that
it
almost
seemed
as
if
far
over
from
the
deep
green
convent
valleys
of
the
manilla
isles
*punct* ,
the
spanish
land-breeze
*punct* ,
wantonly
turned
sailor
*punct* ,
had
gone
to
sea
*punct* ,
freighted
with
these
vesper
hymns
*punct* .
*break*
soothed
again
*punct* ,
but
only
soothed
to
deeper
gloom
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* ,
who
had
sterned
off
from
the
whale
*punct* ,
sat
intently
watching
his
final
wanings
from
the
now
tranquil
boat
*punct* .
*break*
for
that
strange
spectacle
observable
in
all
sperm
whales
dying
*punct* ,
the
turning
sunwards
of
the
head
*punct* ,
and
so
expiring
*punct* ,
that
strange
spectacle
*punct* ,
beheld
of
such
a
placid
evening
*punct* ,
somehow
to
ahab
conveyed
a
wondrousness
unknown
before
*punct* .
*break*
he
turns
and
turns
him
to
it,
*punct* ,
how
slowly
*punct* ,
but
how
steadfastly
*punct* ,
his
homage-rendering
and
invoking
brow
*punct* ,
with
his
last
dying
motions
*punct* .
*break*
he
too
worships
fire
*punct* ;
most
faithful
*punct* ,
broad
*punct* ,
baronial
vassal
of
the
sun!
*punct* ,
oh
that
these
too-favoring
eyes
should
see
these
too-favoring
sights
*punct* .
*break*
no
sooner
dead
*punct* ,
than
death
whirls
round
the
corpse
*punct* ,
and
it
heads
some
other
way.
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
thou
dark
hindoo
half
of
nature
*punct* ,
who
of
drowned
bones
hast
builded
thy
separate
throne
somewhere
in
the
heart
of
these
unverdured
seas
*punct* ;
thou
art
an
infidel
*punct* ,
thou
queen
*punct* ,
and
too
truly
speakest
to
me
in
the
wide-slaughtering
typhoon
*punct* ,
and
the
hushed
burial
of
its
after
calm
*punct* .
*break*
nor
has
this
thy
whale
sunwards
turned
his
dying
head
*punct* ,
and
then
gone
round
again
*punct* ,
without
a
lesson
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
trebly
hooped
and
welded
hip
of
power
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
high
aspiring
*punct* ,
rainbowed
jet!
*punct* ,
that
one
strivest
*punct* ,
this
one
jettest
all
in
vain
*punct* !
*break*
in
vain
*punct* ,
oh
whale
*punct* ,
dost
thou
seek
intercedings
with
yon
all-quickening
sun
*punct* ,
that
only
calls
forth
life
*punct* ,
but
gives
it
not
again
*punct* .
*break*
yet
dost
thou
*punct* ,
darker
half
*punct* ,
rock
me
with
a
prouder
*punct* ,
if
a
darker
faith
*punct* .
*break*
all
thy
unnamable
imminglings
*punct* ,
float
beneath
me
here
*punct* ;
i
am
buoyed
by
breaths
of
once
living
things
*punct* ,
exhaled
as
air
*punct* ,
but
water
now
*punct* .
*break*
then
hail
*punct* ,
for
ever
hail
*punct* ,
o
sea
*punct* ,
in
whose
eternal
tossings
the
wild
fowl
finds
his
only
rest
*punct* .
*break*
born
of
earth
*punct* ,
yet
suckled
by
the
sea
*punct* ;
though
hill
and
valley
mothered
me
*punct* ,
ye
billows
are
my
foster-brothers
*punct* !
*break*
these
last
three
were
brought
alongside
ere
nightfall
*punct* ;
but
the
windward
one
could
not
be
reached
till
morning
*punct* ;
and
the
boat
that
had
killed
it
lay
by
its
side
all
night
*punct* ;
and
that
boat
was
ahab's
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
and
all
his
boat's
crew
seemed
asleep
but
the
parsee
*punct* ;
who
crouching
in
the
bow
*punct* ,
sat
watching
the
sharks
*punct* ,
that
spectrally
played
round
the
whale
*punct* ,
and
tapped
the
light
cedar
planks
with
their
tails
*punct* .
*break*
a
sound
like
the
moaning
in
squadrons
over
asphaltites
of
unforgiven
ghosts
of
gomorrah
*punct* ,
ran
shuddering
through
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
started
from
his
slumbers
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* ,
face
to
face
*punct* ,
saw
the
parsee
*punct* ;
and
hooped
round
by
the
gloom
of
the
night
they
seemed
the
last
men
in
a
flooded
world
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
dreamed
it
again
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* .
*break*
of
the
hearses
*punct* ?
*break*
have
i
not
said
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ,
that
neither
hearse
nor
coffin
can
be
thine
*punct* ?
*break*
and
who
are
hearsed
that
die
on
the
sea
*punct* ?
*break*
but
i
said
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ,
that
ere
thou
couldst
die
on
this
voyage
*punct* ,
two
hearses
must
verily
be
seen
by
thee
on
the
sea
*punct* ;
the
first
not
made
by
mortal
hands
*punct* ;
and
the
visible
wood
of
the
last
one
must
be
grown
in
america
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* !
*break*
a
strange
sight
that
*punct* ,
parsee:
*punct* ,
a
hearse
and
its
plumes
floating
over
the
ocean
with
the
waves
for
the
pall-bearers
*punct* .
*break*
such
a
sight
we
shall
not
soon
see
*punct* .
*break*
believe
it
or
not
*punct* ,
thou
canst
not
die
till
it
be
seen
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
was
that
saying
about
thyself
*punct* ?
*break*
though
it
come
to
the
last
*punct* ,
i
shall
still
go
before
thee
thy
pilot
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
thou
art
so
gone
before
*punct* ,
if
that
ever
befall
*punct* ,
then
ere
i
can
follow
*punct* ,
thou
must
still
appear
to
me
*punct* ,
to
pilot
me
still?
*punct* ,
was
it
not
so
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
did
i
believe
all
ye
say
*punct* ,
oh
my
pilot
*punct* !
*break*
i
have
here
two
pledges
that
i
shall
yet
slay
moby
dick
and
survive
it
*punct* .
*break*
take
another
pledge
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ,
said
the
parsee
*punct* ,
as
his
eyes
lighted
up
like
fire-flies
in
the
gloom,
*punct* ,
hemp
only
can
kill
thee
*punct* .
*break*
the
gallows
*punct* ,
ye
mean.
*punct* ,
i
am
immortal
then
*punct* ,
on
land
and
on
sea
*punct* ,
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
with
a
laugh
of
derision;
*punct* ,
immortal
on
land
and
on
sea
*punct* !
*break*
both
were
silent
again
*punct* ,
as
one
man
*punct* .
*break*
in
good
time
the
order
came
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
hard
upon
high
noon
*punct* ;
and
ahab
*punct* ,
seated
in
the
bows
of
his
high-hoisted
boat
*punct* ,
was
about
taking
his
wonted
daily
obervation
of
the
sun
to
determine
his
latitude
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
that
japanese
sea
*punct* ,
the
days
in
summer
are
as
freshets
of
effulgences
*punct* .
*break*
that
unblinkingly
vivid
japanese
sun
seems
the
blazing
focus
of
the
glassy
ocean's
immeasureable
burning-glass
*punct* .
*break*
the
sky
looks
lacquered
*punct* ;
clouds
there
are
none
*punct* ;
the
horizon
floats
*punct* ;
and
this
nakedness
of
unrelieved
radiance
is
as
the
insufferable
splendors
of
god's
throne
*punct* .
*break*
well
that
ahab's
quadrant
was
furnished
with
colored
glasses
*punct* ,
through
which
to
take
sight
of
that
solar
fire
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
swinging
his
seated
form
to
the
roll
of
the
ship
*punct* ,
and
with
his
astrological-looking
instrument
placed
to
his
eye
*punct* ,
he
remained
in
that
posture
for
some
moments
to
catch
the
precise
instant
when
the
sun
should
gain
its
precise
meridian
*punct* .
*break*
meantime
while
his
whole
attention
was
absorbed
*punct* ,
the
parsee
was
kneeling
beneath
him
on
the
ship's
deck
*punct* ,
and
with
face
thrown
up
like
ahab's
*punct* ,
was
eyeing
the
same
sun
with
him
*punct* ;
only
the
lids
of
his
eyes
half
hooded
their
orbs
*punct* ,
and
his
wild
face
was
subdued
to
an
earthly
passionlessness
*punct* .
*break*
at
length
the
desired
observation
was
taken
*punct* ;
and
with
his
pencil
upon
his
ivory
leg
*punct* ,
ahab
soon
calculated
what
his
latitude
must
be
at
that
precise
instant
*punct* .
*break*
then
falling
into
a
moment's
revery
*punct* ,
he
again
looked
up
towards
the
sun
and
murmured
to
himself
*punct* :
thou
sea-mark
*punct* !
*break*
thou
high
and
mighty
pilot
*punct* !
*break*
or
canst
thou
tell
where
some
other
thing
besides
me
is
this
moment
living
*punct* ?
*break*
where
is
moby
dick
*punct* ?
*break*
this
instant
thou
must
be
eyeing
him
*punct* .
*break*
these
eyes
of
mine
look
into
the
very
eye
that
is
even
now
beholding
him
*punct* ;
aye
*punct* ,
and
into
the
eye
that
is
even
now
equally
beholding
the
objects
on
the
unknown
*punct* ,
thither
side
of
thee
*punct* ,
thou
sun
*punct* !
*break*
then
gazing
at
his
quadrant
*punct* ,
and
handling
*punct* ,
one
after
the
other
*punct* ,
its
numerous
cabalistical
contrivances
*punct* ,
he
pondered
again
*punct* ,
and
muttered
*punct* :
foolish
toy
*punct* !
*break*
babies
plaything
of
haughty
admirals
*punct* ,
and
commodores
*punct* ,
and
captains
*punct* ;
the
world
brags
of
thee
*punct* ,
of
thy
cunning
and
might
*punct* ;
but
what
after
all
canst
thou
do
*punct* ,
but
tell
the
poor
*punct* ,
pitiful
point
*punct* ,
where
thou
thyself
happenest
to
be
on
this
wide
planet
*punct* ,
and
the
hand
that
holds
thee
*punct* :
no
*punct* !
*break*
not
one
jot
more
*punct* !
*break*
thou
canst
not
tell
where
one
drop
of
water
or
one
grain
of
sand
will
be
to-morrow
noon
*punct* ;
and
yet
with
thy
impotence
thou
insultest
the
sun
*punct* !
*break*
curse
thee
*punct* ,
thou
vain
toy
*punct* ;
and
cursed
be
all
the
things
that
cast
man's
eyes
aloft
to
that
heaven
*punct* ,
whose
live
vividness
but
scorches
him
*punct* ,
as
these
old
eyes
are
even
now
scorched
with
thy
light
*punct* ,
o
sun
*punct* !
*break*
level
by
nature
to
this
earth's
horizon
are
the
glances
of
man's
eyes
*punct* ;
not
shot
from
the
crown
of
his
head
*punct* ,
as
if
god
had
meant
him
to
gaze
on
his
firmament
*punct* .
*break*
curse
thee
*punct* ,
thou
quadrant
*punct* !
*break*
dashing
it
to
the
deck
*punct* ,
no
longer
will
i
guide
my
earthly
way
by
thee
*punct* ;
the
level
ship's
compass
*punct* ,
and
the
level
dead-reckoning
*punct* ,
by
log
and
by
line
*punct* ;
these
shall
conduct
me
*punct* ,
and
show
me
my
place
on
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
lighting
from
the
boat
to
the
deck
*punct* ,
thus
i
trample
on
thee
*punct* ,
thou
paltry
thing
that
feebly
pointest
on
high
*punct* ;
thus
i
split
and
destroy
thee
*punct* !
*break*
as
the
frantic
old
man
thus
spoke
and
thus
trampled
with
his
live
and
dead
feet
*punct* ,
a
sneering
triumph
that
seemed
meant
for
ahab
*punct* ,
and
a
fatalistic
despair
that
seemed
meant
for
himself
*punct* ,
these
passed
over
the
mute
*punct* ,
motionless
parsee's
face
*punct* .
*break*
unobserved
he
rose
and
glided
away
*punct* ;
while
*punct* ,
awestruck
by
the
aspect
of
their
commander
*punct* ,
the
seamen
clustered
together
on
the
forecastle
*punct* ,
till
ahab
*punct* ,
troubledly
pacing
the
deck
*punct* ,
shouted
out
*punct* ,
to
the
braces
*punct* !
*break*
up
helm!
*punct* ,
square
in
*punct* !
*break*
standing
between
the
knight-heads
*punct* ,
starbuck
watched
the
pequod's
tumultuous
way
*punct* ,
and
ahab's
also
*punct* ,
as
he
went
lurching
along
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
sat
before
the
dense
coal
fire
and
watched
it
all
aglow
*punct* ,
full
of
its
tormented
flaming
life
*punct* ;
and
i
have
seen
it
wane
at
last
*punct* ,
down
*punct* ,
down
*punct* ,
to
dumbest
dust
*punct* .
*break*
old
man
of
oceans
*punct* !
*break*
of
all
this
fiery
life
of
thine
*punct* ,
what
will
at
length
remain
but
one
little
heap
of
ashes
*punct* !
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
cried
stubb
*punct* ,
but
sea-coal
ashes
*punct* ,
mind

mr.
starbuck
*punct* ,
sea-coal
*punct* ,
not
your
common
charcoal
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
well
*punct* ;
i
heard
ahab
mutter
*punct* ,
here
some
one
thrusts
these
cards
into
these
old
hands
of
mine
*punct* ;
swears
that
i
must
play
them
*punct* ,
and
no
others
*punct* .
*break*
and
damn
me
*punct* ,
ahab

actest
right

game
*punct* ,
and
die

*break*
skies
the
most
effulgent
but
basket
the
deadliest
thunders
*punct* :
gorgeous
cuba

tornadoes
that
never
swept
tame
northern
lands
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
it
is
*punct* ,
that
in
these
resplendent
japanese
seas
the
mariner
encounters
the
direst
of
all
storms
*punct* ,
the
typhoon
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
sometimes
burst
from
out
that
cloudless
sky
*punct* ,
like
an
exploding
bomb
upon
a
dazed
and
sleepy
town
*punct* .
*break*
towards
evening
of
that
day
*punct* ,
the
pequod
was
torn
of
her
canvas
*punct* ,
and
bare-poled
was
left
to
fight
a
typhoon
which
had
struck
her
directly
ahead
*punct* .
*break*
holding
by
a
shroud
*punct* ,
starbuck
was
standing
on
the
quarter-deck
*punct* ;
at
every
flash
of
the
lightning
glancing
aloft
*punct* ,
to
see
what
additional
disaster
might
have
befallen
the
intricate
hamper
there
*punct* ;
while
stubb
and
flask
were
directing
the
men
in
the
higher
hoisting
and
firmer
lashing
of
the
boats
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
their
pains
seemed
naught
*punct* .
*break*
though
lifted
to
the
very
top
of
the
cranes
*punct* ,
the
windward
quarter
boat
*punct* ,
ahab's
*punct* ,
did
not
escape
*punct* .
*break*
a
great
rolling
sea
*punct* ,
dashing
high
up
against
the
reeling
ship's
high
tetering
side
*punct* ,
stove
in
the
boat's
bottom
at
the
stern
*punct* ,
and
left
it
again
*punct* ,
all
dripping
through
like
a
sieve

*break*
bad
work

bad
work
*punct* !
*break*
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ,

you
see

mr.
starbuck
*punct* ,
a
wave
has
such
a
great
long
start
before
it
leaps
*punct* ,
all
round
the
world
it
runs
*punct* ,
and
then
comes
the
spring
*punct* !
*break*
but
as
for
me
*punct* ,
all
the
start
i
have
to
meet
it
*punct* ,
is
just
across
the
deck
here
*punct* .
*break*
but
never
mind
*punct* ;
it's
all
in
fun
*punct* :
so
the
old
song
says;
*punct* ,
sings.
*punct* ,

jolly

cried
starbuck
*punct* ,
seizing
stubb
by
the
shoulder
*punct* ,
and
pointing
his
hand
towards
the
weather
bow
*punct* ,
markest

heedless

*break*
the
gale
that
now
hammers
at
us
to
stave

*break*
yonder
*punct* ,

all

blackness
of
doom

to
leeward
*punct* ,
homeward
*punct* ,
i
see
it
lightens
up
there
*punct* ;
but
not
with
the
lightning
*punct* .
*break*
at
that
moment
in
one
of
the
intervals
of
profound
darkness
*punct* ,
following
the
flashes
*punct* ,
a
voice
was
heard
at
his
side
*punct* ;
and
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
volley
of
thunder
peals
rolled
overhead
*punct* .
*break*
said
ahab
*punct* ,
groping
his
way
along
the
bulwarks
to
his
pivot-hole
*punct* ;
but
suddenly
finding
his
path
made
plain
to
him
by
elbowed
lances
of
fire
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
as
the
lightning
rod
to

off

so
the
kindred
rod
which

cried
starbuck
to

admonished
to
vigilance
by
the
vivid
lightning
that
had
just
been
darting
flambeaux

to
light
ahab
to

here

all
the
yard-arms
were
tipped
with

touched
at

tri-pointed
lightning-rod-end

three
tapering
white
flames
*punct* ,

of
the
three
tall
masts
was
silently
burning
in
that
sulphurous
air
*punct* ,
like
three
gigantic
wax
tapers
before
an
altar
*punct* .
*break*
blast
the
boat
*punct* !
*break*
let
it
go
*punct* !
*break*
cried
stubb
at
this
instant
*punct* ,
as
a
swashing
sea
heaved
up
under
his
own
little
craft
*punct* ,
so
that
its
gunwale
violently
jammed
his
hand
*punct* ,
as
he
was
passing
a
lashing
*punct* .
*break*
blast
it!
*punct* ,
but
slipping
backward
on
the
deck
*punct* ,
his
uplifted
eyes
caught
the
flames
*punct* ;
and
immediately
shifting
his
tone
*punct* ,
he
cried
*punct* ,
the
corpusants
have
mercy
on
us
all
*punct* !
*break*
to
sailors
*punct* ,
oaths
are
household
words
*punct* ;
they
will
swear
in
the
trance
of
the
calm
*punct* ,
and
in
the
teeth
of
the
tempest
*punct* ;
they
will
imprecate
curses
from
the
topsail-yard-arms
*punct* ,
when
most
they
teter
over
to
a
seething
sea
*punct* ;
but
in
all
my
voyagings
*punct* ,
seldom
have
i
heard
a
common
oath
when
god's
burning
finger
has
been
laid
on
the
ship
*punct* ;
when
his
mene
*punct* ,
mene
*punct* ,
tekel
upharsin
has
been
woven
into
the
shrouds
and
the
cordage
*punct* .
*break*
while
this
pallidness
was
burning
aloft
*punct* ,
few
words
were
heard
from
the
enchanted
crew
*punct* ;
who
in
one
thick
cluster
stood
on
the
forecastle
*punct* ,
all
their
eyes
gleaming
in
that
pale
phosphorescence
*punct* ,
like
a
far
away
constellation
of
stars
*punct* .
*break*
relieved
against
the
ghostly
light
*punct* ,
the
gigantic
jet
negro
*punct* ,
daggoo
*punct* ,
loomed
up
to
thrice
his
real
stature
*punct* ,
and
seemed
the
black
cloud
from
which
the
thunder
had
come
*punct* .
*break*
the
tableau
all
waned
at
last
with
the
pallidness
aloft
*punct* ;
and
once
more
the
pequod
and
every
soul
on
her
decks
were
wrapped
in
a
pall
*punct* .
*break*
a
moment
or
two
passed
*punct* ,
when
starbuck
*punct* ,
going
forward
*punct* ,
pushed
against
some
one
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
stubb
*punct* .
*break*
what
thinkest
thou
now
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ;
i
heard
thy
cry
*punct* ;
it
was
not
the
same
in
the
song
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
it
wasn't
*punct* ;
i
said
the
corpusants
have
mercy
on
us
all
*punct* ;
and
i
hope
they
will
*punct* ,
still
*punct* .
*break*
but
do
they
only
have
mercy
on
long
faces?
*punct* ,
have
they
no
bowels
for
a
laugh
*punct* ?
*break*
and
look
ye
*punct* ,
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ,
but
it's
too
dark
to
look
*punct* .
*break*
hear
me
*punct* ,
then
*punct* :
i
take
that
mast-head
flame
we
saw
for
a
sign
of
good
luck
*punct* ;
for
those
masts
are
rooted
in
a
hold
that
is
going
to
be
chock
a
block
with
sperm-oil
*punct* ,
d'ye
see
*punct* ;
and
so
*punct* ,
all
that
sperm
will
work
up
into
the
masts
*punct* ,
like
sap
in
a
tree
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
our
three
masts
will
yet
be
as
three
spermaceti
candles
*punct* ,
that's
the
good
promise
we
saw
*punct* .
*break*
at
that
moment
starbuck
caught
sight
of
stubb's
face
slowly
beginning
to
glimmer
into
sight
*punct* .
*break*
glancing
upwards
*punct* ,
he
cried
*punct* :
see
*punct* !
*break*
and
once
more
the
high
tapering
flames
were
beheld
with
what
seemed
redoubled
supernaturalness
in
their
pallor
*punct* .
*break*
the
corpusants
have
mercy
on
us
all
*punct* ,
cried
stubb
*punct* ,
again
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
base
of
the
mainmast
*punct* ,
full
beneath
the
doubloon
and
the
flame
*punct* ,
the
parsee
was
kneeling
in
ahab's
front
*punct* ,
but
with
his
head
bowed
away
from
him
*punct* ;
while
near
by
*punct* ,
from
the
arched
and
overhanging
rigging
*punct* ,
where
they
had
just
been
engaged
securing
a
spar
*punct* ,
a
number
of
the
seamen
*punct* ,
arrested
by
the
glare
*punct* ,
now
cohered
together
*punct* ,
and
hung
pendulous
*punct* ,
like
a
knot
of
numbed
wasps
from
a
drooping
*punct* ,
orchard
twig
*punct* .
*break*
in
various
enchanted
attitudes
*punct* ,
like
the
standing
*punct* ,
or
stepping
*punct* ,
or
running
skeletons
in
herculaneum
*punct* ,
others
remained
rooted
to
the
deck
*punct* ;
but
all
their
eyes
upcast
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
men
*punct* !
*break*
look
up
at
it
*punct* ;
mark
it
well
*punct* ;
the
white
flame
but
lights
the
way
to
the
white
whale
*punct* !
*break*
hand
me
those
main-mast
links
there
*punct* ;
i
would
fain
feel
this
pulse
*punct* ,
and
let
mine
beat
against
it
*punct* ;
blood
against
fire
*punct* !
*break*
thou
clear
spirit
of
clear
fire
*punct* ,
whom
on
these
seas
i
as
persian
once
did
worship
*punct* ,
till
in
the
sacramental
act
so
burned
by
thee
*punct* ,
that
to
this
hour
i
bear
the
scar
*punct* ;
i
now
know
thee
*punct* ,
thou
clear
spirit
*punct* ,
and
i
now
know
that
thy
right
worship
is
defiance
*punct* .
*break*
to
neither
love
nor
reverence
wilt
thou
be
kind
*punct* ;
and
e'en
for
hate
thou
canst
but
kill
*punct* ;
and
all
are
killed
*punct* .
*break*
no
fearless
fool
now
fronts
thee
*punct* .
*break*
i
own
thy
speechless
*punct* ,
placeless
power
*punct* ;
but
to
the
last
gasp
of
my
earthquake
life
will
dispute
its
unconditional
*punct* ,
unintegral
mastery
in
me
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
midst
of
the
personified
impersonal
*punct* ,
a
personality
stands
here
*punct* .
*break*
though
but
a
point
at
best
*punct* ;
whencesoe'er
i
came
*punct* ;
wheresoe'er
i
go
*punct* ;
yet
while
i
earthly
live
*punct* ,
the
queenly
personality
lives
in
me
*punct* ,
and
feels
her
royal
rights
*punct* .
*break*
but
war
is
pain
*punct* ,
and
hate
is
woe
*punct* .
*break*
come
in
thy
lowest
form
of
love
*punct* ,
and
i
will
kneel
and
kiss
thee
*punct* ;
but
at
thy
highest
*punct* ,
come
as
mere
supernal
power
*punct* ;
and
though
thou
launchest
navies
of
full-freighted
worlds
*punct* ,
there's
that
in
here
that
still
remains
indifferent
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
thou
clear
spirit
*punct* ,
of
thy
fire
thou
madest
me
*punct* ,
and
like
a
true
child
of
fire
*punct* ,
i
breathe
it
back
to
thee
*punct* .
*break*
[sudden
*punct* ,
repeated
flashes
of
lightning
*punct* ;
the
nine
flames
leap
lengthwise
to
thrice
their
previous
height
*punct* ;
ahab
*punct* ,
with
the
rest
*punct* ,
closes
his
eyes
*punct* ,
his
right
hand
pressed
hard
upon
them.]
i
own
thy
speechless
*punct* ,
placeless
power
*punct* ;
said
i
not
so
*punct* ?
*break*
nor
was
it
wrung
from
me
*punct* ;
nor
do
i
now
drop
these
links
*punct* .
*break*
thou
canst
blind
*punct* ;
but
i
can
then
grope
*punct* .
*break*
thou
canst
consume
*punct* ;
but
i
can
then
be
ashes
*punct* .
*break*
take
the
homage
of
these
poor
eyes
*punct* ,
and
shutter-hands
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
not
take
it
*punct* .
*break*
the
lightning
flashes
through
my
skull
*punct* ;
mine
eye-balls
ache
and
ache
*punct* ;
my
whole
beaten
brain
seems
as
beheaded
*punct* ,
and
rolling
on
some
stunning
ground
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
yet
blindfold
*punct* ,
yet
will
i
talk
to
thee
*punct* .
*break*
light
though
thou
be
*punct* ,
thou
leapest
out
of
darkness
*punct* ;
but
i
am
darkness
leaping
out
of
light
*punct* ,
leaping
out
of
thee
*punct* !
*break*
the
javelins
cease
*punct* ;
open
eyes

or
not
*punct* ?
*break*
there
burn
the
flames
*punct* !
*break*
oh

thou
magnanimous
*punct* !
*break*
now
do
i
glory
in
my
genealogy
*punct* .
*break*
but
thou
art
but
my
fiery
father
*punct* ;
my
sweet
mother
*punct* ,
i
know
not
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
cruel
*punct* !
*break*
there
lies
my
puzzle
*punct* ;
but
thine
is
greater
*punct* .
*break*
thou
knowest
not
how
came
ye
*punct* ,
hence
callest
thyself
unbegotten
*punct* ;
certainly
knowest
not
thy
beginning
*punct* ,
hence
callest
thyself
unbegun
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
that
of
me
*punct* ,
which
thou
knowest
not
of
thyself
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
thou
omnipotent
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
some
unsuffusing
thing
beyond
thee
*punct* ,
thou
clear
spirit
*punct* ,
to
whom
all
thy
eternity
is
but
time
*punct* ,
all
thy
creativeness
mechanical
*punct* .
*break*
through
thee
*punct* ,
thy
flaming
self
*punct* ,
my
scorched
eyes
do
dimly
see
it
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
thou
foundling
fire
*punct* ,
thou
hermit
immemorial

thou
too
hast
thy
incommunicable
riddle
*punct* ,
thy
unparticipated
grief
*punct* .
*break*
here
again
with
haughty
agony
*punct* ,
i
read
my
sire
*punct* .
*break*
leap
up
*punct* ,
and
lick
the
sky
*punct* !
*break*
i
leap
with
thee
*punct* ;
i
burn
with
thee
*punct* ;
would
fain
be
welded
with
thee
*punct* ;
defyingly
i
worship
thee
*punct* !
*break*
cried
starbuck
*punct* ,
look
at
thy
boat
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* !
*break*
ahab's
harpoon
*punct* ,
the
one
forged
at
perth's
fire
*punct* ,
remained
firmly
lashed
in
its
conspicuous
crotch
*punct* ,
so
that
it
projected
beyond
his
whale-boat's
bow
*punct* ;
but
the
sea
that
had
stove
its
bottom
had
caused
the
loose
leather
sheath
to
drop
off
*punct* ;
and
from
the
keen
steel
barb
there
now
came
a
levelled
flame
of
pale
*punct* ,
forked
fire
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
silent
harpoon
burned
there
like
a
serpent's
tongue
*punct* ,
starbuck
grasped
ahab
by
the
arm
*punct* ,
god
*punct* ,
god
is
against
thee
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ;
forbear
*punct* !
*break*
t'is
an
ill
voyage
*punct* !
*break*
ill
begun
*punct* ,
ill
continued
*punct* ;
let
me
square
the
yards
*punct* ,
while
we
may
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ,
and
make
a
fair
wind
of
it
homewards
*punct* ,
to
go
on
a
better
voyage
than
this
*punct* .
*break*
overhearing
starbuck
*punct* ,
the
panic-stricken
crew
instantly
ran
to
the
braces
*punct* ,
though
not
a
sail
was
left
aloft
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
moment
all
the
aghast
mate's
thoughts
seemed
theirs
*punct* ;
they
raised
a
half
mutinous
cry
*punct* .
*break*
but
dashing
the
rattling
lightning
links
to
the
deck
*punct* ,
and
snatching
the
burning
harpoon
*punct* ,
ahab
waved
it
like
a
torch
among
them
*punct* ;
swearing
to
transfix
with
it
the
first
sailor
that
but
cast
loose
a
rope's
end
*punct* .
*break*
petrified
by
his
aspect
*punct* ,
and
still
more
shrinking
from
the
fiery
dart
that
he
held
*punct* ,
the
men
fell
back
in
dismay
*punct* ,
and
ahab
again
spoke:
*punct* ,
all
your
oaths
to
hunt
the
white
whale
are
as
binding
as
mine
*punct* ;
and
heart
*punct* ,
soul
*punct* ,
and
body
*punct* ,
lungs
and
life
*punct* ,
old
ahab
is
bound
*punct* .
*break*
and
with
one
blast
of
his
breath
he
extinguished
the
flame
*punct* .
*break*
starbuck
approaching
him
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
send
down
the
main-top-sail
yard
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
the
band
is
working
loose
*punct* ,
and
the
lee
lift
is
half-stranded
*punct* .
*break*
shall
i
strike
it
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
strike
nothing
*punct* ;
lash
it
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
had
sky-sail
poles
*punct* ,
i'd
sway
them
up
now
*punct* .

strike

stir
nothing

but
lash
everything
*punct* .
*break*
the
wind
rises
*punct* ,
but
it
has
not
got
up
to
my
table-lands
yet
*punct* .
*break*
quick
*punct* ,
and
see
to
it.
*punct* ,

masts

keels
*punct* !
*break*
he
takes
me
for
the
hunch-backed
skipper
of
some
coasting
smack
*punct* .
*break*
send
down
my
main-top-sail
yard
*punct* !
*break*
ho
*punct* ,
gluepots
*punct* !
*break*
loftiest
trucks
were
made
for
wildest
winds
*punct* ,
and
this
brain-truck
of
mine
now
sails
amid
the
cloud-scud
*punct* .
*break*
shall
i
strike
that
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
none
but
cowards
send
down
their
brain-trucks
in
tempest
time
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
hooroosh
aloft
there
*punct* !
*break*
i
would
e'en
take
it
for
sublime

did
i
not
know
that
the
colic
is
a
noisy
malady
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
take
medicine
*punct* ,
take
medicine
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ;
you
may
pound
that
knot
there
as
much
as
you
please
*punct* ,
but
you
will
never
pound
into
me
what
you
were
just
now
saying
*punct* .
*break*
and
how
long
ago
is
it
since
you
said
the
very
contrary
*punct* ?
*break*
didn't
you
once
say
that
whatever
ship
ahab
sails
in
*punct* ,
that
ship
should
pay
something
extra
on
its
insurance
policy
*punct* ,
just
as
though
it
were
loaded
with
powder
barrels
aft
and
boxes
of
lucifers
forward
*punct* ?
*break*
stop
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ;
didn't
you
say
so
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
suppose
i
did
*punct* ?
*break*
i've
part
changed
my
flesh
since
that
time
*punct* ,
why
not
my
mind
*punct* ?
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
supposing
we
are
loaded
with
powder
barrels
aft
and
lucifers
forward
*punct* ;
how
the
devil
could
the
lucifers
get
afire
in
this
drenching
spray
here
*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
my
little
man
*punct* ,
you
have
pretty
red
hair
*punct* ,
but
you
couldn't
get
afire
now
*punct* .
*break*
shake
yourself
*punct* ;
you're
aquarius
*punct* ,
or
the
water-bearer
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ;
might
fill
pitchers
at
your
coat
collar
*punct* .
*break*
don't
you
see
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
that
for
these
extra
risks
the
marine
insurance
companies
have
extra
guarantees
*punct* ?
*break*
here
are
hydrants
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* .
*break*
but
hark
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
and
i'll
answer
ye
the
other
thing
*punct* .
*break*
first
take
your
leg
off
from
the
crown
of
the
anchor
here
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
so
i
can
pass
the
rope
*punct* ;
now
listen
*punct* .
*break*
what's
the
mighty
difference
between
holding
a
mast's
lightning-rod
in
the
storm
*punct* ,
and
standing
close
by
a
mast
that
hasn't
got
any
lightning-rod
at
all
in
a
storm
*punct* ?
*break*
don't
you
see
*punct* ,
you
timber-head
*punct* ,
that
no
harm
can
come
to
the
holder
of
the
rod
*punct* ,
unless
the
mast
is
first
struck
*punct* ?
*break*
what
are
you
talking
about
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ?
*break*
not
one
ship
in
a
hundred
carries
rods
*punct* ,
and
ahab,
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
and
all
of
us,
*punct* ,
were
in
no
more
danger
then
*punct* ,
in
my
poor
opinion
*punct* ,
than
all
the
crews
in
ten
thousand
ships
now
sailing
the
seas
*punct* .
*break*
why
don't
ye
be
sensible
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
easy
to
be
sensible
*punct* ;
why
don't
ye
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ?
*break*
any
man
with
half
an
eye
can
be
sensible
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
that
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* .
*break*
you
sometimes
find
it
rather
hard
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
when
a
fellow's
soaked
through
*punct* ,
it's
hard
to
be
sensible
*punct* ,
that's
a
fact
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
am
about
drenched
with
this
spray
*punct* .
*break*
never
mind
*punct* ;
catch
the
turn
there
*punct* ,
and
pass
it
*punct* .
*break*
seems
to
me
we
are
lashing
down
these
anchors
now
as
if
they
were
never
going
to
be
used
again
*punct* .
*break*
tying
these
two
anchors
here
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ,
seems
like
tying
a
man's
hands
behind
him
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
big
generous
hands
they
are
*punct* ,
to
be
sure
*punct* .
*break*
these
are
your
iron
fists
*punct* ,
hey
*punct* ?
*break*
what
a
hold
they
have
*punct* ,
too
*punct* !
*break*
i
wonder
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ,
whether
the
world
is
anchored
anywhere
*punct* ;
if
she
is
*punct* ,
she
swings
with
an
uncommon
long
cable
*punct* ,
though
*punct* .
*break*
there
*punct* ,
hammer
that
knot
down
*punct* ,
and
we've
done
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ;
next
to
touching
land
*punct* ,
lighting
on
deck
is
the
most
satisfactory
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
*punct* ,
just
wring
out
my
jacket
skirts
*punct* ,
will
ye
*punct* ?
*break*
they
laugh
at
long-togs
so
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ;
but
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
a
long
tailed
coat
ought
always
to
be
worn
in
all
storms
afloat
*punct* .
*break*
the
tails
tapering
down
that
way
*punct* ,
serve
to
carry
off
the
water
*punct* ,
d'ye
see
*punct* .
*break*
same
with
cocked
hats
*punct* ;
the
cocks
form
gable-end
eave-troughs
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* .
*break*
no
more
monkey-jackets
and
tarpaulins
for
me
*punct* ;
i
must
mount
a
swallow-tail
*punct* ,
and
drive
down
a
beaver
*punct* ;
so
*punct* .
*break*
there
goes
my
tarpaulin
overboard
*punct* ;
lord
*punct* ,
lord
*punct* ,
that
the
winds
that
come
from
heaven
should
be
so
unmannerly
*punct* !
*break*
um
*punct* ,
um
*punct* ,
um
*punct* .
*break*
stop
that
thunder
*punct* !
*break*
plenty
too
much
thunder
up
here
*punct* .
*break*
what's
the
use
of
thunder
*punct* ?
*break*
um
*punct* ,
um
*punct* ,
um
*punct* .
*break*
we
don't
want
thunder
*punct* ;
we
want
rum
*punct* ;
give
us
a
glass
of
rum
*punct* .
*break*
um
*punct* ,
um
*punct* ,
um
*punct* !
*break*
in
a
severe
gale
like
this
*punct* ,
while
the
ship
is
but
a
tossed
shuttle-cock
to
the
blast
*punct* ,
it
is
by
no
means
uncommon
to
see
the
needles
in
the
compasses
*punct* ,
at
intervals
*punct* ,
go
round
and
round
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
thus
with
the
pequod's
*punct* ;
at
almost
every
shock
the
helmsman
had
not
failed
to
notice
the
whirling
velocity
with
which
they
revolved
upon
the
cards
*punct* ;
it
is
a
sight
that
hardly
any
one
can
behold
without
some
sort
of
unwonted
emotion
*punct* .
*break*
the
three
corresponding
new
sails
were
now
bent
and
reefed
*punct* ,
and
a
storm-trysail
was
set
further
aft
*punct* ;
so
that
the
ship
soon
went
through
the
water
with
some
precision
again
*punct* ;
and
the
course
*punct* ,
for
the
present
*punct* ,
east-south-east
*punct* ,
which
he
was
to
steer
*punct* ,
if
practicable
*punct* ,
was
once
more
given
to
the
helmsman
*punct* .
*break*
for
during
the
violence
of
the
gale
*punct* ,
he
had
only
steered
according
to
its
vicissitudes
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
he
was
now
bringing
the
ship
as
near
her
course
as
possible
*punct* ,
watching
the
compass
meanwhile
*punct* ,
lo
*punct* !
*break*
a
good
sign
*punct* !
*break*
the
wind
seemed
coming
round
astern
*punct* ;
aye
*punct* !
*break*
the
foul
breeze
became
fair
*punct* !
*break*
instantly
the
yards
were
squared
*punct* ,
to
the
lively
song
of
ho
*punct* !
*break*
the
fair
wind
*punct* !
*break*
oh-he-yo
*punct* ,
cheerly
*punct* ,
men
*punct* !
*break*
the
crew
singing
for
joy
*punct* ,
that
so
promising
an
event
should
so
soon
have
falsified
the
evil
portents
preceding
it
*punct* .
*break*
in
compliance
with
the
standing
order
of
his
commander
*punct* ,
to
report
immediately
*punct* ,
and
at
any
one
of
the
twenty-four
hours
*punct* ,
any
decided
change
in
the
affairs
of
the
deck,
*punct* ,
starbuck
had
no
sooner
trimmed
the
yards
to
the
breeze
*punct* ,
however
reluctantly
and
gloomily,
*punct* ,
than
he
mechanically
went
below
to
apprise
captain
ahab
of
the
circumstance
*punct* .
*break*
ere
knocking
at
his
state-room
*punct* ,
he
involuntarily
paused
before
it
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
the
cabin
lamp
*punct* ,
taking
long
swings
this
way
and
that
*punct* ,
was
burning
fitfully
*punct* ,
and
casting
fitful
shadows
upon
the
old
man's
bolted
door,
*punct* ,
a
thin
one
*punct* ,
with
fixed
blinds
inserted
*punct* ,
in
place
of
upper
panels
*punct* .
*break*
the
isolated
subterraneousness
of
the
cabin
made
a
certain
humming
silence
to
reign
there
*punct* ,
though
it
was
hooped
round
by
all
the
roar
of
the
elements
*punct* .
*break*
the
loaded
muskets
in
the
rack
were
shiningly
revealed
*punct* ,
as
they
stood
upright
against
the
forward
bulkhead
*punct* .
*break*
starbuck
was
an
honest
*punct* ,
upright
man
*punct* ;
but
out
of
starbuck's
heart
*punct* ,
at
that
instant
when
he
saw
the
muskets
*punct* ,
there
strangely
evolved
an
evil
thought
*punct* ;
but
so
blent
with
its
neutral
or
good
accompaniments
that
for
the
instant
he
hardly
knew
it
for
itself
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
have
shot
me
once
*punct* ,
he
murmured
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
there's
the
very
musket
that
he
pointed
at
me;
*punct* ,
that
one
with
the
studded
stock
*punct* ;
let
me
touch
it
*punct* ,
lift
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
see
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ;
and
powder
in
the
pan;
*punct* ,
that's
not
good
*punct* .
*break*
best
spill
it?
*punct* ,
wait
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
cure
myself
of
this
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
hold
the
musket
boldly
while
i
think.
*punct* ,
i
come
to
report
a
fair
wind
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
fair
*punct* ?
*break*
fair
for
death
and
doom,
*punct* ,
that's
fair
for
moby
dick
*punct* .
*break*
it's
a
fair
wind
that's
only
fair
for
that
accursed
fish.
*punct* ,
the
very
tube
he
pointed
at
me!
*punct* ,
the
very
one
*punct* ;
this
one
*punct* ,
i
hold
it
here
*punct* ;
he
would
have
killed
me
with
the
very
thing
i
handle
now.
*punct* ,
aye
and
he
would
fain
kill
all
his
crew
*punct* .
*break*
does
he
not
say
he
will
not
strike
his
spars
to
any
gale
*punct* ?
*break*
has
he
not
dashed
his
heavenly
quadrant
*punct* ?
*break*
and
in
these
same
perilous
seas
*punct* ,
gropes
he
not
his
way
by
mere
dead
reckoning
of
the
error-abounding
log
*punct* ?
*break*
and
in
this
very
typhoon
*punct* ,
did
he
not
swear
that
he
would
have
no
lightning-rods
*punct* ?
*break*
but
shall
this
crazed
old
man
be
tamely
suffered
to
drag
a
whole
ship's
company
down
to
doom
with
him?
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
it
would
make
him
the
wilful
murderer
of
thirty
men
and
more
*punct* ,
if
this
ship
come
to
any
deadly
harm
*punct* ;
and
come
to
deadly
harm
*punct* ,
my
soul
swears
this
ship
will
*punct* ,
if
ahab
have
his
way
*punct* .
*break*
if
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
he
were
this
instant
*punct* ,
put
aside
*punct* ,
that
crime
would
not
be
his
*punct* .
*break*
is
he
muttering
in
his
sleep
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
just
there,
*punct* ,
in
there
*punct* ,
he's
sleeping
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
but
still
alive
*punct* ,
and
soon
awake
again
*punct* .
*break*
i
can't
withstand
thee
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* .
*break*
not
reasoning
*punct* ;
not
remonstrance
*punct* ;
not
entreaty
wilt
thou
hearken
to
*punct* ;
all
this
thou
scornest
*punct* .
*break*
flat
obedience
to
thy
own
flat
commands
*punct* ,
this
is
all
thou
breathest
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
and
say'st
the
men
have
vow'd
thy
vow
*punct* ;
say'st
all
of
us
are
ahabs
*punct* .
*break*
great
god
forbid!
*punct* ,
but
is
there
no
other
way
*punct* ?
*break*
no
lawful
way?
*punct* ,
make
him
a
prisoner
to
be
taken
home
*punct* ?
*break*
hope
to
wrest
this
old
man's
living
power
from
his
own
living
hands
*punct* ?
*break*
only
a
fool
would
try
it
*punct* .
*break*
say
he
were
pinioned
even
*punct* ;
knotted
all
over
with
ropes
and
hawsers
*punct* ;
chained
down
to
ring-bolts
on
this
cabin
floor
*punct* ;
he
would
be
more
hideous
than
a
caged
tiger
*punct* ,
then
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
endure
the
sight
*punct* ;
could
not
possibly
fly
his
howlings
*punct* ;
all
comfort
*punct* ,
sleep
itself
*punct* ,
inestimable
reason
would
leave
me
on
the
long
intolerable
voyage
*punct* .
*break*
what
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
remains
*punct* ?
*break*
the
land
is
hundreds
of
leagues
away
*punct* ,
and
locked
japan
the
nearest
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
level
*punct* ,
ahab's
hammock
swings
within
*punct* ;
his
head
this
way
*punct* .
*break*
a
touch
*punct* ,
and
starbuck
may
survive
to
hug
his
wife
and
child
again.
*punct* ,
oh
mary
*punct* !
*break*
mary!
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* !
*break*
boy!
*punct* ,
but
if
i
wake
thee
not
to
death
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ,
who
can
tell
to
what
unsounded
deeps
starbuck's
body
this
day
week
may
sink
*punct* ,
with
all
the
crew
*punct* !
*break*
great
god
*punct* ,
where
art
thou
*punct* ?
*break*
shall
i?
*punct* ,
the
wind
has
gone
down
and
shifted
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
the
fore
and
main
topsails
are
reefed
and
set
*punct* ;
she
heads
her
course
*punct* .
*break*
oh
moby
dick
*punct* ,
i
clutch
thy
heart
at
last
*punct* !
*break*
such
were
the
sounds
that
now
came
hurtling
from
out
the
old
man's
tormented
sleep
*punct* ,
as
if
starbuck's
voice
had
caused
the
long
dumb
dream
to
speak
*punct* .
*break*
the
yet
levelled
musket
shook
like
a
drunkard's
arm
against
the
panel
*punct* ;
starbuck
seemed
wrestling
with
an
angel
*punct* ;
but
turning
from
the
door
*punct* ,
he
placed
the
death-tube
in
its
rack
*punct* ,
and
left
the
place
*punct* .
*break*
he's
too
sound
asleep
*punct* ,
mr
stubb
*punct* ;
go
thou
down
*punct* ,
and
wake
him
*punct* ,
and
tell
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
see
to
the
deck
here
*punct* .
*break*
the
strong
*punct* ,
unstaggering
breeze
abounded
so
*punct* ,
that
sky
and
air
seemed
vast
outbellying
sails
*punct* ;
the
whole
world
boomed
before
the
wind
*punct* .
*break*
emblazonings
*punct* ,
as
of
crowned
babylonian
kings
and
queens
*punct* ,
reigned
over
everything
*punct* .
*break*
the
sea
was
as
a
crucible
of
molten
gold
*punct* ,
that
bubblingly
leaps
with
light
and
heat
*punct* .
*break*
long
maintaining
an
enchanted
silence
*punct* ,
ahab
stood
apart
*punct* ;
and
every
time
the
tetering
ship
loweringly
pitched
down
her
bowsprit
*punct* ,
he
turned
to
eye
the
bright
sun's
rays
produced
ahead
*punct* ;
and
when
she
profoundly
settled
by
the
stern
*punct* ,
he
turned
behind
*punct* ,
and
saw
the
sun's
rearward
place
*punct* ,
and
how
the
same
yellow
rays
were
blending
with
his
undeviating
wake
*punct* .
*break*
ha
*punct* ,
ha
*punct* ,
my
ship
*punct* !
*break*
thou
mightest
well
be
taken
now
for
the
sea-chariot
of
the
sun
*punct* .
*break*
ho
*punct* ,
ho
*punct* !
*break*
all
ye
nations
before
my
prow
*punct* ,
i
bring
the
sun
to
ye
*punct* !
*break*
yoke
on
the
further
billows
*punct* ;
hallo
*punct* !
*break*
a
tandem
*punct* ,
i
drive
the
sea
*punct* !
*break*
but
suddenly
reined
back
by
some
counter
thought
*punct* ,
he
hurried
towards
the
helm
*punct* ,
huskily
demanding
how
the
ship
was
heading
*punct* .
*break*
east-sou-east
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
the
frightened
steersman
*punct* .
*break*
smiting
him
with
his
clenched
fist
*punct* .
*break*
heading
east
at
this
hour
in
the
morning
*punct* ,
and
the
sun
astern
*punct* ?
*break*
upon
this
every
soul
was
confounded
*punct* ;
for
the
phenomenon
just
then
observed
by
ahab
had
unaccountably
escaped
every
one
else
*punct* ;
but
its
very
blinding
palpableness
must
have
been
the
cause
*punct* .
*break*
thrusting
his
head
half
way
into
the
binnacle
*punct* ,
ahab
caught
one
glimpse
of
the
compasses
*punct* ;
his
uplifted
arm
slowly
fell
*punct* ;
for
a
moment
he
almost
seemed
to
stagger
*punct* .
*break*
standing
behind
him
starbuck
looked
*punct* ,
and
lo
*punct* !
*break*
the
two
compasses
pointed
east
*punct* ,
and
the
pequod
was
as
infallibly
going
west
*punct* .
*break*
but
ere
the
first
wild
alarm
could
get
out
abroad
among
the
crew
*punct* ,
the
old
man
with
a
rigid
laugh
exclaimed
*punct* ,
i
have
it
*punct* !
*break*
it
has
happened
before
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ,
last
night's
thunder
turned
our
compasses
*punct* ,
that's
all
*punct* .
*break*
thou
hast
before
now
heard
of
such
a
thing
*punct* ,
i
take
it
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ;
but
never
before
has
it
happened
to
me
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
the
pale
mate
*punct* ,
gloomily
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
it
must
needs
be
said
*punct* ,
that
accidents
like
this
have
in
more
than
one
case
occurred
to
ships
in
violent
storms
*punct* .
*break*
in
instances
where
the
lightning
has
actually
struck
the
vessel
*punct* ,
so
as
to
smite
down
some
of
the
spars
and
rigging
*punct* ,
the
effect
upon
the
needle
has
at
times
been
still
more
fatal
*punct* ;
all
its
loadstone
virtue
being
annihilated
*punct* ,
so
that
the
before
magnetic
steel
was
of
no
more
use
than
an
old
wife's
knitting
needle
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
either
case
*punct* ,
the
needle
never
again
*punct* ,
of
itself
*punct* ,
recovers
the
original
virtue
thus
marred
or
lost
*punct* ;
and
if
the
binnacle
compasses
be
affected
*punct* ,
the
same
fate
reaches
all
the
others
that
may
be
in
the
ship
*punct* ;
even
were
the
lowermost
one
inserted
into
the
kelson
*punct* .
*break*
deliberately
standing
before
the
binnacle
*punct* ,
and
eyeing
the
transpointed
compasses
*punct* ,
the
old
man
*punct* ,
with
the
sharp
of
his
extended
hand
*punct* ,
now
took
the
precise
bearing
of
the
sun
*punct* ,
and
satisfied
that
the
needles
were
exactly
inverted
*punct* ,
shouted
out
his
orders
for
the
ship's
course
to
be
changed
accordingly
*punct* .
*break*
the
yards
were
hard
up
*punct* ;
and
once
more
the
pequod
thrust
her
undaunted
bows
into
the
opposing
wind
*punct* ,
for
the
supposed
fair
one
had
only
been
juggling
her
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
*punct* ,
whatever
were
his
own
secret
thoughts
*punct* ,
starbuck
said
nothing
*punct* ,
but
quietly
he
issued
all
requisite
orders
*punct* ;
while
stubb
and
flask
*punct* ,
who
in
some
small
degree
seemed
then
to
be
sharing
his
feelings
*punct* ,
likewise
unmurmuringly
acquiesced
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
the
men
*punct* ,
though
some
of
them
lowly
rumbled
*punct* ,
their
fear
of
ahab
was
greater
than
their
fear
of
fate
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
ever
before
*punct* ,
the
pagan
harpooneers
remained
almost
wholly
unimpressed
*punct* ;
or
if
impressed
*punct* ,
it
was
only
with
a
certain
magnetism
shot
into
their
congenial
hearts
from
inflexible
ahab's
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
space
the
old
man
walked
the
deck
in
rolling
reveries
*punct* .
*break*
but
chancing
to
slip
with
his
ivory
heel
*punct* ,
he
saw
the
crushed
copper
sight-tubes
of
the
quadrant
he
had
the
day
before
dashed
to
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
thou
poor
*punct* ,
proud
heaven-gazer
and
sun's
pilot
*punct* !
*break*
yesterday
i
wrecked
thee
*punct* ,
and
to-day
the
compasses
would
feign
have
wrecked
me
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ,
a
lance
without
a
pole
*punct* ;
a
top-maul
*punct* ,
and
the
smallest
of
the
sail-maker's
needles
*punct* .
*break*
accessory
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
to
the
impulse
dictating
the
thing
he
was
now
about
to
do
*punct* ,
were
certain
prudential
motives
*punct* ,
whose
object
might
have
been
to
revive
the
spirits
of
his
crew
by
a
stroke
of
his
subtile
skill
*punct* ,
in
a
matter
so
wondrous
as
that
of
the
inverted
compasses
*punct* .
*break*
besides
*punct* ,
the
old
man
well
knew
that
to
steer
by
transpointed
needles
*punct* ,
though
clumsily
practicable
*punct* ,
was
not
a
thing
to
be
passed
over
by
superstitious
sailors
*punct* ,
without
some
shudderings
and
evil
portents
*punct* .
*break*
men
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
steadily
turning
upon
the
crew
*punct* ,
as
the
mate
handed
him
the
things
he
had
demanded
*punct* ,
my
men
*punct* ,
the
thunder
turned
old
ahab's
needles
*punct* ;
but
out
of
this
bit
of
steel
ahab
can
make
one
of
his
own
*punct* ,
that
will
point
as
true
as
any
*punct* .
*break*
abashed
glances
of
servile
wonder
were
exchanged
by
the
sailors
*punct* ,
as
this
was
said
*punct* ;
and
with
fascinated
eyes
they
awaited
whatever
magic
might
follow
*punct* .
*break*
but
starbuck
looked
away
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
blow
from
the
top-maul
ahab
knocked
off
the
steel
head
of
the
lance
*punct* ,
and
then
handing
to
the
mate
the
long
iron
rod
remaining
*punct* ,
bade
him
hold
it
upright
*punct* ,
without
its
touching
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
with
the
maul
*punct* ,
after
repeatedly
smiting
the
upper
end
of
this
iron
rod
*punct* ,
he
placed
the
blunted
needle
endwise
on
the
top
of
it
*punct* ,
and
less
strongly
hammered
that
*punct* ,
several
times
*punct* ,
the
mate
still
holding
the
rod
as
before
*punct* .
*break*
then
going
through
some
small
strange
motions
with
it
*punct* ,
whether
indispensable
to
the
magnetizing
of
the
steel
*punct* ,
or
merely
intended
to
augment
the
awe
of
the
crew
*punct* ,
is
uncertain
*punct* ,
he
called
for
linen
thread
*punct* ;
and
moving
to
the
binnacle
*punct* ,
slipped
out
the
two
reversed
needles
there
*punct* ,
and
horizontally
suspended
the
sail-needle
by
its
middle
*punct* ,
over
one
of
the
compass-cards
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
*punct* ,
the
steel
went
round
and
round
*punct* ,
quivering
and
vibrating
at
either
end
*punct* ;
but
at
last
it
settled
to
its
place
*punct* ,
when
ahab
*punct* ,
who
had
been
intently
watching
for
this
result
*punct* ,
stepped
frankly
back
from
the
binnacle
*punct* ,
and
pointing
his
stretched
arm
towards
it
*punct* ,
exclaimed,
*punct* ,
look
ye
*punct* ,
for
yourselves
*punct* ,
if
ahab
be
not
the
lord
of
the
level
loadstone
*punct* !
*break*
the
sun
is
east
*punct* ,
and
that
compass
swears
it
*punct* !
*break*
owing
to
a
confident
reliance
upon
other
means
of
determining
the
vessel's
place
*punct* ,
some
merchantmen
*punct* ,
and
many
whalemen
*punct* ,
especially
when
cruising
*punct* ,
wholly
neglect
to
heave
the
log
*punct* ;
though
at
the
same
time
*punct* ,
and
frequently
more
for
form's
sake
than
anything
else
*punct* ,
regularly
putting
down
upon
the
customary
slate
the
course
steered
by
the
ship
*punct* ,
as
well
as
the
presumed
average
rate
of
progression
every
hour
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
been
thus
with
the
pequod
*punct* .
*break*
the
wooden
reel
and
angular
log
attached
hung
*punct* ,
long
untouched
*punct* ,
just
beneath
the
railing
of
the
after
bulwarks
*punct* .
*break*
rains
and
spray
had
damped
it
*punct* ;
the
sun
and
wind
had
warped
it
*punct* ;
all
the
elements
had
combined
to
rot
a
thing
that
hung
so
idly
*punct* .
*break*
but
heedless
of
all
this
*punct* ,
his
mood
seized
ahab
*punct* ,
as
he
happened
to
glance
upon
the
reel
*punct* ,
not
many
hours
after
the
magnet
scene
*punct* ,
and
he
remembered
how
his
quadrant
was
no
more
*punct* ,
and
recalled
his
frantic
oath
about
the
level
log
and
line
*punct* .
*break*
the
ship
was
sailing
plungingly
*punct* ;
astern
the
billows
rolled
in
riots
*punct* .
*break*
forward
*punct* ,
there
*punct* !
*break*
heave
the
log
*punct* !
*break*
two
seamen
came
*punct* .
*break*
the
golden-hued
tahitian
and
the
grizzly
manxman
*punct* .
*break*
take
the
reel
*punct* ,
one
of
ye
*punct* ,
i'll
heave
*punct* .
*break*
they
went
towards
the
extreme
stern
*punct* ,
on
the
ship's
lee
side
*punct* ,
where
the
deck
*punct* ,
with
the
oblique
energy
of
the
wind
*punct* ,
was
now
almost
dipping
into
the
creamy
*punct* ,
sidelong-rushing
sea
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
stood
before
him
*punct* ,
and
was
lightly
unwinding
some
thirty
or
forty
turns
to
form
a
preliminary
hand-coil
to
toss
overboard
*punct* ,
when
the
old
manxman
*punct* ,
who
was
intently
eyeing
both
him
and
the
line
*punct* ,
made
bold
to
speak
*punct* .
*break*
sir
*punct* ,
i
mistrust
it
*punct* ;
this
line
looks
far
gone
*punct* ,
long
heat
and
wet
have
spoiled
it
*punct* .
*break*
twill
hold
*punct* ,
old
gentleman
*punct* .
*break*
long
heat
and
wet
*punct* ,
have
they
spoiled
thee
*punct* ?
*break*
thou
seem'st
to
hold
*punct* .
*break*
or
*punct* ,
truer
perhaps
*punct* ,
life
holds
thee
*punct* ;
not
thou
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
hold
the
spool
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
but
just
as
my
captain
says
*punct* .
*break*
with
these
grey
hairs
of
mine
tis
not
worth
while
disputing
*punct* ,
specially
with
a
superior
*punct* ,
who'll
ne'er
confess
*punct* .
*break*
there
now's
a
patched
professor
in
queen
nature's
granite-founded
college
*punct* ;
but
methinks
he's
too
subservient
*punct* .
*break*
where
wert
thou
born
*punct* ?
*break*
in
the
little
rocky
isle
of
man
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
thou'st
hit
the
world
by
that
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
not
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
but
i
was
born
there
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
isle
of
man
*punct* ,
hey
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
the
other
way
*punct* ,
it's
good
*punct* .
*break*
here's
a
man
from
man
*punct* ;
a
man
born
in
once
independent
man
*punct* ,
and
now
unmanned
of
man
*punct* ;
which
is
sucked
in
*punct* ,
by
what
*punct* ?
*break*
up
with
the
reel
*punct* !
*break*
the
dead
*punct* ,
blind
wall
butts
all
inquiring
heads
at
last
*punct* .
*break*
up
with
it
*punct* !
*break*
the
log
was
heaved
*punct* .
*break*
the
loose
coils
rapidly
straightened
out
in
a
long
dragging
line
astern
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
instantly
*punct* ,
the
reel
began
to
whirl
*punct* .
*break*
in
turn
*punct* ,
jerkingly
raised
and
lowered
by
the
rolling
billows
*punct* ,
the
towing
resistance
of
the
log
caused
the
old
reelman
to
stagger
strangely
*punct* .
*break*
the
overstrained
line
sagged
down
in
one
long
festoon
*punct* ;
the
tugging
log
was
gone
*punct* .
*break*
i
crush
the
quadrant
*punct* ,
the
thunder
turns
the
needles
*punct* ,
and
now
the
mad
sea
parts
the
log-line
*punct* .
*break*
but
ahab
can
mend
all
*punct* .
*break*
haul
in
here
*punct* ,
tahitian
*punct* ;
reel
up
*punct* ,
manxman
*punct* .
*break*
and
look
ye
*punct* ,
let
the
carpenter
make
another
log
*punct* ,
and
mend
thou
the
line
*punct* .
*break*
haul
in
*punct* ,
haul
in
*punct* ,
tahitian
*punct* !
*break*
these
lines
run
whole
*punct* ,
and
whirling
out
*punct* :
come
in
broken
*punct* ,
and
dragging
slow
*punct* .
*break*
ha
*punct* ,
pip
*punct* ?
*break*
come
to
help
*punct* ;
eh
*punct* ,
pip
*punct* ?
*break*
whom
call
ye
pip
*punct* ?
*break*
pip
jumped
from
the
whale-boat
*punct* .
*break*
let's
see
now
if
ye
haven't
fished
him
up
here
*punct* ,
fisherman
*punct* .
*break*
it
drags
hard
*punct* ;
i
guess
he's
holding
on
*punct* .
*break*
jerk
him
*punct* ,
tahiti
*punct* !
*break*
jerk
him
off
*punct* ;
we
haul
in
no
cowards
here
*punct* .
*break*
there's
his
arm
just
breaking
water
*punct* .
*break*
cut
it
off
*punct* ,
we
haul
in
no
cowards
here
*punct* .
*break*
sir
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
here's
pip
*punct* ,
trying
to
get
on
board
again
*punct* .
*break*
peace
*punct* ,
thou
crazy
loon
*punct* ,
cried
the
manxman
*punct* ,
seizing
him
by
the
arm
*punct* .
*break*
away
from
the
quarter-deck
*punct* !
*break*
the
greater
idiot
ever
scolds
the
lesser
*punct* ,
muttered
ahab
*punct* ,
advancing
*punct* .
*break*
hands
off
from
that
holiness
*punct* !
*break*
where
sayest
thou
pip
was
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* ?
*break*
astern
there
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
astern
*punct* !
*break*
lo
*punct* ,
lo
*punct* !
*break*
and
who
art
thou
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* ?
*break*
i
see
not
my
reflection
in
the
vacant
pupils
of
thy
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
that
man
should
be
a
thing
for
immortal
souls
to
sieve
through
*punct* !
*break*
who
art
thou
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* ?
*break*
bell-boy
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
ship's-crier
*punct* ;
ding
*punct* ,
dong
*punct* ,
ding
*punct* !
*break*
one
hundred
pounds
of
clay
reward
for
pip
*punct* ;
five
feet
high
*punct* ,
looks
cowardly
*punct* ,
quickest
known
by

*punct* !
*break*
ding
*punct* ,
dong
*punct* ,
ding

*break*
who's
seen
pip
the
coward
*punct* ?
*break*
there
can
be
no
hearts
above
the
snow-line
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
ye
frozen
heavens
*punct* !
*break*
look
down
here
*punct* .
*break*
ye
did
beget
this
luckless
child
*punct* ,
and
have
abandoned
him
*punct* ,
ye
creative
libertines
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* ;
ahab's
cabin
shall
be
pip's
home
henceforth
*punct* ,
while
ahab
lives
*punct* .
*break*
thou
touchest
my
inmost
centre
*punct* ,
boy
*punct* ;
thou
art
tied
to
me
by
cords
woven
of
my
heart-strings
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
let's
down
*punct* .
*break*
here's
velvet
shark-skin
*punct* ,
intently
gazing
at
ahab's
hand
*punct* ,
and
feeling
it
*punct* .
*break*
ah
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
had
poor
pip
but
felt
so
kind
a
thing
as
this
*punct* ,
perhaps
he
had
ne'er
been
lost
*punct* !
*break*
this
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
as
a
man-rope
*punct* ;
something
that
weak
souls
may
hold
by
*punct* .
*break*
come
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
to
my
cabin
*punct* .
*break*
ye
believers
in
gods
all
goodness
*punct* ,
and
in
man
all
ill
*punct* ,
lo
you
*punct* !
*break*
see
the
omniscient
gods
oblivious
of
suffering
man
*punct* ;
and
man
*punct* ,
though
idiotic
*punct* ,
and
knowing
not
what
he
does
*punct* ,
yet
full
of
the
sweet
things
of
love
and
gratitude
*punct* .
*break*
i
feel
prouder
leading
thee
by
thy
black
hand
*punct* ,
than
though
i
grasped
an
emperor's
*punct* !
*break*
there
go
two
daft
ones
now
*punct* ,
muttered
the
old
manxman
*punct* .
*break*
one
daft
with
strength
*punct* ,
the
other
daft
with
weakness
*punct* .
*break*
but
here's
the
end
of
the
rotten
line
*punct* ,
all
dripping
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
mend
it
*punct* ,
eh
*punct* ?
*break*
i
think
we
had
best
have
a
new
line
altogether
*punct* .
*break*
making
so
long
a
passage
through
such
unfrequented
waters
*punct* ,
descrying
no
ships
*punct* ,
and
ere
long
*punct* ,
sideways
impelled
by
unvarying
trade
winds
*punct* ,
over
waves
monotonously
mild
*punct* ;
all
these
seemed
the
strange
calm
things
preluding
some
riotous
and
desperate
scene
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
when
the
ship
drew
near
to
the
outskirts
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ,
of
the
equatorial
fishing-ground
*punct* ,
and
in
the
deep
darkness
that
goes
before
the
dawn
*punct* ,
was
sailing
by
a
cluster
of
rocky
islets
*punct* ;
the
watch
*punct* ,
then
headed
by
flask
*punct* ,
was
startled
by
a
cry
so
plaintively
wild
and
unearthly
*punct* ,
like
half-articulated
wailings
of
the
ghosts
of
all
herod's
murdered
innocents
*punct* ,
that
one
and
all
*punct* ,
they
started
from
their
reveries
*punct* ,
and
for
the
space
of
some
moments
stood
*punct* ,
or
sat
*punct* ,
or
leaned
all
transfixedly
listening
*punct* ,
like
the
carved
roman
slave
*punct* ,
while
that
wild
cry
remained
within
hearing
*punct* .
*break*
yet
the
grey
manxman
*punct* ,
the
oldest
mariner
of
all
*punct* ,
declared
that
the
wild
thrilling
sounds
that
were
heard
*punct* ,
were
the
voices
of
newly
drowned
men
in
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
below
in
his
hammock
*punct* ,
ahab
did
not
hear
of
this
till
grey
dawn
*punct* ,
when
he
came
to
the
deck
*punct* ;
it
was
then
recounted
to
him
by
flask
*punct* ,
not
unaccompanied
with
hinted
dark
meanings
*punct* .
*break*
he
hollowly
laughed
*punct* ,
and
thus
explained
the
wonder
*punct* .
*break*
those
rocky
islands
the
ship
had
passed
were
the
resort
of
great
numbers
of
seals
*punct* ,
and
some
young
seals
that
had
lost
their
dams
*punct* ,
or
some
dams
that
had
lost
their
cubs
*punct* ,
must
have
risen
nigh
the
ship
and
kept
company
with
her
*punct* ,
crying
and
sobbing
with
their
human
sort
of
wail
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
only
the
more
affected
some
of
them
*punct* ,
because
most
mariners
cherish
a
very
superstitious
feeling
about
seals
*punct* ,
arising
not
only
from
their
peculiar
tones
when
in
distress
*punct* ,
but
also
from
the
human
look
of
their
round
heads
and
semi-intelligent
faces
*punct* ,
seen
peeringly
uprising
from
the
water
alongside
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
sea
*punct* ,
under
certain
circumstances
*punct* ,
seals
have
more
than
once
been
mistaken
for
men
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
bodings
of
the
crew
were
destined
to
receive
a
most
plausible
confirmation
in
the
fate
of
one
of
their
number
that
morning
*punct* .
*break*
at
sun-rise
this
man
went
from
his
hammock
to
his
mast-head
at
the
fore
*punct* ;
and
whether
it
was
that
he
was
not
yet
half
waked
from
his
sleep
*punct* ,
for
sailors
sometimes
go
aloft
in
a
transition
state
*punct* ,
whether
it
was
thus
with
the
man
*punct* ,
there
is
now
no
telling
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
be
that
as
it
may
*punct* ,
he
had
not
been
long
at
his
perch
*punct* ,
when
a
cry
was
heard
*punct* ,
a
cry
and
a
rushing
*punct* ,
and
looking
up
*punct* ,
they
saw
a
falling
phantom
in
the
air
*punct* ;
and
looking
down
*punct* ,
a
little
tossed
heap
of
white
bubbles
in
the
blue
of
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
the
life-buoy
*punct* ,
a
long
slender
cask
*punct* ,
was
dropped
from
the
stern
*punct* ,
where
it
always
hung
obedient
to
a
cunning
spring
*punct* ;
but
no
hand
rose
to
seize
it
*punct* ,
and
the
sun
having
long
beat
upon
this
cask
it
had
shrunken
*punct* ,
so
that
it
slowly
filled
*punct* ,
and
the
parched
wood
also
filled
at
its
every
pore
*punct* ;
and
the
studded
iron-bound
cask
followed
the
sailor
to
the
bottom
*punct* ,
as
if
to
yield
him
his
pillow
*punct* ,
though
in
sooth
but
a
hard
one
*punct* .
*break*
but
few
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
thought
of
that
at
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
in
some
sort
*punct* ,
they
were
not
grieved
at
this
event
*punct* ,
at
least
as
a
portent
*punct* ;
for
they
regarded
it
*punct* ,
not
as
a
foreshadowing
of
evil
in
the
future
*punct* ,
but
as
the
fulfilment
of
an
evil
already
presaged
*punct* .
*break*
they
declared
that
now
they
knew
the
reason
of
those
wild
shrieks
they
had
heard
the
night
before
*punct* .
*break*
but
again
the
old
manxman
said
nay
*punct* .
*break*
the
lost
life-buoy
was
now
to
be
replaced
*punct* ;
starbuck
was
directed
to
see
to
it
*punct* ;
but
as
no
cask
of
sufficient
lightness
could
be
found
*punct* ,
and
as
in
the
feverish
eagerness
of
what
seemed
the
approaching
crisis
of
the
voyage
*punct* ,
all
hands
were
impatient
of
any
toil
but
what
was
directly
connected
with
its
final
end
*punct* ,
whatever
that
might
prove
to
be
*punct* ;
therefore
*punct* ,
they
were
going
to
leave
the
ship's
stern
unprovided
with
a
buoy
*punct* ,
when
by
certain
strange
signs
and
inuendoes
queequeg
hinted
a
hint
concerning
his
coffin
*punct* .
*break*
a
life-buoy
of
a
coffin
*punct* !
*break*
cried
starbuck
*punct* ,
starting
*punct* .
*break*
rather
queer
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
i
should
say
*punct* ,
said
stubb
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
make
a
good
enough
one
*punct* ,
said
flask
*punct* ,
the
carpenter
here
can
arrange
it
easily
*punct* .
*break*
bring
it
up
*punct* ;
there's
nothing
else
for
it
*punct* ,
said
starbuck
*punct* ,
after
a
melancholy
pause
*punct* .
*break*
rig
it
*punct* ,
carpenter
*punct* ;
do
not
look
at
me
so
*punct* ,
the
coffin
*punct* ,
i
mean
*punct* .
*break*
dost
thou
hear
me
*punct* ?
*break*
and
shall
i
nail
down
the
lid
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
moving
his
hand
as
with
a
hammer
*punct* .
*break*
and
shall
i
caulk
the
seams
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
moving
his
hand
as
with
a
caulking-iron
*punct* .
*break*
and
shall
i
then
pay
over
the
same
with
pitch
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
moving
his
hand
as
with
a
pitch-pot
*punct* .
*break*
what
possesses
thee
to
this
*punct* ?
*break*
make
a
life-buoy
of
the
coffin
*punct* ,
and
no
more.
*punct* ,
mr.
stubb
*punct* ,
mr.
flask
*punct* ,
come
forward
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
he
goes
off
in
a
huff
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
he
can
endure
*punct* ;
at
the
parts
he
baulks
*punct* .
*break*
now
i
don't
like
this
*punct* .
*break*
i
make
a
leg
for
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
and
he
wears
it
like
a
gentleman
*punct* ;
but
i
make
a
bandbox
for
queequeg
*punct* ,
and
he
wont
put
his
head
into
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
i'm
ordered
to
make
a
life-buoy
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
it's
like
turning
an
old
coat
*punct* ;
going
to
bring
the
flesh
on
the
other
side
now
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
like
this
cobbling
sort
of
business
*punct* ,
i
don't
like
it
at
all
*punct* ;
it's
undignified
*punct* ;
it's
not
my
place
*punct* .
*break*
let
tinkers
brats
do
tinkerings
*punct* ;
we
are
their
betters
*punct* .
*break*
i
like
to
take
in
hand
none
but
clean
*punct* ,
virgin
*punct* ,
fair-and-square
mathematical
jobs
*punct* ,
something
that
regularly
begins
at
the
beginning
*punct* ,
and
is
at
the
middle
when
midway
*punct* ,
and
comes
to
an
end
at
the
conclusion
*punct* ;
not
a
cobbler's
job
*punct* ,
that's
at
an
end
in
the
middle
*punct* ,
and
at
the
beginning
at
the
end
*punct* .
*break*
it's
the
old
woman's
tricks
to
be
giving
cobbling
jobs
*punct* .
*break*
what
an
affection
all
old
women
have
for
tinkers
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
an
old
woman
of
sixty-five
who
ran
away
with
a
bald-headed
young
tinker
once
*punct* .
*break*
and
that's
the
reason
i
never
would
work
for
lonely
widow
old
women
ashore
*punct* ,
when
i
kept
my
job-shop
in
the
vineyard
*punct* ;
they
might
have
taken
it
into
their
lonely
old
heads
to
run
off
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
no
caps
at
sea
but
snow-caps
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
see
*punct* .
*break*
nail
down
the
lid
*punct* ;
caulk
the
seams
*punct* ;
pay
over
the
same
with
pitch
*punct* ;
batten
them
down
tight
*punct* ,
and
hang
it
with
the
snap-spring
over
the
ship's
stern
*punct* .
*break*
were
ever
such
things
done
before
with
a
coffin
*punct* ?
*break*
some
superstitious
old
carpenters
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
would
be
tied
up
in
the
rigging
*punct* ,
ere
they
would
do
the
job
*punct* .
*break*
but
i'm
made
of
knotty
aroostook
hemlock
*punct* ;
i
don't
budge
*punct* .
*break*
cruppered
with
a
coffin
*punct* !
*break*
sailing
about
with
a
grave-yard
tray
*punct* !
*break*
but
never
mind
*punct* .
*break*
we
workers
in
woods
make
bridal-bedsteads
and
card-tables
*punct* ,
as
well
as
coffins
and
hearses
*punct* .
*break*
we
work
by
the
month
*punct* ,
or
by
the
job
*punct* ,
or
by
the
profit
*punct* ;
not
for
us
to
ask
the
why
and
wherefore
of
our
work
*punct* ,
unless
it
be
too
confounded
cobbling
*punct* ,
and
then
we
stash
it
if
we
can
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
do
the
job
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
tenderly
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
have
me
*punct* ,
let's
see
*punct* ,
how
many
in
the
ship's
company
*punct* ,
all
told
*punct* ?
*break*
but
i've
forgotten
*punct* .
*break*
any
way
*punct* ,
i'll
have
me
thirty
separate
*punct* ,
turk's-headed
life-lines
*punct* ,
each
three
feet
long
hanging
all
round
to
the
coffin
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
if
the
hull
go
down
*punct* ,
there'll
be
thirty
lively
fellows
all
fighting
for
one
coffin
*punct* ,
a
sight
not
seen
very
often
beneath
the
sun
*punct* !
*break*
come
hammer
*punct* ,
calking-iron
*punct* ,
pitch-pot
*punct* ,
and
marling-spike
*punct* !
*break*
back
*punct* ,
lad
*punct* ;
i
will
be
with
ye
again
presently
*punct* .
*break*
not
this
hand
complies
with
my
humor
more
genially
than
that
boy.
*punct* ,
middle

a
church
*punct* !
*break*
life

mr.
starbuck's

*break*
oh
*punct* ,
look

*break*
beware
the
hatchway
*punct* !
*break*
thank
ye
*punct* ,
man
*punct* .
*break*
thy
coffin
lies
handy
to
the
vault
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
does
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
so
it
does
*punct* .
*break*
art
not
thou
the
leg-maker
*punct* ?
*break*
look
*punct* ,
did
not
this
stump
come
from
thy
shop
*punct* ?
*break*
i
believe
it
did
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
does
the
ferrule
stand
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
but
art
thou
not
also
the
undertaker
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
i
patched
up
this
thing
here
as
a
coffin
for
queequeg
*punct* ;
but
they've
set
me
now
to
turning
it
into
something
else
*punct* .
*break*
then
tell
me
*punct* ;
art
thou
not
an
arrant
*punct* ,
all-grasping
*punct* ,
inter-meddling
*punct* ,
monopolizing
*punct* ,
heathenish
old
scamp
*punct* ,
to
be
one
day
making
legs
*punct* ,
and
the
next
day
coffins
to
clap
them
in
*punct* ,
and
yet
again
life-buoys
out
of
those
same
coffins
*punct* ?
*break*
thou
art
as
unprincipled
as
the
gods
*punct* ,
and
as
much
of
a
jack-of-all-trades
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
do
not
mean
anything
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
as
i
do
*punct* .
*break*
the
gods
again
*punct* .
*break*
hark
ye
*punct* ,
dost
thou
not
ever
sing
working
about
a
coffin
*punct* ?
*break*
the
titans
*punct* ,
they
say
*punct* ,
hummed
snatches
when
chipping
out
the
craters
for
volcanoes
*punct* ;
and
the
grave-digger
in
the
play
sings
*punct* ,
spade
in
hand
*punct* .
*break*
dost
thou
never
*punct* ?
*break*
sing
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ?
*break*
do
i
sing
*punct* ?
*break*
but
the
calking
mallet
is
full
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
hark
to
it
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
and
that's
because
the
lid
there's
a
sounding-board
*punct* ;
and
what
in
all
things
makes
the
sounding-board
is
this
*punct* ,
there's
naught
beneath
*punct* .
*break*
and
yet
*punct* ,
a
coffin
with
a
body
in
it
rings
pretty
much
the
same
*punct* ,
carpenter
*punct* .
*break*
hast
thou
ever
helped
carry
a
bier
*punct* ,
and
heard
the
coffin
knock
against
the
churchyard
gate
*punct* ,
going
in
*punct* ?
*break*

sir
*punct* ,
i've

*break*
why
*punct* ,
faith
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
it's
only
a
sort
of
exclamation-like
*punct* ,
that's
all
*punct* ,
sir

*break*
um
*punct* ,
um
*punct* ;
go
on

*break*
i
was
about
to
say
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
art
thou
a
silk-worm
*punct* ?
*break*
dost
thou
spin
thy
own
shroud
out
of
thyself
*punct* ?
*break*
look
at
thy
bosom
*punct* !
*break*
and
get
these
traps
out
of
sight
*punct* .
*break*
he
goes
aft
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
sudden
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ;
but
squalls
come
sudden
in
hot
latitudes
*punct* .
*break*
i've
heard
that
the
isle
of
albemarle
*punct* ,
one
of
the
gallipagos
*punct* ,
is
cut
by
the
equator
right
in
the
middle
*punct* .
*break*
seems
to
me
some
sort
of
equator
cuts
yon
old
man
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
right
in
his
middle
*punct* .
*break*
he's
always
under
the
line
*punct* ,
fiery
hot
*punct* ,
i
tell
ye
*punct* !
*break*
he's
looking
this
way
*punct* ,
come
*punct* ,
oakum
*punct* ;
quick
*punct* .
*break*
here
we
go
again
*punct* .
*break*
this
wooden
mallet
is
the
cork
*punct* ,
and
i'm
the
professor
of
musical
glasses
*punct* ,
tap
*punct* ,
tap
*punct* !
*break*
*punct* ,
ahab
to
himself.
*punct* ,
there's
a
sight
*punct* !
*break*
the
greyheaded
woodpecker
tapping
the
hollow
tree
*punct* !
*break*
blind
and
dumb
might
well
be
envied
now
*punct* .
*break*
that
thing
rests
on
two
line-tubs
*punct* ,
full
of
tow-lines
*punct* .
*break*
a
most
malicious
wag
*punct* ,
that
fellow
*punct* .
*break*
so
man's
seconds
tick
*punct* !
*break*
how
immaterial
are
all
materials
*punct* !
*break*
what
things
real
are
there
*punct* ,
but
imponderable
thoughts
*punct* ?
*break*
here
now's
the
very
dreaded
symbol
of
grim
death
*punct* ,
by
a
mere
hap
*punct* ,
made
the
expressive
sign
of
the
help
and
hope
of
most
endangered
life
*punct* .
*break*
a
life-buoy
of
a
coffin
*punct* !
*break*
does
it
go
further
*punct* ?
*break*
can
it
be
that
in
some
spiritual
sense
the
coffin
is
*punct* ,
after
all
*punct* ,
but
an
immortality-preserver
*punct* !
*break*
i'll
think
of
that
*punct* .
*break*
will
ye
never
have
done
*punct* ,
carpenter
*punct* ,
with
that
accursed
sound
*punct* ?
*break*
i
go
below
*punct* ;
let
me
not
see
that
thing
here
when
i
return
again
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
pip
*punct* ,
we'll
talk
this
over
*punct* ;
i
do
suck
most
wondrous
philosophies
from
thee
*punct* !
*break*
some
unknown
conduits
from
the
unknown
worlds
must
empty
into
thee
*punct* !
*break*
at
the
time
the
pequod
was
making
good
speed
through
the
water
*punct* ;
but
as
the
broad-winged
windward
stranger
shot
nigh
to
her
*punct* ,
the
boastful
sails
all
fell
together
as
blank
bladders
that
are
burst
*punct* ,
and
all
life
fled
from
the
smitten
hull
*punct* .
*break*
bad
news
*punct* ;
she
brings
bad
news
*punct* ,
muttered
the
old
manxman
*punct* .
*break*
but
ere
her
commander
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
with
trumpet
to
mouth
*punct* ,
stood
up
in
his
boat
*punct* ;
ere
he
could
hopefully
hail
*punct* ,
ahab's
voice
was
heard
*punct* .
*break*
hast
seen
the
white
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
yesterday
*punct* .
*break*
have
ye
seen
a
whale-boat
adrift
*punct* ?
*break*
throttling
his
joy
*punct* ,
ahab
negatively
answered
this
unexpected
question
*punct* ;
and
would
then
have
fain
boarded
the
stranger
*punct* ,
when
the
stranger
captain
himself
*punct* ,
having
stopped
his
vessel's
way
*punct* ,
was
seen
descending
her
side
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
keen
pulls
*punct* ,
and
his
boat-hook
soon
clinched
the
pequod's
main-chains
*punct* ,
and
he
sprang
to
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
immediately
he
was
recognized
by
ahab
for
a
nantucketer
he
knew
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
formal
salutation
was
exchanged
*punct* .
*break*
where
was
he?
*punct* ,
not
killed!
*punct* ,
not
killed
*punct* !
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
closely
advancing
*punct* .
*break*
how
was
it
*punct* ?
*break*
after
a
keen
sail
before
the
wind
*punct* ,
this
fourth
boat
*punct* ,
the
swiftest
keeled
of
all
*punct* ,
seemed
to
have
succeeded
in
fastening
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
as
well
as
the
man
at
the
mast-head
could
tell
anything
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
distance
he
saw
the
diminished
dotted
boat
*punct* ;
and
then
a
swift
gleam
of
bubbling
white
water
*punct* ;
and
after
that
nothing
more
*punct* ;
whence
it
was
concluded
that
the
stricken
whale
must
have
indefinitely
run
away
with
his
pursuers
*punct* ,
as
often
happens
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
some
apprehension
*punct* ,
but
no
positive
alarm
*punct* ,
as
yet
*punct* .
*break*
the
recall
signals
were
placed
in
the
rigging
*punct* ;
darkness
came
on
*punct* ;
and
forced
to
pick
up
her
three
far
to
windward
boats
*punct* ,
ere
going
in
quest
of
the
fourth
one
in
the
precisely
opposite
direction
*punct* ,
the
ship
had
not
only
been
necessitated
to
leave
that
boat
to
its
fate
till
near
midnight
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
for
the
time
*punct* ,
to
increase
her
distance
from
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
rest
of
her
crew
being
at
last
safe
aboard
*punct* ,
she
crowded
all
sail
*punct* ,
stunsail
on
stunsail
*punct* ,
after
the
missing
boat
*punct* ;
kindling
a
fire
in
her
try-pots
for
a
beacon
*punct* ;
and
every
other
man
aloft
on
the
look-out
*punct* .
*break*
but
though
when
she
had
thus
sailed
a
sufficient
distance
to
gain
the
presumed
place
of
the
absent
ones
when
last
seen
*punct* ;
though
she
then
paused
to
lower
her
spare
boats
to
pull
all
around
her
*punct* ;
and
not
finding
anything
*punct* ,
had
again
dashed
on
*punct* ;
again
paused
*punct* ,
and
lowered
her
boats
*punct* ;
and
though
she
had
thus
continued
doing
till
day
light
*punct* ;
yet
not
the
least
glimpse
of
the
missing
keel
had
been
seen
*punct* .
*break*
the
story
told
*punct* ,
the
stranger
captain
immediately
went
on
to
reveal
his
object
in
boarding
the
pequod
*punct* .
*break*
he
desired
that
ship
to
unite
with
his
own
in
the
search
*punct* ;
by
sailing
over
the
sea
some
four
or
five
miles
apart
*punct* ,
on
parallel
lines
*punct* ,
and
so
sweeping
a
double
horizon
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
wager
something
now
*punct* ,
whispered
stubb
to
flask
*punct* ,
that
some
one
in
that
missing
boat
wore
off
that
captain's
best
coat
*punct* ;
mayhap
*punct* ,
his
watch
*punct* ,
he's
so
cursed
anxious
to
get
it
back
*punct* .
*break*
see
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ,
only
see
how
pale
he
looks
*punct* ,
pale
in
the
very
buttons
of
his
eyes
*punct* ,
look
*punct* ,
it
wasn't
the
coat
*punct* ,
it
must
have
been
the
*punct* ,
my
boy
*punct* ,
my
own
boy
is
among
them
*punct* .
*break*
for
god's
sake
*punct* ,
i
beg
*punct* ,
i
conjure
*punct* ,
here
exclaimed
the
stranger
captain
to
ahab
*punct* ,
who
thus
far
had
but
icily
received
his
petition
*punct* .
*break*
for
eight-and-forty
hours
let
me
charter
your
ship
*punct* ,
i
will
gladly
pay
for
it
*punct* ,
and
roundly
pay
for
it
*punct* ,
if
there
be
no
other
way
*punct* ,
for
eight-and-forty
hours
only
*punct* ,
only
that
*punct* ,
you
must
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
you
must
*punct* ,
and
you
shall
do
this
thing
*punct* .
*break*
cried
stubb
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
it's
his
son
he's
lost
*punct* !
*break*
i
take
back
the
coat
and
watch
*punct* ,
what
says
ahab
*punct* ?
*break*
we
must
save
that
boy
*punct* .
*break*
he's
drowned
with
the
rest
on
em
*punct* ,
last
night
*punct* ,
said
the
old
manx
sailor
standing
behind
them
*punct* ;
i
heard
*punct* ;
all
of
ye
heard
their
spirits
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
as
it
shortly
turned
out
*punct* ,
what
made
this
incident
of
the
rachel's
the
more
melancholy
*punct* ,
was
the
circumstance
*punct* ,
that
not
only
was
one
of
the
captain's
sons
among
the
number
of
the
missing
boat's
crew
*punct* ;
but
among
the
number
of
the
other
boat's
crews
*punct* ,
at
the
same
time
*punct* ,
but
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
separated
from
the
ship
during
the
dark
vicissitudes
of
the
chase
*punct* ,
there
had
been
still
another
son
*punct* ;
as
that
for
a
time
*punct* ,
the
wretched
father
was
plunged
to
the
bottom
of
the
cruellest
perplexity
*punct* ;
which
was
only
solved
for
him
by
his
chief
mate's
instinctively
adopting
the
ordinary
procedure
of
a
whale-ship
in
such
emergencies
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
when
placed
between
jeopardized
but
divided
boats
*punct* ,
always
to
pick
up
the
majority
first
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
captain
*punct* ,
for
some
unknown
constitutional
reason
*punct* ,
had
refrained
from
mentioning
all
this
*punct* ,
and
not
till
forced
to
it
by
ahab's
iciness
did
he
allude
to
his
one
yet
missing
boy
*punct* ;
a
little
lad
*punct* ,
but
twelve
years
old
*punct* ,
whose
father
with
the
earnest
but
unmisgiving
hardihood
of
a
nantucketer's
paternal
love
*punct* ,
had
thus
early
sought
to
initiate
him
in
the
perils
and
wonders
of
a
vocation
almost
immemorially
the
destiny
of
all
his
race
*punct* .
*break*
meantime
*punct* ,
now
the
stranger
was
still
beseeching
his
poor
boon
of
ahab
*punct* ;
and
ahab
still
stood
like
an
anvil
*punct* ,
receiving
every
shock
*punct* ,
but
without
the
least
quivering
of
his
own
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
not
go
*punct* ,
said
the
stranger
*punct* ,
till
you
say
aye
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
do
to
me
as
you
would
have
me
do
to
you
in
the
like
case
*punct* .
*break*
for
you
too
have
a
boy
*punct* ,
captain
ahab
*punct* ,
though
but
a
child
*punct* ,
and
nestling
safely
at
home
now
*punct* ,
a
child
of
your
old
age
too
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
you
relent
*punct* ;
i
see
it
*punct* ,
run
*punct* ,
run
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
and
stand
by
to
square
in
the
yards
*punct* .
*break*
avast
*punct* ,
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
touch
not
a
rope-yarn
*punct* ;
then
in
a
voice
that
prolongingly
moulded
every
word
*punct* ,
captain
gardiner
*punct* ,
i
will
not
do
it
*punct* .
*break*
even
now
i
lose
time
*punct* .
*break*
good
bye
*punct* ,
good
bye
*punct* .
*break*
god
bless
ye
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
and
may
i
forgive
myself
*punct* ,
but
i
must
go
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ,
look
at
the
binnacle
watch
*punct* ,
and
in
three
minutes
from
this
present
instant
warn
off
all
strangers
*punct* :
then
brace
forward
again
*punct* ,
and
let
the
ship
sail
as
before
*punct* .
*break*
hurriedly
turning
*punct* ,
with
averted
face
*punct* ,
he
descended
into
his
cabin
*punct* ,
leaving
the
strange
captain
transfixed
at
this
unconditional
and
utter
rejection
of
his
so
earnest
suit
*punct* .
*break*
but
starting
from
his
enchantment
*punct* ,
gardiner
silently
hurried
to
the
side
*punct* ;
more
fell
than
stepped
into
his
boat
*punct* ,
and
returned
to
his
ship
*punct* .
*break*
soon
the
two
ships
diverged
their
wakes
*punct* ;
and
long
as
the
strange
vessel
was
in
view
*punct* ,
she
was
seen
to
yaw
hither
and
thither
at
every
dark
spot
*punct* ,
however
small
*punct* ,
on
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
this
way
and
that
her
yards
were
swung
round
*punct* ;
starboard
and
larboard
*punct* ,
she
continued
to
tack
*punct* ;
now
she
beat
against
a
head
sea
*punct* ;
and
again
it
pushed
her
before
it
*punct* ;
while
all
the
while
*punct* ,
her
masts
and
yards
were
thickly
clustered
with
men
*punct* ,
as
three
tall
cherry
trees
*punct* ,
when
the
boys
are
cherrying
among
the
boughs
*punct* .
*break*
but
by
her
still
halting
course
and
winding
*punct* ,
woful
way
*punct* ,
you
plainly
saw
that
this
ship
that
so
wept
with
spray
*punct* ,
still
remained
without
comfort
*punct* .
*break*
the
hour
is
coming
when
ahab
would
not
scare
thee
from
him
*punct* ,
yet
would
not
have
thee
by
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
that
in
thee
*punct* ,
poor
lad
*punct* ,
which
i
feel
too
curing
to
my
malady
*punct* .
*break*
like
cures
like
*punct* ;
and
for
this
hunt
*punct* ,
my
malady
becomes
my
most
desired
health
*punct* .
*break*
do
thou
abide
below
here
*punct* ,
where
they
shall
serve
thee
*punct* ,
as
if
thou
wert
the
captain
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
lad
*punct* ,
thou
shalt
sit
here
in
my
own
screwed
chair
*punct* ;
another
screw
to
it
*punct* ,
thou
must
be
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* !
*break*
ye
have
not
a
whole
body
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
do
ye
but
use
poor
me
for
your
one
lost
leg
*punct* ;
only
tread
upon
me
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
i
ask
no
more
*punct* ,
so
i
remain
a
part
of
ye
*punct* .
*break*
spite
of
million
villains
*punct* ,
this
makes
me
a
bigot
in
the
fadeless
fidelity
of
man!
*punct* ,
and
a
black
*punct* !
*break*
and
crazy!
*punct* ,
but
methinks
like-cures-like
applies
to
him
too
*punct* ;
he
grows
so
sane
again
*punct* .
*break*
they
tell
me
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
that
stubb
did
once
desert
poor
little
pip
*punct* ,
whose
drowned
bones
now
show
white
*punct* ,
for
all
the
blackness
of
his
living
skin
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
will
never
desert
ye
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
as
stubb
did
him
*punct* .
*break*
sir
*punct* ,
i
must
go
with
ye
*punct* .
*break*
if
thou
speakest
thus
to
me
much
more
*punct* ,
ahab's
purpose
keels
up
in
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
tell
thee
no
*punct* ;
it
cannot
be
*punct* .
*break*
oh
good
master
*punct* ,
master
*punct* ,
master
*punct* !
*break*
weep
so
*punct* ,
and
i
will
murder
thee
*punct* !
*break*
have
a
care
*punct* ,
for
ahab
too
is
mad
*punct* .
*break*
listen
*punct* ,
and
thou
wilt
often
hear
my
ivory
foot
upon
the
deck
*punct* ,
and
still
know
that
i
am
there
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
i
quit
thee
*punct* .
*break*
thy
hand!
*punct* ,
met
*punct* !
*break*
true
art
thou
*punct* ,
lad
*punct* ,
as
the
circumference
to
its
centre
*punct* .
*break*
now
were
even
poor
pip
here
i
could
endure
it
*punct* ,
but
he's
missing
*punct* .
*break*
ding
*punct* ,
dong
*punct* ,
ding
*punct* !
*break*
who's
seen
pip
*punct* ?
*break*
he
must
be
up
here
*punct* ;
let's
try
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
neither
lock
*punct* ,
nor
bolt
*punct* ,
nor
bar
*punct* ;
and
yet
there's
no
opening
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
be
the
spell
*punct* ;
he
told
me
to
stay
here
*punct* :
aye
*punct* ,
and
told
me
this
screwed
chair
was
mine
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
i'll
seat
me
*punct* ,
against
the
transom
*punct* ,
in
the
ship's
full
middle
*punct* ,
all
her
keel
and
her
three
masts
before
me
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
our
old
sailors
say
*punct* ,
in
their
black
seventy-fours
great
admirals
sometimes
sit
at
table
*punct* ,
and
lord
it
over
rows
of
captains
and
lieutenants
*punct* .
*break*
the
epaulets
all
come
crowding
*punct* !
*break*
pass
round
the
decanters
*punct* ;
glad
to
see
ye
*punct* ;
fill
up
*punct* ,
monsieurs
*punct* !
*break*
what
an
odd
feeling
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
when
a
black
boy's
host
to
white
men
with
gold
lace
upon
their
coats!
*punct* ,
monsieurs
*punct* ,
have
ye
seen
one
pip?
*punct* ,
a
little
negro
lad
*punct* ,
five
feet
high
*punct* ,
hang-dog
look
*punct* ,
and
cowardly
*punct* !
*break*
jumped
from
a
whale-boat
once;
*punct* ,
seen
him
*punct* ?
*break*
well
then
*punct* ,
fill
up
again
*punct* ,
captains
*punct* ,
and
let's
drink
shame
upon
all
cowards
*punct* !
*break*
i
name
no
names
*punct* .
*break*
shame
upon
them
*punct* !
*break*
put
one
foot
upon
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
shame
upon
all
cowards.
*punct* ,
hist
*punct* !
*break*
above
there
*punct* ,
i
hear
ivory
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
master
*punct* ,
master
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
indeed
down-hearted
when
you
walk
over
me
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
unsetting
polar
star
*punct* ,
which
through
the
livelong
*punct* ,
arctic
*punct* ,
six
months
night
sustains
its
piercing
*punct* ,
steady
*punct* ,
central
gaze
*punct* ;
so
ahab's
purpose
now
fixedly
gleamed
down
upon
the
constant
midnight
of
the
gloomy
crew
*punct* .
*break*
it
domineered
above
them
so
*punct* ,
that
all
their
bodings
*punct* ,
doubts
*punct* ,
misgivings
*punct* ,
fears
*punct* ,
were
fain
to
hide
beneath
their
souls
*punct* ,
and
not
sprout
forth
a
single
spear
or
leaf
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
foreshadowing
interval
too
*punct* ,
all
humor
*punct* ,
forced
or
natural
*punct* ,
vanished
*punct* .
*break*
stubb
no
more
strove
to
raise
a
smile
*punct* ;
starbuck
no
more
strove
to
check
one
*punct* .
*break*
alike
*punct* ,
joy
and
sorrow
*punct* ,
hope
and
fear
*punct* ,
seemed
ground
to
finest
dust
*punct* ,
and
powdered
*punct* ,
for
the
time
*punct* ,
in
the
clamped
mortar
of
ahab's
iron
soul
*punct* .
*break*
like
machines
*punct* ,
they
dumbly
moved
about
the
deck
*punct* ,
ever
conscious
that
the
old
man's
despot
eye
was
on
them
*punct* .
*break*
but
did
you
deeply
scan
him
in
his
more
secret
confidential
hours
*punct* ;
when
he
thought
no
glance
but
one
was
on
him
*punct* ;
then
you
would
have
seen
that
even
as
ahab's
eyes
so
awed
the
crew's
*punct* ,
the
inscrutable
parsee's
glance
awed
his
*punct* ;
or
somehow
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
in
some
wild
way
*punct* ,
at
times
affected
it
*punct* .
*break*
such
an
added
*punct* ,
gliding
strangeness
began
to
invest
the
thin
fedallah
now
*punct* ;
such
ceaseless
shudderings
shook
him
*punct* ;
that
the
men
looked
dubious
at
him
*punct* ;
half
uncertain
*punct* ,
as
it
seemed
*punct* ,
whether
indeed
he
were
a
mortal
substance
*punct* ,
or
else
a
tremulous
shadow
cast
upon
the
deck
by
some
unseen
being's
body
*punct* .
*break*
and
that
shadow
was
always
hovering
there
*punct* .
*break*
for
not
by
night
*punct* ,
even
*punct* ,
had
fedallah
ever
certainly
been
known
to
slumber
*punct* ,
or
go
below
*punct* .
*break*
he
would
stand
still
for
hours
*punct* :
but
never
sat
or
leaned
*punct* ;
his
wan
but
wondrous
eyes
did
plainly
say
*punct* ,
we
two
watchmen
never
rest
*punct* .
*break*
the
clothes
that
the
night
had
wet
*punct* ,
the
next
day's
sunshine
dried
upon
him
*punct* ;
and
so
*punct* ,
day
after
day
*punct* ,
and
night
after
night
*punct* ;
he
went
no
more
beneath
the
planks
*punct* ;
whatever
he
wanted
from
the
cabin
that
thing
he
sent
for
*punct* .
*break*
he
ate
in
the
same
open
air
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
his
two
only
meals,
*punct* ,
breakfast
and
dinner
*punct* :
supper
he
never
touched
*punct* ;
nor
reaped
his
beard
*punct* ;
which
darkly
grew
all
gnarled
*punct* ,
as
unearthed
roots
of
trees
blown
over
*punct* ,
which
still
grow
idly
on
at
naked
base
*punct* ,
though
perished
in
the
upper
verdure
*punct* .
*break*
but
though
his
whole
life
was
now
become
one
watch
on
deck
*punct* ;
and
though
the
parsee's
mystic
watch
was
without
intermission
as
his
own
*punct* ;
yet
these
two
never
seemed
to
speak
*punct* ,
one
man
to
the
other
*punct* ,
unless
at
long
intervals
some
passing
unmomentous
matter
made
it
necessary
*punct* .
*break*
though
such
a
potent
spell
seemed
secretly
to
join
the
twain
*punct* ;
openly
*punct* ,
and
to
the
awe-struck
crew
*punct* ,
they
seemed
pole-like
asunder
*punct* .
*break*
if
by
day
they
chanced
to
speak
one
word
*punct* ;
by
night
*punct* ,
dumb
men
were
both
*punct* ,
so
far
as
concerned
the
slightest
verbal
interchange
*punct* .
*break*
at
times
*punct* ,
for
longest
hours
*punct* ,
without
a
single
hail
*punct* ,
they
stood
far
parted
in
the
starlight
*punct* ;
ahab
in
his
scuttle
*punct* ,
the
parsee
by
the
mainmast
*punct* ;
but
still
fixedly
gazing
upon
each
other
*punct* ;
as
if
in
the
parsee
ahab
saw
his
forethrown
shadow
*punct* ,
in
ahab
the
parsee
his
abandoned
substance
*punct* .
*break*
and
yet
*punct* ,
somehow
*punct* ,
did
ahab
*punct* ,
in
his
own
proper
self
*punct* ,
as
daily
*punct* ,
hourly
*punct* ,
and
every
instant
*punct* ,
commandingly
revealed
to
his
subordinates,
*punct* ,
ahab
seemed
an
independent
lord
*punct* ;
the
parsee
but
his
slave
*punct* .
*break*
for
be
this
parsee
what
he
may
*punct* ,
all
rib
and
keel
was
solid
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
first
faintest
glimmering
of
the
dawn
*punct* ,
his
iron
voice
was
heard
from
aft
*punct* ,
man
the
mast-heads!
*punct* ,
and
all
through
the
day
*punct* ,
till
after
sunset
and
after
twilight
*punct* ,
the
same
voice
every
hour
*punct* ,
at
the
striking
of
the
helmsman's
bell
*punct* ,
was
heard
*punct* ,
what
d'ye
see?
*punct* ,
sharp
*punct* !
*break*
but
when
three
or
four
days
had
slided
by
*punct* ,
after
meeting
the
children-seeking
rachel
*punct* ;
and
no
spout
had
yet
been
seen
*punct* ;
the
monomaniac
old
man
seemed
distrustful
of
his
crew's
fidelity
*punct* ;
at
least
*punct* ,
of
nearly
all
except
the
pagan
harpooneers
*punct* ;
he
seemed
to
doubt
*punct* ,
even
*punct* ,
whether
stubb
and
flask
might
not
willingly
overlook
the
sight
he
sought
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
these
suspicions
were
really
his
*punct* ,
he
sagaciously
refrained
from
verbally
expressing
them
*punct* ,
however
his
actions
might
seem
to
hint
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
have
the
first
sight
of
the
whale
myself,
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
must
have
the
doubloon
*punct* !
*break*
and
with
his
own
hands
he
rigged
a
nest
of
basketed
bowlines
*punct* ;
and
sending
a
hand
aloft
*punct* ,
with
a
single
sheaved
block
*punct* ,
to
secure
to
the
main-mast
head
*punct* ,
he
received
the
two
ends
of
the
downward-reeved
rope
*punct* ;
and
attaching
one
to
his
basket
prepared
a
pin
for
the
other
end
*punct* ,
in
order
to
fasten
it
at
the
rail
*punct* .
*break*
this
done
*punct* ,
with
that
end
yet
in
his
hand
and
standing
beside
the
pin
*punct* ,
he
looked
round
upon
his
crew
*punct* ,
sweeping
from
one
to
the
other
*punct* ;
pausing
his
glance
long
upon
daggoo
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
tashtego
*punct* ;
but
shunning
fedallah
*punct* ;
and
then
settling
his
firm
relying
eye
upon
the
chief
mate
*punct* ,
said,
*punct* ,
take
the
rope
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
i
give
it
into
thy
hands
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* .
*break*
then
arranging
his
person
in
the
basket
*punct* ,
he
gave
the
word
for
them
to
hoist
him
to
his
perch
*punct* ,
starbuck
being
the
one
who
secured
the
rope
at
last
*punct* ;
and
afterwards
stood
near
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
thus
*punct* ,
with
one
hand
clinging
round
the
royal
mast
*punct* ,
ahab
gazed
abroad
upon
the
sea
for
miles
and
miles,
*punct* ,
ahead
*punct* ,
astern
*punct* ,
this
side
*punct* ,
and
that,
*punct* ,
within
the
wide
expanded
circle
commanded
at
so
great
a
height
*punct* .
*break*
because
in
such
a
wilderness
of
running
rigging
*punct* ,
whose
various
different
relations
aloft
cannot
always
be
infallibly
discerned
by
what
is
seen
of
them
at
the
deck
*punct* ;
and
when
the
deck-ends
of
these
ropes
are
being
every
few
minutes
cast
down
from
the
fastenings
*punct* ,
it
would
be
but
a
natural
fatality
*punct* ,
if
*punct* ,
unprovided
with
a
constant
watchman
*punct* ,
the
hoisted
sailor
should
by
some
carelessness
of
the
crew
be
cast
adrift
and
fall
all
swooping
to
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
so
ahab's
proceedings
in
this
matter
were
not
unusual
*punct* ;
the
only
strange
thing
about
them
seemed
to
be
*punct* ,
that
starbuck
*punct* ,
almost
the
one
only
man
who
had
ever
ventured
to
oppose
him
with
anything
in
the
slightest
degree
approaching
to
decision
*punct* ,
one
of
those
too
*punct* ,
whose
faithfulness
on
the
look-out
he
had
seemed
to
doubt
somewhat;
*punct* ,
it
was
strange
*punct* ,
that
this
was
the
very
man
he
should
select
for
his
watchman
*punct* ;
freely
giving
his
whole
life
into
such
an
otherwise
distrusted
person's
hands
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
the
first
time
ahab
was
perched
aloft
*punct* ;
ere
he
had
been
there
ten
minutes
*punct* ;
one
of
those
red-billed
savage
sea-hawks
which
so
often
fly
incommodiously
close
round
the
manned
mast-heads
of
whalemen
in
these
latitudes
*punct* ;
one
of
these
birds
came
wheeling
and
screaming
round
his
head
in
a
maze
of
untrackably
swift
circlings
*punct* .
*break*
then
it
darted
a
thousand
feet
straight
up
into
the
air
*punct* ;
then
spiralized
downwards
*punct* ,
and
went
eddying
again
round
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
but
with
his
gaze
fixed
upon
the
dim
and
distant
horizon
*punct* ,
ahab
seemed
not
to
mark
this
wild
bird
*punct* ;
nor
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
would
any
one
else
have
marked
it
much
*punct* ,
it
being
no
uncommon
circumstance
*punct* ;
only
now
almost
the
least
heedful
eye
seemed
to
see
some
sort
of
cunning
meaning
in
almost
every
sight
*punct* .
*break*
your
hat
*punct* ,
your
hat
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
suddenly
cried
the
sicilian
seaman
*punct* ,
who
being
posted
at
the
mizen-mast-head
*punct* ,
stood
directly
behind
ahab
*punct* ,
though
somewhat
lower
than
his
level
*punct* ,
and
with
a
deep
gulf
of
air
dividing
them
*punct* .
*break*
but
only
by
the
replacing
of
the
cap
was
that
omen
accounted
good
*punct* .
*break*
as
she
drew
nigh
*punct* ,
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
broad
beams
*punct* ,
called
shears
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
in
some
whaling-ships
*punct* ,
cross
the
quarter-deck
at
the
height
of
eight
or
nine
feet
*punct* ;
serving
to
carry
the
spare
*punct* ,
unrigged
*punct* ,
or
disabled
boats
*punct* .
*break*
upon
the
stranger's
shears
were
beheld
the
shattered
*punct* ,
white
ribs
*punct* ,
and
some
few
splintered
planks
*punct* ,
of
what
had
once
been
a
whale-boat
*punct* ;
but
you
now
saw
through
this
wreck
*punct* ,
as
plainly
as
you
see
through
the
peeled
*punct* ,
half-unhinged
*punct* ,
and
bleaching
skeleton
of
a
horse
*punct* .
*break*
hast
seen
the
white
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
replied
the
hollow-cheeked
captain
from
his
taffrail
*punct* ;
and
with
his
trumpet
he
pointed
to
the
wreck
*punct* .
*break*
hast
killed
him
*punct* ?
*break*
the
harpoon
is
not
yet
forged
that
will
ever
do
that
*punct* ,
answered
the
other
*punct* ,
sadly
glancing
upon
a
rounded
hammock
on
the
deck
*punct* ,
whose
gathered
sides
some
noiseless
sailors
were
busy
in
sewing
together
*punct* .
*break*
tempered
in
blood
*punct* ,
and
tempered
by
lightning
are
these
barbs
*punct* ;
and
i
swear
to
temper
them
triply
in
that
hot
place
behind
the
fin
*punct* ,
where
the
white
whale
most
feels
his
accursed
life
*punct* !
*break*
then
god
keep
thee
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ,
see'st
thou
that
*punct* ,
pointing
to
the
hammock
*punct* ,
i
bury
but
one
of
five
stout
men
*punct* ,
who
were
alive
only
yesterday
*punct* ;
but
were
dead
ere
night
*punct* .
*break*
only
that
one
i
bury
*punct* ;
the
rest
were
buried
before
they
died
*punct* ;
you
sail
upon
their
tomb
*punct* .
*break*
then
turning
to
his
crew
*punct* ,
are
ye
ready
there
*punct* ?
*break*
place
the
plank
then
on
the
rail
*punct* ,
and
lift
the
body
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
god
*punct* ,
advancing
towards
the
hammock
with
uplifted
hands
*punct* ,
may
the
resurrection
and
the
life
*punct* ,
brace
forward
*punct* !
*break*
cried
ahab
like
lightning
to
his
men
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
suddenly
started
pequod
was
not
quick
enough
to
escape
the
sound
of
the
splash
that
the
corpse
soon
made
as
it
struck
the
sea
*punct* ;
not
so
quick
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
but
that
some
of
the
flying
bubbles
might
have
sprinkled
her
hull
with
their
ghostly
baptism
*punct* .
*break*
as
ahab
now
glided
from
the
dejected
delight
*punct* ,
the
strange
life-buoy
hanging
at
the
pequod's
stern
came
into
conspicuous
relief
*punct* .
*break*
look
yonder
*punct* ,
men
*punct* !
*break*
cried
a
foreboding
voice
in
her
wake
*punct* .
*break*
in
vain
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
ye
strangers
*punct* ,
ye
fly
our
sad
burial
*punct* ;
ye
but
turn
us
your
taffrail
to
show
us
your
coffin
*punct* !
*break*
but
though
thus
contrasting
within
*punct* ,
the
contrast
was
only
in
shades
and
shadows
without
*punct* ;
those
two
seemed
one
*punct* ;
it
was
only
the
sex
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ,
that
distinguished
them
*punct* .
*break*
aloft
*punct* ,
like
a
royal
czar
and
king
*punct* ,
the
sun
seemed
giving
this
gentle
air
to
this
bold
and
rolling
sea
*punct* ;
even
as
bride
to
groom
*punct* .
*break*
and
at
the
girdling
line
of
the
horizon
*punct* ,
a
soft
and
tremulous
motion
*punct* ,
most
seen
here
at
the
equator
*punct* ,
denoted
the
fond
*punct* ,
throbbing
trust
*punct* ,
the
loving
alarms
*punct* ,
with
which
the
poor
bride
gave
her
bosom
away
*punct* .
*break*
tied
up
and
twisted
*punct* ;
gnarled
and
knotted
with
wrinkles
*punct* ;
haggardly
firm
and
unyielding
*punct* ;
his
eyes
glowing
like
coals
*punct* ,
that
still
glow
in
the
ashes
of
ruin
*punct* ;
untottering
ahab
stood
forth
in
the
clearness
of
the
morn
*punct* ;
lifting
his
splintered
helmet
of
a
brow
to
the
fair
girl's
forehead
of
heaven
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
immortal
infancy
*punct* ,
and
innocency
of
the
azure
*punct* !
*break*
invisible
winged
creatures
that
frolic
all
round
us
*punct* !
*break*
sweet
childhood
of
air
and
sky
*punct* !
*break*
how
oblivious
were
ye
of
old
ahab's
close-coiled
woe
*punct* !
*break*
but
so
have
i
seen
little
miriam
and
martha
*punct* ,
laughing-eyed
elves
*punct* ,
heedlessly
gambol
around
their
old
sire
*punct* ;
sporting
with
the
circle
of
singed
locks
which
grew
on
the
marge
of
that
burnt-out
crater
of
his
brain
*punct* .
*break*
slowly
crossing
the
deck
from
the
scuttle
*punct* ,
ahab
leaned
over
the
side
*punct* ,
and
watched
how
his
shadow
in
the
water
sank
and
sank
to
his
gaze
*punct* ,
the
more
and
the
more
that
he
strove
to
pierce
the
profundity
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
lovely
aromas
in
that
enchanted
air
did
at
last
seem
to
dispel
*punct* ,
for
a
moment
*punct* ,
the
cankerous
thing
in
his
soul
*punct* .
*break*
from
beneath
his
slouched
hat
ahab
dropped
a
tear
into
the
sea
*punct* ;
nor
did
all
the
pacific
contain
such
wealth
as
that
one
wee
drop
*punct* .
*break*
starbuck
saw
the
old
man
*punct* ;
saw
him
*punct* ,
how
he
heavily
leaned
over
the
side
*punct* ;
and
he
seemed
to
hear
in
his
own
true
heart
the
measureless
sobbing
that
stole
out
of
the
centre
of
the
serenity
around
*punct* .
*break*
careful
not
to
touch
him
*punct* ,
or
be
noticed
by
him
*punct* ,
he
yet
drew
near
to
him
*punct* ,
and
stood
there
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* !
*break*
it
is
a
mild
*punct* ,
mild
wind
*punct* ,
and
a
mild
looking
sky
*punct* .
*break*
on
such
a
day
*punct* ,
very
much
such
a
sweetness
as
this
*punct* ,
i
struck
my
first
whale
*punct* ,
a
boy-harpooneer
of
eighteen
*punct* !
*break*
forty
*punct* ,
forty
*punct* ,
forty
years
ago!
*punct* ,
ago
*punct* !
*break*
forty
years
of
continual
whaling
*punct* !
*break*
forty
years
of
privation
*punct* ,
and
peril
*punct* ,
and
storm-time
*punct* !
*break*
forty
years
on
the
pitiless
sea
*punct* !
*break*
for
forty
years
has
ahab
forsaken
the
peaceful
land
*punct* ,
for
forty
years
to
make
war
on
the
horrors
of
the
deep
*punct* !
*break*
aye
and
yes
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* ,
out
of
those
forty
years
i
have
not
spent
three
ashore
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
think
of
this
life
i
have
led
*punct* ;
the
desolation
of
solitude
it
has
been
*punct* ;
the
masoned
*punct* ,
walled-town
of
a
captain's
exclusiveness
*punct* ,
which
admits
but
small
entrance
to
any
sympathy
from
the
green
country
without
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
weariness
*punct* !
*break*
guinea-coast
slavery
of
solitary
command!
*punct* ,
when
i
think
of
all
this
*punct* ;
only
half-suspected
*punct* ,
not
so
keenly
known
to
me
before
*punct* ,
and
how
for
forty
years
i
have
fed
upon
dry
salted
fare
*punct* ,
fit
emblem
of
the
dry
nourishment
of
my
soul
*punct* ,
when
the
poorest
landsman
has
had
fresh
fruit
to
his

the

with

furiously

stand

i

they

morning

*break*
about
this
time
*punct* ,
yes
*punct* ,
it
is
his
noon
nap
now
*punct* ,
the
boy
vivaciously
wakes
*punct* ;
sits
up
in
bed
*punct* ;
and
his
mother
tells
him
of
me
*punct* ,
of
cannibal
old
me
*punct* ;
how
i
am
abroad
upon
the
deep
*punct* ,
but
will
yet
come
back
to
dance

again
*punct* .
*break*
tis

*punct* ,
my
mary
herself
*punct* !
*break*
she
promised
that
my
boy
*punct* ,
every
morning
*punct* ,
should
be
carried
to
the
hill
to
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
his
father's
sail
*punct* !
*break*
yes

yes

*break*
it

*break*
the
boy's
face
from
the
window
*punct* !
*break*
the
boy's
hand
on
the
hill
*punct* !
*break*
but
ahab's
glance
was
averted
*punct* ;
like
a
blighted
fruit
tree
he
shook
*punct* ,
and
cast
his
last
*punct* ,
cindered
apple
to
the
soil
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
it
*punct* ,
what
nameless
*punct* ,
inscrutable
*punct* ,
unearthly
thing
is
it
*punct* ;
what
cozzening
*punct* ,
hidden
lord

master
*punct* ,
and
cruel
*punct* ,
remorseless
emperor
commands
me
*punct* ;
that
against
all
natural
lovings

*punct* ,
i
so
keep
pushing
*punct* ,
and
crowding
*punct* ,
and
jamming
myself
on
all
the
time
*punct* ;
recklessly
making
me
ready
to
do
what
in
my
own
proper
*punct* ,
natural
heart
*punct* ,
i
durst
not
so
much

*break*
but
if

is
as
an
errand-boy
in

*punct* ;
nor
one

but
by
some
invisible
power
*punct* ;
how
then
can
this
one
small
heart
beat
*punct* ;
this
one
small
brain
think
thoughts
*punct* ;
unless
god
does
that
beating

does

*break*
by
heaven
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
we
are
turned
round
and
round
in
this
world
*punct* ,
like
yonder
windlass
*punct* ,
and
fate
is
the
handspike
*punct* .
*break*
and
all
the
time
*punct* ,
lo
*punct* !
*break*
that
smiling
sky
*punct* ,
and
this
unsounded
sea
*punct* !
*break*
see

*break*
who
put

into
him
to
chase

that
flying-fish
*punct* ?
*break*
where
do
murderers
go

*break*
who's
to
doom
*punct* ,
when
the
judge
himself
is
dragged
to
the
bar
*punct* ?
*break*
but
it
is
a
mild
*punct* ,
mild
wind
*punct* ,
and
a
mild
looking
sky
*punct* ;
and
the
air
smells
now
*punct* ,
as
if
it
blew
from
a
far-away
meadow
*punct* ;
they
have
been
making
hay
somewhere
under
the
slopes
of
the
andes
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* ,
and
the
mowers
are
sleeping
among
the
new-mown
hay
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
toil
we
how
we
may
*punct* ,
we
all
sleep
at
last
on
the
field
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
and
rust
amid
greenness
*punct* ;
as
last
year's
scythes
flung
down
*punct* ,
and
left
in
the
half-cut
swaths
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* !
*break*
but
blanched
to
a
corpse's
hue
with
despair
*punct* ,
the
mate
had
stolen
away
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
crossed
the
deck
to
gaze
over
on
the
other
side
*punct* ;
but
started
at
two
reflected
*punct* ,
fixed
eyes
in
the
water
there
*punct* .
*break*
he
declared
that
a
whale
must
be
near
*punct* .
*break*
soon
that
peculiar
odor
*punct* ,
sometimes
to
a
great
distance
given
forth
by
the
living
sperm
whale
*punct* ,
was
palpable
to
all
the
watch
*punct* ;
nor
was
any
mariner
surprised
when
*punct* ,
after
inspecting
the
compass
*punct* ,
and
then
the
dog-vane
*punct* ,
and
then
ascertaining
the
precise
bearing
of
the
odor
as
nearly
as
possible
*punct* ,
ahab
rapidly
ordered
the
ship's
course
to
be
slightly
altered
*punct* ,
and
the
sail
to
be
shortened
*punct* .
*break*
the
acute
policy
dictating
these
movements
was
sufficiently
vindicated
at
daybreak
*punct* ,
by
the
sight
of
a
long
sleek
on
the
sea
directly
and
lengthwise
ahead
*punct* ,
smooth
as
oil
*punct* ,
and
resembling
in
the
pleated
watery
wrinkles
bordering
it
*punct* ,
the
polished
metallic-like
marks
of
some
swift
tide-rip
*punct* ,
at
the
mouth
of
a
deep
*punct* ,
rapid
stream
*punct* .
*break*
man
the
mast-heads
*punct* !
*break*
call
all
hands
*punct* !
*break*
thundering
with
the
butts
of
three
clubbed
handspikes
on
the
forecastle
deck
*punct* ,
daggoo
roused
the
sleepers
with
such
judgment
claps
that
they
seemed
to
exhale
from
the
scuttle
*punct* ,
so
instantaneously
did
they
appear
with
their
clothes
in
their
hands
*punct* .
*break*
what
d'ye
see
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
flattening
his
face
to
the
sky
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
*punct* ,
nothing
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
was
the
sound
hailing
down
in
reply
*punct* .
*break*
t'gallant
sails!
*punct* ,
stunsails
*punct* !
*break*
alow
and
aloft
*punct* ,
and
on
both
sides
*punct* !
*break*
a
hump
like
a
snow-hill
*punct* !
*break*
it
is
moby
dick
*punct* !
*break*
fired
by
the
cry
which
seemed
simultaneously
taken
up
by
the
three
look-outs
*punct* ,
the
men
on
deck
rushed
to
the
rigging
to
behold
the
famous
whale
they
had
so
long
been
pursuing
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
had
now
gained
his
final
perch
*punct* ,
some
feet
above
the
other
look-outs
*punct* ,
tashtego
standing
just
beneath
him
on
the
cap
of
the
top-gallant
mast
*punct* ,
so
that
the
indian's
head
was
almost
on
a
level
with
ahab's
heel
*punct* .
*break*
from
this
height
the
whale
was
now
seen
some
mile
or
so
ahead
*punct* ,
at
every
roll
of
the
sea
revealing
his
high
sparkling
hump
*punct* ,
and
regularly
jetting
his
silent
spout
into
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
credulous
mariners
it
seemed
the
same
silent
spout
they
had
so
long
ago
beheld
in
the
moonlit
atlantic
and
indian
oceans
*punct* .
*break*
and
did
none
of
ye
see
it
before
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
hailing
the
perched
men
all
around
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
him
almost
that
same
instant
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
that
captain
ahab
did
*punct* ,
and
i
cried
out
*punct* ,
said
tashtego
*punct* .
*break*
not
the
same
instant
*punct* ;
not
the
same
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
the
doubloon
is
mine
*punct* ,
fate
reserved
the
doubloon
for
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
only
*punct* ;
none
of
ye
could
have
raised
the
white
whale
first
*punct* .
*break*
there
she
blows
*punct* !
*break*
there
she
blows!
*punct* ,
there
she
blows
*punct* !
*break*
there
again!
*punct* ,
there
again
*punct* !
*break*
he
cried
*punct* ,
in
long-drawn
*punct* ,
lingering
*punct* ,
methodic
tones
*punct* ,
attuned
to
the
gradual
prolongings
of
the
whale's
visible
jets
*punct* .
*break*
he's
going
to
sound
*punct* !
*break*
stand
by
three
boats
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ,
remember
*punct* ,
stay
on
board
*punct* ,
and
keep
the
ship
*punct* .
*break*
luff
*punct* ,
luff
a
point
*punct* !
*break*
so
*punct* ;
steady
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
steady
*punct* !
*break*
there
go
flukes
*punct* !
*break*
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ;
only
black
water
*punct* !
*break*
all
ready
the
boats
there
*punct* ?
*break*
stand
by
*punct* ,
stand
by
*punct* !
*break*
lower
me
*punct* ,
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ;
lower
*punct* ,
lower,
*punct* ,
quick
*punct* ,
quicker
*punct* !
*break*
and
he
slid
through
the
air
to
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
heading
straight
to
leeward
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
cried
stubb
*punct* ,
right
away
from
us
*punct* ;
cannot
have
seen
the
ship
yet
*punct* .
*break*
be
dumb
*punct* ,
man
*punct* !
*break*
stand
by
the
braces
*punct* !
*break*
hard
down
the
helm!
*punct* ,
brace
up
*punct* !
*break*
shiver

*punct* ,
shiver
her
*punct* !
*break*
so
*punct* ;
well
that
*punct* !
*break*
boats
*punct* ,
boats
*punct* !
*break*
soon
all
the
boats
but
starbuck's
were
dropped
*punct* ;
all
the
boat-sails
set
*punct* ,
all
the
paddles
plying
*punct* ;
with
rippling
swiftness
*punct* ,
shooting
to
leeward
*punct* ;
and
ahab
heading
the
onset
*punct* .
*break*
like
noiseless
nautilus
shells
*punct* ,
their
light
prows
sped
through
the
sea
*punct* ;
but
only
slowly
they
neared
the
foe
*punct* .
*break*
as
they
neared
him
*punct* ,
the
ocean
grew
still
more
smooth
*punct* ;
seemed
drawing
a
carpet
over
its
waves
*punct* ;
seemed
a
noon-meadow
*punct* ,
so
serenely
it
spread
*punct* .
*break*
at
length
the
breathless
hunter
came
so
nigh
his
seemingly
unsuspecting
prey
*punct* ,
that
his
entire
dazzling
hump
was
distinctly
visible
*punct* ,
sliding
along
the
sea
as
if
an
isolated
thing
*punct* ,
and
continually
set
in
a
revolving
ring
of
finest
*punct* ,
fleecy
*punct* ,
greenish
foam
*punct* .
*break*
he
saw
the
vast
*punct* ,
involved
wrinkles
of
the
slightly
projecting
head
beyond
*punct* .
*break*
before
it
*punct* ,
far
out
on
the
soft
turkish-rugged
waters
*punct* ,
went
the
glistening
white
shadow
from
his
broad
*punct* ,
milky
forehead
*punct* ,
a
musical
rippling
playfully
accompanying
the
shade
*punct* ;
and
behind
*punct* ,
the
blue
waters
interchangeably
flowed
over
into
the
moving
valley
of
his
steady
wake
*punct* ;
and
on
either
hand
bright
bubbles
arose
and
danced
by
his
side
*punct* .
*break*
but
these
were
broken
again
by
the
light
toes
of
hundreds
of
gay
fowl
softly
feathering
the
sea
*punct* ,
alternate
with
their
fitful
flight
*punct* ;
and
like
to
some
flag-staff
rising
from
the
painted
hull
of
an
argosy
*punct* ,
the
tall
but
shattered
pole
of
a
recent
lance
projected
from
the
white
whale's
back
*punct* ;
and
at
intervals
one
of
the
cloud
of
soft-toed
fowls
hovering
*punct* ,
and
to
and
fro
skimming
like
a
canopy
over
the
fish
*punct* ,
silently
perched
and
rocked
on
this
pole
*punct* ,
the
long
tail
feathers
streaming
like
pennons
*punct* .
*break*
a
gentle
joyousness
*punct* ,
a
mighty
mildness
of
repose
in
swiftness
*punct* ,
invested
the
gliding
whale
*punct* .
*break*
not
the
white
bull
jupiter
swimming
away
with
ravished
europa
clinging
to
his
graceful
horns
*punct* ;
his
lovely
*punct* ,
leering
eyes
sideways
intent
upon
the
maid
*punct* ;
with
smooth
bewitching
fleetness
*punct* ,
rippling
straight
for
the
nuptial
bower
in
crete
*punct* ;
not
jove
*punct* ,
not
that
great
majesty
supreme
*punct* !
*break*
did
surpass
the
glorified
white
whale
as
he
so
divinely
swam
*punct* .
*break*
on
each
soft
side
*punct* ,
coincident
with
the
parted
swell
*punct* ,
that
but
once
leaving
him
*punct* ,
then
flowed
so
wide
away
*punct* ,
on
each
bright
side
*punct* ,
the
whale
shed
off
enticings
*punct* .
*break*
yet
calm
*punct* ,
enticing
calm
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
whale
*punct* !
*break*
thou
glidest
on
*punct* ,
to
all
who
for
the
first
time
eye
thee
*punct* ,
no
matter
how
many
in
that
same
way
thou
may'st
have
bejuggled
and
destroyed
before
*punct* .
*break*
and
thus
*punct* ,
through
the
serene
tranquillities
of
the
tropical
sea
*punct* ,
among
waves
whose
hand-clappings
were
suspended
by
exceeding
rapture
*punct* ,
moby
dick
moved
on
*punct* ,
still
withholding
from
sight
the
full
terrors
of
his
submerged
trunk
*punct* ,
entirely
hiding
the
wrenched
hideousness
of
his
jaw
*punct* .
*break*
but
soon
the
fore
part
of
him
slowly
rose
from
the
water
*punct* ;
for
an
instant
his
whole
marbleized
body
formed
a
high
arch
*punct* ,
like
virginia's
natural
bridge
*punct* ,
and
warningly
waving
his
bannered
flukes
in
the
air
*punct* ,
the
grand
god
revealed
himself
*punct* ,
sounded
*punct* ,
and
went
out
of
sight
*punct* .
*break*
hoveringly
halting
*punct* ,
and
dipping
on
the
wing
*punct* ,
the
white
sea-fowls
longingly
lingered
over
the
agitated
pool
that
he
left
*punct* .
*break*
with
oars
apeak
*punct* ,
and
paddles
down
*punct* ,
the
sheets
of
their
sails
adrift
*punct* ,
the
three
boats
now
stilly
floated
*punct* ,
awaiting
moby
dick's
reappearance
*punct* .
*break*
an
hour
*punct* ,
said
ahab
*punct* ,
standing
rooted
in
his
boat's
stern
*punct* ;
and
he
gazed
beyond
the
whale's
place
*punct* ,
towards
the
dim
blue
spaces
and
wide
wooing
vacancies
to
leeward
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
only
an
instant
*punct* ;
for
again
his
eyes
seemed
whirling
round
in
his
head
as
he
swept
the
watery
circle
*punct* .
*break*
the
breeze
now
freshened
*punct* ;
the
sea
began
to
swell
*punct* .
*break*
the
birds!
*punct* ,
the
birds
*punct* !
*break*
in
long
indian
file
*punct* ,
as
when
herons
take
wing
*punct* ,
the
white
birds
were
now
all
flying
towards
ahab's
boat
*punct* ;
and
when
within
a
few
yards
began
fluttering
over
the
water
there
*punct* ,
wheeling
round
and
round
*punct* ,
with
joyous
*punct* ,
expectant
cries
*punct* .
*break*
their
vision
was
keener
than
man's
*punct* ;
ahab
could
discover
no
sign
in
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
but
suddenly
as
he
peered
down
and
down
into
its
depths
*punct* ,
he
profoundly
saw
a
white
living
spot
no
bigger
than
a
white
weasel
*punct* ,
with
wonderful
celerity
uprising
*punct* ,
and
magnifying
as
it
rose
*punct* ,
till
it
turned
*punct* ,
and
then
there
were
plainly
revealed
two
long
crooked
rows
of
white
*punct* ,
glistening
teeth
*punct* ,
floating
up
from
the
undiscoverable
bottom
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
moby
dick's
open
mouth
and
scrolled
jaw
*punct* ;
his
vast
*punct* ,
shadowed
bulk
still
half
blending
with
the
blue
of
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
calling
upon
fedallah
to
change
places
with
him
*punct* ,
went
forward
to
the
bows
*punct* ,
and
seizing
perth's
harpoon
*punct* ,
commanded
his
crew
to
grasp
their
oars
and
stand
by
to
stern
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
by
reason
of
this
timely
spinning
round
the
boat
upon
its
axis
*punct* ,
its
bow
*punct* ,
by
anticipation
*punct* ,
was
made
to
face
the
whale's
head
while
yet
under
water
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
if
perceiving
this
strategem
*punct* ,
moby
dick
*punct* ,
with
that
malicious
intelligence
ascribed
to
him
*punct* ,
sidelingly
transplanted
himself
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ,
in
an
instant
*punct* ,
shooting
his
pleated
head
lengthwise
beneath
the
boat
*punct* .
*break*
through
and
through
*punct* ;
through
every
plank
and
each
rib
*punct* ,
it
thrilled
for
an
instant
*punct* ,
the
whale
obliquely
lying
on
his
back
*punct* ,
in
the
manner
of
a
biting
shark
*punct* ,
slowly
and
feelingly
taking
its
bows
full
within
his
mouth
*punct* ,
so
that
the
long
*punct* ,
narrow
*punct* ,
scrolled
lower
jaw
curled
high
up
into
the
open
air
*punct* ,
and
one
of
the
teeth
caught
in
a
row-lock
*punct* .
*break*
the
bluish
pearl-white
of
the
inside
of
the
jaw
was
within
six
inches
of
ahab's
head
*punct* ,
and
reached
higher
than
that
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
attitude
the
white
whale
now
shook
the
slight
cedar
as
a
mildly
cruel
cat
her
mouse
*punct* .
*break*
with
unastonished
eyes
fedallah
gazed
*punct* ,
and
crossed
his
arms
*punct* ;
but
the
tiger-yellow
crew
were
tumbling
over
each
other's
heads
to
gain
the
uttermost
stern
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
*punct* ,
while
both
elastic
gunwales
were
springing
in
and
out
*punct* ,
as
the
whale
dallied
with
the
doomed
craft
in
this
devilish
way
*punct* ;
and
from
his
body
being
submerged
beneath
the
boat
*punct* ,
he
could
not
be
darted
at
from
the
bows
*punct* ,
for
the
bows
were
almost
inside
of
him
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ;
and
while
the
other
boats
involuntarily
paused
*punct* ,
as
before
a
quick
crisis
impossible
to
withstand
*punct* ,
then
it
was
that
monomaniac
ahab
*punct* ,
furious
with
this
tantalizing
vicinity
of
his
foe
*punct* ,
which
placed
him
all
alive
and
helpless
in
the
very
jaws
he
hated
*punct* ;
frenzied
with
all
this
*punct* ,
he
seized
the
long
bone
with
his
naked
hands
*punct* ,
and
wildly
strove
to
wrench
it
from
its
gripe
*punct* .
*break*
these
floated
aside
*punct* ,
the
broken
ends
drooping
*punct* ,
the
crew
at
the
stern-wreck
clinging
to
the
gunwales
*punct* ,
and
striving
to
hold
fast
to
the
oars
to
lash
them
across
*punct* .
*break*
at
that
preluding
moment
*punct* ,
ere
the
boat
was
yet
snapped
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* ,
the
first
to
perceive
the
whale's
intent
*punct* ,
by
the
crafty
upraising
of
his
head
*punct* ,
a
movement
that
loosed
his
hold
for
the
time
*punct* ;
at
that
moment
his
hand
had
made
one
final
effort
to
push
the
boat
out
of
the
bite
*punct* .
*break*
but
only
slipping
further
into
the
whale's
mouth
*punct* ,
and
tilting
over
sideways
as
it
slipped
*punct* ,
the
boat
had
shaken
off
his
hold
on
the
jaw
*punct* ;
spilled
him
out
of
it
*punct* ,
as
he
leaned
to
the
push
*punct* ;
and
so
he
fell
flat-faced
upon
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
ripplingly
withdrawing
from
his
prey
*punct* ,
moby
dick
now
lay
at
a
little
distance
*punct* ,
vertically
thrusting
his
oblong
white
head
up
and
down
in
the
billows
*punct* ;
and
at
the
same
time
slowly
revolving
his
whole
spindled
body
*punct* ;
so
that
when
his
vast
wrinkled
forehead
rose
*punct* ,
some
twenty
or
more
feet
out
of
the
water
*punct* ,
the
now
rising
swells
*punct* ,
with
all
their
confluent
waves
*punct* ,
dazzlingly
broke
against
it
*punct* ;
vindictively
tossing
their
shivered
spray
still
higher
into
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
in
a
gale
*punct* ,
the
but
half-baffled
channel
billows
only
recoil
from
the
base
of
the
eddystone
*punct* ,
triumphantly
to
overleap
its
summit
with
their
scud
*punct* .
*break*
but
soon
resuming
his
horizontal
attitude
*punct* ,
moby
dick
swam
swiftly
round
and
round
the
wrecked
crew
*punct* ;
sideways
churning
the
water
in
his
vengeful
wake
*punct* ,
as
if
lashing
himself
up
to
still
another
and
more
deadly
assault
*punct* .
*break*
the
sight
of
the
splintered
boat
seemed
to
madden
him
*punct* ,
as
the
blood
of
grapes
and
mulberries
cast
before
antiochus's
elephants
in
the
book
of
maccabees
*punct* .
*break*
meanwhile
ahab
half
smothered
in
the
foam
of
the
whale's
insolent
tail
*punct* ,
and
too
much
of
a
cripple
to
swim,
*punct* ,
though
he
could
still
keep
afloat
*punct* ,
even
in
the
heart
of
such
a
whirlpool
as
that
*punct* ;
helpless
ahab's
head
was
seen
*punct* ,
like
a
tossed
bubble
which
the
least
chance
shock
might
burst
*punct* .
*break*
for
so
revolvingly
appalling
was
the
white
whale's
aspect
*punct* ,
and
so
planetarily
swift
the
ever-contracting
circles
he
made
*punct* ,
that
he
seemed
horizontally
swooping
upon
them
*punct* .
*break*
and
though
the
other
boats
*punct* ,
unharmed
*punct* ,
still
hovered
hard
by
*punct* ;
still
they
dared
not
pull
into
the
eddy
to
strike
*punct* ,
lest
that
should
be
the
signal
for
the
instant
destruction
of
the
jeopardized
castaways
*punct* ,
ahab
and
all
*punct* ;
nor
in
that
case
could
they
themselves
hope
to
escape
*punct* .
*break*
with
straining
eyes
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
they
remained
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
direful
zone
*punct* ,
whose
centre
had
now
become
the
old
man's
head
*punct* .
*break*
meantime
*punct* ,
from
the
beginning
all
this
had
been
descried
from
the
ship's
mast
heads
*punct* ;
and
squaring
her
yards
*punct* ,
she
had
borne
down
upon
the
scene
*punct* ;
and
was
now
so
nigh
*punct* ,
that
ahab
in
the
water
hailed
her;
*punct* ,
sail
on
the
*punct* ,
but
that
moment
a
breaking
sea
dashed
on
him
from
moby
dick
*punct* ,
and
whelmed
him
for
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
but
struggling
out
of
it
again
*punct* ,
and
chancing
to
rise
on
a
towering
crest
*punct* ,
he
shouted,
*punct* ,
sail
on
the
whale!
*punct* ,
drive
him
off
*punct* !
*break*
the
pequod's
prows
were
pointed
*punct* ;
and
breaking
up
the
charmed
circle
*punct* ,
she
effectually
parted
the
white
whale
from
his
victim
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
sullenly
swam
off
*punct* ,
the
boats
flew
to
the
rescue
*punct* .
*break*
dragged
into
stubb's
boat
with
blood-shot
*punct* ,
blinded
eyes
*punct* ,
the
white
brine
caking
in
his
wrinkles
*punct* ;
the
long
tension
of
ahab's
bodily
strength
did
crack
*punct* ,
and
helplessly
he
yielded
to
his
body's
doom
*punct* :
for
a
time
*punct* ,
lying
all
crushed
in
the
bottom
of
stubb's
boat
*punct* ,
like
one
trodden
under
foot
of
herds
of
elephants
*punct* .
*break*
far
inland
*punct* ,
nameless
wails
came
from
him
*punct* ,
as
desolate
sounds
from
out
ravines
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
intensity
of
his
physical
prostration
did
but
so
much
the
more
abbreviate
it
*punct* .
*break*
in
an
instant's
compass
*punct* ,
great
hearts
sometimes
condense
to
one
deep
pang
*punct* ,
the
sum
total
of
those
shallow
pains
kindly
diffused
through
feebler
men's
whole
lives
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
for
it
was
not
darted
*punct* ;
this
is
it
*punct* ,
said
stubb
*punct* ,
showing
it
*punct* .
*break*
lay
it
before
me;
*punct* ,
any
missing
men
*punct* ?
*break*
one
*punct* ,
two
*punct* ,
three
*punct* ,
four
*punct* ,
five;
*punct* ,
there
were
five
oars
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
and
here
are
five
men
*punct* .
*break*
that's
good.
*punct* ,
help
me
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ;
i
wish
to
stand
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ,
i
see
him
*punct* !
*break*
going
to
leeward
still
*punct* ;
what
a
leaping
spout
*punct* !
*break*
hands
off
from
me
*punct* !
*break*
the
eternal
sap
runs
up
in
ahab's
bones
again
*punct* !
*break*
set
the
sail
*punct* ;
out
oars
*punct* ;
the
helm
*punct* !
*break*
it
is
often
the
case
that
when
a
boat
is
stove
*punct* ,
its
crew
*punct* ,
being
picked
up
by
another
boat
*punct* ,
help
to
work
that
second
boat
*punct* ;
and
the
chase
is
thus
continued
with
what
is
called
double-banked
oars
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
thus
now
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
added
power
of
the
boat
did
not
equal
the
added
power
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
for
he
seemed
to
have
treble-banked
his
every
fin
*punct* ;
swimming
with
a
velocity
which
plainly
showed
*punct* ,
that
if
now
*punct* ,
under
these
circumstances
*punct* ,
pushed
on
*punct* ,
the
chase
would
prove
an
indefinitely
prolonged
*punct* ,
if
not
a
hopeless
one
*punct* ;
nor
could
any
crew
endure
for
so
long
a
period
*punct* ,
such
an
unintermitted
*punct* ,
intense
straining
at
the
oar
*punct* ;
a
thing
barely
tolerable
only
in
some
one
brief
vicissitude
*punct* .
*break*
the
ship
itself
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
as
it
sometimes
happens
*punct* ,
offered
the
most
promising
intermediate
means
of
overtaking
the
chase
*punct* .
*break*
accordingly
*punct* ,
the
boats
now
made
for
her
*punct* ,
and
were
soon
swayed
up
to
their
cranes
*punct* ,
the
two
parts
of
the
wrecked
boat
having
been
previously
secured
by
her
*punct* ,
and
then
hoisting
everything
to
her
side
*punct* ,
and
stacking
her
canvas
high
up
*punct* ,
and
sideways
outstretching
it
with
stun-sails
*punct* ,
like
the
double-jointed
wings
of
an
albatross
*punct* ;
the
pequod
bore
down
in
the
leeward
wake
of
moby
dick
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
well
known
*punct* ,
methodic
intervals
*punct* ,
the
whale's
glittering
spout
was
regularly
announced
from
the
manned
mast-heads
*punct* ;
and
when
he
would
be
reported
as
just
gone
down
*punct* ,
ahab
would
take
the
time
*punct* ,
and
then
pacing
the
deck
*punct* ,
binnacle-watch
in
hand
*punct* ,
so
soon
as
the
last
second
of
the
allotted
hour
expired
*punct* ,
his
voice
was
heard.
*punct* ,
whose
is
the
doubloon
now
*punct* ?
*break*
d'ye
see
him
*punct* ?
*break*
and
if
the
reply
was
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* !
*break*
straightway
he
commanded
them
to
lift
him
to
his
perch
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
was
thus
walking
*punct* ,
uttering
no
sound
*punct* ,
except
to
hail
the
men
aloft
*punct* ,
or
to
bid
them
hoist
a
sail
still
higher
*punct* ,
or
to
spread
one
to
a
still
greater
breadth
*punct* ,
thus
to
and
fro
pacing
*punct* ,
beneath
his
slouched
hat
*punct* ,
at
every
turn
he
passed
his
own
wrecked
boat
*punct* ,
which
had
been
dropped
upon
the
quarter-deck
*punct* ,
and
lay
there
reversed
*punct* ;
broken
bow
to
shattered
stern
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
he
paused
before
it
*punct* ;
and
as
in
an
already
over-clouded
sky
fresh
troops
of
clouds
will
sometimes
sail
across
*punct* ,
so
over
the
old
man's
face
there
now
stole
some
such
added
gloom
as
this
*punct* .
*break*
stubb
saw
him
pause
*punct* ;
and
perhaps
intending
*punct* ,
not
vainly
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
to
evince
his
own
unabated
fortitude
*punct* ,
and
thus
keep
up
a
valiant
place
in
his
captain's
mind
*punct* ,
he
advanced
*punct* ,
and
eyeing
the
wreck
exclaimed
*punct* ,
the
thistle
the
ass
refused
*punct* ;
it
pricked
his
mouth
too
keenly
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ;
ha
*punct* !
*break*
what
soulless
thing
is
this
that
laughs
before
a
wreck
*punct* ?
*break*
man
*punct* ,
man
*punct* !
*break*
did
i
not
know
thee
brave
as
fearless
fire
*punct* ,
and
as
mechanical
*punct* ,
i
could
swear
thou
wert
a
poltroon
*punct* .
*break*
groan
nor
laugh
should
be
heard
before
a
wreck
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
starbuck
drawing
near
*punct* ,
tis
a
solemn
sight
*punct* ;
an
omen
*punct* ,
and
an
ill
one
*punct* .
*break*
omen?
*punct* ,
the
dictionary
*punct* !
*break*
if
the
gods
think
to
speak
outright
to
man
*punct* ,
they
will
honorably
speak
outright
*punct* ;
not
shake
their
heads
*punct* ,
and
give
an
old
wives
darkling
hint.
*punct* ,
begone
*punct* !
*break*
ye
two
are
the
opposite
poles
of
one
thing
*punct* ;
starbuck
is
stubb
reversed
*punct* ,
and
stubb
is
starbuck
*punct* ;
and
ye
two
are
all
mankind
*punct* ;
and
ahab
stands
alone
among
the
millions
of
the
peopled
earth
*punct* ,
nor
gods
nor
men
his
neighbors
*punct* !
*break*
cold
*punct* ,
cold
*punct* ,
i
shiver!
*punct* ,
how
now
*punct* ?
*break*
d'ye
see
him
*punct* ?
*break*
sing
out
for
every
spout
*punct* ,
though
he
spout
ten
times
a
second
*punct* !
*break*
the
day
was
nearly
done
*punct* ;
only
the
hem
of
his
golden
robe
was
rustling
*punct* .
*break*
soon
*punct* ,
it
was
almost
dark
*punct* ,
but
the
look-out
men
still
remained
unset
*punct* .
*break*
can't
see
the
spout
now
*punct* ,
sir;
*punct* ,
too
dark
*punct* ,
cried
a
voice
from
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
how
heading
when
last
seen
*punct* ?
*break*
as
before
*punct* ,
sir,
*punct* ,
straight
to
leeward
*punct* .
*break*
he
will
travel
slower
now
tis
night
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
not
run
over
him
before
morning
*punct* ;
he's
making
a
passage
now
*punct* ,
and
may
heave-to
a
while
*punct* .
*break*
keep
her
full
before
the
wind!
*punct* ,
aloft
*punct* !
*break*
come
down!
*punct* ,
mr.
stubb
*punct* ,
send
a
fresh
hand
to
the
fore-mast
head
*punct* ,
and
see
it
manned
till
morning.
*punct* ,
then
advancing
towards
the
doubloon
in
the
main-mast
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
this
gold
is
mine
*punct* ,
for
i
earned
it
*punct* ;
but
i
shall
let
it
abide
here
till
the
white
whale
is
dead
*punct* ;
and
then
*punct* ,
whosoever
of
ye
first
raises
him
*punct* ,
upon
the
day
he
shall
be
killed
*punct* ,
this
gold
is
that
man's
*punct* ;
and
if
on
that
day
i
shall
again
raise
him
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
ten
times
its
sum
shall
be
divided
among
all
of
ye
*punct* !
*break*
away
now!
*punct* ,
the
deck
is
thine
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
it
receives
its
designation
*punct* ,
pitchpoling
*punct* ,
from
its
being
likened
to
that
preliminary
up-and-down
poise
of
the
whale-lance
*punct* ,
in
the
exercise
called
pitchpoling
*punct* ,
previously
described
*punct* .
*break*
d'ye
see
him
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
after
allowing
a
little
space
for
the
light
to
spread
*punct* .
*break*
see
nothing
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
turn
up
all
hands
and
make
sail
*punct* !
*break*
he
travels
faster
than
i
thought
for;
*punct* ,
the
top-gallant
sails!
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
they
should
have
been
kept
on
her
all
night
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
matter
*punct* ,
'tis
but
resting
for
the
rush
*punct* .
*break*
here
be
it
said
*punct* ,
that
this
pertinacious
pursuit
of
one
particular
whale
*punct* ,
continued
through
day
into
night
*punct* ,
and
through
night
into
day
*punct* ,
is
a
thing
by
no
means
unprecedented
in
the
south
sea
fishery
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
in
these
cases
*punct* ,
somewhat
as
a
pilot
*punct* ,
when
about
losing
sight
of
a
coast
*punct* ,
whose
general
trending
he
well
knows
*punct* ,
and
which
he
desires
shortly
to
return
to
again
*punct* ,
but
at
some
further
point
*punct* ;
like
as
this
pilot
stands
by
his
compass
*punct* ,
and
takes
the
precise
bearing
of
the
cape
at
present
visible
*punct* ,
in
order
the
more
certainly
to
hit
aright
the
remote
*punct* ,
unseen
headland
*punct* ,
eventually
to
be
visited
*punct* :
so
does
the
fisherman
*punct* ,
at
his
compass
*punct* ,
with
the
whale
*punct* ;
for
after
being
chased
*punct* ,
and
diligently
marked
*punct* ,
through
several
hours
of
daylight
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
when
night
obscures
the
fish
*punct* ,
the
creature's
future
wake
through
the
darkness
is
almost
as
established
to
the
sagacious
mind
of
the
hunter
*punct* ,
as
the
pilot's
coast
is
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
to
this
hunter's
wondrous
skill
*punct* ,
the
proverbial
evanescence
of
a
thing
writ
in
water
*punct* ,
a
wake
*punct* ,
is
to
all
desired
purposes
well
nigh
as
reliable
as
the
steadfast
land
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
the
mighty
iron
leviathan
of
the
modern
railway
is
so
familiarly
known
in
its
every
pace
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
with
watches
in
their
hands
*punct* ,
men
time
his
rate
as
doctors
that
of
a
baby's
pulse
*punct* ;
and
lightly
say
of
it
*punct* ,
the
up
train
or
the
down
train
will
reach
such
or
such
a
spot
*punct* ,
at
such
or
such
an
hour
*punct* ;
even
so
*punct* ,
almost
*punct* ,
there
are
occasions
when
these
nantucketers
time
that
other
leviathan
of
the
deep
*punct* ,
according
to
the
observed
humor
of
his
speed
*punct* ;
and
say
to
themselves
*punct* ,
so
many
hours
hence
this
whale
will
have
gone
two
hundred
miles
*punct* ,
will
have
about
reached
this
or
that
degree
of
latitude
or
longitude
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
render
this
acuteness
at
all
successful
in
the
end
*punct* ,
the
wind
and
the
sea
must
be
the
whaleman's
allies
*punct* ;
for
of
what
present
avail
to
the
becalmed
or
windbound
mariner
is
the
skill
that
assures
him
he
is
exactly
ninety-three
leagues
and
a
quarter
from
his
port
*punct* ?
*break*
inferable
from
these
statements
*punct* ,
are
many
collateral
subtile
matters
touching
the
chase
of
whales
*punct* .
*break*
the
ship
tore
on
*punct* ;
leaving
such
a
furrow
in
the
sea
as
when
a
cannon-ball
*punct* ,
missent
*punct* ,
becomes
a
plough-share
and
turns
up
the
level
field
*punct* .
*break*
by
salt
and
hemp
*punct* !
*break*
cried
stubb
*punct* ,
but
this
swift
motion
of
the
deck
creeps
up
one's
legs
and
tingles
at
the
heart
*punct* .
*break*
some
one
take
me
up
*punct* ,
and
launch
me
*punct* ,
spine-wise
*punct* ,
on
the
sea,
*punct* ,
for
by
live-oaks
*punct* !
*break*
my
spine's
a
keel
*punct* .
*break*
ha
*punct* ,
ha
*punct* !
*break*
we
go
the
gait
that
leaves
no
dust
behind
*punct* !
*break*
there
she
blows
*punct* ,
she
blows!
*punct* ,
she
blows!
*punct* ,
right
ahead
*punct* !
*break*
was
now
the
mast-head
cry
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* !
*break*
i
knew
it
*punct* ,
ye
can't
escape
*punct* ,
blow
on
and
split
your
spout
*punct* ,
o
whale
*punct* !
*break*
the
mad
fiend
himself
is
after
ye
*punct* !
*break*
blow
your
trump
*punct* ,
blister
your
lungs!
*punct* ,
ahab
will
dam
off
your
blood
*punct* ,
as
a
miller
shuts
his
water-gate
upon
the
stream
*punct* !
*break*
and
stubb
did
but
speak
out
for
well
nigh
all
that
crew
*punct* .
*break*
the
frenzies
of
the
chase
had
by
this
time
worked
them
bubblingly
up
*punct* ,
like
old
wine
worked
anew
*punct* .
*break*
whatever
pale
fears
and
forebodings
some
of
them
might
have
felt
before
*punct* ;
these
were
not
only
now
kept
out
of
sight
through
the
growing
awe
of
ahab
*punct* ,
but
they
were
broken
up
*punct* ,
and
on
all
sides
routed
*punct* ,
as
timid
prairie
hares
that
scatter
before
the
bounding
bison
*punct* .
*break*
the
hand
of
fate
had
snatched
all
their
souls
*punct* ;
and
by
the
stirring
perils
of
the
previous
day
*punct* ;
the
rack
of
the
past
night's
suspense
*punct* ;
the
fixed
*punct* ,
unfearing
*punct* ,
blind
*punct* ,
reckless
way
in
which
their
wild
craft
went
plunging
towards
its
flying
mark
*punct* ;
by
all
these
things
*punct* ,
their
hearts
were
bowled
along
*punct* .
*break*
the
wind
that
made
great
bellies
of
their
sails
*punct* ,
and
rushed
the
vessel
on
by
arms
invisible
as
irresistible
*punct* ;
this
seemed
the
symbol
of
that
unseen
agency
which
so
enslaved
them
to
the
race
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
one
man
*punct* ,
not
thirty
*punct* .
*break*
for
as
the
one
ship
that
held
them
all
*punct* ;
though
it
was
put
together
of
all
contrasting
things
*punct* ,
oak
*punct* ,
and
maple
*punct* ,
and
pine
wood
*punct* ;
iron
*punct* ,
and
pitch
*punct* ,
and
hemp
*punct* ,
yet
all
these
ran
into
each
other
in
the
one
concrete
hull
*punct* ,
which
shot
on
its
way
*punct* ,
both
balanced
and
directed
by
the
long
central
keel
*punct* ;
even
so
*punct* ,
all
the
individualities
of
the
crew
*punct* ,
this
man's
valor
*punct* ,
that
man's
fear
*punct* ;
guilt
and
guiltiness
*punct* ,
all
varieties
were
welded
into
oneness
*punct* ,
and
were
all
directed
to
that
fatal
goal
which
ahab
their
one
lord
and
keel
did
point
to
*punct* .
*break*
the
rigging
lived
*punct* .
*break*
the
mast-heads
*punct* ,
like
the
tops
of
tall
palms
*punct* ,
were
outspreadingly
tufted
with
arms
and
legs
*punct* .
*break*
how
they
still
strove
through
that
infinite
blueness
to
seek
out
the
thing
that
might
destroy
them
*punct* !
*break*
why
sing
ye
not
out
for
him
*punct* ,
if
ye
see
him
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
after
the
lapse
of
some
minutes
since
the
first
cry
*punct* ,
no
more
had
been
heard
*punct* .
*break*
sway
me
up
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ;
ye
have
been
deceived
*punct* ;
not
moby
dick
casts
one
odd
jet
that
way
*punct* ,
and
then
disappears
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
even
so
*punct* ;
in
their
headlong
eagerness
*punct* ,
the
men
had
mistaken
some
other
thing
for
the
whale-spout
*punct* ,
as
the
event
itself
soon
proved
*punct* ;
for
hardly
had
ahab
reached
his
perch
*punct* ;
hardly
was
the
rope
belayed
to
its
pin
on
deck
*punct* ,
when
he
struck
the
key-note
to
an
orchestra
*punct* ,
that
made
the
air
vibrate
as
with
the
combined
discharges
of
rifles
*punct* .
*break*
the
triumphant
halloo
of
thirty
buckskin
lungs
was
heard
*punct* ,
as
*punct* ,
much
nearer
to
the
ship
than
the
place
of
the
imaginary
jet
*punct* ,
less
than
a
mile
ahead
*punct* ,
moby
dick
bodily
burst
into
view
*punct* !
*break*
for
not
by
any
calm
and
indolent
spoutings
*punct* ;
not
by
the
peaceable
gush
of
that
mystic
fountain
in
his
head
*punct* ,
did
the
white
whale
now
reveal
his
vicinity
*punct* ;
but
by
the
far
more
wondrous
phenomenon
of
breaching
*punct* .
*break*
rising
with
his
utmost
velocity
from
the
furthest
depths
*punct* ,
the
sperm
whale
thus
booms
his
entire
bulk
into
the
pure
element
of
air
*punct* ,
and
piling
up
a
mountain
of
dazzling
foam
*punct* ,
shows
his
place
to
the
distance
of
seven
miles
and
more
*punct* .
*break*
in
those
moments
*punct* ,
the
torn
*punct* ,
enraged
waves
he
shakes
off
*punct* ,
seem
his
mane
*punct* ;
in
some
cases
*punct* ,
this
breaching
is
his
act
of
defiance
*punct* .
*break*
there
she
breaches
*punct* !
*break*
there
she
breaches
*punct* !
*break*
was
the
cry
*punct* ,
as
in
his
immeasureable
bravadoes
the
white
whale
tossed
himself
salmon-like
to
heaven
*punct* .
*break*
so
suddenly
seen
in
the
blue
plain
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
and
relieved
against
the
still
bluer
margin
of
the
sky
*punct* ,
the
spray
that
he
raised
*punct* ,
for
the
moment
*punct* ,
intolerably
glittered
and
glared
like
a
glacier
*punct* ;
and
stood
there
gradually
fading
and
fading
away
from
its
first
sparkling
intensity
*punct* ,
to
the
dim
mistiness
of
an
advancing
shower
in
a
vale
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
breach
your
last
to
the
sun
*punct* ,
moby
dick
*punct* !
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
thy
hour
and
thy
harpoon
are
at
hand!
*punct* ,
down
*punct* !
*break*
down
all
of
ye
*punct* ,
but
one
man
at
the
fore
*punct* .
*break*
the
boats!
*punct* ,
stand
by
*punct* !
*break*
lower
away
*punct* ,
he
cried
*punct* ,
so
soon
as
he
had
reached
his
boat
*punct* ,
a
spare
one
*punct* ,
rigged
the
afternoon
previous
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ,
the
ship
is
thine
*punct* ,
keep
away
from
the
boats
*punct* ,
but
keep
near
them
*punct* .
*break*
lower
*punct* ,
all
*punct* !
*break*
as
if
to
strike
a
quick
terror
into
them
*punct* ,
by
this
time
being
the
first
assailant
himself
*punct* ,
moby
dick
had
turned
*punct* ,
and
was
now
coming
for
the
three
crews
*punct* .
*break*
ahab's
boat
was
central
*punct* ;
and
cheering
his
men
*punct* ,
he
told
them
he
would
take
the
whale
head-and-head,
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
pull
straight
up
to
his
forehead,
*punct* ,
a
not
uncommon
thing
*punct* ;
for
when
within
a
certain
limit
*punct* ,
such
a
course
excludes
the
coming
onset
from
the
whale's
sidelong
vision
*punct* .
*break*
but
ere
that
close
limit
was
gained
*punct* ,
and
while
yet
all
three
boats
were
plain
as
the
ship's
three
masts
to
his
eye
*punct* ;
the
white
whale
churning
himself
into
furious
speed
*punct* ,
almost
in
an
instant
as
it
were
*punct* ,
rushing
among
the
boats
with
open
jaws
*punct* ,
and
a
lashing
tail
*punct* ,
offered
appalling
battle
on
every
side
*punct* ;
and
heedless
of
the
irons
darted
at
him
from
every
boat
*punct* ,
seemed
only
intent
on
annihilating
each
separate
plank
of
which
those
boats
were
made
*punct* .
*break*
but
skilfully
manoeuvred
*punct* ,
incessantly
wheeling
like
trained
chargers
in
the
field
*punct* ;
the
boats
for
a
while
eluded
him
*punct* ;
though
*punct* ,
at
times
*punct* ,
but
by
a
plank's
breadth
*punct* ;
while
all
the
time
*punct* ,
ahab's
unearthly
slogan
tore
every
other
cry
but
his
to
shreds
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
last
in
his
untraceable
evolutions
*punct* ,
the
white
whale
so
crossed
and
recrossed
*punct* ,
and
in
a
thousand
ways
entangled
the
slack
of
the
three
lines
now
fast
to
him
*punct* ,
that
they
foreshortened
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
of
themselves
*punct* ,
warped
the
devoted
boats
towards
the
planted
irons
in
him
*punct* ;
though
now
for
a
moment
the
whale
drew
aside
a
little
*punct* ,
as
if
to
rally
for
a
more
tremendous
charge
*punct* .
*break*
seizing
that
opportunity
*punct* ,
ahab
first
paid
out
more
line
*punct* :
and
then
was
rapidly
hauling
and
jerking
in
upon
it
again
*punct* ,
hoping
that
way
to
disencumber
it
of
some
snarls
*punct* ,
when
lo!
*punct* ,
a
sight
more
savage
than
the
embattled
teeth
of
sharks
*punct* !
*break*
only
one
thing
could
be
done
*punct* .
*break*
seizing
the
boat-knife
*punct* ,
he
critically
reached
within
*punct* ,
through
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
without
*punct* ,
the
rays
of
steel
*punct* ;
dragged
in
the
line
beyond
*punct* ,
passed
it
*punct* ,
inboard
*punct* ,
to
the
bowsman
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
twice
sundering
the
rope
near
the
chocks
*punct* ,
dropped
the
intercepted
fagot
of
steel
into
the
sea
*punct* ;
and
was
all
fast
again
*punct* .
*break*
that
instant
*punct* ,
the
white
whale
made
a
sudden
rush
among
the
remaining
tangles
of
the
other
lines
*punct* ;
by
so
doing
*punct* ,
irresistibly
dragged
the
more
involved
boats
of
stubb
and
flask
towards
his
flukes
*punct* ;
dashed
them
together
like
two
rolling
husks
on
a
surf-beaten
beach
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
diving
down
into
the
sea
*punct* ,
disappeared
in
a
boiling
maelstrom
*punct* ,
in
which
*punct* ,
for
a
space
*punct* ,
the
odorous
cedar
chips
of
the
wrecks
danced
round
and
round
*punct* ,
like
the
grated
nutmeg
in
a
swiftly
stirred
bowl
of
punch
*punct* .
*break*
while
the
two
crews
were
yet
circling
in
the
waters
*punct* ,
reaching
out
after
the
revolving
line-tubs
*punct* ,
oars
*punct* ,
and
other
floating
furniture
*punct* ,
while
aslope
little
flask
bobbed
up
and
down
like
an
empty
vial
*punct* ,
twitching
his
legs
upwards
to
escape
the
dreaded
jaws
of
sharks
*punct* ;
and
stubb
was
lustily
singing
out
for
some
one
to
ladle
him
up
*punct* ;
and
while
the
old
man's
line
*punct* ,
now
parting
*punct* ,
admitted
of
his
pulling
into
the
creamy
pool
to
rescue
whom
he
could;
*punct* ,
in
that
wild
simultaneousness
of
a
thousand
concreted
perils,
*punct* ,
ahab's
yet
unstricken
boat
seemed
drawn
up
towards
heaven
by
invisible
wires,
*punct* ,
as
*punct* ,
arrow-like
*punct* ,
shooting
perpendicularly
from
the
sea
*punct* ,
the
white
whale
dashed
his
broad
forehead
against
its
bottom
*punct* ,
and
sent
it
*punct* ,
turning
over
and
over
*punct* ,
into
the
air
*punct* ;
till
it
fell
again
*punct* ,
gunwale
downwards
*punct* ,
and
ahab
and
his
men
struggled
out
from
under
it
*punct* ,
like
seals
from
a
seaside
cave
*punct* .
*break*
the
first
uprising
momentum
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
modifying
its
direction
as
he
struck
the
surface
*punct* ,
involuntarily
launched
him
along
it
*punct* ,
to
a
little
distance
from
the
centre
of
the
destruction
he
had
made
*punct* ;
and
with
his
back
to
it
*punct* ,
he
now
lay
for
a
moment
slowly
feeling
with
his
flukes
from
side
to
side
*punct* ;
and
whenever
a
stray
oar
*punct* ,
bit
of
plank
*punct* ,
the
least
chip
or
crumb
of
the
boats
touched
his
skin
*punct* ,
his
tail
swiftly
drew
back
*punct* ,
and
came
sideways
smiting
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
as
before
*punct* ,
the
attentive
ship
having
descried
the
whole
fight
*punct* ,
again
came
bearing
down
to
the
rescue
*punct* ,
and
dropping
a
boat
*punct* ,
picked
up
the
floating
mariners
*punct* ,
tubs
*punct* ,
oars
and
whatever
else
could
be
caught
at
*punct* ,
and
safely
landed
them
on
her
decks
*punct* .
*break*
some
sprained
shoulders
*punct* ,
wrists
*punct* ,
and
ankles
*punct* ;
livid
contusions
*punct* ;
wrenched
harpoons
and
lances
*punct* ;
inextricable
intricacies
of
rope
*punct* ;
shattered
oars
and
planks
*punct* ;
all
these
were
there
*punct* ;
but
no
fatal
or
even
serious
ill
seemed
to
have
befallen
any
one
*punct* .
*break*
as
with
fedallah
the
day
before
*punct* ,
so
ahab
was
now
found
grimly
clinging
to
his
boat's
broken
half
*punct* ,
which
afforded
a
comparatively
easy
float
*punct* ;
nor
did
it
so
exhaust
him
as
the
previous
day's
mishap
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
he
was
helped
to
the
deck
*punct* ,
all
eyes
were
fastened
upon
him
*punct* ;
as
instead
of
standing
by
himself
he
still
half-hung
upon
the
shoulder
of
starbuck
*punct* ,
who
had
thus
far
been
the
foremost
to
assist
him
*punct* .
*break*
his
ivory
leg
had
been
snapped
off
*punct* ,
leaving
but
one
short
sharp
splinter
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* ,
tis
sweet
to
lean
sometimes
*punct* ,
be
the
leaner
who
he
will
*punct* ;
and
would
old
ahab
had
leaned
oftener
than
he
has
*punct* .
*break*
the
ferrule
has
not
stood
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
the
carpenter
*punct* ,
now
coming
up
*punct* ;
i
put
good
work
into
that
leg
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
bones
broken
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ,
said
stubb
with
true
concern
*punct* .
*break*
and
all
splintered
to
pieces
*punct* ,
stubb!
*punct* ,
d'ye
see
it.
*punct* ,
but
even
with
a
broken
bone
*punct* ,
old
ahab
is
untouched
*punct* ;
and
i
account
no
living
bone
of
mine
one
jot
more
me
*punct* ,
than
this
dead
one
that's
lost
*punct* .
*break*
nor
white
whale
*punct* ,
nor
man
*punct* ,
nor
fiend
*punct* ,
can
so
much
as
graze
old
ahab
in
his
own
proper
and
inaccessible
being
*punct* .
*break*
can
any
lead
touch
yonder
floor
*punct* ,
any
mast
scrape
yonder
roof?
*punct* ,
aloft
there
*punct* !
*break*
dead
to
leeward
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
up
helm
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ;
pile
on
the
sail
again
*punct* ,
ship
keepers
*punct* !
*break*
down
the
rest
of
the
spare
boats
and
rig
them
*punct* ,
mr.
starbuck
away
*punct* ,
and
muster
the
boat's
crews
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
first
help
thee
towards
the
bulwarks
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
how
this
splinter
gores
me
now
*punct* !
*break*
my
body
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
not
thee
*punct* .
*break*
give
me
something
for
a
cane
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ,
that
shivered
lance
will
do
*punct* .
*break*
muster
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
surely
i
have
not
seen
him
yet
*punct* .
*break*
by
heaven
it
cannot
be!
*punct* ,
missing?
*punct* ,
quick
*punct* !
*break*
call
them
all
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
man's
hinted
thought
was
true
*punct* .
*break*
upon
mustering
the
company
*punct* ,
the
parsee
was
not
there
*punct* .
*break*
cried
stubb
*punct* ,
he
must
have
been
caught
in
*punct* ,
the
black
vomit
wrench
thee!
*punct* ,
run
all
of
ye
above
*punct* ,
alow
*punct* ,
cabin
*punct* ,
forecastle
*punct* ,
find
him
*punct* ,
not
gone
*punct* ,
not
gone
*punct* !
*break*
but
quickly
they
returned
to
him
with
the
tidings
that
the
parsee
was
nowhere
to
be
found
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
stubb
*punct* ,
caught
among
the
tangles
of
your
line
*punct* ,
i
thought
i
saw
him
dragging
under
*punct* .
*break*
gone?
*punct* ,
gone
*punct* ?
*break*
what
means
that
little
word?
*punct* ,
what
death-knell
rings
in
it
*punct* ,
that
old
ahab
shakes
as
if
he
were
the
belfry
*punct* .
*break*
the
harpoon
*punct* ,
too!
*punct* ,
toss
over
the
litter
there,
*punct* ,
d'ye
see
it?
*punct* ,
the
forged
iron
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
the
white
whale's
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
no,
*punct* ,
blistered
fool
*punct* ;
this
hand
did
dart
it!
*punct* ,
'tis
in
the
fish!
*punct* ,
aloft
there
*punct* !
*break*
keep
him
nailed
*punct* ,
quick!
*punct* ,
all
hands
to
the
rigging
of
the
boats
*punct* ,
collect
the
oars
*punct* ,
harpooneers
*punct* !
*break*

the
sheets!
*punct* ,
helm
there
*punct* !
*break*
steady
*punct* ,
steady
for
your
life
*punct* !
*break*
i'll
ten
times
girdle
the
unmeasured
globe
*punct* ;
yea
and
dive
straight
through
it
*punct* ,
but
i'll
slay
him
yet
*punct* !
*break*
but
for
one
single
instant
show
thyself
*punct* ,
cried
starbuck
*punct* ;
never
*punct* ,
never
wilt
thou
capture
him
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ,
in
jesus
name
no
more
of
this
*punct* ,
that's
worse
than
devil's
madness
*punct* .
*break*
two
days
chased
*punct* ;
twice
stove
to
splinters
*punct* ;
thy
very
leg
once
more
snatched
from
under
thee
*punct* ;
thy
evil
shadow
gone
*punct* ,
all
good
angels
mobbing
thee
with
warnings:
*punct* ,
what
more
wouldst
thou
have?
*punct* ,
shall
we
keep
chasing
this
murderous
fish
till
he
swamps
the
last
man
*punct* ?
*break*
shall
we
be
dragged
by
him
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
*punct* ?
*break*
shall
we
be
towed
by
him
to
the
infernal
world
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
oh,
*punct* ,
impiety
and
blasphemy
to
hunt
him
more
*punct* !
*break*
but
in
this
matter
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
be
the
front
of
thy
face
to
me
as
the
palm
of
this
hand
*punct* ,
a
lipless
*punct* ,
unfeatured
blank
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
is
for
ever
ahab
*punct* ,
man
*punct* .
*break*
this
whole
act's
immutably
decreed
*punct* .
*break*
twas
rehearsed
by
thee
and
me
a
billion
years
before
this
ocean
rolled
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
the
fates
lieutenant
*punct* ;
i
act
under
orders
*punct* .
*break*
look
thou
*punct* ,
underling
*punct* !
*break*
that
thou
obeyest
mine.
*punct* ,
stand
round
me
*punct* ,
men
*punct* .
*break*
ye
see
an
old
man
cut
down
to
the
stump
*punct* ;
leaning
on
a
shivered
lance
*punct* ;
propped
up
on
a
lonely
foot
*punct* .
*break*
tis
ahab
*punct* ,
his
body's
part
*punct* ;
but
ahab's
soul's
a
centipede
*punct* ,
that
moves
upon
a
hundred
legs
*punct* .
*break*
i
feel
strained
*punct* ,
half
stranded
*punct* ,
as
ropes
that
tow
dismasted
frigates
in
a
gale
*punct* ;
and
i
may
look
so
*punct* .
*break*
but
ere
i
break
*punct* ,
ye'll
hear
me
crack
*punct* ;
and
till
ye
hear
that
*punct* ,
know
that
ahab's
hawser
tows
his
purpose
yet
*punct* .
*break*
believe
ye
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
in
the
things
called
omens
*punct* ?
*break*
then
laugh
aloud
*punct* ,
and
cry
encore
*punct* !
*break*
for
ere
they
drown
*punct* ,
drowning
things
will
twice
rise
to
the
surface
*punct* ;
then
rise
again
*punct* ,
to
sink
for
evermore
*punct* .
*break*
so
with
moby
dick
*punct* ,
two
days
he's
floated
*punct* ,
to-morrow
will
be
the
third
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
he'll
rise
once
more,
*punct* ,
but
only
to
spout
his
last
*punct* !
*break*
d'ye
feel
brave
men
*punct* ,
brave
*punct* ?
*break*
as
fearless
fire
*punct* ,
cried
stubb
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
mechanical
*punct* ,
muttered
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
then
as
the
men
went
forward
*punct* ,
he
muttered
on:
*punct* ,
the
things
called
omens
*punct* !
*break*
and
yesterday
i
talked
the
same
to
starbuck
there
*punct* ,
concerning
my
broken
boat
*punct* .
*break*
how
valiantly
i
seek
to
drive
out
of
others
hearts
what's
clinched
so
fast
in
mine!
*punct* ,
the
parsee
*punct* ,
the
parsee!
*punct* ,
gone
*punct* ,
gone
*punct* ?
*break*
and
he
was
to
go
before:
*punct* ,
but
still
was
to
be
seen
again
ere
i
could
perish
*punct* ,
how's
that?
*punct* ,
there's
a
riddle
now
might
baffle
all
the
lawyers
backed
by
the
ghosts
of
the
whole
line
of
judges:
*punct* ,
like
a
hawk's
beak
it
pecks
my
brain
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
*punct* ,
i'll
solve
it
*punct* ,
though
*punct* !
*break*
when
dusk
descended
*punct* ,
the
whale
was
still
in
sight
to
leeward
*punct* .
*break*
so
once
more
the
sail
was
shortened
*punct* ,
and
everything
passed
nearly
as
on
the
previous
night
*punct* ;
only
*punct* ,
the
sound
of
hammers
*punct* ,
and
the
hum
of
the
grindstone
was
heard
till
nearly
daylight
*punct* ,
as
the
men
toiled
by
lanterns
in
the
complete
and
careful
rigging
of
the
spare
boats
and
sharpening
their
fresh
weapons
for
the
morrow
*punct* .
*break*
d'ye
see
him
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ;
but
the
whale
was
not
yet
in
sight
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
infallible
wake
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ;
but
follow
that
wake
*punct* ,
that's
all
*punct* .
*break*
helm
there
*punct* ;
steady
*punct* ,
as
thou
goest
*punct* ,
and
hast
been
going
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
lovely
day
again
*punct* ;
were
it
a
new-made
world
*punct* ,
and
made
for
a
summer-house
to
the
angels
*punct* ,
and
this
morning
the
first
of
its
throwing
open
to
them
*punct* ,
a
fairer
day
could
not
dawn
upon
that
world
*punct* .
*break*
here's
food
for
thought
*punct* ,
had
ahab
time
to
think
*punct* ;
but
ahab
never
thinks
*punct* ;
he
only
feels
*punct* ,
feels
*punct* ,
feels
*punct* ;
that's
tingling
enough
for
mortal
man
*punct* !
*break*
to
think's
audacity
*punct* .
*break*
god
only
has
that
right
and
privilege
*punct* .
*break*
thinking
is
*punct* ,
or
ought
to
be
*punct* ,
a
coolness
and
a
calmness
*punct* ;
and
our
poor
hearts
throb
*punct* ,
and
our
poor
brains
beat
too
much
for
that
*punct* .
*break*
and
yet
*punct* ,
i've
sometimes
thought
my
brain
was
very
calm
*punct* ,
frozen
calm
*punct* ,
this
old
skull
cracks
so
*punct* ,
like
a
glass
in
which
the
contents
turned
to
ice
*punct* ,
and
shiver
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
still
this
hair
is
growing
now
*punct* ;
this
moment
growing
*punct* ,
and
heat
must
breed
it
*punct* ;
but
no
*punct* ,
it's
like
that
sort
of
common
grass
that
will
grow
anywhere
*punct* ,
between
the
earthy
clefts
of
greenland
ice
or
in
vesuvius
lava
*punct* .
*break*
how
the
wild
winds
blow
it
*punct* ;
they
whip
it
about
me
as
the
torn
shreds
of
split
sails
lash
the
tossed
ship
they
cling
to
*punct* .
*break*
out
upon
it!
*punct* ,
it's
tainted
*punct* .
*break*
were
i
the
wind
*punct* ,
i'd
blow
no
more
on
such
a
wicked
*punct* ,
miserable
world
*punct* .
*break*
i'd
crawl
somewhere
to
a
cave
*punct* ,
and
slink
there
*punct* .
*break*
and
yet
*punct* ,
tis
a
noble
and
heroic
thing
*punct* ,
the
wind
*punct* !
*break*
who
ever
conquered
it
*punct* ?
*break*
in
every
fight
it
has
the
last
and
bitterest
blow
*punct* .
*break*
run
tilting
at
it
*punct* ,
and
you
but
run
through
it
*punct* .
*break*
a
coward
wind
that
strikes
stark
naked
men
*punct* ,
but
will
not
stand
to
receive
a
single
blow
*punct* .
*break*
even
ahab
is
a
braver
thing
*punct* ,
a
nobler
thing
that
that
*punct* .
*break*
would
now
the
wind
but
had
a
body
*punct* ;
but
all
the
things
that
most
exasperate
and
outrage
mortal
man
*punct* ,
all
these
things
are
bodiless
*punct* ,
but
only
bodiless
as
objects
*punct* ,
not
as
agents
*punct* .
*break*
there's
a
most
special
*punct* ,
a
most
cunning
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
a
most
malicious
difference
*punct* !
*break*
and
yet
*punct* ,
i
say
again
*punct* ,
and
swear
it
now
*punct* ,
that
there's
something
all
glorious
and
gracious
in
the
wind
*punct* .
*break*
these
warm
trade
winds
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
that
in
the
clear
heavens
blow
straight
on
*punct* ,
in
strong
and
steadfast
*punct* ,
vigorous
mildness
*punct* ;
and
veer
not
from
their
mark
*punct* ,
however
the
baser
currents
of
the
sea
may
turn
and
tack
*punct* ,
and
mightiest
mississippies
of
the
land
swift
and
swerve
about
*punct* ,
uncertain
where
to
go
at
last
*punct* .
*break*
and
by
the
eternal
poles
*punct* !
*break*
these
same
trades
that
so
directly
blow
my
good
ship
on
*punct* ;
these
trades
*punct* ,
or
something
like
them
*punct* ,
something
so
unchangeable
*punct* ,
and
full
as
strong
*punct* ,
blow
my
keeled
soul
along
*punct* !
*break*
what
d'ye
see
*punct* ?
*break*
nothing
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
and
noon
at
hand
*punct* !
*break*
the
doubloon
goes
a-begging
*punct* !
*break*
see
the
sun
*punct* !
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
it
must
be
so
*punct* .
*break*
i've
oversailed
him
*punct* .
*break*
how
*punct* ,
got
the
start
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
he's
chasing
me
now
*punct* ;
not
i
*punct* ,
him
*punct* ,
that's
bad
*punct* ;
i
might
have
known
it
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
the
lines
*punct* ,
the
harpoons
he's
towing
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
i
have
run
him
by
last
night
*punct* .
*break*
come
down
*punct* ,
all
of
ye
*punct* ,
but
the
regular
look
outs
*punct* !
*break*
man
the
braces
*punct* !
*break*
steering
as
she
had
done
*punct* ,
the
wind
had
been
somewhat
on
the
pequod's
quarter
*punct* ,
so
that
now
being
pointed
in
the
reverse
direction
*punct* ,
the
braced
ship
sailed
hard
upon
the
breeze
as
she
rechurned
the
cream
in
her
own
white
wake
*punct* .
*break*
against
the
wind
he
now
steers
for
the
open
jaw
*punct* ,
murmured
starbuck
to
himself
*punct* ,
as
he
coiled
the
new-hauled
main-brace
upon
the
rail
*punct* .
*break*
i
misdoubt
me
that
i
disobey
my
god
in
obeying
him
*punct* !
*break*
stand
by
to
sway
me
up
*punct* !
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
advancing
to
the
hempen
basket
*punct* .
*break*
we
should
meet
him
soon
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
and
straightway
starbuck
did
ahab's
bidding
*punct* ,
and
once
more
ahab
swung
on
high
*punct* .
*break*
a
whole
hour
now
passed
*punct* ;
gold-beaten
out
to
ages
*punct* .
*break*
time
itself
now
held
long
breaths
with
keen
suspense
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
last
*punct* ,
some
three
points
off
the
weather
bow
*punct* ,
ahab
descried
the
spout
again
*punct* ,
and
instantly
from
the
three
ma
st-heads
three
shrieks
went
up
as
if
the
tongues
of
fire
had
voiced
it
*punct* .
*break*
forehead
to
forehead
i
meet
thee
*punct* ,
this
third
time
*punct* ,
moby
dick
*punct* !
*break*
on
deck
there!
*punct* ,
brace
sharper
up
*punct* ;
crowd
her
into
the
wind's
eye
*punct* .
*break*
he's
too
far
off
to
lower
yet
*punct* ,
mr.
starbuck
*punct* .
*break*
the
sails
shake
*punct* !
*break*
stand
over
that
helmsman
with
a
top-maul
*punct* !
*break*
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ;
he
travels
fast
*punct* ,
and
i
must
down
*punct* .
*break*
but
let
me
have
one
more
good
round
look
aloft
here
at
the
sea
*punct* ;
there's
time
for
that
*punct* .
*break*
an
old
*punct* ,
old
sight
*punct* ,
and
yet
somehow
so
young
*punct* ;
aye
*punct* ,
and
not
changed
a
wink
since
i
first
saw
it
*punct* ,
a
boy
*punct* ,
from
the
sand-hills
of
nantucket
*punct* !
*break*
the
same!
*punct* ,
the
same!
*punct* ,
the
same
to
noah
as
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
there's
a
soft
shower
to
leeward
*punct* .
*break*
such
lovely
leewardings
*punct* !
*break*
they
must
lead
somewhere
*punct* ,
to
something
else
than
common
land
*punct* ,
more
palmy
than
the
palms
*punct* .
*break*
the
white
whale
goes
that
way
*punct* ;
look
to
windward
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ;
the
better
if
the
bitterer
quarter
*punct* .
*break*
but
good
bye
*punct* ,
good
bye
*punct* ,
old
mast-head
*punct* !
*break*
what's
this?
*punct* ,
green
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
tiny
mosses
in
these
warped
cracks
*punct* .
*break*
no
such
green
weather
stains
on
ahab's
head
*punct* !
*break*
there's
the
difference
now
between
man's
old
age
and
matter's
*punct* .
*break*
but
aye
*punct* ,
old
mast
*punct* ,
we
both
grow
old
together
*punct* ;
sound
in
our
hulls
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
are
we
not
*punct* ,
my
ship
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
minus
a
leg
*punct* ,
that's
all
*punct* .
*break*
by
heaven
this
dead
wood
has
the
better
of
my
live
flesh
every
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
can't
compare
with
it
*punct* ;
and
i've
known
some
ships
made
of
dead
trees
outlast
the
lives
of
men
made
of
the
most
vital
stuff
of
vital
fathers
*punct* .
*break*
what's
that
he
said
*punct* ?
*break*
he
should
still
go
before
me
*punct* ,
my
pilot
*punct* ;
and
yet
to
be
seen
again
*punct* ?
*break*
will
i
have
eyes
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
supposing
i
descend
those
endless
stairs
*punct* ?
*break*
and
all
night
i've
been
sailing
from
him
*punct* ,
wherever
he
did
sink
to
*punct* .
*break*
good
by
*punct* ,
mast-head
*punct* ,
keep
a
good
eye
upon
the
whale
*punct* ,
the
while
i'm
gone
*punct* .
*break*
we'll
talk
to-morrow
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
to-night
*punct* ,
when
the
white
whale
lies
down
there
*punct* ,
tied
by
head
and
tail
*punct* .
*break*
he
gave
the
word
*punct* ;
and
still
gazing
round
him
*punct* ,
was
steadily
lowered
through
the
cloven
blue
air
to
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
in
due
time
the
boats
were
lowered
*punct* ,
but
as
standing
in
his
shallop's
stern
*punct* ,
ahab
just
hovered
upon
the
point
of
the
descent
*punct* ,
he
waved
to
the
mate,
*punct* ,
who
held
one
of
the
tackle-ropes
on
deck
*punct* ,
and
bade
him
pause
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
third
time
my
soul's
ship
starts
upon
this
voyage
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
thou
wilt
have
it
so
*punct* .
*break*
some
ships
sail
from
their
ports
*punct* ,
and
ever
afterwards
are
missing
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* !
*break*
truth
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* :
saddest
truth
*punct* .
*break*
some
men
die
at
ebb
tide
*punct* ;
some
at
low
water
*punct* ;
some
at
the
full
of
the
flood;
*punct* ,
and
i
feel
now
like
a
billow
that's
all
one
crested
comb
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
old;
*punct* ,
shake
hands
with
me
*punct* ,
man
*punct* .
*break*
their
hands
met
*punct* ;
their
eyes
fastened
*punct* ;
starbuck's
tears
the
glue
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
my
captain
*punct* ,
my
captain!
*punct* ,
noble
heart
*punct* ,
go
not
*punct* ,
go
not!
*punct* ,
see
*punct* ,
it's
a
brave
man
that
weeps
*punct* ;
how
great
the
agony
of
the
persuasion
then
*punct* !
*break*
lower
away!
*punct* ,
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
tossing
the
mate's
arm
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
stand
by
the
crew
*punct* !
*break*
in
an
instant
the
boat
was
pulling
round
close
under
the
stern
*punct* .
*break*
cried
a
voice
from
the
low
cabin-window
there
*punct* ;
o
master
*punct* ,
my
master
*punct* ,
come
back
*punct* !
*break*
but
ahab
heard
nothing
*punct* ;
for
his
own
voice
was
high-lifted
then
*punct* ;
and
the
boat
leaped
on
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
thing
not
uncommonly
happening
to
the
whale-boats
in
those
swarming
seas
*punct* ;
the
sharks
at
times
apparently
following
them
in
the
same
prescient
way
that
vultures
hover
over
the
banners
of
marching
regiments
in
the
east
*punct* .
*break*
but
these
were
the
first
sharks
that
had
been
observed
by
the
pequod
since
the
white
whale
had
been
first
descried
*punct* ;
and
whether
it
was
that
ahab's
crew
were
all
such
tiger-yellow
barbarians
*punct* ,
and
therefore
their
flesh
more
musky
to
the
senses
of
the
sharks
*punct* ,
a
matter
sometimes
well
known
to
affect
them,
*punct* ,
however
it
was
*punct* ,
they
seemed
to
follow
that
one
boat
without
molesting
the
others
*punct* .
*break*
heart
of
wrought
steel
*punct* !
*break*
murmured
starbuck
gazing
over
the
side
*punct* ,
and
following
with
his
eyes
the
receding
boat
*punct* ,
canst
thou
yet
ring
boldly
to
that
sight?
*punct* ,
lowering
thy
keel
among
ravening
sharks
*punct* ,
and
followed
by
them
*punct* ,
open-mouthed
to
the
chase
*punct* ;
and
this
the
critical
third
day?
*punct* ,
for
when
three
days
flow
together
in
one
continuous
intense
pursuit
*punct* ;
be
sure
the
first
is
the
morning
*punct* ,
the
second
the
noon
*punct* ,
and
the
third
the
evening
and
the
end
of
that
thing
*punct* ,
be
that
end
what
it
may
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
this
that
shoots
through
me
*punct* ,
and
leaves
me
so
deadly
calm
*punct* ,
yet
expectant,
*punct* ,
fixed
at
the
top
of
a
shudder
*punct* !
*break*
future
things
swim
before
me
*punct* ,
as
in
empty
outlines
and
skeletons
*punct* ;
all
the
past
is
somehow
grown
dim
*punct* .
*break*
mary
*punct* ,
girl
*punct* !
*break*
thou
fadest
in
pale
glories
behind
me
*punct* ;
boy
*punct* !
*break*
i
seem
to
see
but
thy
eyes
grown
wondrous
blue
*punct* .
*break*
strangest
problems
of
life
seem
clearing
*punct* ;
but
clouds
sweep
between
*punct* ,
is
my
journey's
end
coming
*punct* ?
*break*
my
legs
feel
faint
*punct* ;
like
his
who
has
footed
it
all
day
*punct* .
*break*
feel
thy
heart,
*punct* ,
beats
it
yet?
*punct* ,
stir
thyself
*punct* ,
starbuck!
*punct* ,
stave
it
off
*punct* ,
move
*punct* ,
move
*punct* !
*break*
speak
aloud!
*punct* ,
mast-head
there
*punct* !
*break*
see
ye
my
boy's
hand
on
the
hill?
*punct* ,
crazed;
*punct* ,
aloft
there!
*punct* ,
keep
thy
keenest
eye
upon
the
boats:
*punct* ,
mark
well
the
whale!
*punct* ,
ho
*punct* !
*break*
again!
*punct* ,
drive
off
that
hawk
*punct* !
*break*
he
pecks
*punct* ,
he
tears
the
vane
*punct* ,
pointing
to
the
red
flag
flying
at
the
main-truck
*punct* ,
ha
*punct* !
*break*
he
soars
away
with
it!
*punct* ,
where's
the
old
man
now
*punct* ?
*break*
sees't
thou
that
sight
*punct* ,
oh
ahab!
*punct* ,
shudder
*punct* ,
shudder
*punct* !
*break*
drive
*punct* ,
drive
in
your
nails
*punct* ,
oh
ye
waves
*punct* !
*break*
to
their
uttermost
heads
*punct* ,
drive
them
in
*punct* !
*break*
ye
but
strike
a
thing
without
a
lid
*punct* ;
and
no
coffin
and
no
hearse
can
be
mine:
*punct* ,
and
hemp
only
can
kill
me
*punct* !
*break*
suddenly
the
waters
around
them
slowly
swelled
in
broad
circles
*punct* ;
then
quickly
upheaved
*punct* ,
as
if
sideways
sliding
from
a
submerged
berg
of
ice
*punct* ,
swiftly
rising
to
the
surface
*punct* .
*break*
a
low
rumbling
sound
was
heard
*punct* ;
a
subterraneous
hum
*punct* ;
and
then
all
held
their
breaths
*punct* ;
as
bedraggled
with
trailing
ropes
*punct* ,
and
harpoons
*punct* ,
and
lances
*punct* ,
a
vast
form
shot
lengthwise
*punct* ,
but
obliquely
from
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
shrouded
in
a
thin
drooping
veil
of
mist
*punct* ,
it
hovered
for
a
moment
in
the
rainbowed
air
*punct* ;
and
then
fell
swamping
back
into
the
deep
*punct* .
*break*
crushed
thirty
feet
upwards
*punct* ,
the
waters
flashed
for
an
instant
like
heaps
of
fountains
*punct* ,
then
brokenly
sank
in
a
shower
of
flakes
*punct* ,
leaving
the
circling
surface
creamed
like
new
milk
round
the
marble
trunk
of
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
cried
ahab
to
the
oarsmen
*punct* ,
and
the
boats
darted
forward
to
the
attack
*punct* ;
but
maddened
by
yesterday's
fresh
irons
that
corroded
in
him
*punct* ,
moby
dick
seemed
combinedly
possessed
by
all
the
angels
that
fell
from
heaven
*punct* .
*break*
the
wide
tiers
of
welded
tendons
overspreading
his
broad
white
forehead
*punct* ,
beneath
the
transparent
skin
*punct* ,
looked
knitted
together
*punct* ;
as
head
on
*punct* ,
he
came
churning
his
tail
among
the
boats
*punct* ;
and
once
more
flailed
them
apart
*punct* ;
spilling
out
the
irons
and
lances
from
the
two
mates
boats
*punct* ,
and
dashing
in
one
side
of
the
upper
part
of
their
bows
*punct* ,
but
leaving
ahab's
almost
without
a
scar
*punct* .
*break*
while
daggoo
and
queequeg
were
stopping
the
strained
planks
*punct* ;
and
as
the
whale
swimming
out
from
them
*punct* ,
turned
*punct* ,
and
showed
one
entire
flank
as
he
shot
by
them
again
*punct* ;
at
that
moment
a
quick
cry
went
up
*punct* .
*break*
befooled
*punct* ,
befooled!
*punct* ,
drawing
in
a
long
lean
breath
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
parsee
*punct* !
*break*
i
see
thee
again.
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
and
thou
goest
before
*punct* ;
and
this
*punct* ,
this
then
is
the
hearse
that
thou
didst
promise
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
hold
thee
to
the
last
letter
of
thy
word
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
the
second
hearse
*punct* ?
*break*
away
*punct* ,
mates
*punct* ,
to
the
ship
*punct* !
*break*
those
boats
are
useless
now
*punct* ;
repair
them
if
ye
can
in
time
*punct* ,
and
return
to
me
*punct* ;
if
not
*punct* ,
ahab
is
enough
to
die
*punct* ,
down
*punct* ,
men
*punct* !
*break*
the
first
thing
that
but
offers
to
jump
from
this
boat
i
stand
in
*punct* ,
that
thing
i
harpoon
*punct* .
*break*
ye
are
not
other
men
*punct* ,
but
my
arms
and
my
legs
*punct* ;
and
so
obey
me.
*punct* ,
where's
the
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
gone
down
again
*punct* ?
*break*
but
he
looked
too
nigh
the
boat
*punct* ;
for
as
if
bent
upon
escaping
with
the
corpse
he
bore
*punct* ,
and
as
if
the
particular
place
of
the
last
encounter
had
been
but
a
stage
in
his
leeward
voyage
*punct* ,
moby
dick
was
now
again
steadily
swimming
forward
*punct* ;
and
had
almost
passed
the
ship,
*punct* ,
which
thus
far
had
been
sailing
in
the
contrary
direction
to
him
*punct* ,
though
for
the
present
her
headway
had
been
stopped
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
swimming
with
his
utmost
velocity
*punct* ,
and
now
only
intent
upon
pursuing
his
own
straight
path
in
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
*punct* ,
cried
starbuck
*punct* ,
not
too
late
is
it
*punct* ,
even
now
*punct* ,
the
third
day
*punct* ,
to
desist
*punct* .
*break*
moby
dick
seeks
thee
not
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
thou
*punct* ,
thou
*punct* ,
that
madly
seekest
him
*punct* !
*break*
setting
sail
to
the
rising
wind
*punct* ,
the
lonely
boat
was
swiftly
impelled
to
leeward
*punct* ,
by
both
oars
and
canvas
*punct* .
*break*
and
at
last
when
ahab
was
sliding
by
the
vessel
*punct* ,
so
near
as
plainly
to
distinguish
starbuck's
face
as
he
leaned
over
the
rail
*punct* ,
he
hailed
him
to
turn
the
vessel
about
*punct* ,
and
follow
him
*punct* ,
not
too
swiftly
*punct* ,
at
a
judicious
interval
*punct* .
*break*
glancing
upwards
*punct* ,
he
saw
tashtego
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
and
daggoo
*punct* ,
eagerly
mounting
to
the
three
mast-heads
*punct* ;
while
the
oarsmen
were
rocking
in
the
two
staved
boats
which
had
but
just
been
hoisted
to
the
side
*punct* ,
and
were
busily
at
work
in
repairing
them
*punct* .
*break*
one
after
the
other
*punct* ,
through
the
portholes
*punct* ,
as
he
sped
*punct* ,
he
also
caught
flying
glimpses
of
stubb
and
flask
*punct* ,
busying
themselves
on
deck
among
bundles
of
new
irons
and
lances
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
saw
all
this
*punct* ;
as
he
heard
the
hammers
in
the
broken
boats
*punct* ;
far
other
hammers
seemed
driving
a
nail
into
his
heart
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
rallied
*punct* .
*break*
whether
fagged
by
the
three
days
running
chase
*punct* ,
and
the
resistance
to
his
swimming
in
the
knotted
hamper
he
bore
*punct* ;
or
whether
it
was
some
latent
deceitfulness
and
malice
in
him
*punct* :
whichever
was
true
*punct* ,
the
white
whale's
way
now
began
to
abate
*punct* ,
as
it
seemed
*punct* ,
from
the
boat
so
rapidly
nearing
him
once
more
*punct* ;
though
indeed
the
whale's
last
start
had
not
been
so
long
a
one
as
before
*punct* .
*break*
and
still
as
ahab
glided
over
the
waves
the
unpitying
sharks
accompanied
him
*punct* ;
and
so
pertinaciously
stuck
to
the
boat
*punct* ;
and
so
continually
bit
at
the
plying
oars
*punct* ,
that
the
blades
became
jagged
and
crunched
*punct* ,
and
left
small
splinters
in
the
sea
*punct* ,
at
almost
every
dip
*punct* .
*break*
heed
them
not
*punct* !
*break*
those
teeth
but
give
new
rowlocks
to
your
oars
*punct* .
*break*
tis
the
better
rest
*punct* ,
the
shark's
jaw
than
the
yielding
water
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
every
bite
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
the
thin
blades
grow
smaller
and
smaller
*punct* !
*break*
they
will
last
long
enough
*punct* !
*break*
pull
on!
*punct* ,
but
who
can
tell
*punct* ,
he
muttered
*punct* ,
whether
these
sharks
swim
to
feast
on
the
whale
or
on
ahab?
*punct* ,
but
pull
on
*punct* !
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
all
alive
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
we
near
him
*punct* .
*break*
take
the
helm
*punct* ;
let
me
pass,
*punct* ,
and
so
saying
*punct* ,
two
of
the
oarsmen
helped
him
forward
to
the
bows
of
the
still
flying
boat
*punct* .
*break*
at
length
as
the
craft
was
cast
to
one
side
*punct* ,
and
ran
ranging
along
with
the
white
whale's
flank
*punct* ,
he
seemed
strangely
oblivious
of
its
advance
*punct* ,
as
the
whale
sometimes
will
*punct* ,
and
ahab
was
fairly
within
the
smoky
mountain
mist
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
thrown
off
from
the
whale's
spout
*punct* ,
curled
round
his
great
*punct* ,
monadnock
hump
*punct* ;
he
was
even
thus
close
to
him
*punct* ;
when
*punct* ,
with
body
arched
back
*punct* ,
and
both
arms
lengthwise
high-lifted
to
the
poise
*punct* ,
he
darted
his
fierce
iron
*punct* ,
and
his
far
fiercer
curse
into
the
hated
whale
*punct* .
*break*
almost
simultaneously
*punct* ,
with
a
mighty
volition
of
ungraduated
*punct* ,
instantaneous
swiftness
*punct* ,
the
white
whale
darted
through
the
weltering
sea
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
ahab
cried
out
to
the
steersman
to
take
new
turns
with
the
line
*punct* ,
and
hold
it
so
*punct* ;
and
commanded
the
crew
to
turn
round
on
their
seats
*punct* ,
and
tow
the
boat
up
to
the
mark
*punct* ;
the
moment
the
treacherous
line
felt
that
double
strain
and
tug
*punct* ,
it
snapped
in
the
empty
air
*punct* !
*break*
what
breaks
in
me
*punct* ?
*break*
some
sinew
cracks!
*punct* ,
'tis
whole
again
*punct* ;
oars
*punct* !
*break*
burst
in
upon
him
*punct* !
*break*
hearing
the
tremendous
rush
of
the
sea-crashing
boat
*punct* ,
the
whale
wheeled
round
to
present
his
blank
forehead
at
bay
*punct* ;
but
in
that
evolution
*punct* ,
catching
sight
of
the
nearing
black
hull
of
the
ship
*punct* ;
seemingly
seeing
in
it
the
source
of
all
his
persecutions
*punct* ;
bethinking
it
*punct* ,
it
may
be
*punct* ,
a
larger
and
nobler
foe
*punct* ;
of
a
sudden
*punct* ,
he
bore
down
upon
its
advancing
prow
*punct* ,
smiting
his
jaws
amid
fiery
showers
of
foam
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
staggered
*punct* ;
his
hand
smote
his
forehead
*punct* .
*break*
i
grow
blind
*punct* ;
hands
*punct* !
*break*
stretch
out
before
me
that
i
may
yet
grope
my
way
*punct* .
*break*
cried
the
cringing
oarsmen
*punct* .
*break*
oars
slope
downwards
to
thy
depths
*punct* ,
o
sea
*punct* ,
that
ere
it
be
for
ever
too
late
*punct* ,
ahab
may
slide
this
last
*punct* ,
last
time
upon
his
mark
*punct* ;
i
see
*punct* :
the
ship
*punct* !
*break*
dash
on
*punct* ,
my
men
*punct* !
*break*
will
ye
not
save
my
ship
*punct* ?
*break*
but
as
the
oarsmen
violently
forced
their
boat
through
the
sledge-hammering
seas
*punct* ,
the
before
whale-smitten
bow-ends
of
two
planks
burst
through
*punct* ,
and
in
an
instant
almost
*punct* ,
the
temporarily
disabled
boat
lay
nearly
level
with
the
waves
*punct* ;
its
half-wading
*punct* ,
splashing
crew
*punct* ,
trying
hard
to
stop
the
gap
and
bale
out
the
pouring
water
*punct* .
*break*
the
whale
*punct* ,
the
whale
*punct* !
*break*
up
helm
*punct* ,
up
helm
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
all
ye
sweet
powers
of
air
*punct* ,
now
hug
me
close
*punct* !
*break*
let
not
starbuck
die
*punct* ,
if
die
he
must
*punct* ,
in
a
woman's
fainting
fit
*punct* .
*break*
up
helm
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
ye
fools
*punct* ,
the
jaw
*punct* !
*break*
is
this
the
end
of
all
my
bursting
prayers
*punct* ?
*break*
all
my
life-long
fidelities
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* ,
lo
*punct* ,
thy
work
*punct* .
*break*
helmsman
*punct* ,
steady
*punct* .
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* !
*break*
up
helm
again
*punct* !
*break*
he
turns
to
meet
us
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
his
unappeasable
brow
drives
on
towards
one
*punct* ,
whose
duty
tells
him
he
cannot
depart
*punct* .
*break*
my
god
*punct* ,
stand
by
me
now
*punct* !
*break*
stand
not
by
me
*punct* ,
but
stand
under
me
*punct* ,
whoever
you
are
that
will
now
help
stubb
*punct* ;
for
stubb
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
sticks
here
*punct* .
*break*
i
grin
at
thee
*punct* ,
thou
grinning
whale
*punct* !
*break*
who
ever
helped
stubb
*punct* ,
or
kept
stubb
awake
*punct* ,
but
stubb's
own
unwinking
eye
*punct* ?
*break*
and
now
poor
stubb
goes
to
bed
upon
a
mattrass
that
is
all
too
soft
*punct* ;
would
it
were
stuffed
with
brushwood
*punct* !
*break*
i
grin
at
thee
*punct* ,
thou
grinning
whale
*punct* !
*break*
look
ye
*punct* ,
sun
*punct* ,
moon
*punct* ,
and
stars
*punct* !
*break*
i
call
ye
assassins
of
as
good
a
fellow
as
ever
spouted
up
his
ghost
*punct* .
*break*
for
all
that
*punct* ,
i
would
yet
ring
glasses
with
ye
*punct* ,
would
ye
but
hand
the
cup
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
thou
grinning
whale
*punct* ,
but
there'll
be
plenty
of
gulping
soon
*punct* !
*break*
why
fly
ye
not
*punct* ,
o
ahab
*punct* !
*break*
for
me
*punct* ,
off
shoes
and
jacket
to
it
*punct* ;
let
stubb
die
in
his
drawers
*punct* !
*break*
a
most
mouldy
and
over
salted
death
*punct* ,
though;
*punct* ,
cherries
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ,
for
one
red
cherry
ere
we
die
*punct* !
*break*
i
only
wish
that
we
were
where
they
grow
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ,
i
hope
my
poor
mother's
drawn
my
part-pay
ere
this
*punct* ;
if
not
*punct* ,
few
coppers
will
now
come
to
her
*punct* ,
for
the
voyage
is
up
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
ship's
bows
*punct* ,
nearly
all
the
seamen
now
hung
inactive
*punct* ;
hammers
*punct* ,
bits
of
plank
*punct* ,
lances
*punct* ,
and
harpoons
*punct* ,
mechanically
retained
in
their
hands
*punct* ,
just
as
they
had
darted
from
their
various
employments
*punct* ;
all
their
enchanted
eyes
intent
upon
the
whale
*punct* ,
which
from
side
to
side
strangely
vibrating
his
predestinating
head
*punct* ,
sent
a
broad
band
of
overspreading
semicircular
foam
before
him
as
he
rushed
*punct* .
*break*
some
fell
flat
upon
their
faces
*punct* .
*break*
like
dislodged
trucks
*punct* ,
the
heads
of
the
harpooneers
aloft
shook
on
their
bull-like
necks
*punct* .
*break*
through
the
breach
*punct* ,
they
heard
the
waters
pour
*punct* ,
as
mountain
torrents
down
a
flume
*punct* .
*break*
the
hearse!
*punct* ,
the
second
hearse
*punct* !
*break*
cried
ahab
from
the
boat
*punct* ;
its
wood
could
only
be
american
*punct* !
*break*
diving
beneath
the
settling
ship
*punct* ,
the
whale
ran
quivering
along
its
keel
*punct* ;
but
turning
under
water
*punct* ,
swiftly
shot
to
the
surface
again
*punct* ,
far
off
the
other
bow
*punct* ,
but
within
a
few
yards
of
ahab's
boat
*punct* ,
where
*punct* ,
for
a
time
*punct* ,
he
lay
quiescent
*punct* .
*break*
i
turn
my
body
from
the
sun
*punct* .
*break*
what
ho
*punct* ,
tashtego
*punct* !
*break*
let
me
hear
thy
hammer
*punct* .
*break*
ye
three
unsurrendered
spires
of
mine
*punct* ;
thou
uncracked
keel
*punct* ;
and
only
god-bullied
hull
*punct* ;
thou
firm
deck
*punct* ,
and
haughty
helm
*punct* ,
and
pole-pointed
prow,
*punct* ,
death-glorious
ship
*punct* !
*break*
must
ye
then
perish
*punct* ,
and
without
me
*punct* ?
*break*
am
i
cut
off
from
the
last
fond
pride
of
meanest
shipwrecked
captains
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
lonely
death
on
lonely
life
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
now
i
feel
my
topmost
greatness
lies
in
my
topmost
grief
*punct* .
*break*
ho
*punct* ,
ho
*punct* !
*break*
from
all
your
furthest
bounds
*punct* ,
pour
ye
now
in
*punct* ,
ye
bold
billows
of
my
whole
foregone
life
*punct* ,
and
top
this
one
piled
comber
of
my
death
*punct* !
*break*
towards
thee
i
roll
*punct* ,
thou
all-destroying
but
unconquering
whale
*punct* ;
to
the
last
i
grapple
with
thee
*punct* ;
from
hell's
heart
i
stab
at
thee
*punct* ;
for
hate's
sake
i
spit
my
last
breath
at
thee
*punct* .
*break*
sink
all
coffins
and
all
hearses
to
one
common
pool
*punct* !
*break*
and
since
neither
can
be
mine
*punct* ,
let
me
then
tow
to
pieces
*punct* ,
while
still
chasing
thee
*punct* ,
though
tied
to
thee
*punct* ,
thou
damned
whale
*punct* !
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
i
give
up
the
spear
*punct* !
*break*
the
harpoon
was
darted
*punct* ;
the
stricken
whale
flew
forward
*punct* ;
with
igniting
velocity
the
line
ran
through
the
groove;
*punct* ,
ran
foul
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
stooped
to
clear
it
*punct* ;
he
did
clear
it
*punct* ;
but
the
flying
turn
caught
him
round
the
neck
*punct* ,
and
voicelessly
as
turkish
mutes
bowstring
their
victim
*punct* ,
he
was
shot
out
of
the
boat
*punct* ,
ere
the
crew
knew
he
was
gone
*punct* .
*break*
next
instant
*punct* ,
the
heavy
eye-splice
in
the
rope's
final
end
flew
out
of
the
stark-empty
tub
*punct* ,
knocked
down
an
oarsman
*punct* ,
and
smiting
the
sea
*punct* ,
disappeared
in
its
depths
*punct* .
*break*
for
an
instant
*punct* ,
the
tranced
boat's
crew
stood
still
*punct* ;
then
turned
*punct* .
*break*
great
god
*punct* ,
where
is
the
ship
*punct* ?
*break*
and
now
*punct* ,
concentric
circles
seized
the
lone
boat
itself
*punct* ,
and
all
its
crew
*punct* ,
and
each
floating
oar
*punct* ,
and
every
lance-pole
*punct* ,
and
spinning
*punct* ,
animate
and
inanimate
*punct* ,
all
round
and
round
in
one
vortex
*punct* ,
carried
the
smallest
chip
of
the
pequod
out
of
sight
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
the
last
whelmings
intermixingly
poured
themselves
over
the
sunken
head
of
the
indian
at
the
mainmast
*punct* ,
leaving
a
few
inches
of
the
erect
spar
yet
visible
*punct* ,
together
with
long
streaming
yards
of
the
flag
*punct* ,
which
calmly
undulated
*punct* ,
with
ironical
coincidings
*punct* ,
over
the
destroying
billows
they
almost
touched;
*punct* ,
at
that
instant
*punct* ,
a
red
arm
and
a
hammer
hovered
backwardly
uplifted
in
the
open
air
*punct* ,
in
the
act
of
nailing
the
flag
faster
and
yet
faster
to
the
subsiding
spar
*punct* .
*break*
a
sky-hawk
that
tauntingly
had
followed
the
main-truck
downwards
from
its
natural
home
among
the
stars
*punct* ,
pecking
at
the
flag
*punct* ,
and
incommoding
tashtego
there
*punct* ;
this
bird
now
chanced
to
intercept
its
broad
fluttering
wing
between
the
hammer
and
the
wood
*punct* ;
and
simultaneously
feeling
that
etherial
thrill
*punct* ,
the
submerged
savage
beneath
*punct* ,
in
his
death-gasp
*punct* ,
kept
his
hammer
frozen
there
*punct* ;
and
so
the
bird
of
heaven
*punct* ,
with
archangelic
shrieks
*punct* ,
and
his
imperial
beak
thrust
upwards
*punct* ,
and
his
whole
captive
form
folded
in
the
flag
of
ahab
*punct* ,
went
down
with
his
ship
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
like
satan
*punct* ,
would
not
sink
to
hell
till
she
had
dragged
a
living
part
of
heaven
along
with
her
*punct* ,
and
helmeted
herself
with
it
*punct* .
*break*

+and
+i
only
am
escaped
alone
to
tell
thee
*punct* .
*break*
+the
drama's
done
*punct* .
*break*
+why
then
here
does
any
one
step
forth?
*punct* ,
+because
one
did
survive
the
wreck
*punct* .
*break*
+when
+i
reached
it
*punct* ,
it
had
subsided
to
a
creamy
pool
*punct* .
*break*
+round
and
round
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
and
ever
contracting
towards
the
button-like
black
bubble
at
the
axis
of
that
slowly
wheeling
circle
*punct* ,
like
another
+ixion
+i
did
revolve
*punct* .
*break*
+buoyed
up
by
that
coffin
*punct* ,
for
almost
one
whole
day
and
night
*punct* ,
+i
floated
on
a
soft
and
dirge-like
main
*punct* .
*break*
+on
the
second
day
*punct* ,
a
sail
drew
near
*punct* ,
nearer
*punct* ,
and
pic
ked
me
up
at
last
*punct* .
*break*
+it
was
the
devious-cruising
+rachel
*punct* ,
that
in
her
retracin
at
day-break
*punct* ,
the
three
mast-heads
were
punctually
manned
afresh
*punct* .
*break*
d'ye
see
him
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
after
allowing
a
little
space
for
the
light
to
spread
*punct* .
*break*
see
nothing
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
turn
up
all
hands
and
make
sail
*punct* !
*break*
he
travels
faster
than
i
thought
for;
*punct* ,
the
top-gallant
sails!
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
they
should
have
been
kept
on
her
all
night
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
matter
*punct* ,
'tis
but
resting
for
the
rush
*punct* .
*break*
here
be
it
said
*punct* ,
that
this
pertinacious
pursuit
of
one
particular
whale
*punct* ,
continued
through
day
into
night
*punct* ,
and
through
night
into
day
*punct* ,
is
a
thing
by
no
means
unprecedented
in
the
south
sea
fishery
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
in
these
cases
*punct* ,
somewhat
as
a
pilot
*punct* ,
when
about
losing
sight
of
a
coast
*punct* ,
whose
general
trending
he
well
knows
*punct* ,
and
which
he
desires
shortly
to
return
to
again
*punct* ,
but
at
some
further
point
*punct* ;
like
as
this
pilot
stands
by
his
compass
*punct* ,
and
takes
the
precise
bearing
of
the
cape
at
present
visible
*punct* ,
in
order
the
more
certainly
to
hit
aright
the
remote
*punct* ,
unseen
headland
*punct* ,
eventually
to
be
visited
*punct* :
so
does
the
fisherman
*punct* ,
at
his
compass
*punct* ,
with
the
whale
*punct* ;
for
after
being
chased
*punct* ,
and
diligently
marked
*punct* ,
through
several
hours
of
daylight
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
when
night
obscures
the
fish
*punct* ,
the
creature's
future
wake
through
the
darkness
is
almost
as
established
to
the
sagacious
mind
of
the
hunter
*punct* ,
as
the
pilot's
coast
is
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
to
this
hunter's
wondrous
skill
*punct* ,
the
proverbial
evanescence
of
a
thing
writ
in
water
*punct* ,
a
wake
*punct* ,
is
to
all
desired
purposes
well
nigh
as
reliable
as
the
steadfast
land
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
the
mighty
iron
leviathan
of
the
modern
railway
is
so
familiarly
known
in
its
every
pace
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
with
watches
in
their
hands
*punct* ,
men
time
his
rate
as
doctors
that
of
a
baby's
pulse
*punct* ;
and
lightly
say
of
it
*punct* ,
the
up
train
or
the
down
train
will
reach
such
or
such
a
spot
*punct* ,
at
such
or
such
an
hour
*punct* ;
even
so
*punct* ,
almost
*punct* ,
there
are
occasions
when
these
nantucketers
time
that
other
leviathan
of
the
deep
*punct* ,
according
to
the
observed
humor
of
his
speed
*punct* ;
and
say
to
themselves
*punct* ,
so
many
hours
hence
this
whale
will
have
gone
two
hundred
miles
*punct* ,
will
have
about
reached
this
or
that
degree
of
latitude
or
longitude
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
render
this
acuteness
at
all
successful
in
the
end
*punct* ,
the
wind
and
the
sea
must
be
the
whaleman's
allies
*punct* ;
for
of
what
present
avail
to
the
becalmed
or
windbound
mariner
is
the
skill
that
assures
him
he
is
exactly
ninety-three
leagues
and
a
quarter
from
his
port
*punct* ?
*break*
inferable
from
these
statements
*punct* ,
are
many
collateral
subtile
matters
touching
the
chase
of
whales
*punct* .
*break*
the
ship
tore
on
*punct* ;
leaving
such
a
furrow
in
the
sea
as
when
a
cannon-ball
*punct* ,
missent
*punct* ,
becomes
a
plough-share
and
turns
up
the
level
field
*punct* .
*break*
by
salt
and
hemp
*punct* !
*break*
cried
stubb
*punct* ,
but
this
swift
motion
of
the
deck
creeps
up
one's
legs
and
tingles
at
the
heart
*punct* .
*break*
some
one
take
me
up
*punct* ,
and
launch
me
*punct* ,
spine-wise
*punct* ,
on
the
sea,
*punct* ,
for
by
live-oaks
*punct* !
*break*
my
spine's
a
keel
*punct* .
*break*
ha
*punct* ,

*punct* !
*break*
we
go
the
gait
that
leaves
no
dust
behind
*punct* !
*break*
there
she
blows
*punct* ,
she
blows!
*punct* ,
she
blows!
*punct* ,
right
ahead
*punct* !
*break*
was
now
the
mast-head
cry
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* !
*break*
i
knew
it
*punct* ,
ye
can't
escape
*punct* ,
blow
on
and
split
your
spout
*punct* ,
o
whale
*punct* !
*break*
the
mad
fiend
himself
is
after
ye
*punct* !
*break*
blow
your
trump
*punct* ,
blister
your
lungs!
*punct* ,
ahab
will
dam
off
your
blood
*punct* ,
as
a
miller
shuts
his
water-gate
upon
the
stream
*punct* !
*break*
and
stubb
did
but
speak
out
for
well
nigh
all
that
crew
*punct* .
*break*
the
frenzies
of
the
chase
had
by
this
time
worked
them
bubblingly
up
*punct* ,
like
old
wine
worked
anew
*punct* .
*break*
whatever
pale
fears
and
forebodings
some
of
them
might
have
felt
before
*punct* ;
these
were
not
only
now
kept
out
of
sight
through
the
growing
awe
of
ahab
*punct* ,
but
they
were
broken
up
*punct* ,
and
on
all
sides
routed
*punct* ,
as
timid
prairie
hares
that
scatter
before
the
bounding
bison
*punct* .
*break*
the
hand
of
fate
had
snatched
all
their
souls
*punct* ;
and
by
the
stirring
perils
of
the
previous
day
*punct* ;
the
rack
of
the
past
night's
suspense
*punct* ;
the
fixed
*punct* ,
unfearing
*punct* ,
blind
*punct* ,
reckless
way
in
which
their
wild
craft
went
plunging
towards
its
flying
mark
*punct* ;
by
all
these
things
*punct* ,
their
hearts
were
bowled
along
*punct* .
*break*
the
wind
that
made
great
bellies
of
their
sails
*punct* ,
and
rushed
the
vessel
on
by
arms
invisible
as
irresistible
*punct* ;
this
seemed
the
symbol
of
that
unseen
agency
which
so
enslaved
them
to
the
race
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
one
man
*punct* ,
not
thirty
*punct* .
*break*
for
as
the
one
ship
that
held
them
all
*punct* ;
though
it
was
put
together
of
all
contrasting
things
*punct* ,
oak
*punct* ,
and
maple
*punct* ,
and
pine
wood
*punct* ;
iron
*punct* ,
and
pitch
*punct* ,
and
hemp
*punct* ,
yet
all
these
ran
into
each
other
in
the
one
concrete
hull
*punct* ,
which
shot
on
its
way
*punct* ,
both
balanced
and
directed
by
the
long
central
keel
*punct* ;
even
so
*punct* ,
all
the
individualities
of
the
crew
*punct* ,
this
man's
valor
*punct* ,
that
man's
fear
*punct* ;
guilt
and
guiltiness
*punct* ,
all
varieties
were
welded
into
oneness
*punct* ,
and
were
all
directed
to
that
fatal
goal
which
ahab
their
one
lord
and
keel
did
point
to
*punct* .
*break*
the
rigging
lived
*punct* .
*break*
the
mast-heads
*punct* ,
like
the
tops
of
tall
palms
*punct* ,
were
outspreadingly
tufted
with
arms
and
legs
*punct* .
*break*
how
they
still
strove
through
that
infinite
blueness
to
seek
out
the
thing
that
might
destroy
them
*punct* !
*break*
why
sing
ye
not
out
for
him
*punct* ,
if
ye
see
him
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
when
*punct* ,
after
the
lapse
of
some
minutes
since
the
first
cry
*punct* ,
no
more
had
been
heard
*punct* .
*break*
sway
me
up
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ;
ye
have
been
deceived
*punct* ;
not
moby
dick
casts
one
odd
jet
that
way
*punct* ,
and
then
disappears
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
even
so
*punct* ;
in
their
headlong
eagerness
*punct* ,
the
men
had
mistaken
some
other
thing
for
the
whale-spout
*punct* ,
as
the
event
itself
soon
proved
*punct* ;
for
hardly
had
ahab
reached
his
perch
*punct* ;
hardly
was
the
rope
belayed
to
its
pin
on
deck
*punct* ,
when
he
struck
the
key-note
to
an
orchestra
*punct* ,
that
made
the
air
vibrate
as
with
the
combined
discharges
of
rifles
*punct* .
*break*
the
triumphant
halloo
of
thirty
buckskin
lungs
was
heard
*punct* ,
as
*punct* ,
much
nearer
to
the
ship
than
the
place
of
the
imaginary
jet
*punct* ,
less
than
a
mile
ahead
*punct* ,
moby
dick
bodily
burst
into
view
*punct* !
*break*
for
not
by
any
calm
and
indolent
spoutings
*punct* ;
not
by
the
peaceable
gush
of
that
mystic
fountain
in
his
head
*punct* ,
did
the
white
whale
now
reveal
his
vicinity
*punct* ;
but
by
the
far
more
wondrous
phenomenon
of
breaching
*punct* .
*break*
rising
with
his
utmost
velocity
from
the
furthest
depths
*punct* ,
the
sperm
whale
thus
booms
his
entire
bulk
into
the
pure
element
of
air
*punct* ,
and
piling
up
a
mountain
of
dazzling
foam
*punct* ,
shows
his
place
to
the
distance
of
seven
miles
and
more
*punct* .
*break*
in
those
moments
*punct* ,
the
torn
*punct* ,
enraged
waves
he
shakes
off
*punct* ,
seem
his
mane
*punct* ;
in
some
cases
*punct* ,
this
breaching
is
his
act
of
defiance
*punct* .
*break*
there
she
breaches
*punct* !
*break*
there
she
breaches
*punct* !
*break*
was
the
cry
*punct* ,
as
in
his
immeasureable
bravadoes
the
white
whale
tossed
himself
salmon-like
to
heaven
*punct* .
*break*
so
suddenly
seen
in
the
blue
plain
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
and
relieved
against
the
still
bluer
margin
of
the
sky
*punct* ,
the
spray
that
he
raised
*punct* ,
for
the
moment
*punct* ,
intolerably
glittered
and
glared
like
a
glacier
*punct* ;
and
stood
there
gradually
fading
and
fading
away
from
its
first
sparkling
intensity
*punct* ,
to
the
dim
mistiness
of
an
advancing
shower
in
a
vale
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
breach
your
last
to
the
sun
*punct* ,
moby
dick
*punct* !
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
thy
hour
and
thy
harpoon
are
at
hand!
*punct* ,
down
*punct* !
*break*
down
all
of
ye
*punct* ,
but
one
man
at
the
fore
*punct* .
*break*
the
boats!
*punct* ,
stand
by
*punct* !
*break*
lower
away
*punct* ,
he
cried
*punct* ,
so
soon
as
he
had
reached
his
boat
*punct* ,
a
spare
one
*punct* ,
rigged
the
afternoon
previous
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
starbuck
*punct* ,
the
ship
is
thine
*punct* ,
keep
away
from
the
boats
*punct* ,
but
keep
near
them
*punct* .
*break*
lower
*punct* ,
all
*punct* !
*break*
as
if
to
strike
a
quick
terror
into
them
*punct* ,
by
this
time
being
the
first
assailant
himself
*punct* ,
moby
dick
had
turned
*punct* ,
and
was
now
coming
for
the
three
crews
*punct* .
*break*
ahab's
boat
was
central
*punct* ;
and
cheering
his
men
*punct* ,
he
told
them
he
would
take
the
whale
head-and-head,
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
pull
straight
up
to
his
forehead,
*punct* ,
a
not
uncommon
thing
*punct* ;
for
when
within
a
certain
limit
*punct* ,
such
a
course
excludes
the
coming
onset
from
the
whale's
sidelong
vision
*punct* .
*break*
but
ere
that
close
limit
was
gained
*punct* ,
and
while
yet
all
three
boats
were
plain
as
the
ship's
three
masts
to
his
eye
*punct* ;
the
white
whale
churning
himself
into
furious
speed
*punct* ,
almost
in
an
instant
as
it
were
*punct* ,
rushing
among
the
boats
with
open
jaws
*punct* ,
and
a
lashing
tail
*punct* ,
offered
appalling
battle
on
every
side
*punct* ;
and
heedless
of
the
irons
darted
at
him
from
every
boat
*punct* ,
seemed
only
intent
on
annihilating
each
separate
plank
of
which
those
boats
were
made
*punct* .
*break*
but
skilfully
manoeuvred
*punct* ,
incessantly
wheeling
like
trained
chargers
in
the
field
*punct* ;
the
boats
for
a
while
eluded
him
*punct* ;
though
*punct* ,
at
times
*punct* ,
but
by
a
plank's
breadth
*punct* ;
while
all
the
time
*punct* ,
ahab's
unearthly
slogan
tore
every
other
cry
but
his
to
shreds
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
last
in
his
untraceable
evolutions
*punct* ,
the
white
whale
so
crossed
and
recrossed
*punct* ,
and
in
a
thousand
ways
entangled
the
slack
of
the
three
lines
now
fast
to
him
*punct* ,
that
they
foreshortened
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
of
themselves
*punct* ,
warped
the
devoted
boats
towards
the
planted
irons
in
him
*punct* ;
though
now
for
a
moment
the
whale
drew
aside
a
little
*punct* ,
as
if
to
rally
for
a
more
tremendous
charge
*punct* .
*break*
seizing
that
opportunity
*punct* ,
ahab
first
paid
out
more
line
*punct* :
and
then
was
rapidly
hauling
and
jerking
in
upon
it
again
*punct* ,
hoping
that
way
to
disencumber
it
of
some
snarls
*punct* ,
when
lo!
*punct* ,
a
sight
more
savage
than
the
embattled
teeth
of
sharks
*punct* !
*break*
only
one
thing
could
be
done
*punct* .
*break*
seizing
the
boat-knife
*punct* ,
he
critically
reached
within
*punct* ,
through
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
without
*punct* ,
the
rays
of
steel
*punct* ;
dragged
in
the
line
beyond
*punct* ,
passed
it
*punct* ,
inboard
*punct* ,
to
the
bowsman
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
twice
sundering
the
rope
near
the
chocks
*punct* ,
dropped
the
intercepted
fagot
of
steel
into
the
sea
*punct* ;
and
was
all
fast
again
*punct* .
*break*
that
instant
*punct* ,
the
white
whale
made
a
sudden
rush
among
the
remaining
tangles
of
the
other
lines
*punct* ;
by
so
doing
*punct* ,
irresistibly
dragged
the
more
involved
boats
of
stubb
and
flask
towards
his
flukes
*punct* ;
dashed
them
together
like
two
rolling
husks
on
a
surf-beaten
beach
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
diving
down
into
the
sea
*punct* ,
disappeared
in
a
boiling
maelstrom
*punct* ,
in
which
*punct* ,
for
a
space
*punct* ,
the
odorous
cedar
chips
of
the
wrecks
danced
round
and
round
*punct* ,
like
the
grated
nutmeg
in
a
swiftly
stirred
bowl
of
punch
*punct* .
*break*
while
the
two
crews
were
yet
circling
in
the
waters
*punct* ,
reaching
out
after
the
revolving
line-tubs
*punct* ,
oars
*punct* ,
and
other
floating
furniture
*punct* ,
while
aslope
little
flask
bobbed
up
and
down
like
an
empty
vial
*punct* ,
twitching
his
legs
upwards
to
escape
the
dreaded
jaws
of
sharks
*punct* ;
and
stubb
was
lustily
singing
out
for
some
one
to
ladle
him
up
*punct* ;
and
while
the
old
man's
line
*punct* ,
now
parting
*punct* ,
admitted
of
his
pulling
into
the
creamy
pool
to
rescue
whom
he
could;
*punct* ,
in
that
wild
simultaneousness
of
a
thousand
concreted
perils,
*punct* ,
ahab's
yet
unstricken
boat
seemed
drawn
up
towards
heaven
by
invisible
wires,
*punct* ,
as
*punct* ,
arrow-like
*punct* ,
shooting
perpendicularly
from
the
sea
*punct* ,
the
white
whale
dashed
his
broad
forehead
against
its
bottom
*punct* ,
and
sent
it
*punct* ,
turning
over
and
over
*punct* ,
into
the
air
*punct* ;
till
it
fell
again
*punct* ,
gunwale
downwards
*punct* ,
and
ahab
and
his
men
struggled
out
from
under
it
*punct* ,
like
seals
from
a
seaside
cave
*punct* .
*break*
the
first
uprising
momentum
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
modifying
its
direction
as
he
struck
the
surface
*punct* ,
involuntarily
launched
him
along
it
*punct* ,
to
a
little
distance
from
the
centre
of
the
destruction
he
had
made
*punct* ;
and
with
his
back
to
it
*punct* ,
he
now
lay
for
a
moment
slowly
feeling
with
his
flukes
from
side
to
side
*punct* ;
and
whenever
a
stray
oar
*punct* ,
bit
of
plank
*punct* ,
the
least
chip
or
crumb
of
the
boats
touched
his
skin
*punct* ,
his
tail
swiftly
drew
back
*punct* ,
and
came
sideways
smiting
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
as
before
*punct* ,
the
attentive
ship
having
descried
the
whole
fight
*punct* ,
again
came
bearing
down
to
the
rescue
*punct* ,
and
dropping
a
boat
*punct* ,
picked
up
the
floating
mariners
*punct* ,
tubs
*punct* ,
oars
and
whatever
else
could
be
caught
at
*punct* ,
and
safely
landed
them
on
her
decks
*punct* .
*break*
some
sprained
shoulders
*punct* ,
wrists
*punct* ,
and
ankles
*punct* ;
livid
contusions
*punct* ;
wrenched
harpoons
and
lances
*punct* ;
inextricable
intricacies
of
rope
*punct* ;
shattered
oars
and
planks
*punct* ;
all
these
were
there
*punct* ;
but
no
fatal
or
even
serious
ill
seemed
to
have
befallen
any
one
*punct* .
*break*
as
with
fedallah
the
day
before
*punct* ,
so
ahab
was
now
found
grimly
clinging
to
his
boat's
broken
half
*punct* ,
which
afforded
a
comparatively
easy
float
*punct* ;
nor
did
it
so
exhaust
him
as
the
previous
day's
mishap
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
he
was
helped
to
the
deck
*punct* ,
all
eyes
were
fastened
upon
him
*punct* ;
as
instead
of
standing
by
himself
he
still
half-hung
upon
the
shoulder
of
starbuck
*punct* ,
who
had
thus
far
been
the
foremost
to
assist
him
*punct* .
*break*
his
ivory
leg
had
been
snapped
off
*punct* ,
leaving
but
one
short
sharp
splinter
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* ,
tis
sweet
to
lean
sometimes
*punct* ,
be
the
leaner
who
he
will
*punct* ;
and
would
old
ahab
had
leaned
oftener
than
he
has
*punct* .
*break*
the
ferrule
has
not
stood
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
the
carpenter
*punct* ,
now
coming
up
*punct* ;
i
put
good
work
into
that
leg
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
bones
broken
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
i
hope
*punct* ,
said
stubb
with
true
concern
*punct* .
*break*
and
all
splintered
to
pieces
*punct* ,
stubb!
*punct* ,
d'ye
see
it.
*punct* ,
but
even
with
a
broken
bone
*punct* ,
old
ahab
is
untouched
*punct* ;
and
i
account
no
living
bone
of
mine
one
jot
more
me
*punct* ,
than
this
dead
one
that's
lost
*punct* .
*break*
nor
white
whale
*punct* ,
nor
man
*punct* ,
nor
fiend
*punct* ,
can
so
much
as
graze
old
ahab
in
his
own
proper
and
inaccessible
being
*punct* .
*break*
can
any
lead
touch
yonder
floor
*punct* ,
any
mast
scrape
yonder
roof?
*punct* ,
aloft
there
*punct* !
*break*
dead
to
leeward
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
up
helm
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ;
pile
on
the
sail
again
*punct* ,
ship
keepers
*punct* !
*break*
down
the
rest
of
the
spare
boats
and
rig
them
*punct* ,
mr.
starbuck
away
*punct* ,
and
muster
the
boat's
crews
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
first
help
thee
towards
the
bulwarks
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
how
this
splinter
gores
me
now
*punct* !
*break*
my
body
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ,
not
thee
*punct* .
*break*
give
me
something
for
a
cane
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ,
that
shivered
lance
will
do
*punct* .
*break*
muster
the
men
*punct* .
*break*
surely
i
have
not
seen
him
yet
*punct* .
*break*
by
heaven
it
cannot
be!
*punct* ,
missing?
*punct* ,
quick
*punct* !
*break*
call
them
all
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
man's
hinted
thought
was
true
*punct* .
*break*
upon
mustering
the
company
*punct* ,
the
parsee
was
not
there
*punct* .
*break*
cried
stubb
*punct* ,
he
must
have
been
caught
in
*punct* ,
the
black
vomit
wrench
thee!
*punct* ,
run
all
of
ye
above
*punct* ,
alow
*punct* ,
cabin
*punct* ,
forecastle
*punct* ,
find
him
*punct* ,
not
gone
*punct* ,
not
gone
*punct* !
*break*
but
quickly
they
returned
to
him
with
the
tidings
that
the
parsee
was
nowhere
to
be
found
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
said
stubb
*punct* ,
caught
among
the
tangles
of
your
line
*punct* ,
i
thought
i
saw
him
dragging
under
*punct* .
*break*
gone?
*punct* ,
gone
*punct* ?
*break*
what
means
that
little
word?
*punct* ,
what
death-knell
rings
in
it
*punct* ,
that
old
ahab
shakes
as
if
he
were
the
belfry
*punct* .
*break*
the
harpoon
*punct* ,
too!
*punct* ,
toss
over
the
litter
there,
*punct* ,
d'ye
see
it?
*punct* ,
the
forged
iron
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
the
white
whale's
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
no
*punct* ,
no,
*punct* ,
blistered
fool
*punct* ;
this
hand
did
dart
it!
*punct* ,
'tis
in
the
fish!
*punct* ,
aloft
there
*punct* !
*break*
keep
him
nailed
*punct* ,
quick!
*punct* ,
all
hands
to
the
rigging
of
the
boats
*punct* ,
collect
the
oars
*punct* ,
harpooneers
*punct* !
*break*
the

hoist

the
sheets!
*punct* ,
helm
there
*punct* !
*break*
steady
*punct* ,
steady
for
your
life
*punct* !
*break*
i'll
ten
times
girdle
the
unmeasured
globe
*punct* ;
yea
and
dive
straight
through
it
*punct* ,
but
i'll
slay
him
yet
*punct* !
*break*
but
for
one
single
instant
show
thyself
*punct* ,
cried
starbuck
*punct* ;
never
*punct* ,
never
wilt
thou
capture
him
*punct* ,
old
man
*punct* ,
in
jesus
name
no
more
of
this
*punct* ,
that's
worse
than
devil's
madness
*punct* .
*break*
two
days
chased
*punct* ;
twice
stove
to
splinters
*punct* ;
thy
very
leg
once
more
snatched
from
under
thee
*punct* ;
thy
evil
shadow
gone
*punct* ,
all
good
angels
mobbing
thee
with
warnings:
*punct* ,
what
more
wouldst
thou
have?
*punct* ,
shall
we
keep
chasing
this
murderous
fish
till
he
swamps
the
last
man
*punct* ?
*break*
shall
we
be
dragged
by
him
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
*punct* ?
*break*
shall
we
be
towed
by
him
to
the
infernal
world
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
oh,
*punct* ,
impiety
and
blasphemy
to
hunt
him
more
*punct* !
*break*
but
in
this
matter
of
the
whale
*punct* ,
be
the
front
of
thy
face
to
me
as
the
palm
of
this
hand
*punct* ,
a
lipless
*punct* ,
unfeatured
blank
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
is
for
ever
ahab
*punct* ,
man
*punct* .
*break*
this
whole
act's
immutably
decreed
*punct* .
*break*
twas
rehearsed
by
thee
and
me
a
billion
years
before
this
ocean
rolled
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
the
fates
lieutenant
*punct* ;
i
act
under
orders
*punct* .
*break*
look
thou
*punct* ,
underling
*punct* !
*break*
that
thou
obeyest
mine.
*punct* ,
stand
round
me
*punct* ,
men
*punct* .
*break*
ye
see
an
old
man
cut
down
to
the
stump
*punct* ;
leaning
on
a
shivered
lance
*punct* ;
propped
up
on
a
lonely
foot
*punct* .
*break*
tis
ahab
*punct* ,
his
body's
part
*punct* ;
but
ahab's
soul's
a
centipede
*punct* ,
that
moves
upon
a
hundred
legs
*punct* .
*break*
i
feel
strained
*punct* ,
half
stranded
*punct* ,
as
ropes
that
tow
dismasted
frigates
in
a
gale
*punct* ;
and
i
may
look
so
*punct* .
*break*
but
ere
i
break
*punct* ,
ye'll
hear
me
crack
*punct* ;
and
till
ye
hear
that
*punct* ,
know
that
ahab's
hawser
tows
his
purpose
yet
*punct* .
*break*
believe
ye
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
in
the
things
called
omens
*punct* ?
*break*
then
laugh
aloud
*punct* ,
and
cry
encore
*punct* !
*break*
for
ere
they
drown
*punct* ,
drowning
things
will
twice
rise
to
the
surface
*punct* ;
then
rise
again
*punct* ,
to
sink
for
evermore
*punct* .
*break*
so
with
moby
dick
*punct* ,
two
days
he's
floated
*punct* ,
to-morrow
will
be
the
third
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
men
*punct* ,
he'll
rise
once
more,
*punct* ,
but
only
to
spout
his
last
*punct* !
*break*
d'ye
feel
brave
men
*punct* ,
brave
*punct* ?
*break*
as
fearless
fire
*punct* ,
cried
stubb
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
mechanical
*punct* ,
muttered
ahab
*punct* .
*break*
then
as
the
men
went
forward
*punct* ,
he
muttered
on:
*punct* ,
the
things
called
omens
*punct* !
*break*
and
yesterday
i
talked
the
same
to
starbuck
there
*punct* ,
concerning
my
broken
boat
*punct* .
*break*
how
valiantly
i
seek
to
drive
out
of
others
hearts
what's
clinched
so
fast
in
mine!
*punct* ,
the
parsee
*punct* ,
the
parsee!
*punct* ,
gone
*punct* ,
gone
*punct* ?
*break*
and
he
was
to
go
before:
*punct* ,
but
still
was
to
be
seen
again
ere
i
could
perish
*punct* ,
how's
that?
*punct* ,
there's
a
riddle
now
might
baffle
all
the
lawyers
backed
by
the
ghosts
of
the
whole
line
of
judges:
*punct* ,
like
a
hawk's
beak
it
pecks
my
brain
*punct* .
*break*
i'll
*punct* ,
i'll
solve
it
*punct* ,
though
*punct* !
*break*
when
dusk
descended
*punct* ,
the
whale
was
still
in
sight
to
leeward
*punct* .
*break*
so
once
more
the
sail
was
shortened
*punct* ,
and
everything
passed
nearly
as
on
the
previous
night
*punct* ;
only
*punct* ,
the
sound
of
hammers
*punct* ,
and
the
hum
of
the
grindstone
was
heard
till
nearly
daylight
*punct* ,
as
the
men
toiled
by
lanterns
in
the
complete
and
careful
rigging
of
the
spare
boats
and
sharpening
their
fresh
weapons
for
the
morrow
*punct* .
*break*
d'ye
see
him
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ;
but
the
whale
was
not
yet
in
sight
*punct* .
*break*
in
his
infallible
wake
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ;
but
follow
that
wake
*punct* ,
that's
all
*punct* .
*break*
helm
there
*punct* ;
steady
*punct* ,
as
thou
goest
*punct* ,
and
hast
been
going
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
lovely
day
again
*punct* ;
were
it
a
new-made
world
*punct* ,
and
made
for
a
summer-house
to
the
angels
*punct* ,
and
this
morning
the
first
of
its
throwing
open
to
them
*punct* ,
a
fairer
day
could
not
dawn
upon
that
world
*punct* .
*break*
here's
food
for
thought
*punct* ,
had
ahab
time
to
think
*punct* ;
but
ahab
never
thinks
*punct* ;
he
only
feels
*punct* ,
feels
*punct* ,
feels
*punct* ;
that's
tingling
enough
for
mortal
man
*punct* !
*break*
to
think's
audacity
*punct* .
*break*
god
only
has
that
right
and
privilege
*punct* .
*break*
thinking
is
*punct* ,
or
ought
to
be
*punct* ,
a
coolness
and
a
calmness
*punct* ;
and
our
poor
hearts
throb
*punct* ,
and
our
poor
brains
beat
too
much
for
that
*punct* .
*break*
and
yet
*punct* ,
i've
sometimes
thought
my
brain
was
very
calm
*punct* ,
frozen
calm
*punct* ,
this
old
skull
cracks
so
*punct* ,
like
a
glass
in
which
the
contents
turned
to
ice
*punct* ,
and
shiver
it
*punct* .
*break*
and
still
this
hair
is
growing
now
*punct* ;
this
moment
growing
*punct* ,
and
heat
must
breed
it
*punct* ;
but
no
*punct* ,
it's
like
that
sort
of
common
grass
that
will
grow
anywhere
*punct* ,
between
the
earthy
clefts
of
greenland
ice
or
in
vesuvius
lava
*punct* .
*break*
how
the
wild
winds
blow
it
*punct* ;
they
whip
it
about
me
as
the
torn
shreds
of
split
sails
lash
the
tossed
ship
they
cling
to
*punct* .
*break*
out
upon
it!
*punct* ,
it's
tainted
*punct* .
*break*
were
i
the
wind
*punct* ,
i'd
blow
no
more
on
such
a
wicked
*punct* ,
miserable
world
*punct* .
*break*
i'd
crawl
somewhere
to
a
cave
*punct* ,
and
slink
there
*punct* .
*break*
and
yet
*punct* ,
tis
a
noble
and
heroic
thing
*punct* ,
the
wind
*punct* !
*break*
who
ever
conquered
it
*punct* ?
*break*
in
every
fight
it
has
the
last
and
bitterest
blow
*punct* .
*break*
run
tilting
at
it
*punct* ,
and
you
but
run
through
it
*punct* .
*break*
a
coward
wind
that
strikes
stark
naked
men
*punct* ,
but
will
not
stand
to
receive
a
single
blow
*punct* .
*break*
even
ahab
is
a
braver
thing
*punct* ,
a
nobler
thing
that
that
*punct* .
*break*
would
now
the
wind
but
had
a
body
*punct* ;
but
all
the
things
that
most
exasperate
and
outrage
mortal
man
*punct* ,
all
these
things
are
bodiless
*punct* ,
but
only
bodiless
as
objects
*punct* ,
not
as
agents
*punct* .
*break*
there's
a
most
special
*punct* ,
a
most
cunning
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* ,
a
most
malicious
difference
*punct* !
*break*
and
yet
*punct* ,
i
say
again
*punct* ,
and
swear
it
now
*punct* ,
that
there's
something
all
glorious
and
gracious
in
the
wind
*punct* .
*break*
these
warm
trade
winds
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
that
in
the
clear
heavens
blow
straight
on
*punct* ,
in
strong
and
steadfast
*punct* ,
vigorous
mildness
*punct* ;
and
veer
not
from
their
mark
*punct* ,
however
the
baser
currents
of
the
sea
may
turn
and
tack
*punct* ,
and
mightiest
mississippies
of
the
land
swift
and
swerve
about
*punct* ,
uncertain
where
to
go
at
last
*punct* .
*break*
and
by
the
eternal
poles
*punct* !
*break*
these
same
trades
that
so
directly
blow
my
good
ship
on
*punct* ;
these
trades
*punct* ,
or
something
like
them
*punct* ,
something
so
unchangeable
*punct* ,
and
full
as
strong
*punct* ,
blow
my
keeled
soul
along
*punct* !
*break*
what
d'ye
see
*punct* ?
*break*
nothing
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
and
noon
at
hand
*punct* !
*break*
the
doubloon
goes
a-begging
*punct* !
*break*
see
the
sun
*punct* !
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
it
must
be
so
*punct* .
*break*
i've
oversailed
him
*punct* .
*break*
how
*punct* ,
got
the
start
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
he's
chasing
me
now
*punct* ;
not
i
*punct* ,
him
*punct* ,
that's
bad
*punct* ;
i
might
have
known
it
*punct* ,
too
*punct* .
*break*
the
lines
*punct* ,
the
harpoons
he's
towing
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
i
have
run
him
by
last
night
*punct* .
*break*
come
down
*punct* ,
all
of
ye
*punct* ,
but
the
regular
look
outs
*punct* !
*break*
man
the
braces
*punct* !
*break*
steering
as
she
had
done
*punct* ,
the
wind
had
been
somewhat
on
the
pequod's
quarter
*punct* ,
so
that
now
being
pointed
in
the
reverse
direction
*punct* ,
the
braced
ship
sailed
hard
upon
the
breeze
as
she
rechurned
the
cream
in
her
own
white
wake
*punct* .
*break*
against
the
wind
he
now
steers
for
the
open
jaw
*punct* ,
murmured
starbuck
to
himself
*punct* ,
as
he
coiled
the
new-hauled
main-brace
upon
the
rail
*punct* .
*break*
i
misdoubt
me
that
i
disobey
my
god
in
obeying
him
*punct* !
*break*
stand
by
to
sway
me
up
*punct* !
*break*
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
advancing
to
the
hempen
basket
*punct* .
*break*
we
should
meet
him
soon
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
and
straightway
starbuck
did
ahab's
bidding
*punct* ,
and
once
more
ahab
swung
on
high
*punct* .
*break*
a
whole
hour
now
passed
*punct* ;
gold-beaten
out
to
ages
*punct* .
*break*
time
itself
now
held
long
breaths
with
keen
suspense
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
last
*punct* ,
some
three
points
off
the
weather
bow
*punct* ,
ahab
descried
the
spout
again
*punct* ,
and
instantly
from
the
three
mast-heads
three
shrieks
went
up
as
if
the
tongues
of
fire
had
voiced
it
*punct* .
*break*
forehead
to
forehead
i
meet
thee
*punct* ,
this
third
time
*punct* ,
moby
dick
*punct* !
*break*
on
deck
there!
*punct* ,
brace
sharper
up
*punct* ;
crowd
her
into
the
wind's
eye
*punct* .
*break*
he's
too
far
off
to
lower
yet
*punct* ,
mr.
starbuck
*punct* .
*break*
the
sails
shake
*punct* !
*break*
stand
over
that
helmsman
with
a
top-maul
*punct* !
*break*
so
*punct* ,
so
*punct* ;
he
travels
fast
*punct* ,
and
i
must
down
*punct* .
*break*
but
let
me
have
one
more
good
round
look
aloft
here
at
the
sea
*punct* ;
there's
time
for
that
*punct* .
*break*
an
old
*punct* ,
old
sight
*punct* ,
and
yet
somehow
so
young
*punct* ;
aye
*punct* ,
and
not
changed
a
wink
since
i
first
saw
it
*punct* ,
a
boy
*punct* ,
from
the
sand-hills
of
nantucket
*punct* !
*break*
the
same!
*punct* ,
the
same!
*punct* ,
the
same
to
noah
as
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
there's
a
soft
shower
to
leeward
*punct* .
*break*
such
lovely
leewardings
*punct* !
*break*
they
must
lead
somewhere
*punct* ,
to
something
else
than
common
land
*punct* ,
more
palmy
than
the
palms
*punct* .
*break*
the
white
whale
goes
that
way
*punct* ;
look
to
windward
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ;
the
better
if
the
bitterer
quarter
*punct* .
*break*
but
good
bye
*punct* ,
good
bye
*punct* ,
old
mast-head
*punct* !
*break*
what's
this?
*punct* ,
green
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
tiny
mosses
in
these
warped
cracks
*punct* .
*break*
no
such
green
weather
stains
on
ahab's
head
*punct* !
*break*
there's
the
difference
now
between
man's
old
age
and
matter's
*punct* .
*break*
but
aye
*punct* ,
old
mast
*punct* ,
we
both
grow
old
together
*punct* ;
sound
in
our
hulls
*punct* ,
though
*punct* ,
are
we
not
*punct* ,
my
ship
*punct* ?
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
minus
a
leg
*punct* ,
that's
all
*punct* .
*break*
by
heaven
this
dead
wood
has
the
better
of
my
live
flesh
every
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
can't
compare
with
it
*punct* ;
and
i've
known
some
ships
made
of
dead
trees
outlast
the
lives
of
men
made
of
the
most
vital
stuff
of
vital
fathers
*punct* .
*break*
what's
that
he
said
*punct* ?
*break*
he
should
still
go
before
me
*punct* ,
my
pilot
*punct* ;
and
yet
to
be
seen
again
*punct* ?
*break*
will
i
have
eyes
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
supposing
i
descend
those
endless
stairs
*punct* ?
*break*
and
all
night
i've
been
sailing
from
him
*punct* ,
wherever
he
did
sink
to
*punct* .
*break*
good
by
*punct* ,
mast-head
*punct* ,
keep
a
good
eye
upon
the
whale
*punct* ,
the
while
i'm
gone
*punct* .
*break*
we'll
talk
to-morrow
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* ,
to-night
*punct* ,
when
the
white
whale
lies
down
there
*punct* ,
tied
by
head
and
tail
*punct* .
*break*
he
gave
the
word
*punct* ;
and
still
gazing
round
him
*punct* ,
was
steadily
lowered
through
the
cloven
blue
air
to
the
deck
*punct* .
*break*
in
due
time
the
boats
were
lowered
*punct* ,
but
as
standing
in
his
shallop's
stern
*punct* ,
ahab
just
hovered
upon
the
point
of
the
descent
*punct* ,
he
waved
to
the
mate,
*punct* ,
who
held
one
of
the
tackle-ropes
on
deck
*punct* ,
and
bade
him
pause
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
third
time
my
soul's
ship
starts
upon
this
voyage
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* .
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
thou
wilt
have
it
so
*punct* .
*break*
some
ships
sail
from
their
ports
*punct* ,
and
ever
afterwards
are
missing
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* !
*break*
truth
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* :
saddest
truth
*punct* .
*break*
some
men
die
at
ebb
tide
*punct* ;
some
at
low
water
*punct* ;
some
at
the
full
of
the
flood;
*punct* ,
and
i
feel
now
like
a
billow
that's
all
one
crested
comb
*punct* ,
starbuck
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
old;
*punct* ,
shake
hands
with
me
*punct* ,
man
*punct* .
*break*
their
hands
met
*punct* ;
their
eyes
fastened
*punct* ;
starbuck's
tears
the
glue
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
my
captain
*punct* ,
my
captain!
*punct* ,
noble
heart
*punct* ,
go
not
*punct* ,
go
not!
*punct* ,
see
*punct* ,
it's
a
brave
man
that
weeps
*punct* ;
how
great
the
agony
of
the
persuasion
then
*punct* !
*break*
lower
away!
*punct* ,
cried
ahab
*punct* ,
tossing
the
mate's
arm
from
him
*punct* .
*break*
stand
by
the
crew
*punct* !
*break*
in
an
instant
the
boat
was
pulling
round
close
under
the
stern
*punct* .
*break*
cried
a
voice
from
the
low
cabin-window
there
*punct* ;
o
master
*punct* ,
my
master
*punct* ,
come
back
*punct* !
*break*
but
ahab
heard
nothing
*punct* ;
for
his
own
voice
was
high-lifted
then
*punct* ;
and
the
boat
leaped
on
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
thing
not
uncommonly
happening
to
the
whale-boats
in
those
swarming
seas
*punct* ;
the
sharks
at
times
apparently
following
them
in
the
same
prescient
way
that
vultures
hover
over
the
banners
of
marching
regiments
in
the
east
*punct* .
*break*
but
these
were
the
first
sharks
that
had
been
observed
by
the
pequod
since
the
white
whale
had
been
first
descried
*punct* ;
and
whether
it
was
that
ahab's
crew
were
all
such
tiger-yellow
barbarians
*punct* ,
and
therefore
their
flesh
more
musky
to
the
senses
of
the
sharks
*punct* ,
a
matter
sometimes
well
known
to
affect
them,
*punct* ,
however
it
was
*punct* ,
they
seemed
to
follow
that
one
boat
without
molesting
the
others
*punct* .
*break*
heart
of
wrought
steel
*punct* !
*break*
murmured
starbuck
gazing
over
the
side
*punct* ,
and
following
with
his
eyes
the
receding
boat
*punct* ,
canst
thou
yet
ring
boldly
to
that
sight?
*punct* ,
lowering
thy
keel
among
ravening
sharks
*punct* ,
and
followed
by
them
*punct* ,
open-mouthed
to
the
chase
*punct* ;
and
this
the
critical
third
day?
*punct* ,
for
when
three
days
flow
together
in
one
continuous
intense
pursuit
*punct* ;
be
sure
the
first
is
the
morning
*punct* ,
the
second
the
noon
*punct* ,
and
the
third
the
evening
and
the
end
of
that
thing
*punct* ,
be
that
end
what
it
may
*punct* .
*break*
what
is
this
that
shoots
through
me
*punct* ,
and
leaves
me
so
deadly
calm
*punct* ,
yet
expectant,
*punct* ,
fixed
at
the
top
of
a
shudder
*punct* !
*break*
future
things
swim
before
me
*punct* ,
as
in
empty
outlines
and
skeletons
*punct* ;
all
the
past
is
somehow
grown
dim
*punct* .
*break*
mary
*punct* ,
girl
*punct* !
*break*
thou
fadest
in
pale
glories
behind
me
*punct* ;
boy
*punct* !
*break*
i
seem
to
see
but
thy
eyes
grown
wondrous
blue
*punct* .
*break*
strangest
problems
of
life
seem
clearing
*punct* ;
but
clouds
sweep
between
*punct* ,
is
my
journey's
end
coming
*punct* ?
*break*
my
legs
feel
faint
*punct* ;
like
his
who
has
footed
it
all
day
*punct* .
*break*
feel
thy
heart,
*punct* ,
beats
it
yet?
*punct* ,
stir
thyself
*punct* ,
starbuck!
*punct* ,
stave
it
off
*punct* ,
move
*punct* ,
move
*punct* !
*break*
speak
aloud!
*punct* ,
mast-head
there
*punct* !
*break*
see
ye
my
boy's
hand
on
the
hill?
*punct* ,
crazed;
*punct* ,
aloft
there!
*punct* ,
keep
thy
keenest
eye
upon
the
boats:
*punct* ,
mark
well
the
whale!
*punct* ,
ho
*punct* !
*break*
again!
*punct* ,
drive
off
that
hawk
*punct* !
*break*
he
pecks
*punct* ,
he
tears
the
vane
*punct* ,
pointing
to
the
red
flag
flying
at
the
main-truck
*punct* ,
ha
*punct* !
*break*
he
soars
away
with
it!
*punct* ,
where's
the
old
man
now
*punct* ?
*break*
sees't
thou
that
sight
*punct* ,
oh
ahab!
*punct* ,
shudder
*punct* ,
shudder
*punct* !
*break*
drive
*punct* ,
drive
in
your
nails
*punct* ,
oh
ye
waves
*punct* !
*break*
to
their
uttermost
heads
*punct* ,
drive
them
in
*punct* !
*break*
ye
but
strike
a
thing
without
a
lid
*punct* ;
and
no
coffin
and
no
hearse
can
be
mine:
*punct* ,
and
hemp
only
can
kill
me
*punct* !
*break*
suddenly
the
waters
around
them
slowly
swelled
in
broad
circles
*punct* ;
then
quickly
upheaved
*punct* ,
as
if
sideways
sliding
from
a
submerged
berg
of
ice
*punct* ,
swiftly
rising
to
the
surface
*punct* .
*break*
a
low
rumbling
sound
was
heard
*punct* ;
a
subterraneous
hum
*punct* ;
and
then
all
held
their
breaths
*punct* ;
as
bedraggled
with
trailing
ropes
*punct* ,
and
harpoons
*punct* ,
and
lances
*punct* ,
a
vast
form
shot
lengthwise
*punct* ,
but
obliquely
from
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
shrouded
in
a
thin
drooping
veil
of
mist
*punct* ,
it
hovered
for
a
moment
in
the
rainbowed
air
*punct* ;
and
then
fell
swamping
back
into
the
deep
*punct* .
*break*
crushed
thirty
feet
upwards
*punct* ,
the
waters
flashed
for
an
instant
like
heaps
of
fountains
*punct* ,
then
brokenly
sank
in
a
shower
of
flakes
*punct* ,
leaving
the
circling
surface
creamed
like
new
milk
round
the
marble
trunk
of
the
whale
*punct* .
*break*
cried
ahab
to
the
oarsmen
*punct* ,
and
the
boats
darted
forward
to
the
attack
*punct* ;
but
maddened
by
yesterday's
fresh
irons
that
corroded
in
him
*punct* ,
moby
dick
seemed
combinedly
possessed
by
all
the
angels
that
fell
from
heaven
*punct* .
*break*
the
wide
tiers
of
welded
tendons
overspreading
his
broad
white
forehead
*punct* ,
beneath
the
transparent
skin
*punct* ,
looked
knitted
together
*punct* ;
as
head
on
*punct* ,
he
came
churning
his
tail
among
the
boats
*punct* ;
and
once
more
flailed
them
apart
*punct* ;
spilling
out
the
irons
and
lances
from
the
two
mates
boats
*punct* ,
and
dashing
in
one
side
of
the
upper
part
of
their
bows
*punct* ,
but
leaving
ahab's
almost
without
a
scar
*punct* .
*break*
while
daggoo
and
queequeg
were
stopping
the
strained
planks
*punct* ;
and
as
the
whale
swimming
out
from
them
*punct* ,
turned
*punct* ,
and
showed
one
entire
flank
as
he
shot
by
them
again
*punct* ;
at
that
moment
a
quick
cry
went
up
*punct* .
*break*
befooled
*punct* ,
befooled!
*punct* ,
drawing
in
a
long
lean
breath
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
parsee
*punct* !
*break*
i
see
thee
again.
*punct* ,
aye
*punct* ,
and
thou
goest
before
*punct* ;
and
this
*punct* ,
this
then
is
the
hearse
that
thou
didst
promise
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
hold
thee
to
the
last
letter
of
thy
word
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
the
second
hearse
*punct* ?
*break*
away
*punct* ,
mates
*punct* ,
to
the
ship
*punct* !
*break*
those
boats
are
useless
now
*punct* ;
repair
them
if
ye
can
in
time
*punct* ,
and
return
to
me
*punct* ;
if
not
*punct* ,
ahab
is
enough
to
die
*punct* ,
down
*punct* ,
men
*punct* !
*break*
the
first
thing
that
but
offers
to
jump
from
this
boat
i
stand
in
*punct* ,
that
thing
i
harpoon
*punct* .
*break*
ye
are
not
other
men
*punct* ,
but
my
arms
and
my
legs
*punct* ;
and
so
obey
me.
*punct* ,
where's
the
whale
*punct* ?
*break*
gone
down
again
*punct* ?
*break*
but
he
looked
too
nigh
the
boat
*punct* ;
for
as
if
bent
upon
escaping
with
the
corpse
he
bore
*punct* ,
and
as
if
the
particular
place
of
the
last
encounter
had
been
but
a
stage
in
his
leeward
voyage
*punct* ,
moby
dick
was
now
again
steadily
swimming
forward
*punct* ;
and
had
almost
passed
the
ship,
*punct* ,
which
thus
far
had
been
sailing
in
the
contrary
direction
to
him
*punct* ,
though
for
the
present
her
headway
had
been
stopped
*punct* .
*break*
he
seemed
swimming
with
his
utmost
velocity
*punct* ,
and
now
only
intent
upon
pursuing
his
own
straight
path
in
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
*punct* ,
cried
starbuck
*punct* ,
not
too
late
is
it
*punct* ,
even
now
*punct* ,
the
third
day
*punct* ,
to
desist
*punct* .
*break*
moby
dick
seeks
thee
not
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
thou
*punct* ,
thou
*punct* ,
that
madly
seekest
him
*punct* !
*break*
setting
sail
to
the
rising
wind
*punct* ,
the
lonely
boat
was
swiftly
impelled
to
leeward
*punct* ,
by
both
oars
and
canvas
*punct* .
*break*
and
at
last
when
ahab
was
sliding
by
the
vessel
*punct* ,
so
near
as
plainly
to
distinguish
starbuck's
face
as
he
leaned
over
the
rail
*punct* ,
he
hailed
him
to
turn
the
vessel
about
*punct* ,
and
follow
him
*punct* ,
not
too
swiftly
*punct* ,
at
a
judicious
interval
*punct* .
*break*
glancing
upwards
*punct* ,
he
saw
tashtego
*punct* ,
queequeg
*punct* ,
and
daggoo
*punct* ,
eagerly
mounting
to
the
three
mast-heads
*punct* ;
while
the
oarsmen
were
rocking
in
the
two
staved
boats
which
had
but
just
been
hoisted
to
the
side
*punct* ,
and
were
busily
at
work
in
repairing
them
*punct* .
*break*
one
after
the
other
*punct* ,
through
the
portholes
*punct* ,
as
he
sped
*punct* ,
he
also
caught
flying
glimpses
of
stubb
and
flask
*punct* ,
busying
themselves
on
deck
among
bundles
of
new
irons
and
lances
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
saw
all
this
*punct* ;
as
he
heard
the
hammers
in
the
broken
boats
*punct* ;
far
other
hammers
seemed
driving
a
nail
into
his
heart
*punct* .
*break*
but
he
rallied
*punct* .
*break*
whether
fagged
by
the
three
days
running
chase
*punct* ,
and
the
resistance
to
his
swimming
in
the
knotted
hamper
he
bore
*punct* ;
or
whether
it
was
some
latent
deceitfulness
and
malice
in
him
*punct* :
whichever
was
true
*punct* ,
the
white
whale's
way
now
began
to
abate
*punct* ,
as
it
seemed
*punct* ,
from
the
boat
so
rapidly
nearing
him
once
more
*punct* ;
though
indeed
the
whale's
last
start
had
not
been
so
long
a
one
as
before
*punct* .
*break*
and
still
as
ahab
glided
over
the
waves
the
unpitying
sharks
accompanied
him
*punct* ;
and
so
pertinaciously
stuck
to
the
boat
*punct* ;
and
so
continually
bit
at
the
plying
oars
*punct* ,
that
the
blades
became
jagged
and
crunched
*punct* ,
and
left
small
splinters
in
the
sea
*punct* ,
at
almost
every
dip
*punct* .
*break*
heed
them
not
*punct* !
*break*
those
teeth
but
give
new
rowlocks
to
your
oars
*punct* .
*break*
tis
the
better
rest
*punct* ,
the
shark's
jaw
than
the
yielding
water
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
every
bite
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* ,
the
thin
blades
grow
smaller
and
smaller
*punct* !
*break*
they
will
last
long
enough
*punct* !
*break*
pull
on!
*punct* ,
but
who
can
tell
*punct* ,
he
muttered
*punct* ,
whether
these
sharks
swim
to
feast
on
the
whale
or
on
ahab?
*punct* ,
but
pull
on
*punct* !
*break*
aye
*punct* ,
all
alive
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
we
near
him
*punct* .
*break*
take
the
helm
*punct* ;
let
me
pass,
*punct* ,
and
so
saying
*punct* ,
two
of
the
oarsmen
helped
him
forward
to
the
bows
of
the
still
flying
boat
*punct* .
*break*
at
length
as
the
craft
was
cast
to
one
side
*punct* ,
and
ran
ranging
along
with
the
white
whale's
flank
*punct* ,
he
seemed
strangely
oblivious
of
its
advance
*punct* ,
as
the
whale
sometimes
will
*punct* ,
and
ahab
was
fairly
within
the
smoky
mountain
mist
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
thrown
off
from
the
whale's
spout
*punct* ,
curled
round
his
great
*punct* ,
monadnock
hump
*punct* ;
he
was
even
thus
close
to
him
*punct* ;
when
*punct* ,
with
body
arched
back
*punct* ,
and
both
arms
lengthwise
high-lifted
to
the
poise
*punct* ,
he
darted
his
fierce
iron
*punct* ,
and
his
far
fiercer
curse
into
the
hated
whale
*punct* .
*break*
almost
simultaneously
*punct* ,
with
a
mighty
volition
of
ungraduated
*punct* ,
instantaneous
swiftness
*punct* ,
the
white
whale
darted
through
the
weltering
sea
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
ahab
cried
out
to
the
steersman
to
take
new
turns
with
the
line
*punct* ,
and
hold
it
so
*punct* ;
and
commanded
the
crew
to
turn
round
on
their
seats
*punct* ,
and
tow
the
boat
up
to
the
mark
*punct* ;
the
moment
the
treacherous
line
felt
that
double
strain
and
tug
*punct* ,
it
snapped
in
the
empty
air
*punct* !
*break*
what
breaks
in
me
*punct* ?
*break*
some
sinew
cracks!
*punct* ,
'tis
whole
again
*punct* ;
oars
*punct* !
*break*
burst
in
upon
him
*punct* !
*break*
hearing
the
tremendous
rush
of
the
sea-crashing
boat
*punct* ,
the
whale
wheeled
round
to
present
his
blank
forehead
at
bay
*punct* ;
but
in
that
evolution
*punct* ,
catching
sight
of
the
nearing
black
hull
of
the
ship
*punct* ;
seemingly
seeing
in
it
the
source
of
all
his
persecutions
*punct* ;
bethinking
it
*punct* ,
it
may
be
*punct* ,
a
larger
and
nobler
foe
*punct* ;
of
a
sudden
*punct* ,
he
bore
down
upon
its
advancing
prow
*punct* ,
smiting
his
jaws
amid
fiery
showers
of
foam
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
staggered
*punct* ;
his
hand
smote
his
forehead
*punct* .
*break*
i
grow
blind
*punct* ;
hands
*punct* !
*break*
stretch
out
before
me
that
i
may
yet
grope
my
way
*punct* .
*break*
cried
the
cringing
oarsmen
*punct* .
*break*
oars
slope
downwards
to
thy
depths
*punct* ,
o
sea
*punct* ,
that
ere
it
be
for
ever
too
late
*punct* ,
ahab
may
slide
this
last
*punct* ,
last
time
upon
his
mark
*punct* ;
i
see
*punct* :
the
ship
*punct* !
*break*
dash
on
*punct* ,
my
men
*punct* !
*break*
will
ye
not
save
my
ship
*punct* ?
*break*
but
as
the
oarsmen
violently
forced
their
boat
through
the
sledge-hammering
seas
*punct* ,
the
before
whale-smitten
bow-ends
of
two
planks
burst
through
*punct* ,
and
in
an
instant
almost
*punct* ,
the
temporarily
disabled
boat
lay
nearly
level
with
the
waves
*punct* ;
its
half-wading
*punct* ,
splashing
crew
*punct* ,
trying
hard
to
stop
the
gap
and
bale
out
the
pouring
water
*punct* .
*break*
the
whale
*punct* ,
the
whale
*punct* !
*break*
up
helm
*punct* ,
up
helm
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
all
ye
sweet
powers
of
air
*punct* ,
now
hug
me
close
*punct* !
*break*
let
not
starbuck
die
*punct* ,
if
die
he
must
*punct* ,
in
a
woman's
fainting
fit
*punct* .
*break*
up
helm
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
ye
fools
*punct* ,
the
jaw
*punct* !
*break*
is
this
the
end
of
all
my
bursting
prayers
*punct* ?
*break*
all
my
life-long
fidelities
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* ,
ahab
*punct* ,
lo
*punct* ,
thy
work
*punct* .
*break*
helmsman
*punct* ,
steady
*punct* .
*break*
nay
*punct* ,
nay
*punct* !
*break*
up
helm
again
*punct* !
*break*
he
turns
to
meet
us
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
his
unappeasable
brow
drives
on
towards
one
*punct* ,
whose
duty
tells
him
he
cannot
depart
*punct* .
*break*
my
god
*punct* ,
stand
by
me
now
*punct* !
*break*
stand
not
by
me
*punct* ,
but
stand
under
me
*punct* ,
whoever
you
are
that
will
now
help
stubb
*punct* ;
for
stubb
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
sticks
here
*punct* .
*break*
i
grin
at
thee
*punct* ,
thou
grinning
whale
*punct* !
*break*
who
ever
helped
stubb
*punct* ,
or
kept
stubb
awake
*punct* ,
but
stubb's
own
unwinking
eye
*punct* ?
*break*
and
now
poor
stubb
goes
to
bed
upon
a
mattrass
that
is
all
too
soft
*punct* ;
would
it
were
stuffed
with
brushwood
*punct* !
*break*
i
grin
at
thee
*punct* ,
thou
grinning
whale
*punct* !
*break*
look
ye
*punct* ,
sun
*punct* ,
moon
*punct* ,
and
stars
*punct* !
*break*
i
call
ye
assassins
of
as
good
a
fellow
as
ever
spouted
up
his
ghost
*punct* .
*break*
for
all
that
*punct* ,
i
would
yet
ring
glasses
with
ye
*punct* ,
would
ye
but
hand
the
cup
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
oh
*punct* !
*break*
thou
grinning
whale
*punct* ,
but
there'll
be
plenty
of
gulping
soon
*punct* !
*break*
why
fly
ye
not
*punct* ,
o
ahab
*punct* !
*break*
for
me
*punct* ,
off
shoes
and
jacket
to
it
*punct* ;
let
stubb
die
in
his
drawers
*punct* !
*break*
a
most
mouldy
and
over
salted
death
*punct* ,
though;
*punct* ,
cherries
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
flask
*punct* ,
for
one
red
cherry
ere
we
die
*punct* !
*break*
i
only
wish
that
we
were
where
they
grow
*punct* .
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
stubb
*punct* ,
i
hope
my
poor
mother's
drawn
my
part-pay
ere
this
*punct* ;
if
not
*punct* ,
few
coppers
will
now
come
to
her
*punct* ,
for
the
voyage
is
up
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
ship's
bows
*punct* ,
nearly
all
the
seamen
now
hung
inactive
*punct* ;
hammers
*punct* ,
bits
of
plank
*punct* ,
lances
*punct* ,
and
harpoons
*punct* ,
mechanically
retained
in
their
hands
*punct* ,
just
as
they
had
darted
from
their
various
employments
*punct* ;
all
their
enchanted
eyes
intent
upon
the
whale
*punct* ,
which
from
side
to
side
strangely
vibrating
his
predestinating
head
*punct* ,
sent
a
broad
band
of
overspreading
semicircular
foam
before
him
as
he
rushed
*punct* .
*break*
some
fell
flat
upon
their
faces
*punct* .
*break*
like
dislodged
trucks
*punct* ,
the
heads
of
the
harpooneers
aloft
shook
on
their
bull-like
necks
*punct* .
*break*
through
the
breach
*punct* ,
they
heard
the
waters
pour
*punct* ,
as
mountain
torrents
down
a
flume
*punct* .
*break*
the
hearse!
*punct* ,
the
second
hearse
*punct* !
*break*
cried
ahab
from
the
boat
*punct* ;
its
wood
could
only
be
american
*punct* !
*break*
diving
beneath
the
settling
ship
*punct* ,
the
whale
ran
quivering
along
its
keel
*punct* ;
but
turning
under
water
*punct* ,
swiftly
shot
to
the
surface
again
*punct* ,
far
off
the
other
bow
*punct* ,
but
within
a
few
yards
of
ahab's
boat
*punct* ,
where
*punct* ,
for
a
time
*punct* ,
he
lay
quiescent
*punct* .
*break*
i
turn
my
body
from
the
sun
*punct* .
*break*
what
ho
*punct* ,
tashtego
*punct* !
*break*
let
me
hear
thy
hammer
*punct* .
*break*
must
ye
then
perish
*punct* ,
and
without
me
*punct* ?
*break*
am
i
cut
off
from
the
last
fond
pride
of
meanest
shipwrecked
captains
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
lonely
death
on
lonely
life
*punct* !
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
now
i
feel
my
topmost
greatness
lies
in
my
topmost
grief
*punct* .
*break*
ho
*punct* ,
ho
*punct* !
*break*
from
all
your
furthest
bounds
*punct* ,
pour
ye
now
in
*punct* ,
ye
bold
billows
of
my
whole
foregone
life
*punct* ,
and
top
this
one
piled
comber
of
my
death
*punct* !
*break*
towards
thee
i
roll
*punct* ,
thou
all-destroying
but
unconquering
whale
*punct* ;
to
the
last
i
grapple
with
thee
*punct* ;
from
hell's
heart
i
stab
at
thee
*punct* ;
for
hate's
sake
i
spit
my
last
breath
at
thee
*punct* .
*break*
sink
all
coffins
and
all
hearses
to
one
common
pool
*punct* !
*break*
and
since
neither
can
be
mine
*punct* ,
let
me
then
tow
to
pieces
*punct* ,
while
still
chasing
thee
*punct* ,
though
tied
to
thee
*punct* ,
thou
damned
whale
*punct* !
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
i
give
up
the
spear
*punct* !
*break*
the
harpoon
was
darted
*punct* ;
the
stricken
whale
flew
forward
*punct* ;
with
igniting
velocity
the
line
ran
through
the
groove;
*punct* ,
ran
foul
*punct* .
*break*
ahab
stooped
to
clear
it
*punct* ;
he
did
clear
it
*punct* ;
but
the
flying
turn
caught
him
round
the
neck
*punct* ,
and
voicelessly
as
turkish
mutes
bowstring
their
victim
*punct* ,
he
was
shot
out
of
the
boat
*punct* ,
ere
the
crew
knew
he
was
gone
*punct* .
*break*
next
instant
*punct* ,
the
heavy
eye-splice
in
the
rope's
final
end
flew
out
of
the
stark-empty
tub
*punct* ,
knocked
down
an
oarsman
*punct* ,
and
smiting
the
sea
*punct* ,
disappeared
in
its
depths
*punct* .
*break*
for
an
instant
*punct* ,
the
tranced
boat's
crew
stood
still
*punct* ;
then
turned
*punct* .
*break*
great
god
*punct* ,
where
is
the
ship
*punct* ?
*break*
and
now
*punct* ,
concentric
circles
seized
the
lone
boat
itself
*punct* ,
and
all
its
crew
*punct* ,
and
each
floating
oar
*punct* ,
and
every
lance-pole
*punct* ,
and
spinning
*punct* ,
animate
and
inanimate
*punct* ,
all
round
and
round
in
one
vortex
*punct* ,
carried
the
smallest
chip
of
the
pequod
out
of
sight
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
the
last
whelmings
intermixingly
poured
themselves
over
the
sunken
head
of
the
indian
at
the
mainmast
*punct* ,
leaving
a
few
inches
of
the
erect
spar
yet
visible
*punct* ,
together
with
long
streaming
yards
of
the
flag
*punct* ,
which
calmly
undulated
*punct* ,
with
ironical
coincidings
*punct* ,
over
the
destroying
billows
they
almost
touched;
*punct* ,
at
that
instant
*punct* ,
a
red
arm
and
a
hammer
hovered
backwardly
uplifted
in
the
open
air
*punct* ,
in
the
act
of
nailing
the
flag
faster
and
yet
faster
to
the
subsiding
spar
*punct* .
*break*
a
sky-hawk
that
tauntingly
had
followed
the
main-truck
downwards
from
its
natural
home
among
the
stars
*punct* ,
pecking
at
the
flag
*punct* ,
and
incommoding
tashtego
there
*punct* ;
this
bird
now
chanced
to
intercept
its
broad
fluttering
wing
between
the
hammer
and
the
wood
*punct* ;
and
simultaneously
feeling
that
etherial
thrill
*punct* ,
the
submerged
savage
beneath
*punct* ,
in
his
death-gasp
*punct* ,
kept
his
hammer
frozen
there
*punct* ;
and
so
the
bird
of
heaven
*punct* ,
with
archangelic
shrieks
*punct* ,
and
his
imperial
beak
thrust
upwards
*punct* ,
and
his
whole
captive
form
folded
in
the
flag
of
ahab
*punct* ,
went
down
with
his
ship
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
like
satan
*punct* ,
would
not
sink
to
hell
till
she
had
dragged
a
living
part
of
heaven
along
