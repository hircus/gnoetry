Title: On The Origin Of Species
Author: Charles Darwin
when
we
look
to
the
individuals
of
the
same
variety
or
sub-variety
of
our
older
cultivated
plants
and
animals
*punct* ,
one
of
the
first
points
which
strikes
us
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
that
they
generally
differ
much
more
from
each
other
*punct* ,
than
do
the
individuals
of
any
one
species
or
variety
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
reflect
on
the
vast
diversity
of
the
plants
and
animals
which
have
been
cultivated
*punct* ,
and
which
have
varied
during
all
ages
under
the
most
different
climates
and
treatment
*punct* ,
i
think
we
are
driven
to
conclude
that
this
greater
variability
is
simply
due
to
our
domestic
productions
having
been
raised
under
conditions
of
life
not
so
uniform
as
*punct* ,
and
somewhat
different
from
*punct* ,
those
to
which
the
parent-species
have
been
exposed
under
nature
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
some
probability
in
the
view
propounded
by
andrew
knight
*punct* ,
that
this
variability
may
be
partly
connected
with
excess
of
food
*punct* .
*break*
it
seems
pretty
clear
that
organic
beings
must
be
exposed
during
several
generations
to
the
new
conditions
of
life
to
cause
any
appreciable
amount
of
variation
*punct* ;
and
that
when
the
organisation
has
once
begun
to
vary
*punct* ,
it
generally
continues
to
vary
for
many
generations
*punct* .
*break*
no
case
is
on
record
of
a
variable
being
ceasing
to
be
variable
under
cultivation
*punct* .
*break*
our
oldest
cultivated
plants
*punct* ,
such
as
wheat
*punct* ,
still
often
yield
new
varieties
*punct* :
our
oldest
domesticated
animals
are
still
capable
of
rapid
improvement
or
modification
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
been
disputed
at
what
period
of
life
the
causes
of
variability
*punct* ,
whatever
they
may
be
*punct* ,
generally
act
*punct* ;
whether
during
the
early
or
late
period
of
development
of
the
embryo
*punct* ,
or
at
the
instant
of
conception
*punct* .
*break*
hilaire's
experiments
show
that
unnatural
treatment
of
the
embryo
causes
monstrosities
*punct* ;
and
monstrosities
cannot
be
separated
by
any
clear
line
of
distinction
from
mere
variations
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
suspect
that
the
most
frequent
cause
of
variability
may
be
attributed
to
the
male
and
female
reproductive
elements
having
been
affected
prior
to
the
act
of
conception
*punct* .
*break*
several
reasons
make
me
believe
in
this
*punct* ;
but
the
chief
one
is
the
remarkable
effect
which
confinement
or
cultivation
has
on
the
functions
of
the
reproductive
system
*punct* ;
this
system
appearing
to
be
far
more
susceptible
than
any
other
part
of
the
organisation
*punct* ,
to
the
action
of
any
change
in
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
is
more
easy
than
to
tame
an
animal
*punct* ,
and
few
things
more
difficult
than
to
get
it
to
breed
freely
under
confinement
*punct* ,
even
in
the
many
cases
when
the
male
and
female
unite
*punct* .
*break*
how
many
animals
there
are
which
will
not
breed
*punct* ,
though
living
long
under
not
very
close
confinement
in
their
native
country
*punct* !
*break*
this
is
generally
attributed
to
vitiated
instincts
*punct* ;
but
how
many
cultivated
plants
display
the
utmost
vigour
*punct* ,
and
yet
rarely
or
never
seed
*punct* !
*break*
in
some
few
such
cases
it
has
been
found
out
that
very
trifling
changes
*punct* ,
such
as
a
little
more
or
less
water
at
some
particular
period
of
growth
*punct* ,
will
determine
whether
or
not
the
plant
sets
a
seed
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
here
enter
on
the
copious
details
which
i
have
collected
on
this
curious
subject
*punct* ;
but
to
show
how
singular
the
laws
are
which
determine
the
reproduction
of
animals
under
confinement
*punct* ,
i
may
just
mention
that
carnivorous
animals
*punct* ,
even
from
the
tropics
*punct* ,
breed
in
this
country
pretty
freely
under
confinement
*punct* ,
with
the
exception
of
the
plantigrades
or
bear
family
*punct* ;
whereas
*punct* ,
carnivorous
birds
*punct* ,
with
the
rarest
exceptions
*punct* ,
hardly
ever
lay
fertile
eggs
*punct* .
*break*
many
exotic
plants
have
pollen
utterly
worthless
*punct* ,
in
the
same
exact
condition
as
in
the
most
sterile
hybrids
*punct* .
*break*
when
*punct* ,
on
the
one
hand
*punct* ,
we
see
domesticated
animals
and
plants
*punct* ,
though
often
weak
and
sickly
*punct* ,
yet
breeding
quite
freely
under
confinement
*punct* ;
and
when
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
we
see
individuals
*punct* ,
though
taken
young
from
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
perfectly
tamed
*punct* ,
long-lived
*punct* ,
and
healthy
*punct* ,
of
which
i
could
give
numerous
instances
*punct* ,
yet
having
their
reproductive
system
so
seriously
affected
by
unperceived
causes
as
to
fail
in
acting
*punct* ,
we
need
not
be
surprised
at
this
system
*punct* ,
when
it
does
act
under
confinement
*punct* ,
acting
not
quite
regularly
*punct* ,
and
producing
offspring
not
perfectly
like
their
parents
or
variable
*punct* .
*break*
sterility
has
been
said
to
be
the
bane
of
horticulture
*punct* ;
but
on
this
view
we
owe
variability
to
the
same
cause
which
produces
sterility
*punct* ;
and
variability
is
the
source
of
all
the
choicest
productions
of
the
garden
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
add
*punct* ,
that
as
some
organisms
will
breed
most
freely
under
the
most
unnatural
conditions
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
rabbit
and
ferret
kept
in
hutches
*punct* ,
showing
that
their
reproductive
system
has
not
been
thus
affected
*punct* ;
so
will
some
animals
and
plants
withstand
domestication
or
cultivation
*punct* ,
and
vary
very
slightly
*punct* ,
perhaps
hardly
more
than
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
a
long
list
could
easily
be
given
of
sporting
plants
*punct* ;
by
this
term
gardeners
mean
a
single
bud
or
offset
*punct* ,
which
suddenly
assumes
a
new
and
sometimes
very
different
character
from
that
of
the
rest
of
the
plant
*punct* .
*break*
such
buds
can
be
propagated
by
grafting
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
by
seed
*punct* .
*break*
these
sports
are
extremely
rare
under
nature
*punct* ,
but
far
from
rare
under
cultivation
*punct* ;
and
in
this
case
we
see
that
the
treatment
of
the
parent
has
affected
a
bud
or
offset
*punct* ,
and
not
the
ovules
or
pollen
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
the
opinion
of
most
physiologists
that
there
is
no
essential
difference
between
a
bud
and
an
ovule
in
their
earliest
stages
of
formation
*punct* ;
so
that
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
sports
support
my
view
*punct* ,
that
variability
may
be
largely
attributed
to
the
ovules
or
pollen
*punct* ,
or
to
both
*punct* ,
having
been
affected
by
the
treatment
of
the
parent
prior
to
the
act
of
conception
*punct* .
*break*
these
cases
anyhow
show
that
variation
is
not
necessarily
connected
*punct* ,
as
some
authors
have
supposed
*punct* ,
with
the
act
of
generation
*punct* .
*break*
seedlings
from
the
same
fruit
*punct* ,
and
the
young
of
the
same
litter
*punct* ,
sometimes
differ
considerably
from
each
other
*punct* ,
though
both
the
young
and
the
parents
*punct* ,
as
muller
has
remarked
*punct* ,
have
apparently
been
exposed
to
exactly
the
same
conditions
of
life
*punct* ;
and
this
shows
how
unimportant
the
direct
effects
of
the
conditions
of
life
are
in
comparison
with
the
laws
of
reproduction
*punct* ,
and
of
growth
*punct* ,
and
of
inheritance
*punct* ;
for
had
the
action
of
the
conditions
been
direct
*punct* ,
if
any
of
the
young
had
varied
*punct* ,
all
would
probably
have
varied
in
the
same
manner
*punct* .
*break*
to
judge
how
much
*punct* ,
in
the
case
of
any
variation
*punct* ,
we
should
attribute
to
the
direct
action
of
heat
*punct* ,
moisture
*punct* ,
light
*punct* ,
food
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
is
most
difficult
*punct* :
my
impression
is
*punct* ,
that
with
animals
such
agencies
have
produced
very
little
direct
effect
*punct* ,
though
apparently
more
in
the
case
of
plants
*punct* .
*break*
under
this
point
of
view
*punct* ,
mr.
buckman's
recent
experiments
on
plants
seem
extremely
valuable
*punct* .
*break*
when
all
or
nearly
all
the
individuals
exposed
to
certain
conditions
are
affected
in
the
same
way
*punct* ,
the
change
at
first
appears
to
be
directly
due
to
such
conditions
*punct* ;
but
in
some
cases
it
can
be
shown
that
quite
opposite
conditions
produce
similar
changes
of
structure
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
some
slight
amount
of
change
may
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
be
attributed
to
the
direct
action
of
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
as
*punct* ,
in
some
cases
*punct* ,
increased
size
from
amount
of
food
*punct* ,
colour
from
particular
kinds
of
food
and
from
light
*punct* ,
and
perhaps
the
thickness
of
fur
from
climate
*punct* .
*break*
habit
also
has
a
deciding
influence
*punct* ,
as
in
the
period
of
flowering
with
plants
when
transported
from
one
climate
to
another
*punct* .
*break*
in
animals
it
has
a
more
marked
effect
*punct* ;
for
instance
*punct* ,
i
find
in
the
domestic
duck
that
the
bones
of
the
wing
weigh
less
and
the
bones
of
the
leg
more
*punct* ,
in
proportion
to
the
whole
skeleton
*punct* ,
than
do
the
same
bones
in
the
wild-duck
*punct* ;
and
i
presume
that
this
change
may
be
safely
attributed
to
the
domestic
duck
flying
much
less
*punct* ,
and
walking
more
*punct* ,
than
its
wild
parent
*punct* .
*break*
the
great
and
inherited
development
of
the
udders
in
cows
and
goats
in
countries
where
they
are
habitually
milked
*punct* ,
in
comparison
with
the
state
of
these
organs
in
other
countries
*punct* ,
is
another
instance
of
the
effect
of
use
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
single
domestic
animal
can
be
named
which
has
not
in
some
country
drooping
ears
*punct* ;
and
the
view
suggested
by
some
authors
*punct* ,
that
the
drooping
is
due
to
the
disuse
of
the
muscles
of
the
ear
*punct* ,
from
the
animals
not
being
much
alarmed
by
danger
*punct* ,
seems
probable
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
many
laws
regulating
variation
*punct* ,
some
few
of
which
can
be
dimly
seen
*punct* ,
and
will
be
hereafter
briefly
mentioned
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
here
only
allude
to
what
may
be
called
correlation
of
growth
*punct* .
*break*
any
change
in
the
embryo
or
larva
will
almost
certainly
entail
changes
in
the
mature
animal
*punct* .
*break*
in
monstrosities
*punct* ,
the
correlations
between
quite
distinct
parts
are
very
curious
*punct* ;
and
many
instances
are
given
in
isidore
geoffroy
st
*punct* .
*break*
hilaire's
great
work
on
this
subject
*punct* .
*break*
breeders
believe
that
long
limbs
are
almost
always
accompanied
by
an
elongated
head
*punct* .
*break*
some
instances
of
correlation
are
quite
whimsical
*punct* ;
thus
cats
with
blue
eyes
are
invariably
deaf
*punct* ;
colour
and
constitutional
peculiarities
go
together
*punct* ,
of
which
many
remarkable
cases
could
be
given
amongst
animals
and
plants
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
facts
collected
by
heusinger
*punct* ,
it
appears
that
white
sheep
and
pigs
are
differently
affected
from
coloured
individuals
by
certain
vegetable
poisons
*punct* .
*break*
hairless
dogs
have
imperfect
teeth
*punct* ;
long-haired
and
coarse-haired
animals
are
apt
to
have
*punct* ,
as
is
asserted
*punct* ,
long
or
many
horns
*punct* ;
pigeons
with
feathered
feet
have
skin
between
their
outer
toes
*punct* ;
pigeons
with
short
beaks
have
small
feet
*punct* ,
and
those
with
long
beaks
large
feet
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
if
man
goes
on
selecting
*punct* ,
and
thus
augmenting
*punct* ,
any
peculiarity
*punct* ,
he
will
almost
certainly
unconsciously
modify
other
parts
of
the
structure
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
mysterious
laws
of
the
correlation
of
growth
*punct* .
*break*
the
result
of
the
various
*punct* ,
quite
unknown
*punct* ,
or
dimly
seen
laws
of
variation
is
infinitely
complex
and
diversified
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
well
worth
while
carefully
to
study
the
several
treatises
published
on
some
of
our
old
cultivated
plants
*punct* ,
as
on
the
hyacinth
*punct* ,
potato
*punct* ,
even
the
dahlia
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ;
and
it
is
really
surprising
to
note
the
endless
points
in
structure
and
constitution
in
which
the
varieties
and
sub-varieties
differ
slightly
from
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
organisation
seems
to
have
become
plastic
*punct* ,
and
tends
to
depart
in
some
small
degree
from
that
of
the
parental
type
*punct* .
*break*
any
variation
which
is
not
inherited
is
unimportant
for
us
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
number
and
diversity
of
inheritable
deviations
of
structure
*punct* ,
both
those
of
slight
and
those
of
considerable
physiological
importance
*punct* ,
is
endless
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
prosper
lucas's
treatise
*punct* ,
in
two
large
volumes
*punct* ,
is
the
fullest
and
the
best
on
this
subject
*punct* .
*break*
no
breeder
doubts
how
strong
is
the
tendency
to
inheritance
*punct* :
like
produces
like
is
his
fundamental
belief
*punct* :
doubts
have
been
thrown
on
this
principle
by
theoretical
writers
alone
*punct* .
*break*
when
a
deviation
appears
not
unfrequently
*punct* ,
and
we
see
it
in
the
father
and
child
*punct* ,
we
cannot
tell
whether
it
may
not
be
due
to
the
same
original
cause
acting
on
both
*punct* ;
but
when
amongst
individuals
*punct* ,
apparently
exposed
to
the
same
conditions
*punct* ,
any
very
rare
deviation
*punct* ,
due
to
some
extraordinary
combination
of
circumstances
*punct* ,
appears
in
the
parent
*punct* ,
say
*punct* ,
once
amongst
several
million
individuals
*punct* ,
and
it
reappears
in
the
child
*punct* ,
the
mere
doctrine
of
chances
almost
compels
us
to
attribute
its
reappearance
to
inheritance
*punct* .
*break*
every
one
must
have
heard
of
cases
of
albinism
*punct* ,
prickly
skin
*punct* ,
hairy
bodies
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
appearing
in
several
members
of
the
same
family
*punct* .
*break*
if
strange
and
rare
deviations
of
structure
are
truly
inherited
*punct* ,
less
strange
and
commoner
deviations
may
be
freely
admitted
to
be
inheritable
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
the
correct
way
of
viewing
the
whole
subject
*punct* ,
would
be
*punct* ,
to
look
at
the
inheritance
of
every
character
whatever
as
the
rule
*punct* ,
and
non-inheritance
as
the
anomaly
*punct* .
*break*
the
laws
governing
inheritance
are
quite
unknown
*punct* ;
no
one
can
say
why
the
same
peculiarity
in
different
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
and
in
individuals
of
different
species
*punct* ,
is
sometimes
inherited
and
sometimes
not
so
*punct* ;
why
the
child
often
reverts
in
certain
characters
to
its
grandfather
or
grandmother
or
other
much
more
remote
ancestor
*punct* ;
why
a
peculiarity
is
often
transmitted
from
one
sex
to
both
sexes
or
to
one
sex
alone
*punct* ,
more
commonly
but
not
exclusively
to
the
like
sex
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
fact
of
some
little
importance
to
us
*punct* ,
that
peculiarities
appearing
in
the
males
of
our
domestic
breeds
are
often
transmitted
either
exclusively
*punct* ,
or
in
a
much
greater
degree
*punct* ,
to
males
alone
*punct* .
*break*
a
much
more
important
rule
*punct* ,
which
i
think
may
be
trusted
*punct* ,
is
that
*punct* ,
at
whatever
period
of
life
a
peculiarity
first
appears
*punct* ,
it
tends
to
appear
in
the
offspring
at
a
corresponding
age
*punct* ,
though
sometimes
earlier
*punct* .
*break*
in
many
cases
this
could
not
be
otherwise
*punct* :
thus
the
inherited
peculiarities
in
the
horns
of
cattle
could
appear
only
in
the
offspring
when
nearly
mature
*punct* ;
peculiarities

the
silkworm

known
to
appear
at
the
corresponding
caterpillar
or
cocoon
stage
*punct* .
*break*
but
hereditary
diseases
and
some
other
facts
make
me
believe
that
the
rule
has
a
wider
extension
*punct* ,
and
that
when
there
is
no
apparent
reason
why
a
peculiarity
should
appear
at
any
particular
age
*punct* ,
yet
that
it
does
tend
to
appear
in
the
offspring
at
the
same
period
at
which
it
first
appeared
in
the
parent
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
this
rule
to
be
of
the
highest
importance
in
explaining
the
laws
of
embryology
*punct* .
*break*
these
remarks
are
of
course
confined
to
the
first
appearance
of
the
peculiarity
*punct* ,
and
not
to
its
primary
cause
*punct* ,
which
may
have
acted
on
the
ovules
or
male
element
*punct* ;
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
in
the
crossed
offspring
from
a
short-horned
cow
by
a
long-horned
bull
*punct* ,
the
greater
length
of
horn
*punct* ,
though
appearing
late
in
life
*punct* ,
is
clearly
due
to
the
male
element
*punct* .
*break*
having
alluded
to
the
subject
of
reversion
*punct* ,
i
may
here
refer
to
a
statement
often
made
by
naturalists
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
our
domestic
varieties
*punct* ,
when
run
wild
*punct* ,
gradually
but
certainly
revert
in
character
to
their
aboriginal
stocks
*punct* .
*break*
hence
it
has
been
argued
that
no
deductions
can
be
drawn
from
domestic
races
to
species
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
in
vain
endeavoured
to
discover
on
what
decisive
facts
the
above
statement
has
so
often
and
so
boldly
been
made
*punct* .
*break*
there
would
be
great
difficulty
in
proving
its
truth
*punct* :
we
may
safely
conclude
that
very
many
of
the
most
strongly-marked
domestic
varieties
could
not
possibly
live
in
a
wild
state
*punct* .
*break*
in
many
cases
we
do
not
know
what
the
aboriginal
stock
was
*punct* ,
and
so
could
not
tell
whether
or
not
nearly
perfect
reversion
had
ensued
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
quite
necessary
*punct* ,
in
order
to
prevent
the
effects
of
intercrossing
*punct* ,
that
only
a
single
variety
should
be
turned
loose
in
its
new
home
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
as
our
varieties
certainly
do
occasionally
revert
in
some
of
their
characters
to
ancestral
forms
*punct* ,
it
seems
to
me
not
improbable
*punct* ,
that
if
we
could
succeed
in
naturalising
*punct* ,
or
were
to
cultivate
*punct* ,
during
many
generations
*punct* ,
the
several
races
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
of
the
cabbage
*punct* ,
in
very
poor
soil
*punct* ,
in
which
case
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
some
effect
would
have
to
be
attributed
to
the
direct
action
of
the
poor
soil
*punct* ,
that
they
would
to
a
large
extent
*punct* ,
or
even
wholly
*punct* ,
revert
to
the
wild
aboriginal
stock
*punct* .
*break*
whether
or
not
the
experiment
would
succeed
*punct* ,
is
not
of
great
importance
for
our
line
of
argument
*punct* ;
for
by
the
experiment
itself
the
conditions
of
life
are
changed
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
could
be
shown
that
our
domestic
varieties
manifested
a
strong
tendency
to
reversion,
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
to
lose
their
acquired
characters
*punct* ,
whilst
kept
under
unchanged
conditions
*punct* ,
and
whilst
kept
in
a
considerable
body
*punct* ,
so
that
free
intercrossing
might
check
*punct* ,
by
blending
together
*punct* ,
any
slight
deviations
of
structure
*punct* ,
in
such
case
*punct* ,
i
grant
that
we
could
deduce
nothing
from
domestic
varieties
in
regard
to
species
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
evidence
in
favour
of
this
view
*punct* :
to
assert
that
we
could
not
breed
our
cart
and
race-horses
*punct* ,
long
and
short-horned
cattle
*punct* ,
and
poultry
of
various
breeds
*punct* ,
and
esculent
vegetables
*punct* ,
for
an
almost
infinite
number
of
generations
*punct* ,
would
be
opposed
to
all
experience
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
add
*punct* ,
that
when
under
nature
the
conditions
of
life
do
change
*punct* ,
variations
and
reversions
of
character
probably
do
occur
*punct* ;
but
natural
selection
*punct* ,
as
will
hereafter
be
explained
*punct* ,
will
determine
how
far
the
new
characters
thus
arising
shall
be
preserved
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
look
to
the
hereditary
varieties
or
races
of
our
domestic
animals
and
plants
*punct* ,
and
compare
them
with
species
closely
allied
together
*punct* ,
we
generally
perceive
in
each
domestic
race
*punct* ,
as
already
remarked
*punct* ,
less
uniformity
of
character
than
in
true
species
*punct* .
*break*
domestic
races
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
often
have
a
somewhat
monstrous
character
*punct* ;
by
which
i
mean
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
although
differing
from
each
other
*punct* ,
and
from
the
other
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
in
several
trifling
respects
*punct* ,
they
often
differ
in
an
extreme
degree
in
some
one
part
*punct* ,
both
when
compared
one
with
another
*punct* ,
and
more
especially
when
compared
with
all
the
species
in
nature
to
which
they
are
nearest
allied
*punct* .
*break*
with
these
exceptions
*punct* ,
and
with
that
of
the
perfect
fertility
of
varieties
when
crossed,
*punct* ,
a
subject
hereafter
to
be
discussed
*punct* ,
domestic
races
of
the
same
species
differ
from
each
other
in
the
same
manner
as
*punct* ,
only
in
most
cases
in
a
lesser
degree
than
*punct* ,
do
closely-allied
species
of
the
same
genus
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
this
must
be
admitted
*punct* ,
when
we
find
that
there
are
hardly
any
domestic
races
*punct* ,
either
amongst
animals
or
plants
*punct* ,
which
have
not
been
ranked
by
some
competent
judges
as
mere
varieties
*punct* ,
and
by
other
competent
judges
as
the
descendants
of
aboriginally
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
if
any
marked
distinction
existed
between
domestic
races
and
species
*punct* ,
this
source
of
doubt
could
not
so
perpetually
recur
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
often
been
stated
that
domestic
races
do
not
differ
from
each
other
in
characters
of
generic
value
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
it
could
be
shown
that
this
statement
is
hardly
correct
*punct* ;
but
naturalists
differ
most
widely
in
determining
what
characters
are
of
generic
value
*punct* ;
all
such
valuations
being
at
present
empirical
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
on
the
view
of
the
origin
of
genera
which
i
shall
presently
give
*punct* ,
we
have
no
right
to
expect
often
to
meet
with
generic
differences
in
our
domesticated
productions
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
attempt
to
estimate
the
amount
of
structural
difference
between
the
domestic
races
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
we
are
soon
involved
in
doubt
*punct* ,
from
not
knowing
whether
they
have
descended
from
one
or
several
parent-species
*punct* .
*break*
this
point
*punct* ,
if
it
could
be
cleared
up
*punct* ,
would
be
interesting
*punct* ;
if
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
it
could
be
shown
that
the
greyhound
*punct* ,
bloodhound
*punct* ,
terrier
*punct* ,
spaniel
*punct* ,
and
bull-dog
*punct* ,
which
we
all
know
propagate
their
kind
so
truly
*punct* ,
were
the
offspring
of
any
single
species
*punct* ,
then
such
facts
would
have
great
weight
in
making
us
doubt
about
the
immutability
of
the
many
very
closely
allied
and
natural
species
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
of
the
many
foxes
*punct* ,
inhabiting
different
quarters
of
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
believe
*punct* ,
as
we
shall
presently
see
*punct* ,
that
all
our
dogs
have
descended
from
any
one
wild
species
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
in
the
case
of
some
other
domestic
races
*punct* ,
there
is
presumptive
*punct* ,
or
even
strong
*punct* ,
evidence
in
favour
of
this
view
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
often
been
assumed
that
man
has
chosen
for
domestication
animals
and
plants
having
an
extraordinary
inherent
tendency
to
vary
*punct* ,
and
likewise
to
withstand
diverse
climates
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
dispute
that
these
capacities
have
added
largely
to
the
value
of
most
of
our
domesticated
productions
*punct* ;
but
how
could
a
savage
possibly
know
*punct* ,
when
he
first
tamed
an
animal
*punct* ,
whether
it
would
vary
in
succeeding
generations
*punct* ,
and
whether
it
would
endure
other
climates
*punct* ?
*break*
has
the
little
variability
of
the
ass
or
guinea-fowl
*punct* ,
or
the
small
power
of
endurance
of
warmth
by
the
rein-deer
*punct* ,
or
of
cold
by
the
common
camel
*punct* ,
prevented
their
domestication
*punct* ?
*break*
i
cannot
doubt
that
if
other
animals
and
plants
*punct* ,
equal
in
number
to
our
domesticated
productions
*punct* ,
and
belonging
to
equally
diverse
classes
and
countries
*punct* ,
were
taken
from
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
and
could
be
made
to
breed
for
an
equal
number
of
generations
under
domestication
*punct* ,
they
would
vary
on
an
average
as
largely
as
the
parent
species
of
our
existing
domesticated
productions
have
varied
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
case
of
most
of
our
anciently
domesticated
animals
and
plants
*punct* ,
i
do
not
think
it
is
possible
to
come
to
any
definite
conclusion
*punct* ,
whether
they
have
descended
from
one
or
several
species
*punct* .
*break*
the
argument
mainly
relied
on
by
those
who
believe
in
the
multiple
origin
of
our
domestic
animals
is
*punct* ,
that
we
find
in
the
most
ancient
records
*punct* ,
more
especially
on
the
monuments
of
egypt
*punct* ,
much
diversity
in
the
breeds
*punct* ;
and
that
some
of
the
breeds
closely
resemble
*punct* ,
perhaps
are
identical
with
*punct* ,
those
still
existing
*punct* .
*break*
even
if
this
latter
fact
were
found
more
strictly
and
generally
true
than
seems
to
me
to
be
the
case
*punct* ,
what
does
it
show
*punct* ,
but
that
some
of
our
breeds
originated
there
*punct* ,
four
or
five
thousand
years
ago
*punct* ?
*break*
but
mr.
horner's
researches
have
rendered
it
in
some
degree
probable
that
man
sufficiently
civilized
to
have
manufactured
pottery
existed
in
the
valley
of
the
nile
thirteen
or
fourteen
thousand
years
ago
*punct* ;
and
who
will
pretend
to
say
how
long
before
these
ancient
periods
*punct* ,
savages
*punct* ,
like
those
of
tierra
del
fuego
or
australia
*punct* ,
who
possess
a
semi-domestic
dog
*punct* ,
may
not
have
existed
in
egypt
*punct* ?
*break*
the
whole
subject
must
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
remain
vague
*punct* ;
nevertheless
*punct* ,
i
may
*punct* ,
without
here
entering
on
any
details
*punct* ,
state
that
*punct* ,
from
geographical
and
other
considerations
*punct* ,
i
think
it
highly
probable
that
our
domestic
dogs
have
descended
from
several
wild
species
*punct* .
*break*
in
regard
to
sheep
and
goats
i
can
form
no
opinion
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
think
*punct* ,
from
facts
communicated
to
me
by
mr.
blyth
*punct* ,
on
the
habits
*punct* ,
voice
*punct* ,
and
constitution
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
of
the
humped
indian
cattle
*punct* ,
that
these
had
descended
from
a
different
aboriginal
stock
from
our
european
cattle
*punct* ;
and
several
competent
judges
believe
that
these
latter
have
had
more
than
one
wild
parent
*punct* .
*break*
with
respect
to
horses
*punct* ,
from
reasons
which
i
cannot
give
here
*punct* ,
i
am
doubtfully
inclined
to
believe
*punct* ,
in
opposition
to
several
authors
*punct* ,
that
all
the
races
have
descended
from
one
wild
stock
*punct* .
*break*
in
regard
to
ducks
and
rabbits
*punct* ,
the
breeds
of
which
differ
considerably
from
each
other
in
structure
*punct* ,
i
do
not
doubt
that
they
all
have
descended
from
the
common
wild
duck
and
rabbit
*punct* .
*break*
the
doctrine
of
the
origin
of
our
several
domestic
races
from
several
aboriginal
stocks
*punct* ,
has
been
carried
to
an
absurd
extreme
by
some
authors
*punct* .
*break*
they
believe
that
every
race
which
breeds
true
*punct* ,
let
the
distinctive
characters
be
ever
so
slight
*punct* ,
has
had
its
wild
prototype
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
rate
there
must
have
existed
at
least
a
score
of
species
of
wild
cattle
*punct* ,
as
many
sheep
*punct* ,
and
several
goats
in
europe
alone
*punct* ,
and
several
even
within
great
britain
*punct* .
*break*
one
author
believes
that
there
formerly
existed
in
great
britain
eleven
wild
species
of
sheep
peculiar
to
it
*punct* !
*break*
when
we
bear
in
mind
that
britain
has
now
hardly
one
peculiar
mammal
*punct* ,
and
france
but
few
distinct
from
those
of
germany
and
conversely
*punct* ,
and
so
with
hungary
*punct* ,
spain
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
but
that
each
of
these
kingdoms
possesses
several
peculiar
breeds
of
cattle
*punct* ,
sheep
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
we
must
admit
that
many
domestic
breeds
have
originated
in
europe
*punct* ;
for
whence
could
they
have
been
derived
*punct* ,
as
these
several
countries
do
not
possess
a
number
of
peculiar
species
as
distinct
parent-stocks
*punct* ?
*break*
so
it
is
in
india
*punct* .
*break*
even
in
the
case
of
the
domestic
dogs
of
the
whole
world
*punct* ,
which
i
fully
admit
have
probably
descended
from
several
wild
species
*punct* ,
i
cannot
doubt
that
there
has
been
an
immense
amount
of
inherited
variation
*punct* .
*break*
who
can
believe
that
animals
closely
resembling
the
italian
greyhound
*punct* ,
the
bloodhound
*punct* ,
the
bull-dog
*punct* ,
or
blenheim
spaniel
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
so
unlike
all
wild
canidae
*punct* ,
ever
existed
freely
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ?
*break*
it
has
often
been
loosely
said
that
all
our
races
of
dogs
have
been
produced
by
the
crossing
of
a
few
aboriginal
species
*punct* ;
but
by
crossing
we
can
get
only
forms
in
some
degree
intermediate
between
their
parents
*punct* ;
and
if
we
account
for
our
several
domestic
races
by
this
process
*punct* ,
we
must
admit
the
former
existence
of
the
most
extreme
forms
*punct* ,
as
the
italian
greyhound
*punct* ,
bloodhound
*punct* ,
bull-dog
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
in
the
wild
state
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
the
possibility
of
making
distinct
races
by
crossing
has
been
greatly
exaggerated
*punct* .
*break*
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
a
race
may
be
modified
by
occasional
crosses
*punct* ,
if
aided
by
the
careful
selection
of
those
individual
mongrels
*punct* ,
which
present
any
desired
character
*punct* ;
but
that
a
race
could
be
obtained
nearly
intermediate
between
two
extremely
different
races
or
species
*punct* ,
i
can
hardly
believe
*punct* .
*break*
sebright
expressly
experimentised
for
this
object
*punct* ,
and
failed
*punct* .
*break*
the
offspring
from
the
first
cross
between
two
pure
breeds
is
tolerably
and
sometimes
*punct* ,
as
i
have
found
with
pigeons
*punct* ,
extremely
uniform
*punct* ,
and
everything
seems
simple
enough
*punct* ;
but
when
these
mongrels
are
crossed
one
with
another
for
several
generations
*punct* ,
hardly
two
of
them
will
be
alike
*punct* ,
and
then
the
extreme
difficulty
*punct* ,
or
rather
utter
hopelessness
*punct* ,
of
the
task
becomes
apparent
*punct* .
*break*
certainly
*punct* ,
a
breed
intermediate
between
two
very
distinct
breeds
could
not
be
got
without
extreme
care
and
long-continued
selection
*punct* ;
nor
can
i
find
a
single
case
on
record
of
a
permanent
race
having
been
thus
formed

the
breeds
of
the
domestic
pigeon.
*punct* ,
believing
that
it
is
always
best
to
study
some
special
group
*punct* ,
i
have
*punct* ,
after
deliberation
*punct* ,
taken
up
domestic
pigeons
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
kept
every
breed
which
i
could

have

of
the

more
especially
by

many
treatises
in
different
languages
have
been
published
on
pigeons
*punct* ,
and
some
of
them
are
very
important
*punct* ,
as
being
of
considerably
antiquity
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
associated
with
several
eminent
fanciers
*punct* ,
and
have
been
permitted
to
join
two
of
the
london
pigeon
clubs
*punct* .
*break*
the
diversity
of
the
breeds
is
something
astonishing
*punct* .
*break*
compare
the
english
carrier
and
the
short-faced
tumbler
*punct* ,
and
see
the
wonderful
difference
in
their
beaks
*punct* ,
entailing
corresponding
differences
in
their
skulls
*punct* .
*break*
the
carrier
*punct* ,
more
especially
the
male
bird
*punct* ,
is
also
remarkable
from
the
wonderful
development
of
the
carunculated
skin
about
the
head
*punct* ,
and
this
is
accompanied
by
greatly
elongated
eyelids
*punct* ,
very
large
external
orifices
to
the
nostrils
*punct* ,
and
a
wide
gape
of
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
the
short-faced
tumbler
has
a
beak
in
outline
almost
like
that
of
a
finch
*punct* ;
and
the
common
tumbler
has
the
singular
and
strictly
inherited
habit
of
flying
at
a
great
height
in
a
compact
flock
*punct* ,
and
tumbling
in
the
air
head
over
heels
*punct* .
*break*
the
runt
is
a
bird
of
great
size
*punct* ,
with
long
*punct* ,
massive
beak
and
large
feet
*punct* ;
some
of
the
sub-breeds
of
runts
have
very
long
necks
*punct* ,
others
very
long
wings
and
tails
*punct* ,
others
singularly
short
tails
*punct* .
*break*
the
barb
is
allied
to
the
carrier
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
instead
of
a
very
long
beak
*punct* ,
has
a
very
short
and
very
broad
one
*punct* .
*break*
the
pouter
has
a
much
elongated
body
*punct* ,
wings
*punct* ,
and
legs
*punct* ;
and
its
enormously
developed
crop
*punct* ,
which
it
glories
in
inflating
*punct* ,
may
well
excite
astonishment
and
even
laughter
*punct* .
*break*
the
turbit
has
a
very
short
and
conical
beak
*punct* ,
with
a
line
of
reversed
feathers
down
the
breast
*punct* ;
and
it
has
the
habit
of
continually
expanding
slightly
the
upper
part
of
the
oesophagus
*punct* .
*break*
the
jacobin
has
the
feathers
so
much
reversed
along
the
back
of
the
neck
that
they
form
a
hood
*punct* ,
and
it
has
*punct* ,
proportionally
to
its
size
*punct* ,
much
elongated
wing
and
tail
feathers
*punct* .
*break*
the
trumpeter
and
laugher
*punct* ,
as
their
names
express
*punct* ,
utter
a
very
different
coo
from
the
other
breeds
*punct* .
*break*
the
fantail
has
thirty
or
even
forty
tail-feathers
*punct* ,
instead
of
twelve
or
fourteen
*punct* ,
the
normal
number
in
all
members
of
the
great
pigeon
family
*punct* ;
and
these
feathers
are
kept
expanded
*punct* ,
and
are
carried
so
erect
that
in
good
birds
the
head
and
tail
touch
*punct* ;
the
oil-gland
is
quite
aborted
*punct* .
*break*
several
other
less
distinct
breeds
might
have
been
specified
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
skeletons
of
the
several
breeds
*punct* ,
the
development
of
the
bones
of
the
face
in
length
and
breadth
and
curvature
differs
enormously
*punct* .
*break*
the
shape
*punct* ,
as
well
as
the
breadth
and
length
of
the
ramus
of
the
lower
jaw
*punct* ,
varies
in
a
highly
remarkable
manner
*punct* .
*break*
the
number
of
the
caudal
and
sacral
vertebrae
vary
*punct* ;
as
does
the
number
of
the
ribs
*punct* ,
together
with
their
relative
breadth
and
the
presence
of
processes
*punct* .
*break*
the
size
and
shape
of
the
apertures
in
the
sternum
are
highly
variable
*punct* ;
so
is
the
degree
of
divergence
and
relative
size
of
the
two
arms
of
the
furcula
*punct* .
*break*
the
proportional
width
of
the
gape
of
mouth
*punct* ,
the
proportional
length
of
the
eyelids
*punct* ,
of
the
orifice
of
the
nostrils
*punct* ,
of
the
tongue
*punct* ,
not
always
in
strict
correlation
with
the
length
of
beak
*punct* ,
the
size
of
the
crop
and
of
the
upper
part
of
the
oesophagus
*punct* ;
the
development
and
abortion
of
the
oil-gland
*punct* ;
the
number
of
the
primary
wing
and
caudal
feathers
*punct* ;
the
relative
length
of
wing
and
tail
to
each
other
and
to
the
body
*punct* ;
the
relative
length
of
leg
and
of
the
feet
*punct* ;
the
number
of
scutellae
on
the
toes
*punct* ,
the
development
of
skin
between
the
toes
*punct* ,
are
all
points
of
structure
which
are
variable
*punct* .
*break*
the
period
at
which
the
perfect
plumage
is
acquired
varies
*punct* ,
as
does
the
state
of
the
down
with
which
the
nestling
birds
are
clothed
when
hatched
*punct* .
*break*
the
shape
and
size
of
the
eggs
vary
*punct* .
*break*
the
manner
of
flight
differs
remarkably
*punct* ;
as
does
in
some
breeds
the
voice
and
disposition
*punct* .
*break*
lastly
*punct* ,
in
certain
breeds
*punct* ,
the
males
and
females
have
come
to
differ
to
a
slight
degree
from
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
altogether
at
least
a
score
of
pigeons
might
be
chosen
*punct* ,
which
if
shown
to
an
ornithologist
*punct* ,
and
he
were
told
that
they
were
wild
birds
*punct* ,
would
certainly
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
be
ranked
by
him
as
well-defined
species
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
i
do
not
believe
that
any
ornithologist
would
place
the
english
carrier
*punct* ,
the
short-faced
tumbler
*punct* ,
the
runt
*punct* ,
the
barb
*punct* ,
pouter
*punct* ,
and
fantail
in
the
same
genus
*punct* ;
more
especially
as
in
each
of
these
breeds
several
truly-inherited
sub-breeds
*punct* ,
or
species
as
he
might
have
called
them
*punct* ,
could
be
shown
him
*punct* .
*break*
great
as
the
differences
are
between
the
breeds
of
pigeons
*punct* ,
i
am
fully
convinced
that
the
common
opinion
of
naturalists
is
correct
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
all
have
descended
from
the
rock-pigeon
*punct* ,
columba
livia
*punct* ,
including
under
this
term
several
geographical
races
or
sub-species
*punct* ,
which
differ
from
each
other
in
the
most
trifling
respects
*punct* .
*break*
as
several
of
the
reasons
which
have
led
me
to
this
belief
are
in
some
degree
applicable
in
other
cases
*punct* ,
i
will
here
briefly
give
them
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
several
breeds
are
not
varieties
*punct* ,
and
have
not
proceeded
from
the
rock-pigeon
*punct* ,
they
must
have
descended
from
at
least
seven
or
eight
aboriginal
stocks
*punct* ;
for
it
is
impossible
to
make
the
present
domestic
breeds
by
the
crossing
of
any
lesser
number
*punct* :
how
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
could
a
pouter
be
produced
by
crossing
two
breeds
unless
one
of
the
parent-stocks
possessed
the
characteristic
enormous
crop
*punct* ?
*break*
the
supposed
aboriginal
stocks
must
all
have
been
rock-pigeons
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
not
breeding
or
willingly
perching
on
trees
*punct* .
*break*
liv
ia
*punct* ,
with
its
geographical
sub-species
*punct* ,
only
two
or
three
other
species
of
rock-pigeons
are
known
*punct* ;
and
these
have
not
any
of
the
characters
of
the
domestic
breeds
*punct* .
*break*
hence
the
supposed
aboriginal
stocks
must
either
still
exist
in
the
countries
where
they
were
originally
domesticated
*punct* ,
and
yet
be
unknown
to
ornithologists
*punct* ;
and
this
*punct* ,
considering
their
size
*punct* ,
habits
*punct* ,
and
remarkable
characters
*punct* ,
seems
very
improbable
*punct* ;
or
they
must
have
become
extinct
in
the
wild
state
*punct* .
*break*
but
birds
breeding
on
precipices
*punct* ,
and
good
fliers
*punct* ,
are
unlikely
to
be
exterminated
*punct* ;
and
the
common
rock-pigeon
*punct* ,
which
has
the
same
habits
with
the
domestic
breeds
*punct* ,
has
not
been
exterminated
even
on
several
of
the
smaller
british
islets
*punct* ,
or
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
*punct* .
*break*
hence
the
supposed
extermination
of
so
many
species
having
similar
habits
with
the
rock-pigeon
seems
to
me
a
very
rash
assumption
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
the
several
above-named
domesticated
breeds
have
been
transported
to
all
parts
of
the
world
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
some
of
them
must
have
been
carried
back
again
into
their
native
country
*punct* ;
but
not
one
has
ever
become
wild
or
feral
*punct* ,
though
the
dovecot-pigeon
*punct* ,
which
is
the
rock-pigeon
in
a
very
slightly
altered
state
*punct* ,
has
become
feral
in
several
places
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
all
recent
experience
shows
that
it
is
most
difficult
to
get
any
wild
animal
to
breed
freely
under
domestication
*punct* ;
yet
on
the
hypothesis
of
the
multiple
origin
of
our
pigeons
*punct* ,
it
must
be
assumed
that
at
least
seven
or
eight
species
were
so
thoroughly
domesticated
in
ancient
times
by
half-civilized
man
*punct* ,
as
to
be
quite
prolific
under
confinement
*punct* .
*break*
an
argument
*punct* ,
as
it
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
of
great
weight
*punct* ,
and
applicable
in
several
other
cases
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
that
the
above-specified
breeds
*punct* ,
though
agreeing
generally
in
constitution
*punct* ,
habits
*punct* ,
voice
*punct* ,
colouring
*punct* ,
and
in
most
parts
of
their
structure
*punct* ,
with
the
wild
rock-pigeon
*punct* ,
yet
are
certainly
highly
abnormal
in
other
parts
of
their
structure
*punct* :
we
may
look
in
vain
throughout
the
whole
great
family
of
columbidae
for
a
beak
like
that
of
the
english
carrier
*punct* ,
or
that
of
the
short-faced
tumbler
*punct* ,
or
barb
*punct* ;
for
reversed
feathers
like
those
of
the
jacobin
*punct* ;
for
a
crop
like
that
of
the
pouter
*punct* ;
for
tail-feathers
like
those
of
the
fantail
*punct* .
*break*
hence
it
must
be
assumed
not
only
that
half-civilized
man
succeeded
in
thoroughly
domesticating
several
species
*punct* ,
but
that
he
intentionally
or
by
chance
picked
out
extraordinarily
abnormal
species
*punct* ;
and
further
*punct* ,
that
these
very
species
have
since
all
become
extinct
or
unknown
*punct* .
*break*
so
many
strange
contingencies
seem
to
me
improbable
in
the
highest
degree
*punct* .
*break*
some
facts
in
regard
to
the
colouring
of
pigeons
well
deserve
consideration
*punct* .
*break*
these
several
marks
do
not
occur
together
in
any
other
species
of
the
whole
family
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
every
one
of
the
domestic
breeds
*punct* ,
taking
thoroughly
well-bred
birds
*punct* ,
all
the
above
marks
*punct* ,
even
to
the
white
edging
of
the
outer
tail-feathers
*punct* ,
sometimes
concur
perfectly
developed
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
when
two
birds
belonging
to
two
distinct
breeds
are
crossed
*punct* ,
neither
of
which
is
blue
or
has
any
of
the
above-specified
marks
*punct* ,
the
mongrel
offspring
are
very
apt
suddenly
to
acquire
these
characters
*punct* ;
for
instance
*punct* ,
i
crossed
some
uniformly
white
fantails
with
some
uniformly
black
barbs
*punct* ,
and
they
produced
mottled
brown
and
black
birds
*punct* ;
these
i
again
crossed
together
*punct* ,
and
one
grandchild
of
the
pure
white
fantail
and
pure
black
barb
was
of
as
beautiful
a
blue
colour
*punct* ,
with
the
white
rump
*punct* ,
double
black
wing-bar
*punct* ,
and
barred
and
white-edged
tail-feathers
*punct* ,
as
any
wild
rock-pigeon
*punct* !
*break*
we
can
understand
these
facts
*punct* ,
on
the
well-known
principle
of
reversion
to
ancestral
characters
*punct* ,
if
all
the
domestic
breeds
have
descended
from
the
rock-pigeon
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
we
deny
this
*punct* ,
we
must
make
one
of
the
two
following
highly
improbable
suppositions
*punct* .
*break*
either
*punct* ,
firstly
*punct* ,
that
all
the
several
imagined
aboriginal
stocks
were
coloured
and
marked
like
the
rock-pigeon
*punct* ,
although
no
other
existing
species
is
thus
coloured
and
marked
*punct* ,
so
that
in
each
separate
breed
there
might
be
a
tendency
to
revert
to
the
very
same
colours
and
markings
*punct* .
*break*
or
*punct* ,
secondly
*punct* ,
that
each
breed
*punct* ,
even
the
purest
*punct* ,
has
within
a
dozen
or
*punct* ,
at
most
*punct* ,
within
a
score
of
generations
*punct* ,
been
crossed
by
the
rock-pigeon
*punct* :
i
say
within
a
dozen
or
twenty
generations
*punct* ,
for
we
know
of
no
fact
countenancing
the
belief
that
the
child
ever
reverts
to
some
one
ancestor
*punct* ,
removed
by
a
greater
number
of
generations
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
breed
which
has
been
crossed
only
once
with
some
distinct
breed
*punct* ,
the
tendency
to
reversion
to
any
character
derived
from
such
cross
will
naturally
become
less
and
less
*punct* ,
as
in
each
succeeding
generation
there
will
be
less
of
the
foreign
blood
*punct* ;
but
when
there
has
been
no
cross
with
a
distinct
breed
*punct* ,
and
there
is
a
tendency
in
both
parents
to
revert
to
a
character
*punct* ,
which
has
been
lost
during
some
former
generation
*punct* ,
this
tendency
*punct* ,
for
all
that
we
can
see
to
the
contrary
*punct* ,
may
be
transmitted
undiminished
for
an
indefinite
number
of
generations
*punct* .
*break*
these
two
distinct
cases
are
often
confounded
in
treatises
on
inheritance
*punct* .
*break*
lastly
*punct* ,
the
hybrids
or
mongrels
from
between
all
the
domestic
breeds
of
pigeons
are
perfectly
fertile
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
state
this
from
my
own
observations
*punct* ,
purposely
made
on
the
most
distinct
breeds
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
it
is
difficult
*punct* ,
perhaps
impossible
*punct* ,
to
bring
forward
one
case
of
the
hybrid
offspring
of
two
animals
clearly
distinct
being
themselves
perfectly
fertile
*punct* .
*break*
some
authors
believe
that
long-continued
domestication
eliminates
this
strong
tendency
to
sterility
*punct* :
from
the
history
of
the
dog
i
think
there
is
some
probability
in
this
hypothesis
*punct* ,
if
applied
to
species
closely
related
together
*punct* ,
though
it
is
unsupported
by
a
single
experiment
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
extend
the
hypothesis
so
far
as
to
suppose
that
species
*punct* ,
aboriginally
as
distinct
as
carriers
*punct* ,
tumblers
*punct* ,
pouters
*punct* ,
and
fantails
now
are
*punct* ,
should
yield
offspring
perfectly
fertile
*punct* ,
inter
se
*punct* ,
seems
to
me
rash
in
the
extreme
*punct* .
*break*
from
these
several
reasons
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
the
improbability
of
man
having
formerly
got
seven
or
eight
supposed
species
of
pigeons
to
breed
freely
under
domestication
*punct* ;
these
supposed
species
being
quite
unknown
in
a
wild
state
*punct* ,
and
their
becoming
nowhere
feral
*punct* ;
these
species
having
very
abnormal
characters
in
certain
respects
*punct* ,
as
compared
with
all
other
columbidae
*punct* ,
though
so
like
in
most
other
respects
to
the
rock-pigeon
*punct* ;
the
blue
colour
and
various
marks
occasionally
appearing
in
all
the
breeds
*punct* ,
both
when
kept
pure
and
when
crossed
*punct* ;
the
mongrel
offspring
being
perfectly
fertile;
*punct* ,
from
these
several
reasons
*punct* ,
taken
together
*punct* ,
i
can
feel
no
doubt
that
all
our
domestic
breeds
have
descended
from
the
columba
livia
with
its
geographical
sub-species
*punct* .
*break*
livia
*punct* ,
or
the
rock-pigeon
*punct* ,
has
been
found
capable
of
domestication
in
europe
and
in
india
*punct* ;
and
that
it
agrees
in
habits
and
in
a
great
number
of
points
of
structure
with
all
the
domestic
breeds
*punct* .

secondly
*punct* ,
although
an
english
carrier
or
short-faced
tumbler
differs
immensely
in
certain
characters
from
the
rock-pigeon
*punct* ,
yet
by
comparing
the
several
sub-breeds
of
these
breeds
*punct* ,
more
especially
those
brought
from
distant
countries
*punct* ,
we
can
make
an
almost
perfect
series
between
the
extremes
of
structure
*punct* .
*break*
thirdly
*punct* ,
those
characters
which
are
mainly
distinctive
of
each
breed
*punct* ,
for
instance
the
wattle
and
length
of
beak
of
the
carrier
*punct* ,
the
shortness
of
that
of
the
tumbler
*punct* ,
and
the
number
of
tail-feathers
in
the
fantail
*punct* ,
are
in
each
breed
eminently
variable
*punct* ;
and
the
explanation
of
this
fact
will
be
obvious
when
we
come
to
treat
of
selection
*punct* .
*break*
fourthly
*punct* ,
pigeons
have
been
watched
*punct* ,
and
tended
with
the
utmost
care
*punct* ,
and
loved
by
many
people
*punct* .
*break*
they
have
been
domesticated
for
thousands
of
years
in
several
quarters
of
the
world
*punct* ;
the
earliest
known
record
of
pigeons
is
in
the
fifth
aegyptian
dynasty
*punct* ,
about
3000
b.c.
*punct* ,
as
was
pointed
out
to
me
by
professor
lepsius
*punct* ;
but
mr.
birch
informs
me
that
pigeons
are
given
in
a
bill
of
fare
in
the
previous
dynasty
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
time
of
the
romans
*punct* ,
as
we
hear
from
pliny
*punct* ,
immense
prices
were
given
for
pigeons
*punct* ;
nay
*punct* ,
they
are
come
to
this
pass
*punct* ,
that
they
can
reckon
up
their
pedigree
and
race
*punct* .
*break*
pigeons
were
much
valued
by
akber
khan
in
india
*punct* ,
about
the
year
1600
*punct* ;
never
less
than
20,000
pigeons
were
taken
with
the
court
*punct* .
*break*
the
monarchs
of
iran
and
turan
sent
him
some
very
rare
birds
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
continues
the
courtly
historian
*punct* ,
his
majesty
by
crossing
the
breeds
*punct* ,
which
method
was
never
practised
before
*punct* ,
has
improved
them
astonishingly
*punct* .
*break*
about
this
same
period
the
dutch
were
as
eager
about
pigeons
as
were
the
old
romans
*punct* .
*break*
the
paramount
importance
of
these
considerations
in
explaining
the
immense
amount
of
variation
which
pigeons
have
undergone
*punct* ,
will
be
obvious
when
we
treat
of
selection
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
then
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
see
how
it
is
that
the
breeds
so
often
have
a
somewhat
monstrous
character
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
also
a
most
favourable
circumstance
for
the
production
of
distinct
breeds
*punct* ,
that
male
and
female
pigeons
can
be
easily
mated
for
life
*punct* ;
and
thus
different
breeds
can
be
kept
together
in
the
same
aviary
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
discussed
the
probable
origin
of
domestic
pigeons
at
some
*punct* ,
yet
quite
insufficient
*punct* ,
length
*punct* ;
because
when
i
first
kept
pigeons
and
watched
the
several
kinds
*punct* ,
knowing
well
how
true
they
bred
*punct* ,
i
felt
fully
as
much
difficulty
in
believing
that
they
could
ever
have
descended
from
a
common
parent
*punct* ,
as
any
naturalist
could
in
coming
to
a
similar
conclusion
in
regard
to
the
many
species
of
finches
*punct* ,
or
other
large
groups
of
birds
*punct* ,
in
nature
*punct* .
*break*
one
circumstance
has
struck
me
much
*punct* ;
namely
*punct* ,
that
all
the
breeders
of
the
various
domestic
animals
and
the
cultivators
of
plants
*punct* ,
with
whom
i
have
ever
conversed
*punct* ,
or
whose
treatises
i
have
read
*punct* ,
are
firmly
convinced
that
the
several
breeds
to
which
each
has
attended
*punct* ,
are
descended
from
so
many
aboriginally
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
ask
*punct* ,
as
i
have
asked
*punct* ,
a
celebrated
raiser
of
hereford
cattle
*punct* ,
whether
his
cattle
might
not
have
descended
from
long
horns
*punct* ,
and
he
will
laugh
you
to
scorn
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
never
met
a
pigeon
*punct* ,
or
poultry
*punct* ,
or
duck
*punct* ,
or
rabbit
fancier
*punct* ,
who
was
not
fully
convinced
that
each
main
breed
was
descended
from
a
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
van
mons
*punct* ,
in
his
treatise
on
pears
and
apples
*punct* ,
shows
how
utterly
he
disbelieves
that
the
several
sorts
*punct* ,
for
instance
a
ribston-pippin
or
codlin-apple
*punct* ,
could
ever
have
proceeded
from
the
seeds
of
the
same
tree
*punct* .
*break*
innumerable
other
examples
could
be
given
*punct* .
*break*
the
explanation
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
is
simple
*punct* :
from
long-continued
study
they
are
strongly
impressed
with
the
differences
between
the
several
races
*punct* ;
and
though
they
well
know
that
each
race
varies
slightly
*punct* ,
for
they
win
their
prizes
by
selecting
such
slight
differences
*punct* ,
yet
they
ignore
all
general
arguments
*punct* ,
and
refuse
to
sum
up
in
their
minds
slight
differences
accumulated
during
many
successive
generations
*punct* .
*break*
may
not
those
naturalists
who
*punct* ,
knowing
far
less
of
the
laws
of
inheritance
than
does
the
breeder
*punct* ,
and
knowing
no
more
than
he
does
of
the
intermediate
links
in
the
long
lines
of
descent
*punct* ,
yet
admit
that
many
of
our
domestic
races
have
descended
from
the
same
parents
*punct* ,
may
they
not
learn
a
lesson
of
caution
*punct* ,
when
they
deride
the
idea
of
species
in
a
state
of
nature
being
lineal
descendants
of
other
species
*punct* ?
*break*
selection.
*punct* ,
let
us
now
briefly
consider
the
steps
by
which
domestic
races
have
been
produced
*punct* ,
either
from
one
or
from
several
allied
species
*punct* .
*break*
some
little
effect
may
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
be
attributed
to
the
direct
action
of
the
external
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
and
some
little
to
habit
*punct* ;
but
he
would
be
a
bold
man
who
would
account
by
such
agencies
for
the
differences
of
a
dray
and
race
horse
*punct* ,
a
greyhound
and
bloodhound
*punct* ,
a
carrier
and
tumbler
pigeon
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
the
most
remarkable
features
in
our
domesticated
races
is
that
we
see
in
them
adaptation
*punct* ,
not
indeed
to
the
animal's
or
plant's
own
good
*punct* ,
but
to
man's
use
or
fancy
*punct* .
*break*
some
variations
useful
to
him
have
probably
arisen
suddenly
*punct* ,
or
by
one
step
*punct* ;
many
botanists
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
believe
that
the
fuller's
teazle
*punct* ,
with
its
hooks
*punct* ,
which
cannot
be
rivalled
by
any
mechanical
contrivance
*punct* ,
is
only
a
variety
of
the
wild
dipsacus
*punct* ;
and
this
amount
of
change
may
have
suddenly
arisen
in
a
seedling
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
has
probably
been
with
the
turnspit
dog
*punct* ;
and
this
is
known
to
have
been
the
case
with
the
ancon
sheep
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
we
compare
the
dray-horse
and
race-horse
*punct* ,
the
dromedary
and
camel
*punct* ,
the
various
breeds
of
sheep
fitted
either
for
cultivated
land
or
mountain
pasture
*punct* ,
with
the
wool
of
one
breed
good
for
one
purpose
*punct* ,
and
that
of
another
breed
for
another
purpose
*punct* ;
when
we
compare
the
many
breeds
of
dogs
*punct* ,
each
good
for
man
in
very
different
ways
*punct* ;
when
we
compare
the
game-cock
*punct* ,
so
pertinacious
in
battle
*punct* ,
with
other
breeds
so
little
quarrelsome
*punct* ,
with
everlasting
layers
which
never
desire
to
sit
*punct* ,
and
with
the
bantam
so
small
and
elegant
*punct* ;
when
we
compare
the
host
of
agricultural
*punct* ,
culinary
*punct* ,
orchard
*punct* ,
and
flower-garden
races
of
plants
*punct* ,
most
useful
to
man
at
different
seasons
and
for
different
purposes
*punct* ,
or
so
beautiful
in
his
eyes
*punct* ,
we
must
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
look
further
than
to
mere
variability
*punct* .
*break*
we
cannot
suppose
that
all
the
breeds
were
suddenly
produced
as
perfect
and
as
useful
as
we
now
see
them
*punct* ;
indeed
*punct* ,
in
several
cases
*punct* ,
we
know
that
this
has
not
been
their
history
*punct* .
*break*
the
key
is
man's
power
of
accumulative
selection
*punct* :
nature
gives
successive
variations
*punct* ;
man
adds
them
up
in
certain
directions
useful
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
sense
he
may
be
said
to
make
for
himself
useful
breeds
*punct* .
*break*
the
great
power
of
this
principle
of
selection
is
not
hypothetical
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
certain
that
several
of
our
eminent
breeders
have
*punct* ,
even
within
a
single
lifetime
*punct* ,
modified
to
a
large
extent
some
breeds
of
cattle
and
sheep
*punct* .
*break*
in
order
fully
to
realise
what
they
have
done
*punct* ,
it
is
almost
necessary
to
read
several
of
the
many
treatises
devoted
to
this
subject
*punct* ,
and
to
inspect
the
animals
*punct* .
*break*
breeders
habitually
speak
of
an
animal's
organisation
as
something
quite
plastic
*punct* ,
which
they
can
model
almost
as
they
please
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
had
space
i
could
quote
numerous
passages
to
this
effect
from
highly
competent
authorities
*punct* .
*break*
youatt
*punct* ,
who
was
probably
better
acquainted
with
the
works
of
agriculturalists
than
almost
any
other
individual
*punct* ,
and
who
was
himself
a
very
good
judge
of
an
animal
*punct* ,
speaks
of
the
principle
of
selection
as
that
which
enables
the
agriculturist
*punct* ,
not
only
to
modify
the
character
of
his
flock
*punct* ,
but
to
change
it
altogether
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
the
magician's
wand
*punct* ,
by
means
of
which
he
may
summon
into
life
whatever
form
and
mould
he
pleases
*punct* .
*break*
lord
somerville
*punct* ,
speaking
of
what
breeders
have
done
for
sheep
*punct* ,
says:
*punct* -
it
would
seem
as
if
they
had
chalked
out
upon
a
wall
a
form
perfect
in
itself
*punct* ,
and
then
had
given
it
existence
*punct* .
*break*
that
most
skilful
breeder
*punct* ,
sir
john
sebright
*punct* ,
used
to
say
*punct* ,
with
respect
to
pigeons
*punct* ,
that
he
would
produce
any
given
feather
in
three
years
*punct* ,
but
it
would
take
him
six
years
to
obtain
head
and
beak
*punct* .
*break*
in
saxony
the
importance
of
the
principle
of
selection
in
regard
to
merino
sheep
is
so
fully
recognised
*punct* ,
that
men
follow
it
as
a
trade
*punct* :
the
sheep
are
placed
on
a
table
and
are
studied
*punct* ,
like
a
picture
by
a
connoisseur
*punct* ;
this
is
done
three
times
at
intervals
of
months
*punct* ,
and
the
sheep
are
each
time
marked
and
classed
*punct* ,
so
that
the
very
best
may
ultimately
be
selected
for
breeding
*punct* .
*break*
what
english
breeders
have
actually
effected
is
proved
by
the
enormous
prices
given
for
animals
with
a
good
pedigree
*punct* ;
and
these
have
now
been
exported
to
almost
every
quarter
of
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
the
improvement
is
by
no
means
generally
due
to
crossing
different
breeds
*punct* ;
all
the
best
breeders
are
strongly
opposed
to
this
practice
*punct* ,
except
sometimes
amongst
closely
allied
sub-breeds
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
a
cross
has
been
made
*punct* ,
the
closest
selection
is
far
more
indispensable
even
than
in
ordinary
cases
*punct* .
*break*
if
selection
consisted
merely
in
separating
some
very
distinct
variety
*punct* ,
and
breeding
from
it
*punct* ,
the
principle
would
be
so
obvious
as
hardly
to
be
worth
notice
*punct* ;
but
its
importance
consists
in
the
great
effect
produced
by
the
accumulation
in
one
direction
*punct* ,
during
successive
generations
*punct* ,
of
differences
absolutely
inappreciable
by
an
uneducated
eye
*punct* ,
differences
which
i
for
one
have
vainly
attempted
to
appreciate
*punct* .
*break*
not
one
man
in
a
thousand
has
accuracy
of
eye
and
judgment
sufficient
to
become
an
eminent
breeder
*punct* .
*break*
if
gifted
with
these
qualities
*punct* ,
and
he
studies
his
subject
for
years
*punct* ,
and
devotes
his
lifetime
to
it
with
indomitable
perseverance
*punct* ,
he
will
succeed
*punct* ,
and
may
make
great
improvements
*punct* ;
if
he
wants
any
of
these
qualities
*punct* ,
he
will
assuredly
fail
*punct* .
*break*
few
would
readily
believe
in
the
natural
capacity
and
years
of
practice
requisite
to
become
even
a
skilful
pigeon-fancier
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
principles
are
followed
by
horticulturists
*punct* ;
but
the
variations
are
here
often
more
abrupt
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
supposes
that
our
choicest
productions
have
been
produced
by
a
single
variation
from
the
aboriginal
stock
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
proofs
that
this
is
not
so
in
some
cases
*punct* ,
in
which
exact
records
have
been
kept
*punct* ;
thus
*punct* ,
to
give
a
very
trifling
instance
*punct* ,
the
steadily-increasing
size
of
the
common
gooseberry
may
be
quoted
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
an
astonishing
improvement
in
many
florists
flowers
*punct* ,
when
the
flowers
of
the
present
day
are
compared
with
drawings
made
only
twenty
or
thirty
years
ago
*punct* .
*break*
when
a
race
of
plants
is
once
pretty
well
established
*punct* ,
the
seed-raisers
do
not
pick
out
the
best
plants
*punct* ,
but
merely
go
over
their
seed-beds
*punct* ,
and
pull
up
the
rogues
*punct* ,
as
they
call
the
plants
that
deviate
from
the
proper
standard
*punct* .
*break*
with
animals
this
kind
of
selection
is
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
also
followed
*punct* ;
for
hardly
any
one
is
so
careless
as
to
allow
his
worst
animals
to
breed
*punct* .
*break*
in
regard
to
plants
*punct* ,
there
is
another
means
of
observing
the
accumulated
effects
of
selection
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
by
comparing
the
diversity
of
flowers
in
the
different
varieties
of
the
same
species
in
the
flower-garden
*punct* ;
the
diversity
of
leaves
*punct* ,
pods
*punct* ,
or
tubers
*punct* ,
or
whatever
part
is
valued
*punct* ,
in
the
kitchen-garden
*punct* ,
in
comparison
with
the
flowers
of
the
same
varieties
*punct* ;
and
the
diversity
of
fruit
of
the
same
species
in
the
orchard
*punct* ,
in
comparison
with
the
leaves
and
flowers
of
the
same
set
of
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
see
how
different
the
leaves
of
the
cabbage
are
*punct* ,
and
how
extremely
alike
the
flowers
*punct* ;
how
unlike
the
flowers
of
the
heartsease
are
*punct* ,
and
how
alike
the
leaves
*punct* ;
how
much
the
fruit
of
the
different
kinds
of
gooseberries
differ
in
size
*punct* ,
colour
*punct* ,
shape
*punct* ,
and
hairiness
*punct* ,
and
yet
the
flowers
present
very
slight
differences
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
that
the
varieties
which
differ
largely
in
some
one
point
do
not
differ
at
all
in
other
points
*punct* ;
this
is
hardly
ever
*punct* ,
perhaps
never
*punct* ,
the
case
*punct* .
*break*
the
laws
of
correlation
of
growth
*punct* ,
the
importance
of
which
should
never
be
overlooked
*punct* ,
will
ensure
some
differences
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
a
general
rule
*punct* ,
i
cannot
doubt
that
the
continued
selection
of
slight
variations
*punct* ,
either
in
the
leaves
*punct* ,
the
flowers
*punct* ,
or
the
fruit
*punct* ,
will
produce
races
differing
from
each
other
chiefly
in
these
characters
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
be
objected
that
the
principle
of
selection
has
been
reduced
to
methodical
practice
for
scarcely
more
than
three-quarters
of
a
century
*punct* ;
it
has
certainly
been
more
attended
to
of
late
years
*punct* ,
and
many
treatises
have
been
published
on
the
subject
*punct* ;
and
the
result
*punct* ,
i
may
add
*punct* ,
has
been
*punct* ,
in
a
corresponding
degree
*punct* ,
rapid
and
important
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
very
far
from
true
that
the
principle
is
a
modern
discovery
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
give
several
references
to
the
full
acknowledgment
of
the
importance
of
the
principle
in
works
of
high
antiquity
*punct* .
*break*
in
rude
and
barbarous
periods
of
english
history
choice
animals
were
often
imported
*punct* ,
and
laws
were
passed
to
prevent
their
exportation
*punct* :
the
destruction
of
horses
under
a
certain
size
was
ordered
*punct* ,
and
this
may
be
compared
to
the
roguing
of
plants
by
nurserymen
*punct* .
*break*
the
principle
of
selection
i
find
distinctly
given
in
an
ancient
chinese
encyclopaedia
*punct* .
*break*
explicit
rules
are
laid
down
by
some
of
the
roman
classical
writers
*punct* .
*break*
from
passages
in
genesis
*punct* ,
it
is
clear
that
the
colour
of
domestic
animals
was
at
that
early
period
attended
to
*punct* .
*break*
savages
now
sometimes
cross
their
dogs
with
wild
canine
animals
*punct* ,
to
improve
the
breed
*punct* ,
and
they
formerly
did
so
*punct* ,
as
is
attested
by
passages
in
pliny
*punct* .
*break*
the
savages
in
south
africa
match
their
draught
cattle
by
colour
*punct* ,
as
do
some
of
the
esquimaux
their
teams
of
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
livingstone
shows
how
much
good
domestic
breeds
are
valued
by
the
negroes
of
the
interior
of
africa
who
have
not
associated
with
europeans
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
these
facts
do
not
show
actual
selection
*punct* ,
but
they
show
that
the
breeding
of
domestic
animals
was
carefully
attended
to
in
ancient
times
*punct* ,
and
is
now
attended
to
by
the
lowest
savages
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
have
been
a
strange
fact
*punct* ,
had
attention
not
been
paid
to
breeding
*punct* ,
for
the
inheritance
of
good
and
bad
qualities
is
so
obvious
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
present
time
*punct* ,
eminent
breeders
try
by
methodical
selection
*punct* ,
with
a
distinct
object
in
view
*punct* ,
to
make
a
new
strain
or
sub-breed
*punct* ,
superior
to
anything
existing
in
the
country
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
for
our
purpose
*punct* ,
a
kind
of
selection
*punct* ,
which
may
be
called
unconscious
*punct* ,
and
which
results
from
every
one
trying
to
possess
and
breed
from
the
best
individual
animals
*punct* ,
is
more
important
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
a
man
who
intends
keeping
pointers
naturally
tries
to
get
as
good
dogs
as
he
can
*punct* ,
and
afterwards
breeds
from
his
own
best
dogs
*punct* ,
but
he
has
no
wish
or
expectation
of
permanently
altering
the
breed
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
i
cannot
doubt
that
this
process
*punct* ,
continued
during
centuries
*punct* ,
would
improve
and
modify
any
breed
*punct* ,
in
the
same
way
as
bakewell
*punct* ,
collins
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
by
this
very
same
process
*punct* ,
only
carried
on
more
methodically
*punct* ,
did
greatly
modify
*punct* ,
even
during
their
own
lifetimes
*punct* ,
the
forms
and
qualities
of
their
cattle
*punct* .
*break*
slow
and
insensible
changes
of
this
kind
could
never
be
recognised
unless
actual
measurements
or
careful
drawings
of
the
breeds
in
question
had
been
made
long
ago
*punct* ,
which
might
serve
for
comparison
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
cases
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
unchanged
or
but
little
changed
individuals
of
the
same
breed
may
be
found
in
less
civilised
districts
*punct* ,
where
the
breed
has
been
less
improved
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
king
charles's
spaniel
has
been
unconsciously
modified
to
a
large
extent
since
the
time
of
that
monarch
*punct* .
*break*
some
highly
competent
authorities
are
convinced
that
the
setter
is
directly
derived
from
the
spaniel
*punct* ,
and
has
probably
been
slowly
altered
from
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
known
that
the
english
pointer
has
been
greatly
changed
within
the
last
century
*punct* ,
and
in
this
case
the
change
has
*punct* ,
it
is
believed
*punct* ,
been
chiefly
effected
by
crosses
with
the
fox-hound
*punct* ;
but
what
concerns
us
is
*punct* ,
that
the
change
has
been
effected
unconsciously
and
gradually
*punct* ,
and
yet
so
effectually
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
though
the
old
spanish
pointer
certainly
came
from
spain
*punct* ,
mr.
borrow
has
not
seen
*punct* ,
as
i
am
informed
by
him
*punct* ,
any
native
dog
in
spain
like
our
pointer
*punct* .
*break*
by
a
similar
process
of
selection
*punct* ,
and
by
careful
training
*punct* ,
the
whole
body
of
english
racehorses
have
come
to
surpass
in
fleetness
and
size
the
parent
arab
stock
*punct* ,
so
that
the
latter
*punct* ,
by
the
regulations
for
the
goodwood
races
*punct* ,
are
favoured
in
the
weights
they
carry
*punct* .
*break*
lord
spencer
and
others
have
shown
how
the
cattle
of
england
have
increased
in
weight
and
in
early
maturity
*punct* ,
compared
with
the
stock
formerly
kept
in
this
country
*punct* .
*break*
by
comparing
the
accounts
given
in
old
pigeon
treatises
of
carriers
and
tumblers
with
these
breeds
as
now
existing
in
britain
*punct* ,
india
*punct* ,
and
persia
*punct* ,
we
can
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
clearly
trace
the
stages
through
which
they
have
insensibly
passed
*punct* ,
and
come
to
differ
so
greatly
from
the
rock-pigeon
*punct* .
*break*
youatt
gives
an
excellent
illustration
of
the
effects
of
a
course
of
selection
*punct* ,
which
may
be
considered
as
unconsciously
followed
*punct* ,
in
so
far
that
the
breeders
could
never
have
expected
or
even
have
wished
to
have
produced
the
result
which
ensued
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
the
production
of
two
distinct
strains
*punct* .
*break*
the
two
flocks
of
leicester
sheep
kept
by
mr.
buckley
and
mr.
burgess
*punct* ,
as
mr.
youatt
remarks
*punct* ,
have
been
purely
bred
from
the
original
stock
of
mr.
bakewell
for
upwards
of
fifty
years
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
not
a
suspicion
existing
in
the
mind
of
any
one
at
all
acquainted
with
the
subject
that
the
owner
of
either
of
them
has
deviated
in
any
one
instance
from
the
pure
blood
of
mr.
bakewell's
flock
*punct* ,
and
yet
the
difference
between
the
sheep
possessed
by
these
two
gentlemen
is
so
great
that
they
have
the
appearance
of
being
quite
different
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
if
there
exist
savages
so
barbarous
as
never
to
think
of
the
inherited
character
of
the
offspring
of
their
domestic
animals
*punct* ,
yet
any
one
animal
particularly
useful
to
them
*punct* ,
for
any
special
purpose
*punct* ,
would
be
carefully
preserved
during
famines
and
other
accidents
*punct* ,
to
which
savages
are
so
liable
*punct* ,
and
such
choice
animals
would
thus
generally
leave
more
offspring
than
the
inferior
ones
*punct* ;
so
that
in
this
case
there
would
be
a
kind
of
unconscious
selection
going
on
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
the
value
set
on
animals
even
by
the
barbarians
of
tierra
del
fuego
*punct* ,
by
their
killing
and
devouring
their
old
women
*punct* ,
in
times
of
dearth
*punct* ,
as
of
less
value
than
their
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
in
plants
the
same
gradual
process
of
improvement
*punct* ,
through
the
occasional
preservation
of
the
best
individuals
*punct* ,
whether
or
not
sufficiently
distinct
to
be
ranked
at
their
first
appearance
as
distinct
varieties
*punct* ,
and
whether
or
not
two
or
more
species
or
races
have
become
blended
together
by
crossing
*punct* ,
may
plainly
be
recognised
in
the
increased
size
and
beauty
which
we
now
see
in
the
varieties
of
the
heartsease
*punct* ,
rose
*punct* ,
pelargonium
*punct* ,
dahlia
*punct* ,
and
other
plants
*punct* ,
when
compared
with
the
older
varieties
or
with
their
parent-stocks
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
would
ever
expect
to
get
a
first-rate
heartsease
or
dahlia
from
the
seed
of
a
wild
plant
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
would
expect
to
raise
a
first-rate
melting
pear
from
the
seed
of
a
wild
pear
*punct* ,
though
he
might
succeed
from
a
poor
seedling
growing
wild
*punct* ,
if
it
had
come
from
a
garden-stock
*punct* .
*break*
the
pear
*punct* ,
though
cultivated
in
classical
times
*punct* ,
appears
*punct* ,
from
pliny's
description
*punct* ,
to
have
been
a
fruit
of
very
inferior
quality
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
seen
great
surprise
expressed
in
horticultural
works
at
the
wonderful
skill
of
gardeners
*punct* ,
in
having
produced
such
splendid
results
from
such
poor
materials
*punct* ;
but
the
art
*punct* ,
i
cannot
doubt
*punct* ,
has
been
simple
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
far
as
the
final
result
is
concerned
*punct* ,
has
been
followed
almost
unconsciously
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
consisted
in
always
cultivating
the
best
known
variety
*punct* ,
sowing
its
seeds
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
when
a
slightly
better
variety
has
chanced
to
appear
*punct* ,
selecting
it
*punct* ,
and
so
onwards
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
gardeners
of
the
classical
period
*punct* ,
who
cultivated
the
best
pear
they
could
procure
*punct* ,
never
thought
what
splendid
fruit
we
should
eat
*punct* ;
though
we
owe
our
excellent
fruit
*punct* ,
in
some
small
degree
*punct* ,
to
their
having
naturally
chosen
and
preserved
the
best
varieties
they
could
anywhere
find
*punct* .
*break*
a
large
amount
of
change
in
our
cultivated
plants
*punct* ,
thus
slowly
and
unconsciously
accumulated
*punct* ,
explains
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
the
well-known
fact
*punct* ,
that
in
a
vast
number
of
cases
we
cannot
recognise
*punct* ,
and
therefore
do
not
know
*punct* ,
the
wild
parent-stocks
of
the
plants
which
have
been
longest
cultivated
in
our
flower
and
kitchen
gardens
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
has
taken
centuries
or
thousands
of
years
to
improve
or
modify
most
of
our
plants
up
to
their
present
standard
of
usefulness
to
man
*punct* ,
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
neither
australia
*punct* ,
the
cape
of
good
hope
*punct* ,
nor
any
other
region
inhabited
by
quite
uncivilised
man
*punct* ,
has
afforded
us
a
single
plant
worth
culture
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
that
these
countries
*punct* ,
so
rich
in
species
*punct* ,
do
not
by
a
strange
chance
possess
the
aboriginal
stocks
of
any
useful
plants
*punct* ,
but
that
the
native
plants
have
not
been
improved
by
continued
selection
up
to
a
standard
of
perfection
comparable
with
that
given
to
the
plants
in
countries
anciently
civilised
*punct* .
*break*
in
regard
to
the
domestic
animals
kept
by
uncivilised
man
*punct* ,
it
should
not
be
overlooked
that
they
almost
always
have
to
struggle
for
their
own
food
*punct* ,
at
least
during
certain
seasons
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
two
countries
very
differently
circumstanced
*punct* ,
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
having
slightly
different
constitutions
or
structure
*punct* ,
would
often
succeed
better
in
the
one
country
than
in
the
other
*punct* ,
and
thus
by
a
process
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
as
will
hereafter
be
more
fully
explained
*punct* ,
two
sub-breeds
might
be
formed
*punct* .
*break*
this
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
partly
explains
what
has
been
remarked
by
some
authors
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
the
varieties
kept
by
savages
have
more
of
the
character
of
species
than
the
varieties
kept
in
civilised
countries
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
view
here
given
of
the
all-important
part
which
selection
by
man
has
played
*punct* ,
it
becomes
at
once
obvious
*punct* ,
how
it
is
that
our
domestic
races
show
adaptation
in
their
structure
or
in
their
habits
to
man's
wants
or
fancies
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
further
understand
the
frequently
abnormal
character
of
our
domestic
races
*punct* ,
and
likewise
their
differences
being
so
great
in
external
characters
and
relatively
so
slight
in
internal
parts
or
organs
*punct* .
*break*
man
can
hardly
select
*punct* ,
or
only
with
much
difficulty
*punct* ,
any
deviation
of
structure
excepting
such
as
is
externally
visible
*punct* ;
and
indeed
he
rarely
cares
for
what
is
internal
*punct* .
*break*
he
can
never
act
by
selection
*punct* ,
excepting
on
variations
which
are
first
given
to
him
in
some
slight
degree
by
nature
*punct* .
*break*
no
man
would
ever
try
to
make
a
fantail
*punct* ,
till
he
saw
a
pigeon
with
a
tail
developed
in
some
slight
degree
in
an
unusual
manner
*punct* ,
or
a
pouter
till
he
saw
a
pigeon
with
a
crop
of
somewhat
unusual
size
*punct* ;
and
the
more
abnormal
or
unusual
any
character
was
when
it
first
appeared
*punct* ,
the
more
likely
it
would
be
to
catch
his
attention
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
use
such
an
expression
as
trying
to
make
a
fantail
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
i
have
no
doubt
*punct* ,
in
most
cases
*punct* ,
utterly
incorrect
*punct* .
*break*
the
man
who
first
selected
a
pigeon
with
a
slightly
larger
tail
*punct* ,
never
dreamed
what
the
descendants
of
that
pigeon
would
become
through
long-continued
*punct* ,
partly
unconscious
and
partly
methodical
selection
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
the
parent
bird
of
all
fantails
had
only
fourteen
tail-feathers
somewhat
expanded
*punct* ,
like
the
present
java
fantail
*punct* ,
or
like
individuals
of
other
and
distinct
breeds
*punct* ,
in
which
as
many
as
seventeen
tail-feathers
have
been
counted
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
the
first
pouter-pigeon
did
not
inflate
its
crop
much
more
than
the
turbit
now
does
the
upper
part
of
its
oesophagus,
*punct* ,
a
habit
which
is
disregarded
by
all
fanciers
*punct* ,
as
it
is
not
one
of
the
points
of
the
breed
*punct* .
*break*
nor
let
it
be
thought
that
some
great
deviation
of
structure
would
be
necessary
to
catch
the
fancier's
eye
*punct* :
he
perceives
extremely
small
differences
*punct* ,
and
it
is
in
human
nature
to
value
any
novelty
*punct* ,
however
slight
*punct* ,
in
one's
own
possession
*punct* .
*break*
nor
must
the
value
which
would
formerly
be
set
on
any
slight
differences
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
be
judged
of
by
the
value
which
would
now
be
set
on
them
*punct* ,
after
several
breeds
have
once
fairly
been
established
*punct* .
*break*
many
slight
differences
might
*punct* ,
and
indeed
do
now
*punct* ,
arise
amongst
pigeons
*punct* ,
which
are
rejected
as
faults
or
deviations
from
the
standard
of
perfection
of
each
breed
*punct* .
*break*
the
common
goose
has
not
given
rise
to
any
marked
varieties
*punct* ;
hence
the
thoulouse
and
the
common
breed
*punct* ,
which
differ
only
in
colour
*punct* ,
that
most
fleeting
of
characters
*punct* ,
have
lately
been
exhibited
as
distinct
at
our
poultry-shows
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
these
views
further
explain
what
has
sometimes
been
noticed
*punct* ,
namely
that
we
know
nothing
about
the
origin
or
history
of
any
of
our
domestic
breeds
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
a
breed
*punct* ,
like
a
dialect
of
a
language
*punct* ,
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
had
a
definite
origin
*punct* .
*break*
a
man
preserves
and
breeds
from
an
individual
with
some
slight
deviation
of
structure
*punct* ,
or
takes
more
care
than
usual
in
matching
his
best
animals
and
thus
improves
them
*punct* ,
and
the
improved
individuals
slowly
spread
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
yet
they
will
hardly
have
a
distinct
name
*punct* ,
and
from
being
only
slightly
valued
*punct* ,
their
history
will
be
disregarded
*punct* .
*break*
when
further
improved
by
the
same
slow
and
gradual
process
*punct* ,
they
will
spread
more
widely
*punct* ,
and
will
get
recognised
as
something
distinct
and
valuable
*punct* ,
and
will
then
probably
first
receive
a
provincial
name
*punct* .
*break*
in
semi-civilised
countries
*punct* ,
with
little
free
communication
*punct* ,
the
spreading
and
knowledge
of
any
new
sub-breed
will
be
a
slow
process
*punct* .
*break*
as
soon
as
the
points
of
value
of
the
new
sub-breed
are
once
fully
acknowledged
*punct* ,
the
principle
*punct* ,
as
i
have
called
it
*punct* ,
of
unconscious
selection
will
always
tend,
*punct* ,
perhaps
more
at
one
period
than
at
another
*punct* ,
as
the
breed
rises
or
falls
in
fashion,
*punct* ,
perhaps
more
in
one
district
than
in
another
*punct* ,
according
to
the
state
of
civilisation
of
the
inhabitants
*punct* ,
slowly
to
add
to
the
characteristic
features
of
the
breed
*punct* ,
whatever
they
may
be
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
chance
will
be
infinitely
small
of
any
record
having
been
preserved
of
such
slow
*punct* ,
varying
*punct* ,
and
insensible
changes
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
now
say
a
few
words
on
the
circumstances
*punct* ,
favourable
*punct* ,
or
the
reverse
*punct* ,
to
man's
power
of
selection
*punct* .
*break*
a
high
degree
of
variability
is
obviously
favourable
*punct* ,
as
freely
giving
the
materials
for
selection
to
work
on
*punct* ;
not
that
mere
individual
differences
are
not
amply
sufficient
*punct* ,
with
extreme
care
*punct* ,
to
allow
of
the
accumulation
of
a
large
amount
of
modification
in
almost
any
desired
direction
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
variations
manifestly
useful
or
pleasing
to
man
appear
only
occasionally
*punct* ,
the
chance
of
their
appearance
will
be
much
increased
by
a
large
number
of
individuals
being
kept
*punct* ;
and
hence
this
comes
to
be
of
the
highest
importance
to
success
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
principle
marshall
has
remarked
*punct* ,
with
respect
to
the
sheep
of
parts
of
yorkshire
*punct* ,
that
as
they
generally
belong
to
poor
people
*punct* ,
and
are
mostly
in
small
lots
*punct* ,
they
never
can
be
improved
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
nurserymen
*punct* ,
from
raising
large
stocks
of
the
same
plants
*punct* ,
are
generally
far
more
successful
than
amateurs
in
getting
new
and
valuable
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
the
keeping
of
a
large
number
of
individuals
of
a
species
in
any
country
requires
that
the
species
should
be
placed
under
favourable
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
so
as
to
breed
freely
in
that
country
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
individuals
of
any
species
are
scanty
*punct* ,
all
the
individuals
*punct* ,
whatever
their
quality
may
be
*punct* ,
will
generally
be
allowed
to
breed
*punct* ,
and
this
will
effectually
prevent
selection
*punct* .
*break*
but
probably
the
most
important
point
of
all
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
that
the
animal
or
plant
should
be
so
highly
useful
to
man
*punct* ,
or
so
much
valued
by
him
*punct* ,
that
the
closest
attention
should
be
paid
to
even
the
slightest
deviation
in
the
qualities
or
structure
of
each
individual
*punct* .
*break*
unless
such
attention
be
paid
nothing
can
be
effected
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
seen
it
gravely
remarked
*punct* ,
that
it
was
most
fortunate
that
the
strawberry
began
to
vary
just
when
gardeners
began
to
attend
closely
to
this
plant
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
the
strawberry
had
always
varied
since
it
was
cultivated
*punct* ,
but
the
slight
varieties
had
been
neglected
*punct* .
*break*
as
soon
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
as
gardeners
picked
out
individual
plants
with
slightly
larger
*punct* ,
earlier
*punct* ,
or
better
fruit
*punct* ,
and
raised
seedlings
from
them
*punct* ,
and
again
picked
out
the
best
seedlings
and
bred
from
them
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
there
appeared
*punct* ,
aided
by
some
crossing
with
distinct
species
*punct* ,
those
many
admirable
varieties
of
the
strawberry
which
have
been
raised
during
the
last
thirty
or
forty
years
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
case
of
animals
with
separate
sexes
*punct* ,
facility
in
preventing
crosses
is
an
important
element
of
success
in
the
formation
of
new
races,
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
in
a
country
which
is
already
stocked
with
other
races
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
respect
enclosure
of
the
land
plays
a
part
*punct* .
*break*
wandering
savages
or
the
inhabitants
of
open
plains
rarely
possess
more
than
one
breed
of
the
same
species
*punct* .
*break*
pigeons
can
be
mated
for
life
*punct* ,
and
this
is
a
great
convenience
to
the
fancier
*punct* ,
for
thus
many
races
may
be
kept
true
*punct* ,
though
mingled
in
the
same
aviary
*punct* ;
and
this
circumstance
must
have
largely
favoured
the
improvement
and
formation
of
new
breeds
*punct* .
*break*
pigeons
*punct* ,
i
may
add
*punct* ,
can
be
propagated
in
great
numbers
and
at
a
very
quick
rate
*punct* ,
and
inferior
birds
may
be
freely
rejected
*punct* ,
as
when
killed
they
serve
for
food
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
cats
*punct* ,
from
their
nocturnal
rambling
habits
*punct* ,
cannot
be
matched
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
although
so
much
valued
by
women
and
children
*punct* ,
we
hardly
ever
see
a
distinct
breed
kept
up
*punct* ;
such
breeds
as
we
do
sometimes
see
are
almost
always
imported
from
some
other
country
*punct* ,
often
from
islands
*punct* .
*break*
although
i
do
not
doubt
that
some
domestic
animals
vary
less
than
others
*punct* ,
yet
the
rarity
or
absence
of
distinct
breeds
of
the
cat
*punct* ,
the
donkey
*punct* ,
peacock
*punct* ,
goose
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
may
be
attributed
in
main
part
to
selection
not
having
been
brought
into
play
*punct* :
in
cats
*punct* ,
from
the
difficulty
in
pairing
them
*punct* ;
in
donkeys
*punct* ,
from
only
a
few
being
kept
by
poor
people
*punct* ,
and
little
attention
paid
to
their
breeding
*punct* ;
in
peacocks
*punct* ,
from
not
being
very
easily
reared
and
a
large
stock
not
kept
*punct* ;
in
geese
*punct* ,
from
being
valuable
only
for
two
purposes
*punct* ,
food
and
feathers
*punct* ,
and
more
especially
from
no
pleasure
having
been
felt
in
the
display
of
distinct
breeds
*punct* .
*break*
to
sum
up
on
the
origin
of
our
domestic
races
of
animals
and
plants
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
that
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
from
their
action
on
the
reproductive
system
*punct* ,
are
so
far
of
the
highest
importance
as
causing
variability
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
believe
that
variability
is
an
inherent
and
necessary
contingency
*punct* ,
under
all
circumstances
*punct* ,
with
all
organic
beings
*punct* ,
as
some
authors
have
thought
*punct* .
*break*
the
effects
of
variability
are
modified
by
various
degrees
of
inheritance
and
of
reversion
*punct* .
*break*
variability
is
governed
by
many
unknown
laws
*punct* ,
more
especially
by
that
of
correlation
of
growth
*punct* .
*break*
something
may
be
attributed
to
the
direct
action
of
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
something
must
be
attributed
to
use
and
disuse
*punct* .
*break*
the
final
result
is
thus
rendered
infinitely
complex
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
cases
*punct* ,
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
intercrossing
of
species
*punct* ,
aboriginally
distinct
*punct* ,
has
played
an
important
part
in
the
origin
of
our
domestic
productions
*punct* .
*break*
when
in
any
country
several
domestic
breeds
have
once
been
established
*punct* ,
their
occasional
intercrossing
*punct* ,
with
the
aid
of
selection
*punct* ,
has
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* ,
largely
aided
in
the
formation
of
new
sub-breeds
*punct* ;
but
the
importance
of
the
crossing
of
varieties
has
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
been
greatly
exaggerated
*punct* ,
both
in
regard
to
animals
and
to
those
plants
which
are
propagated
by
seed
*punct* .
*break*
in
plants
which
are
temporarily
propagated
by
cuttings
*punct* ,
buds
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
the
importance
of
the
crossing
both
of
distinct
species
and
of
varieties
is
immense
*punct* ;
for
the
cultivator
here
quite
disregards
the
extreme
variability
both
of
hybrids
and
mongrels
*punct* ,
and
the
frequent
sterility
of
hybrids
*punct* ;
but
the
cases
of
plants
not
propagated
by
seed
are
of
little
importance
to
us
*punct* ,
for
their
endurance
is
only
temporary
*punct* .
*break*
over
all
these
causes
of
change
i
am
convinced
that
the
accumulative
action
of
selection
*punct* ,
whether
applied
methodically
and
more
quickly
*punct* ,
or
unconsciously
and
more
slowly
*punct* ,
but
more
efficiently
*punct* ,
is
by
far
the
predominant
power
*punct* .
*break*
before
applying
the
principles
arrived
at
in
the
last
chapter
to
organic
beings
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
we
must
briefly
discuss
whether
these
latter
are
subject
to
any
variation
*punct* .
*break*
to
treat
this
subject
at
all
properly
*punct* ,
a
long
catalogue
of
dry
facts
should
be
given
*punct* ;
but
these
i
shall
reserve
for
my
future
work
*punct* .
*break*
nor
shall
i
here
discuss
the
various
definitions
which
have
been
given
of
the
term
species
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
definition
has
as
yet
satisfied
all
naturalists
*punct* ;
yet
every
naturalist
knows
vaguely
what
he
means
when
he
speaks
of
a
species
*punct* .
*break*
generally
the
term
includes
the
unknown
element
of
a
distinct
act
of
creation
*punct* .
*break*
the
term
variety
is
almost
equally
difficult
to
define
*punct* ;
but
here
community
of
descent
is
almost
universally
implied
*punct* ,
though
it
can
rarely
be
proved
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
also
what
are
called
monstrosities
*punct* ;
but
they
graduate
into
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
by
a
monstrosity
i
presume
is
meant
some
considerable
deviation
of
structure
in
one
part
*punct* ,
either
injurious
to
or
not
useful
to
the
species
*punct* ,
and
not
generally
propagated
*punct* .
*break*
some
authors
use
the
term
variation
in
a
technical
sense
*punct* ,
as
implying
a
modification
directly
due
to
the
physical
conditions
of
life
*punct* ;
and
variations
in
this
sense
are
supposed
not
to
be
inherited
*punct* :
but
who
can
say
that
the
dwarfed
condition
of
shells
in
the
brackish
waters
of
the
baltic
*punct* ,
or
dwarfed
plants
on
alpine
summits
*punct* ,
or
the
thicker
fur
of
an
animal
from
far
northwards
*punct* ,
would
not
in
some
cases
be
inherited
for
at
least
some
few
generations
*punct* ?
*break*
and
in
this
case
i
presume
that
the
form
would
be
called
a
variety
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
we
have
many
slight
differences
which
may
be
called
individual
differences
*punct* ,
such
as
are
known
frequently
to
appear
in
the
offspring
from
the
same
parents
*punct* ,
or
which
may
be
presumed
to
have
thus
arisen
*punct* ,
from
being
frequently
observed
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
inhabiting
the
same
confined
locality
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
supposes
that
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
are
cast
in
the
very
same
mould
*punct* .
*break*
these
individual
differences
are
highly
important
for
us
*punct* ,
as
they
afford
materials
for
natural
selection
to
accumulate
*punct* ,
in
the
same
manner
as
man
can
accumulate
in
any
given
direction
individual
differences
in
his
domesticated
productions
*punct* .
*break*
these
individual
differences
generally
affect
what
naturalists
consider
unimportant
parts
*punct* ;
but
i
could
show
by
a
long
catalogue
of
facts
*punct* ,
that
parts
which
must
be
called
important
*punct* ,
whether
viewed
under
a
physiological
or
classificatory
point
of
view
*punct* ,
sometimes
vary
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
convinced
that
the
most
experienced
naturalist
would
be
surprised
at
the
number
of
the
cases
of
variability
*punct* ,
even
in
important
parts
of
structure
*punct* ,
which
he
could
collect
on
good
authority
*punct* ,
as
i
have
collected
*punct* ,
during
a
course
of
years
*punct* .
*break*
it
should
be
remembered
that
systematists
are
far
from
pleased
at
finding
variability
in
important
characters
*punct* ,
and
that
there
are
not
many
men
who
will
laboriously
examine
internal
and
important
organs
*punct* ,
and
compare
them
in
many
specimens
of
the
same
species
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
never
have
expected
that
the
branching
of
the
main
nerves
close
to
the
great
central
ganglion
of
an
insect
would
have
been
variable
in
the
same
species
*punct* ;
i
should
have
expected
that
changes
of
this
nature
could
have
been
effected
only
by
slow
degrees
*punct* :
yet
quite
recently
mr.
lubbock
has
shown
a
degree
of
variability
in
these
main
nerves
in
coccus
*punct* ,
which
may
almost
be
compared
to
the
irregular
branching
of
the
stem
of
a
tree
*punct* .
*break*
this
philosophical
naturalist
*punct* ,
i
may
add
*punct* ,
has
also
quite
recently
shown
that
the
muscles
in
the
larvae
of
certain
insects
are
very
far
from
uniform
*punct* .
*break*
authors
sometimes
argue
in
a
circle
when
they
state
that
important
organs
never
vary
*punct* ;
for
these
same
authors
practically
rank
that
character
as
important
*punct* ,
as
some
few
naturalists
have
honestly
confessed
*punct* ,
which
does
not
vary
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
under
this
point
of
view
*punct* ,
no
instance
of
any
important
part
varying
will
ever
be
found
*punct* :
but
under
any
other
point
of
view
many
instances
assuredly
can
be
given
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
one
point
connected
with
individual
differences
*punct* ,
which
seems
to
me
extremely
perplexing
*punct* :
i
refer
to
those
genera
which
have
sometimes
been
called
protean
or
polymorphic
*punct* ,
in
which
the
species
present
an
inordinate
amount
of
variation
*punct* ;
and
hardly
two
naturalists
can
agree
which
forms
to
rank
as
species
and
which
as
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
instance
rubus
*punct* ,
rosa
*punct* ,
and
hieracium
amongst
plants
*punct* ,
several
genera
of
insects
*punct* ,
and
several
genera
of
brachiopod
shells
*punct* .
*break*
in
most
polymorphic
genera
some
of
the
species
have
fixed
and
definite
characters
*punct* .
*break*
genera
which
are
polymorphic
in
one
country
seem
to
be
*punct* ,
with
some
few
exceptions
*punct* ,
polymorphic
in
other
countries
*punct* ,
and
likewise
*punct* ,
judging
from
brachiopod
shells
*punct* ,
at
former
periods
of
time
*punct* .
*break*
these
facts
seem
to
be
very
perplexing
*punct* ,
for
they
seem
to
show
that
this
kind
of
variability
is
independent
of
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
inclined
to
suspect
that
we
see
in
these
polymorphic
genera
variations
in
points
of
structure
which
are
of
no
service
or
disservice
to
the
species
*punct* ,
and
which
consequently
have
not
been
seized
on
and
rendered
definite
by
natural
selection
*punct* ,
as
hereafter
will
be
explained
*punct* .
*break*
those
forms
which
possess
in
some
considerable
degree
the
character
of
species
*punct* ,
but
which
are
so
closely
similar
to
some
other
forms
*punct* ,
or
are
so
closely
linked
to
them
by
intermediate
gradations
*punct* ,
that
naturalists
do
not
like
to
rank
them
as
distinct
species
*punct* ,
are
in
several
respects
the
most
important
for
us
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
many
of
these
doubtful
and
closely-allied
forms
have
permanently
retained
their
characters
in
their
own
country
for
a
long
time
*punct* ;
for
as
long
*punct* ,
as
far
as
we
know
*punct* ,
as
have
good
and
true
species
*punct* .
*break*
practically
*punct* ,
when
a
naturalist
can
unite
two
forms
together
by
others
having
intermediate
characters
*punct* ,
he
treats
the
one
as
a
variety
of
the
other
*punct* ,
ranking
the
most
common
*punct* ,
but
sometimes

one
first
described
*punct* ,

the
species
*punct* ,

the
other

*punct* .
*break*
but
cases
of
great
difficulty
*punct* ,
which
i
will
not
here
enumerate
*punct* ,
sometimes
occur
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
rank
one
form
as
a
variety
of
another
*punct* ,
even
when
they
are
closely
connected
by
intermediate
links
*punct* ;
nor
will
the
commonly-assumed
hybrid
nature
of
the
intermediate
links
always
remove
the
difficulty
*punct* .
*break*
in
very
many
cases
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
one
form
is
ranked
as
a
variety
of
another
*punct* ,
not
because
the
intermediate
links
have
actually
been
found
*punct* ,
but
because
analogy
leads
the
observer
to
suppose
either
that
they
do
now
somewhere
exist
*punct* ,
or
may
formerly
have
existed
*punct* ;
and
here
a
wide
door
for
the
entry
of
doubt
and
conjecture
is
opened
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
in
determining
whether
a
form
should
be
ranked
as
a
species
or
a
variety
*punct* ,
the
opinion
of
naturalists
having
sound
judgment
and
wide
experience
seems
the
only
guide
to
follow
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
in
many
cases
*punct* ,
decide
by
a
majority
of
naturalists
*punct* ,
for
few
well-marked
and
well-known
varieties
can
be
named
which
have
not
been
ranked
as
species
by
at
least
some
competent
judges
*punct* .
*break*
that
varieties
of
this
doubtful
nature
are
far
from
uncommon
cannot
be
disputed
*punct* .
*break*
compare
the
several
floras
of
great
britain
*punct* ,
of
france
or
of
the
united
states
*punct* ,
drawn
up
by
different
botanists
*punct* ,
and
see
what
a
surprising
number
of
forms
have
been
ranked
by
one
botanist
as
good
species
*punct* ,
and
by
another
as
mere
varieties

watson
*punct* ,

i
lie
under
deep
obligation

assistance

all
kinds

me
182
british
plants
*punct* ,
which
are
generally
considered
as
varieties
*punct* ,
but
which
have
all
been
ranked
by
botanists
as
species
*punct* ;
and
in
making
this
list
he
has
omitted
many
trifling
varieties
*punct* ,
but
which
nevertheless
have
been
ranked
by
some
botanists
as
species
*punct* ,
and
he
has
entirely
omitted
several
highly
polymorphic
genera
*punct* .
*break*
under
genera
*punct* ,
including
the
most
polymorphic
forms
*punct* ,
mr.
babington
gives
251
species
*punct* ,
whereas
mr.
bentham
gives
only
112,

139
doubtful
forms
*punct* !

animals
which

doubtful

one
zoologist
as
a
species

by
another
as
a
variety

can
rarely
be
found
within
the
same
country
*punct* ,
but
are
common
in
separated
areas

*break*
how
many
of
those
birds
and
insects
in
north
america
and
europe
*punct* ,
which
differ
very
slightly
from
each
other
*punct* ,
have
been
ranked
by
one
eminent
naturalist
as
undoubted
species
*punct* ,
and
by
another
as
varieties
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
as
they
are
often
called
*punct* ,
as
geographical
races
*punct* !
*break*
many
years
ago
*punct* ,
when
comparing
*punct* ,
and
seeing
others
compare
*punct* ,
the
birds
from
the
separate
islands
of
the
galapagos
archipelago
*punct* ,
both
one
with
another
*punct* ,
and
with
those
from
the
american
mainland
*punct* ,
i
was
much
struck
how
entirely
vague
and
arbitrary
is
the
distinction
between
species
and
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
islets
of
the
little
madeira
group
there
are
many
insects
which
are
characterized
as
varieties
in
mr.
wollaston's
admirable
work
*punct* ,
but
which
it
cannot
be
doubted
would
be
ranked
as
distinct
species
by
many
entomologists
*punct* .
*break*
even
ireland
has
a
few
animals
*punct* ,
now
generally
regarded
as
varieties
*punct* ,
but
which
have
been
ranked
as
species
by
some
zoologists
*punct* .
*break*
several
most
experienced
ornithologists
consider
our
british
red
grouse
as
only
a
strongly-marked
race
of
a
norwegian
species
*punct* ,
whereas
the
greater
number
rank
it
as
an
undoubted
species
peculiar
to
great
britain
*punct* .
*break*
a
wide
distance
between
the
homes
of
two
doubtful
forms
leads
many
naturalists
to
rank
both
as
distinct
species
*punct* ;
but
what
distance
*punct* ,
it
has
been
well
asked
*punct* ,
will
suffice
*punct* ?
*break*
if
that
between
america
and
europe
is
ample
*punct* ,
will
that
between
the
continent
and
the
azores
*punct* ,
or
madeira
*punct* ,
or
the
canaries
*punct* ,
or
ireland
*punct* ,
be
sufficient
*punct* ?
*break*
it
must
be
admitted
that
many
forms
*punct* ,
considered
by
highly-competent
judges
as
varieties
*punct* ,
have
so
perfectly
the
character
of
species
that
they
are
ranked
by
other
highly-competent
judges
as
good
and
true
species
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
discuss
whether
they
are
rightly
called
species
or
varieties
*punct* ,
before
any
definition
of
these
terms
has
been
generally
accepted
*punct* ,
is
vainly
to
beat
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
many
of
the
cases
of
strongly-marked
varieties
or
doubtful
species
well
deserve
consideration
*punct* ;
for
several
interesting
lines
of
argument
*punct* ,
from
geographical
distribution
*punct* ,
analogical
variation
*punct* ,
hybridism
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
have
been
brought
to
bear
on
the
attempt
to
determine
their
rank
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
here
give
only
a
single
instance,
*punct* ,
the
well-known
one
of
the
primrose
and
cowslip
*punct* ,
or
primula
veris
and
elatior
*punct* .
*break*
these
plants
differ
considerably
in
appearance
*punct* ;
they
have
a
different
flavour
and
emit
a
different
odour
*punct* ;
they
flower
at
slightly
different
periods
*punct* ;
they
grow
in
somewhat
different
stations
*punct* ;
they
ascend
mountains
to
different
heights
*punct* ;
they
have
different
geographical
ranges
*punct* ;
and
lastly
*punct* ,
according
to
very
numerous
experiments
made
during
several
years
by
that
most
careful
observer
gartner
*punct* ,
they
can
be
crossed
only
with
much
difficulty
*punct* .
*break*
we
could
hardly
wish
for
better
evidence
of
the
two
forms
being
specifically
distinct
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
they
are
united
by
many
intermediate
links
*punct* ,
and
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
these
links
are
hybrids
*punct* ;
and
there
is
*punct* ,
as
it
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
an
overwhelming
amount
of
experimental
evidence
*punct* ,
showing
that
they
descend
from
common
parents
*punct* ,
and
consequently
must
be
ranked
as
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
close
investigation
*punct* ,
in
most
cases
*punct* ,
will
bring
naturalists
to
an
agreement
how
to
rank
doubtful
forms
*punct* .
*break*
yet
it
must
be
confessed
*punct* ,
that
it
is
in
the
best-known
countries
that
we
find
the
greatest
number
of
forms
of
doubtful
value
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
been
struck
with
the
fact
*punct* ,
that
if
any
animal
or
plant
in
a
state
of
nature
be
highly
useful
to
man
*punct* ,
or
from
any
cause
closely
attract
his
attention
*punct* ,
varieties
of
it
will
almost
universally
be
found
recorded
*punct* .
*break*
these
varieties
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
will
be
often
ranked
by
some
authors
as
species
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
the
common
oak
*punct* ,
how
closely
it
has
been
studied
*punct* ;
yet
a
german
author
makes
more
than
a
dozen
species
out
of
forms
*punct* ,
which
are
very
generally
considered
as
varieties
*punct* ;
and
in
this
country
the
highest
botanical
authorities
and
practical
men
can
be
quoted
to
show
that
the
sessile
and
pedunculated
oaks
are
either
good
and
distinct
species
or
mere
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
when
a
young
naturalist
commences
the
study
of
a
group
of
organisms
quite
unknown
to
him
*punct* ,
he
is
at
first
much
perplexed
to
determine
what
differences
to
consider
as
specific
*punct* ,
and
what
as
varieties
*punct* ;
for
he
knows
nothing
of
the
amount
and
kind
of
variation
to
which
the
group
is
subject
*punct* ;
and
this
shows
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
how
very
generally
there
is
some
variation
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
he
confine
his
attention
to
one
class
within
one
country
*punct* ,
he
will
soon
make
up
his
mind
how
to
rank
most
of
the
doubtful
forms
*punct* .
*break*
his
general
tendency
will
be
to
make
many
species
*punct* ,
for
he
will
become
impressed
*punct* ,
just
like
the
pigeon
or
poultry-fancier
before
alluded
to
*punct* ,
with
the
amount
of
difference
in
the
forms
which
he
is
continually
studying
*punct* ;
and
he
has
little
general
knowledge
of
analogical
variation
in
other
groups
and
in
other
countries
*punct* ,
by
which
to
correct
his
first
impressions
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
extends
the
range
of
his
observations
*punct* ,
he
will
meet
with
more
cases
of
difficulty
*punct* ;
for
he
will
encounter
a
greater
number
of
closely-allied
forms
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
his
observations
be
widely
extended
*punct* ,
he
will
in
the
end
generally
be
enabled
to
make
up
his
own
mind
which
to
call
varieties
and
which
species
*punct* ;
but
he
will
succeed
in
this
at
the
expense
of
admitting
much
variation,
*punct* ,
and
the
truth
of
this
admission
will
often
be
disputed
by
other
naturalists
*punct* .
*break*
when
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
he
comes
to
study
allied
forms
brought
from
countries
not
now
continuous
*punct* ,
in
which
case
he
can
hardly
hope
to
find
the
intermediate
links
between
his
doubtful
forms
*punct* ,
he
will
have
to
trust
almost
entirely
to
analogy
*punct* ,
and
his
difficulties
will
rise
to
a
climax
*punct* .
*break*
certainly
no
clear
line
of
demarcation
has
as
yet
been
drawn
between
species
and
sub-species
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
the
forms
which
in
the
opinion
of
some
naturalists
come
very
near
to
*punct* ,
but
do
not
quite
arrive
at
the
rank
of
species
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
between
sub-species
and
well-marked
varieties
*punct* ,
or
between
lesser
varieties
and
individual
differences
*punct* .
*break*
these
differences
blend
into
each
other
in
an
insensible
series
*punct* ;
and
a
series
impresses
the
mind
with
the
idea
of
an
actual
passage
*punct* .
*break*
hence
i
look
at
individual
differences
*punct* ,
though
of
small
interest
to
the
systematist
*punct* ,
as
of
high
importance
for
us
*punct* ,
as
being
the
first
step
towards
such
slight
varieties
as
are
barely
thought
worth
recording
in
works
on
natural
history
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
look
at
varieties
which
are
in
any
degree
more
distinct
and
permanent
*punct* ,
as
steps
leading
to
more
strongly
marked
and
more
permanent
varieties
*punct* ;
and
at
these
latter
*punct* ,
as
leading
to
sub-species
*punct* ,
and
to
species
*punct* .
*break*
the
passage
from
one
stage
of
difference
to
another
and
higher
stage
may
be
*punct* ,
in
some
cases
*punct* ,
due
merely
to
the
long-continued
action
of
different
physical
conditions
in
two
different
regions
*punct* ;
but
i
have
not
much
faith
in
this
view
*punct* ;
and
i
attribute
the
passage
of
a
variety
*punct* ,
from
a
state
in
which
it
differs
very
slightly
from
its
parent
to
one
in
which
it
differs
more
*punct* ,
to
the
action
of
natural
selection
in
accumulating
*punct* ,
as
will
hereafter
be
more
fully
explained
*punct* ,
differences
of
structure
in
certain
definite
directions
*punct* .
*break*
hence
i
believe
a
well-marked
variety
may
be
justly
called
an
incipient
species
*punct* ;
but
whether
this
belief
be
justifiable
must
be
judged
of
by
the
general
weight
of
the
several
facts
and
views
given
throughout
this
work
*punct* .
*break*
it
need
not
be
supposed
that
all
varieties
or
incipient
species
necessarily
attain
the
rank
of
species
*punct* .
*break*
they
may
whilst
in
this
incipient
state
become
extinct
*punct* ,
or
they
may
endure
as
varieties
for
very
long
periods
*punct* ,
as
has
been
shown
to
be
the
case
by
mr.
wollaston
with
the
varieties
of
certain
fossil
land-shells
in
madeira
*punct* .
*break*
if
a
variety
were
to
flourish
so
as
to
exceed
in
numbers
the
parent
species
*punct* ,
it
would
then
rank
as
the
species
*punct* ,
and
the
species
as
the
variety
*punct* ;
or
it
might
come
to
supplant
and
exterminate
the
parent
species
*punct* ;
or
both
might
co-exist
*punct* ,
and
both
rank
as
independent
species
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
shall
hereafter
have
to
return
to
this
subject
*punct* .
*break*
from
these
remarks
it
will
be
seen
that
i
look
at
the
term
species
*punct* ,
as
one
arbitrarily
given
for
the
sake
of
convenience
to
a
set
of
individuals
closely
resembling
each
other
*punct* ,
and
that
it
does
not
essentially
differ
from
the
term
variety
*punct* ,
which
is
given
to
less
distinct
and
more
fluctuating
forms
*punct* .
*break*
the
term
variety
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
in
comparison
with
mere
individual
differences
*punct* ,
is
also
applied
arbitrarily
*punct* ,
and
for
mere
convenience
sake
*punct* .
*break*
guided
by
theoretical
considerations
*punct* ,
i
thought
that
some
interesting
results
might
be
obtained
in
regard
to
the
nature
and
relations
of
the
species
which
vary
most
*punct* ,
by
tabulating
all
the
varieties
in
several
well-worked
floras
*punct* .
*break*
watson
*punct* ,
to
whom
i
am
much
indebted
for
valuable
advice
and
assistance
on
this
subject
*punct* ,
soon
convinced
me
that
there
were
many
difficulties
*punct* ,
as
did
subsequently
dr.
hooker
*punct* ,
even
in
stronger
terms
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
reserve
for
my
future
work
the
discussion
of
these
difficulties
*punct* ,
and
the
tables
themselves
of
the
proportional
numbers
of
the
varying
species
*punct* .
*break*
dr.
hooker
permits
me
to
add
*punct* ,
that
after
having
carefully
read
my
manuscript
*punct* ,
and
examined
the
tables
*punct* ,
he
thinks
that
the
following
statements
are
fairly
well
established
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
subject
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
treated
as
it
necessarily
here
is
with
much
brevity
*punct* ,
is
rather
perplexing
*punct* ,
and
allusions
cannot
be
avoided
to
the
struggle
for
existence
*punct* ,
divergence
of
character
*punct* ,
and
other
questions
*punct* ,
hereafter
to
be
discussed
*punct* .
*break*
de
candolle
and
others
have
shown
that
plants
which
have
very
wide
ranges
generally
present
varieties
*punct* ;
and
this
might
have
been
expected
*punct* ,
as
they
become
exposed
to
diverse
physical
conditions
*punct* ,
and
as
they
come
into
competition
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
*punct* ,
is
a
far
more
important
circumstance
*punct* ,
with
different
sets
of
organic
beings
*punct* .
*break*
but
my
tables
further
show
that
*punct* ,
in
any
limited
country
*punct* ,
the
species
which
are
most
common
*punct* ,
that
is
abound
most
in
individuals
*punct* ,
and
the
species
which
are
most
widely
diffused
within
their
own
country
*punct* ,
and
this
is
a
different
consideration
from
wide
range
*punct* ,
and
to
a
certain
extent
from
commonness
*punct* ,
often
give
rise
to
varieties
sufficiently
well-marked
to
have
been
recorded
in
botanical
works
*punct* .
*break*
hence
it
is
the
most
flourishing
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
as
they
may
be
called
*punct* ,
the
dominant
species,
*punct* ,
those
which
range
widely
over
the
world
*punct* ,
are
the
most
diffused
in
their
own
country
*punct* ,
and
are
the
most
numerous
in
individuals,
*punct* ,
which
oftenest
produce
well-marked
varieties
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
as
i
consider
them
*punct* ,
incipient
species
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
might
have
been
anticipated
*punct* ;
for

as
varieties
*punct* ,
in
order
to
become
in
any
degree
permanent
*punct* ,
necessarily
have
to
struggle
with
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
country
*punct* ,
the
species
which
are
already
dominant
will
be
the
most
likely
to
yield
offspring
which
*punct* ,
though
in
some
slight
degree
modified
*punct* ,
will
still
inherit
those
advantages
that
enabled
their
parents
to
become
dominant
over
their
compatriots
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
plants
inhabiting
a
country
and
described
in
any
flora
be
divided
into
two
equal
masses
*punct* ,
all
those
in
the
larger
genera
being
placed
on
one
side
*punct* ,
and
all
those
in
the
smaller
genera
on
the
other
side
*punct* ,
a
somewhat
larger
number
of
the
very
common
and
much
diffused
or
dominant
species
will
be
found
on
the
side
of
the
larger
genera
*punct* .
*break*
this
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
might
have
been
anticipated
*punct* ;
for
the
mere
fact
of
many
species
of
the
same
genus
inhabiting
any
country
*punct* ,
shows
that
there
is
something
in
the
organic
or
inorganic
conditions
of
that
country
favourable
to
the
genus
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
consequently
*punct* ,
we
might
have
expected
to
have
found
in
the
larger
genera
*punct* ,
or
those
including
many
species
*punct* ,
a
large
proportional
number
of
dominant
species
*punct* .
*break*
but
so
many
causes
tend
to
obscure
this
result
*punct* ,
that
i
am
surprised
that
my
tables
show
even
a
small
majority
on
the
side
of
the
larger
genera
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
here
allude
to
only
two
causes
of
obscurity
*punct* .
*break*
fresh-water
and
salt-loving
plants
have
generally
very
wide
ranges
and
are
much
diffused
*punct* ,
but
this
seems
to
be
connected
with
the
nature
of
the
stations
inhabited
by
them
*punct* ,
and
has
little
or
no
relation
to
the
size
of
the
genera
to
which
the
species
belong
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
plants
low
in
the
scale
of
organisation
are
generally
much
more
widely
diffused
than
plants
higher
in
the
scale
*punct* ;
and
here
again
there
is
no
close
relation
to
the
size
of
the
genera
*punct* .
*break*
the
cause
of
lowly-organised
plants
ranging
widely
will
be
discussed
in
our
chapter
on
geographical
distribution
*punct* .
*break*
from
looking
at
species
as
only
strongly-marked
and
well-defined
varieties
*punct* ,
i
was
led
to
anticipate
that
the
species
of
the
larger
genera
in
each
country
would
oftener
present
varieties
*punct* ,
than
the
species
of
the
smaller
genera
*punct* ;
for
wherever
many
closely
related
species
*punct* ,
i.e
*punct* .
*break*
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
have
been
formed
*punct* ,
many
varieties
or
incipient
species
ought
*punct* ,
as
a
general
rule
*punct* ,
to
be
now
forming
*punct* .
*break*
where
many
large
trees
grow
*punct* ,
we
expect
to
find
saplings
*punct* .
*break*
where
many
species
of
a
genus
have
been
formed
through
variation
*punct* ,
circumstances
have
been
favourable
for
variation
*punct* ;
and
hence
we
might
expect
that
the
circumstances
would
generally
be
still
favourable
to
variation
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
if
we
look
at
each
species
as
a
special
act
of
creation
*punct* ,
there
is
no
apparent
reason
why
more
varieties
should
occur
in
a
group
having
many
species
*punct* ,
than
in
one
having
few
*punct* .
*break*
to
test
the
truth
of
this
anticipation
i
have
arranged
the
plants
of
twelve
countries
*punct* ,
and
the
coleopterous
insects
of
two
districts
*punct* ,
into
two
nearly
equal
masses
*punct* ,
the
species
of
the
larger
genera
on
one
side
*punct* ,
and
those
of
the
smaller
genera
on
the
other
side
*punct* ,
and
it
has
invariably
proved
to
be
the
case
that
a
larger
proportion
of
the
species
on
the
side
of
the
larger
genera
present
varieties
*punct* ,
than
on
the
side
of
the
smaller
genera
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
the
species
of
the
large
genera
which
present
any
varieties
*punct* ,
invariably
present
a
larger
average
number
of
varieties
than
do
the
species
of
the
small
genera
*punct* .
*break*
both
these
results
follow
when
another
division
is
made
*punct* ,
and
when
all
the
smallest
genera
*punct* ,
with
from
only
one
to
four
species
*punct* ,
are
absolutely
excluded
from
the
tables
*punct* .
*break*
these
facts
are
of
plain
signification
on
the
view
that
species
are
only
strongly
marked
and
permanent
varieties
*punct* ;
for
whenever
many
species
of
the
same
genus
have
been
formed
*punct* ,
or
where
*punct* ,
if
we
may
use
the
expression
*punct* ,
the
manufactory
of
species
has
been
active
*punct* ,
we
ought
generally
to
find
the
manufactory
still
in
action
*punct* ,
more
especially
as
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
the
process
of
manufacturing
new
species
to
be
a
slow
one
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
certainly
is
the
case
*punct* ,
if
varieties
be
looked
at
as
incipient
species
*punct* ;
for
my
tables
clearly
show
as
a
general
rule
that
*punct* ,
wherever
many
species
of
a
genus
have
been
formed
*punct* ,
the
species
of
that
genus
present
a
number
of
varieties
*punct* ,
that
is
of
incipient
species
*punct* ,
beyond
the
average
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
that
all
large
genera
are
now
varying
much
*punct* ,
and
are
thus
increasing
in
the
number
of
their
species
*punct* ,
or
that
no
small
genera
are
now
varying
and
increasing
*punct* ;
for
if
this
had
been
so
*punct* ,
it
would
have
been
fatal
to
my
theory
*punct* ;
inasmuch
as
geology
plainly
tells
us
that
small
genera
have
in
the
lapse
of
time
often
increased
greatly
in
size
*punct* ;
and
that
large
genera
have
often
come
to
their
maxima
*punct* ,
declined
*punct* ,
and
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
all
that
we
want
to
show
is
*punct* ,
that
where
many
species
of
a
genus
have
been
formed
*punct* ,
on
an
average
many
are
still
forming
*punct* ;
and
this
holds
good
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
other
relations
between
the
species
of
large
genera
and
their
recorded
varieties
which
deserve
notice
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
seen
that
there
is
no
infallible
criterion
by
which
to
distinguish
species
and
well-marked
varieties
*punct* ;
and
in
those
cases
in
which
intermediate
links
have
not
been
found
between
doubtful
forms
*punct* ,
naturalists
are
compelled
to
come
to
a
determination
by
the
amount
of
difference
between
them
*punct* ,
judging
by
analogy
whether
or
not
the
amount
suffices
to
raise
one
or
both
to
the
rank
of
species
*punct* .
*break*
hence
the
amount
of
difference
is
one
very
important
criterion
in
settling
whether
two
forms
should
be
ranked
as
species
or
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
now
fries
has
remarked
in
regard
to
plants
*punct* ,
and
westwood
in
regard
to
insects
*punct* ,
that
in
large
genera
the
amount
of
difference
between
the
species
is
often
exceedingly
small
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
endeavoured
to
test
this
numerically
by
averages
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
far
as
my
imperfect
results
go
*punct* ,
they
always
confirm
the
view
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
also
consulted
some
sagacious
and
most
experienced
observers
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
after
deliberation
*punct* ,
they
concur
in
this
view
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
respect
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
the
species
of
the
larger
genera
resemble
varieties
*punct* ,
more
than
do
the
species
of
the
smaller
genera
*punct* .
*break*
or
the
case
may
be
put
in
another
way
*punct* ,
and
it
may
be
said
*punct* ,
that
in
the
larger
genera
*punct* ,
in
which
a
number
of
varieties
or
incipient
species
greater
than
the
average
are
now
manufacturing
*punct* ,
many
of
the
species
already
manufactured
still
to
a
certain
extent
resemble
varieties
*punct* ,
for
they
differ
from
each
other
by
a
less
than
usual
amount
of
difference
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
the
species
of
the
large
genera
are
related
to
each
other
*punct* ,
in
the
same
manner
as
the
varieties
of
any
one
species
are
related
to
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
no
naturalist
pretends
that
all
the
species
of
a
genus
are
equally
distinct
from
each
other
*punct* ;
they
may
generally
be
divided
into
sub-genera
*punct* ,
or
sections
*punct* ,
or
lesser
groups
*punct* .
*break*
as
fries
has
well
remarked
*punct* ,
little
groups
of
species
are
generally
clustered
like
satellites
around
certain
other
species
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
are
varieties
but
groups
of
forms
*punct* ,
unequally
related
to
each
other
*punct* ,
and
clustered
round
certain
forms
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
round
their
parent-species
*punct* ?
*break*
undoubtedly
there
is
one
most
important
point
of
difference
between
varieties
and
species
*punct* ;
namely
*punct* ,
that
the
amount
of
difference
between
varieties
*punct* ,
when
compared
with
each
other
or
with
their
parent-species
*punct* ,
is
much
less
than
that
between
the
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
we
come
to
discuss
the
principle
*punct* ,
as
i
call
it
*punct* ,
of
divergence
of
character
*punct* ,
we
shall
see
how
this
may
be
explained
*punct* ,
and
how
the
lesser
differences
between
varieties
will
tend
to
increase
into
the
greater
differences
between
species
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
one
other
point
which
seems
to
me
worth
notice
*punct* .
*break*
varieties
generally
have
much
restricted
ranges
*punct* :
this
statement
is
indeed
scarcely
more
than
a
truism
*punct* ,
for
if
a
variety
were
found
to
have
a
wider
range
than
that
of
its
supposed
parent-species
*punct* ,
their
denominations
ought
to
be
reversed
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
is
also
reason
to
believe
*punct* ,
that
those
species
which
are
very
closely
allied
to
other
species
*punct* ,
and
in
so
far
resemble
varieties
*punct* ,
often
have
much
restricted
ranges
*punct* .
*break*
watson
has
marked
for
me
in
the
well-sifted
london
catalogue
of
plants
*punct* ,
4th
edition
*punct* ,
63
plants
which
are
therein
ranked
as
species
*punct* ,
but
which
he
considers
as
so
closely
allied
to
other
species
as
to
be
of
doubtful
value
*punct* :
these
63
reputed
species
range
on
an
average
over
6.9
of
the
provinces
into
which
mr.
watson
has
divided
great
britain
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
this
same
catalogue
*punct* ,
53
acknowledged
varieties
are
recorded
*punct* ,
and
these
range
over
7.7
provinces
*punct* ;
whereas
*punct* ,
the
species
to
which
these
varieties
belong
range
over
14.3
provinces
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
the
acknowledged
varieties
have
very
nearly
the
same
restricted
average
range
*punct* ,
as
have
those
very
closely
allied
forms
*punct* ,
marked
for
me
by
mr.
watson
as
doubtful
species
*punct* ,
but
which
are
almost
universally
ranked
by
british
botanists
as
good
and
true
species
*punct* .
*break*
finally
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
varieties
have
the
same
general
characters
as
species
*punct* ,
for
they
cannot
be
distinguished
from
species,
*punct* ,
except
*punct* ,
firstly
*punct* ,
by
the
discovery
of
intermediate
linking
forms
*punct* ,
and
the
occurrence
of
such
links
cannot
affect
the
actual
characters
of
the
forms
which
they
connect
*punct* ;
and
except
*punct* ,
secondly
*punct* ,
by
a
certain
amount
of
difference
*punct* ,
for
two
forms
*punct* ,
if
differing
very
little
*punct* ,
are
generally
ranked
as
varieties
*punct* ,
notwithstanding
that
intermediate
linking
forms
have
not
been
discovered
*punct* ;
but
the
amount
of
difference
considered
necessary
to
give
to
two
forms
the
rank
of
species
is
quite
indefinite
*punct* .
*break*
in
genera
having
more
than
the
average
number
of
species
in
any
country
*punct* ,
the
species
of
these
genera
have
more
than
the
average
number
of
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
in
large
genera
the
species
are
apt
to
be
closely
*punct* ,
but
unequally
*punct* ,
allied
together
*punct* ,
forming
little
clusters
round
certain
species
*punct* .
*break*
species
very
closely
allied
to
other
species
apparently
have
restricted
ranges
*punct* .
*break*
in
all
these
several
respects
the
species
of
large
genera
present
a
strong
analogy
with
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
and
we
can
clearly
understand
these
analogies
*punct* ,
if
species
have
once
existed
as
varieties
*punct* ,
and
have
thus
originated
*punct* :
whereas
*punct* ,
these
analogies
are
utterly
inexplicable
if
each
species
has
been
independently
created
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
seen
that
it
is
the
most
flourishing
and
dominant
species
of
the
larger
genera
which
on
an
average
vary
most
*punct* ;
and
varieties
*punct* ,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
*punct* ,
tend
to
become
converted
into
new
and
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
the
larger
genera
thus
tend
to
become
larger
*punct* ;
and
throughout
nature
the
forms
of
life
which
are
now
dominant
tend
to
become
still
more
dominant
by
leaving
many
modified
and
dominant
descendants
*punct* .
*break*
but
by
steps
hereafter
to
be
explained
*punct* ,
the
larger
genera
also
tend
to
break
up
into
smaller
genera
*punct* .
*break*
and
thus
*punct* ,
the
forms
of
life
throughout
the
universe
become
divided
into
groups
subordinate
to
groups
*punct* .
*break*
before
entering
on
the
subject
of
this
chapter
*punct* ,
i
must
make
a
few
preliminary
remarks
*punct* ,
to
show
how
the
struggle
for
existence
bears
on
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
been
seen
in
the
last
chapter
that
amongst
organic
beings
in
a
state
of
nature
there
is
some
individual
variability
*punct* ;
indeed
i
am
not
aware
that
this
has
ever
been
disputed
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
immaterial
for
us
whether
a
multitude
of
doubtful
forms
be
called
species
or
sub-species
or
varieties
*punct* ;
what
rank
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
two
or
three
hundred
doubtful
forms
of
british
plants
are
entitled
to
hold
*punct* ,
if
the
existence
of
any
well-marked
varieties
be
admitted
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
mere
existence
of
individual
variability
and
of
some
few
well-marked
varieties
*punct* ,
though
necessary
as
the
foundation
for
the
work
*punct* ,
helps
us
but
little
in
understanding
how
species
arise
in
nature
*punct* .
*break*
how
have
all
those
exquisite
adaptations
of
one
part
of
the
organisation
to
another
part
*punct* ,
and
to
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
and
of
one
distinct
organic
being
to
another
being
*punct* ,
been
perfected
*punct* ?
*break*
we
see
these
beautiful
co-adaptations
most
plainly
in
the
woodpecker
and
missletoe
*punct* ;
and
only
a
little
less
plainly
in
the
humblest
parasite
which
clings
to
the
hairs
of
a
quadruped
or
feathers
of
a
bird
*punct* ;
in
the
structure
of
the
beetle
which
dives
through
the
water
*punct* ;
in
the
plumed
seed
which
is
wafted
by
the
gentlest
breeze
*punct* ;
in
short
*punct* ,
we
see
beautiful
adaptations
everywhere
and
in
every
part
of
the
organic
world
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
it
may
be
asked
*punct* ,
how
is
it
that
varieties
*punct* ,
which
i
have
called
incipient
species
*punct* ,
become
ultimately
converted
into
good
and
distinct
species
*punct* ,
which
in
most
cases
obviously
differ
from
each
other
far
more
than
do
the
varieties
of
the
same
species
*punct* ?
*break*
how
do
those
groups
of
species
*punct* ,
which
constitute
what
are
called
distinct
genera
*punct* ,
and
which
differ
from
each
other
more
than
do
the
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
arise
*punct* ?
*break*
all
these
results
*punct* ,
as
we
shall
more
fully
see
in
the
next
chapter
*punct* ,
follow
inevitably
from
the
struggle
for
life
*punct* .
*break*
owing
to
this
struggle
for
life
*punct* ,
any
variation
*punct* ,
however
slight
and
from
whatever
cause
proceeding
*punct* ,
if
it
be
in
any
degree
profitable
to
an
individual
of
any
species
*punct* ,
in
its
infinitely
complex
relations
to
other
organic
beings
and
to
external
nature
*punct* ,
will
tend
to
the
preservation
of
that
individual
*punct* ,
and
will
generally
be
inherited
by
its
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
the
offspring
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
will
thus
have
a
better
chance
of
surviving
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
of
the
many
individuals
of
any
species
which
are
periodically
born
*punct* ,
but
a
small
number
can
survive
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
called
this
principle
*punct* ,
by
which
each
slight
variation
*punct* ,
if
useful
*punct* ,
is
preserved
*punct* ,
by
the
term
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
in
order
to
mark
its
relation
to
man's
power
of
selection
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
seen
that
man
by
selection
can
certainly
produce
great
results
*punct* ,
and
can
adapt
organic
beings
to
his
own
uses
*punct* ,
through
the
accumulation
of
slight
but
useful
variations
*punct* ,
given
to
him
by
the
hand
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
but
natural
selection
*punct* ,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
*punct* ,
is
a
power
incessantly
ready
for
action
*punct* ,
and
is
as
immeasurably
superior
to
man's
feeble
efforts
*punct* ,
as
the
works
of
nature
are
to
those
of
art
*punct* .
*break*
we
will
now
discuss
in
a
little
more
detail
the
struggle
for
existence
*punct* .
*break*
in
my
future
work
this
subject
shall
be
treated
*punct* ,
as
it
well
deserves
*punct* ,
at
much
greater
length
*punct* .
*break*
the
elder
de
candolle
and
lyell
have
largely
and
philosophically
shown
that
all
organic
beings
are
exposed
to
severe
competition
*punct* .
*break*
herbert
*punct* ,
dean
of
manchester
*punct* ,
evidently
the
result
of
his
great
horticultural
knowledge
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
is
easier
than
to
admit
in
words
the
truth
of
the
universal
struggle
for
life
*punct* ,
or
more
difficult
*punct* ,
at
least
i
have
found
it
so
*punct* ,
than
constantly
to
bear
this
conclusion
in
mind
*punct* .
*break*
yet
unless
it
be
thoroughly
engrained
in
the
mind
*punct* ,
i
am
convinced
that
the
whole
economy
of
nature
*punct* ,
with
every
fact
on
distribution
*punct* ,
rarity
*punct* ,
abundance
*punct* ,
extinction
*punct* ,
and
variation
*punct* ,
will
be
dimly
seen
or
quite
misunderstood
*punct* .
*break*
we
behold
the
face
of
nature
bright
with
gladness
*punct* ,
we
often
see
superabundance
of
food
*punct* ;
we
do
not
see
*punct* ,
or
we
forget
*punct* ,
that
the
birds
which
are
idly
singing
round
us
mostly
live
on
insects
or
seeds
*punct* ,
and
are
thus
constantly
destroying
life
*punct* ;
or
we
forget
how
largely
these
songsters
*punct* ,
or
their
eggs
*punct* ,
or
their
nestlings
*punct* ,
are
destroyed
by
birds
and
beasts
of
prey
*punct* ;
we
do
not
always
bear
in
mind
*punct* ,
that
though
food
may
be
now
superabundant
*punct* ,
it
is
not
so
at
all
seasons
of
each
recurring
year
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
premise
that
i
use
the
term
struggle
for
existence
in
a
large
and
metaphorical
sense
*punct* ,
including
dependence
of
one
being
on
another
*punct* ,
and
including
*punct* ,
which
is
more
important
*punct* ,
not
only
the
life
of
the
individual
*punct* ,
but
success
in
leaving
progeny
*punct* .
*break*
two
canine
animals
in
a
time
of
dearth
*punct* ,
may
be
truly
said
to
struggle
with
each
other
which
shall
get
food
and
live
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
plant
on
the
edge
of
a
desert
is
said
to
struggle
for
life
against
the
drought
*punct* ,
though
more
properly
it
should
be
said
to
be
dependent
on
the
moisture
*punct* .
*break*
a
plant
which
annually
produces
a
thousand
seeds
*punct* ,
of
which
on
an
average
only
one
comes
to
maturity
*punct* ,
may
be
more
truly
said
to
struggle
with
the
plants
of
the
same
and
other
kinds
which
already
clothe
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
the
missletoe
is
dependent
on
the
apple
and
a
few
other
trees
*punct* ,
but
can
only
in
a
far-fetched
sense
be
said
to
struggle
with
these
trees
*punct* ,
for
if
too
many
of
these
parasites
grow
on
the
same
tree
*punct* ,
it
will
languish
and
die
*punct* .
*break*
but
several
seedling
missletoes
*punct* ,
growing
close
together
on
the
same
branch
*punct* ,
may
more
truly
be
said
to
struggle
with
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
missletoe
is
disseminated
by
birds
*punct* ,
its
existence
depends
on
birds
*punct* ;
and
it
may
metaphorically
be
said
to
struggle
with
other
fruit-bearing
plants
*punct* ,
in
order
to
tempt
birds
to
devour
and
thus
disseminate
its
seeds
rather
than
those
of
other
plants
*punct* .
*break*
in
these
several
senses
*punct* ,
which
pass
into
each
other
*punct* ,
i
use
for
convenience
sake
the
general
term
of
struggle
for
existence
*punct* .
*break*
a
struggle
for
existence
inevitably
follows
from
the
high
rate
at
which
all
organic
beings
tend
to
increase
*punct* .
*break*
every
being
*punct* ,
which
during
its
natural
lifetime
produces
several
eggs
or
seeds
*punct* ,
must
suffer
destruction
during
some
period
of
its
life
*punct* ,
and
during
some
season
or
occasional
year
*punct* ,
otherwise
*punct* ,
on
the
principle
of
geometrical
increase
*punct* ,
its
numbers
would
quickly
become
so
inordinately
great
that
no
country
could
support
the
product
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
as
more
individuals
are
produced
than
can
possibly
survive
*punct* ,
there
must
in
every
case
be
a
struggle
for
existence
*punct* ,
either
one
individual
with
another
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
or
with
the
individuals
of
distinct
species
*punct* ,
or
with
the
physical
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
the
doctrine
of
malthus
applied
with
manifold
force
to
the
whole
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
*punct* ;
for
in
this
case
there
can
be
no
artificial
increase
of
food
*punct* ,
and
no
prudential
restraint
from
marriage
*punct* .
*break*
although
some
species
may
be
now
increasing
*punct* ,
more
or
less
rapidly
*punct* ,
in
numbers
*punct* ,
all
cannot
do
so
*punct* ,
for
the
world
would
not
hold
them
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
that
every
organic
being
naturally
increases
at
so
high
a
rate
*punct* ,
that
if
not
destroyed
*punct* ,
the
earth
would
soon
be
covered
by
the
progeny
of
a
single
pair
*punct* .
*break*
even
slow-breeding
man
has
doubled
in
twenty-five
years
*punct* ,
and
at
this
rate
*punct* ,
in
a
few
thousand
years
*punct* ,
there
would
literally
not
be
standing
room
for
his
progeny
*punct* .
*break*
linnaeus
has
calculated
that
if
an
annual
plant
produced
only
two
seeds
*punct* ,
and
there
is
no
plant
so
unproductive
as
this
*punct* ,
and
their
seedlings
next
year
produced
two
*punct* ,
and
so
on
*punct* ,
then
in
twenty
years
there
would
be
a
million
plants
*punct* .
*break*
the
elephant
is
reckoned
to
be
the
slowest
breeder
of
all
known
animals
*punct* ,
and
i
have
taken
some
pains
to
estimate
its
probable
minimum
rate
of
natural
increase
*punct* :
it
will
be
under
the
mark
to
assume
that
it
breeds
when
thirty
years
old
*punct* ,
and
goes
on
breeding
till
ninety
years
old
*punct* ,
bringing
forth
three
pair
of
young
in
this
interval
*punct* ;
if
this
be
so
*punct* ,
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
century
there
would
be
alive
fifteen
million
elephants
*punct* ,
descended
from
the
first
pair
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
have
better
evidence
on
this
subject
than
mere
theoretical
calculations
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
the
numerous
recorded
cases
of
the
astonishingly
rapid
increase
of
various
animals
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
when
circumstances
have
been
favourable
to
them
during
two
or
three
following
seasons
*punct* .
*break*
still
more
striking
is
the
evidence
from
our
domestic
animals
of
many
kinds
which
have
run
wild
in
several
parts
of
the
world
*punct* :
if
the
statements
of
the
rate
of
increase
of
slow-breeding
cattle
and
horses
in
south
america
*punct* ,
and
latterly
in
australia
*punct* ,
had
not
been
well
authenticated
*punct* ,
they
would
have
been
quite
incredible
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
is
with
plants
*punct* :
cases
could
be
given
of
introduced
plants
which
have
become
common
throughout
whole
islands
in
a
period
of
less
than
ten
years
*punct* .
*break*
several
of
the
plants
now
most
numerous
over
the
wide
plains
of
la
plata
*punct* ,
clothing
square
leagues
of
surface
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
plants
*punct* ,
have
been
introduced
from
europe
*punct* ;
and
there
are
plants
which
now
range
in
india
*punct* ,
as
i
hear
from
dr.
falconer
*punct* ,
from
cape
comorin
to
the
himalaya
*punct* ,
which
have
been
imported
from
america
since
its
discovery
*punct* .
*break*
in
such
cases
*punct* ,
and
endless
instances
could
be
given
*punct* ,
no
one
supposes
that
the
fertility
of
these
animals
or
plants
has
been
suddenly
and
temporarily
increased
in
any
sensible
degree
*punct* .
*break*
the
obvious
explanation
is
that
the
conditions
of
life
have
been
very
favourable
*punct* ,
and
that
there
has
consequently
been
less
destruction
of
the
old
and
young
*punct* ,
and
that
nearly
all
the
young
have
been
enabled
to
breed
*punct* .
*break*
in
such
cases
the
geometrical
ratio
of
increase
*punct* ,
the
result
of
which
never
fails
to
be
surprising
*punct* ,
simply
explains
the
extraordinarily
rapid
increase
and
wide
diffusion
of
naturalised
productions
in
their
new
homes
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
state
of
nature
almost
every
plant
produces
seed
*punct* ,
and
amongst
animals
there
are
very
few
which
do
not
annually
pair
*punct* .
*break*
hence
we
may
confidently
assert
*punct* ,
that
all
plants
and
animals
are
tending
to
increase
at
a
geometrical
ratio
*punct* ,
that
all
would
most
rapidly
stock
every
station
in
which
they
could
any
how
exist
*punct* ,
and
that
the
geometrical
tendency
to
increase
must
be
checked
by
destruction
at
some
period
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
our
familiarity
with
the
larger
domestic
animals
tends
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
to
mislead
us
*punct* :
we
see
no
great
destruction
falling
on
them
*punct* ,
and
we
forget
that
thousands
are
annually
slaughtered
for
food
*punct* ,
and
that
in
a
state
of
nature
an
equal
number
would
have
somehow
to
be
disposed
of
*punct* .
*break*
the
only
difference
between
organisms
which
annually
produce
eggs
or
seeds
by
the
thousand
*punct* ,
and
those
which
produce
extremely
few
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
that
the
slow-breeders
would
require
a
few
more
years
to
people
*punct* ,
under
favourable
conditions
*punct* ,
a
whole
district
*punct* ,
let
it
be
ever
so
large
*punct* .
*break*
the
condor
lays
a
couple
of
eggs
and
the
ostrich
a
score
*punct* ,
and
yet
in
the
same
country
the
condor
may
be
the
more
numerous
of
the
two
*punct* :
the
fulmar
petrel
lays
but
one
egg
*punct* ,
yet
it
is
believed
to
be
the
most
numerous
bird
in
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
one
fly
deposits
hundreds
of
eggs
*punct* ,
and
another
*punct* ,
like
the
hippobosca
*punct* ,
a
single
one
*punct* ;
but
this
difference
does
not
determine
how
many
individuals
of
the
two
species
can
be
supported
in
a
district
*punct* .
*break*
a
large
number
of
eggs
is
of
some
importance
to
those
species
*punct* ,
which
depend
on
a
rapidly
fluctuating
amount
of
food
*punct* ,
for
it
allows
them
rapidly
to
increase
in
number
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
real
importance
of
a
large
number
of
eggs
or
seeds
is
to
make
up
for
much
destruction
at
some
period
of
life
*punct* ;
and
this
period
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
is
an
early
one
*punct* .
*break*
if
an
animal
can
in
any
way
protect
its
own
eggs
or
young
*punct* ,
a
small
number
may
be
produced
*punct* ,
and
yet
the
average
stock
be
fully
kept
up
*punct* ;
but
if
many
eggs
or
young
are
destroyed
*punct* ,
many
must
be
produced
*punct* ,
or
the
species
will
become
extinct
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
suffice
to
keep
up
the
full
number
of
a
tree
*punct* ,
which
lived
on
an
average
for
a
thousand
years
*punct* ,
if
a
single
seed
were
produced
once
in
a
thousand
years
*punct* ,
supposing
that
this
seed
were
never
destroyed
*punct* ,
and
could
be
ensured
to
germinate
in
a
fitting
place
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
in
all
cases
*punct* ,
the
average
number
of
any
animal
or
plant
depends
only
indirectly
on
the
number
of
its
eggs
or
seeds
*punct* .
*break*
in
looking
at
nature
*punct* ,
it
is
most
necessary
to
keep
the
foregoing
considerations
always
in
mind
*punct* ,
never
to
forget
that
every
single
organic
being
around
us
may
be
said
to
be
striving
to
the
utmost
to
increase
in
numbers
*punct* ;
that
each
lives
by
a
struggle
at
some
period
of
its
life
*punct* ;
that
heavy
destruction
inevitably
falls
either
on
the
young
or
old
*punct* ,
during
each
generation
or
at
recurrent
intervals
*punct* .
*break*
lighten
any
check
*punct* ,
mitigate
the
destruction
ever
so
little
*punct* ,
and
the
number
of
the
species
will
almost
instantaneously
increase
to
any
amount
*punct* .
*break*
the
face
of
nature
may
be
compared
to
a
yielding
surface
*punct* ,
with
ten
thousand
sharp
wedges
packed
close
together
and
driven
inwards
by
incessant
blows
*punct* ,
sometimes
one
wedge
being
struck
*punct* ,
and
then
another
with
greater
force
*punct* .
*break*
what
checks
the
natural
tendency
of
each
species
to
increase
in
number
is
most
obscure
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
the
most
vigorous
species
*punct* ;
by
as
much
as
it
swarms
in
numbers
*punct* ,
by
so
much
will
its
tendency
to
increase
be
still
further
increased
*punct* .
*break*
we
know
not
exactly
what
the
checks
are
in
even
one
single
instance
*punct* .
*break*
nor
will
this
surprise
any
one
who
reflects
how
ignorant
we
are
on
this
head
*punct* ,
even
in
regard
to
mankind
*punct* ,
so
incomparably
better
known
than
any
other
animal
*punct* .
*break*
this
subject
has
been
ably
treated
by
several
authors
*punct* ,
and
i
shall
*punct* ,
in
my
future
work
*punct* ,
discuss
some
of
the
checks
at
considerable
length
*punct* ,
more
especially
in
regard
to
the
feral
animals
of
south
america
*punct* .
*break*
here
i
will
make
only
a
few
remarks
*punct* ,
just
to
recall
to
the
reader's
mind
some
of
the
chief
points
*punct* .
*break*
eggs
or
very
young
animals
seem
generally
to
suffer
most
*punct* ,
but
this
is
not
invariably
the
case
*punct* .
*break*
with
plants
there
is
a
vast
destruction
of
seeds
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
from
some
observations
which
i
have
made
*punct* ,
i
believe
that
it
is
the
seedlings
which
suffer
most
from
germinating
in
ground
already
thickly
stocked
with
other
plants
*punct* .
*break*
seedlings
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
are
destroyed
in
vast
numbers
by
various
enemies
*punct* ;
for
instance
*punct* ,
on
a
piece
of
ground
three
feet
long
and
two
wide
*punct* ,
dug
and
cleared
*punct* ,
and
where
there
could
be
no
choking
from
other
plants
*punct* ,
i
marked
all
the
seedlings
of
our
native
weeds
as
they
came
up
*punct* ,
and
out
of
the
357
no
less
than
295
were
destroyed
*punct* ,
chiefly
by
slugs
and
insects
*punct* .
*break*
if
turf
which
has
long
been
mown
*punct* ,
and
the
case
would
be
the
same
with
turf
closely
browsed
by
quadrupeds
*punct* ,
be
let
to
grow
*punct* ,
the
more
vigorous
plants
gradually
kill
the
less
vigorous
*punct* ,
though
fully
grown
*punct* ,
plants
*punct* :
thus
out
of
twenty
species
growing
on
a
little
plot
of
turf
*punct* ,
three
feet
by
four
*punct* ,
nine
species
perished
from
the
other
species
being
allowed
to
grow
up
freely
*punct* .
*break*
the
amount
of
food
for
each
species
of
course
gives
the
extreme
limit
to
which
each
can
increase
*punct* ;
but
very
frequently
it
is
not
the
obtaining
food
*punct* ,
but
the
serving
as
prey
to
other
animals
*punct* ,
which
determines
the
average
numbers
of
a
species
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
there
seems
to
be
little
doubt
that
the
stock
of
partridges
*punct* ,
grouse
*punct* ,
and
hares
on
any
large
estate
depends
chiefly
on
the
destruction
of
vermin
*punct* .
*break*
if
not
one
head
of
game
were
shot
during
the
next
twenty
years
in
england
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
at
the
same
time
*punct* ,
if
no
vermin
were
destroyed
*punct* ,
there
would
*punct* ,
in
all
probability
*punct* ,
be
less
game
than
at
present
*punct* ,
although
hundreds
of
thousands
of
game
animals
are
now
annually
killed
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
in
some
cases
*punct* ,
as
with
the
elephant
and
rhinoceros
*punct* ,
none
are
destroyed
by
beasts
of
prey
*punct* :
even
the
tiger
in
india
most
rarely
dares
to
attack
a
young
elephant
protected
by
its
dam
*punct* .
*break*
climate
plays
an
important
part
in
determining
the
average
numbers
of
a
species
*punct* ,
and
periodical
seasons
of
extreme
cold
or
drought
*punct* ,
i
believe
to
be
the
most
effective
of
all
checks
*punct* .
*break*
i
estimated
that
the
winter
of
1854-55
destroyed
four-fifths
of
the
birds
in
my
own
grounds
*punct* ;
and
this
is
a
tremendous
destruction
*punct* ,
when
we
remember
that
ten
per
cent
*punct* .
*break*
is
an
extraordinarily
severe
mortality
from
epidemics
with
man
*punct* .
*break*
the
action
of
climate
seems
at
first
sight
to
be
quite
independent
of
the
struggle
for
existence
*punct* ;
but
in
so
far
as
climate
chiefly
acts
in
reducing
food
*punct* ,
it
brings
on
the
most
severe
struggle
between
the
individuals
*punct* ,
whether
of
the
same
or
of
distinct
species
*punct* ,
which
subsist
on
the
same
kind
of
food
*punct* .
*break*
even
when
climate
*punct* ,
for
instance
extreme
cold
*punct* ,
acts
directly
*punct* ,
it
will
be
the
least
vigorous
*punct* ,
or
those
which
have
got
least
food
through
the
advancing
winter
*punct* ,
which
will
suffer
most
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
travel
from
south
to
north
*punct* ,
or
from
a
damp
region
to
a
dry
*punct* ,
we
invariably
see
some
species
gradually
getting
rarer
and
rarer
*punct* ,
and
finally
disappearing
*punct* ;
and
the
change
of
climate
being
conspicuous
*punct* ,
we
are
tempted
to
attribute
the
whole
effect
to
its
direct
action
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
is
a
very
false
view
*punct* :
we
forget
that
each
species
*punct* ,
even
where
it
most
abounds
*punct* ,
is
constantly
suffering
enormous
destruction
at
some
period
of
its
life
*punct* ,
from
enemies
or
from
competitors
for
the
same
place
and
food
*punct* ;
and
if
these
enemies
or
competitors
be
in
the
least
degree
favoured
by
any
slight
change
of
climate
*punct* ,
they
will
increase
in
numbers
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
each
area
is
already
fully
stocked
with
inhabitants
*punct* ,
the
other
species
will
decrease
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
travel
southward
and
see
a
species
decreasing
in
numbers
*punct* ,
we
may
feel
sure
that
the
cause
lies
quite
as
much
in
other
species
being
favoured
*punct* ,
as
in
this
one
being
hurt
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
is
when
we
travel
northward
*punct* ,
but
in
a
somewhat
lesser
degree
*punct* ,
for
the
number
of
species
of
all
kinds
*punct* ,
and
therefore
of
competitors
*punct* ,
decreases
northwards
*punct* ;
hence
in
going
northward
*punct* ,
or
in
ascending
a
mountain
*punct* ,
we
far
oftener
meet
with
stunted
forms
*punct* ,
due
to
the
directly
injurious
action
of
climate
*punct* ,
than
we
do
in
proceeding
southwards
or
in
descending
a
mountain
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
reach
the
arctic
regions
*punct* ,
or
snow-capped
summits
*punct* ,
or
absolute
deserts
*punct* ,
the
struggle
for
life
is
almost
exclusively
with
the
elements
*punct* .
*break*
that
climate
acts
in
main
part
indirectly
by
favouring
other
species
*punct* ,
we
may
clearly
see
in
the
prodigious
number
of
plants
in
our
gardens
which
can
perfectly
well
endure
our
climate
*punct* ,
but
which
never
become
naturalised
*punct* ,
for
they
cannot
compete
with
our
native
plants
*punct* ,
nor
resist
destruction
by
our
native
animals
*punct* .
*break*
when
a
species
*punct* ,
owing
to
highly
favourable
circumstances
*punct* ,
increases
inordinately
in
numbers
in
a
small
tract
*punct* ,
epidemics
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
this
seems
generally
to
occur
with
our
game
animals
*punct* ,
often
ensue
*punct* :
and
here
we
have
a
limiting
check
independent
of
the
struggle
for
life
*punct* .
*break*
but
even
some
of
these
so-called
epidemics
appear
to
be
due
to
parasitic
worms
*punct* ,
which
have
from
some
cause
*punct* ,
possibly
in
part
through
facility
of
diffusion
amongst
the
crowded
animals
*punct* ,
been
disproportionably
favoured
*punct* :
and
here
comes
in
a
sort
of
struggle
between
the
parasite
and
its
prey
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
in
many
cases
*punct* ,
a
large
stock
of
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
relatively
to
the
numbers
of
its
enemies
*punct* ,
is
absolutely
necessary
for
its
preservation
*punct* .
*break*
thus
we
can
easily
raise
plenty
of
corn
and
rape-seed
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
in
our
fields
*punct* ,
because
the
seeds
are
in
great
excess
compared
with
the
number
of
birds
which
feed
on
them
*punct* ;
nor
can
the
birds
*punct* ,
though
having
a
superabundance
of
food
at
this
one
season
*punct* ,
increase
in
number
proportionally
to
the
supply
of
seed
*punct* ,
as
their
numbers
are
checked
during
winter
*punct* :
but
any
one
who
has
tried
*punct* ,
knows
how
troublesome
it
is
to
get
seed
from
a
few
wheat
or
other
such
plants
in
a
garden
*punct* ;
i
have
in
this
case
lost
every
single
seed
*punct* .
*break*
this
view
of
the
necessity
of
a
large
stock
of
the
same
species
for
its
preservation
*punct* ,
explains
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
some
singular
facts
in
nature
*punct* ,
such
as
that
of
very
rare
plants
being
sometimes
extremely
abundant
in
the
few
spots
where
they
do
occur
*punct* ;
and
that
of
some
social
plants
being
social
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
abounding
in
individuals
*punct* ,
even
on
the
extreme
confines
of
their
range
*punct* .
*break*
for
in
such
cases
*punct* ,
we
may
believe
*punct* ,
that
a
plant
could
exist
only
where
the
conditions
of
its
life
were
so
favourable
that
many
could
exist
together
*punct* ,
and
thus
save
each
other
from
utter
destruction
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
add
that
the
good
effects
of
frequent
intercrossing
*punct* ,
and
the
ill
effects
of
close
interbreeding
*punct* ,
probably
come
into
play
in
some
of
these
cases
*punct* ;
but
on
this
intricate
subject
i
will
not
here
enlarge
*punct* .
*break*
many
cases
are
on
record
showing
how
complex
and
unexpected
are
the
checks
and
relations
between
organic
beings
*punct* ,
which
have
to
struggle
together
in
the
same
country
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
give
only
a
single
instance
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
though
a
simple
one
*punct* ,
has
interested
me
*punct* .
*break*
in
staffordshire
*punct* ,
on
the
estate
of
a
relation
where
i
had
ample
means
of
investigation
*punct* ,
there
was
a
large
and
extremely
barren
heath
*punct* ,
which
had
never
been
touched
by
the
hand
of
man
*punct* ;
but
several
hundred
acres
of
exactly
the
same
nature
had
been
enclosed
twenty-five
years
previously
and
planted
with
scotch
fir
*punct* .
*break*
the
change
in
the
native
vegetation
of
the
planted
part
of
the
heath
was
most
remarkable
*punct* ,
more
than
is
generally
seen
in
passing
from
one
quite
different
soil
to
another
*punct* :
not
only
the
proportional
numbers
of
the
heath-plants
were
wholly
changed
*punct* ,
but
twelve
species
of
plants
*punct* ,
not
counting
grasses
and
carices
*punct* ,
flourished
in
the
plantations
*punct* ,
which
could
not
be
found
on
the
heath
*punct* .
*break*
the
effect
on
the
insects
must
have
been
still
greater
*punct* ,
for
six
insectivorous
birds
were
very
common
in
the
plantations
*punct* ,
which
were
not
to
be
seen
on
the
heath
*punct* ;
and
the
heath
was
frequented
by
two
or
three
distinct
insectivorous
birds
*punct* .
*break*
here
we
see
how
potent
has
been
the
effect
of
the
introduction
of
a
single
tree
*punct* ,
nothing
whatever
else
having
been
done
*punct* ,
with
the
exception
that
the
land
had
been
enclosed
*punct* ,
so
that
cattle
could
not
enter
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
important
an
element
enclosure
is
*punct* ,
i
plainly
saw
near
farnham
*punct* ,
in
surrey
*punct* .
*break*
here
there
are
extensive
heaths
*punct* ,
with
a
few
clumps
of
old
scotch
firs
on
the
distant
hill-tops
*punct* :
within
the
last
ten
years
large
spaces
have
been
enclosed
*punct* ,
and
self-sown
firs
are
now
springing
up
in
multitudes
*punct* ,
so
close
together
that
all
cannot
live
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
ascertained
that
these
young
trees
had
not
been
sown
or
planted
*punct* ,
i
was
so
much
surprised
at
their
numbers
that
i
went
to
several
points
of
view
*punct* ,
whence
i
could
examine
hundreds
of
acres
of
the
unenclosed
heath
*punct* ,
and
literally
i
could
not
see
a
single
scotch
fir
*punct* ,
except
the
old
planted
clumps
*punct* .
*break*
but
on
looking
closely
between
the
stems
of
the
heath
*punct* ,
i
found
a
multitude
of
seedlings
and
little
trees
*punct* ,
which
had
been
perpetually
browsed
down
by
the
cattle
*punct* .
*break*
in
one
square
yard
*punct* ,
at
a
point
some
hundreds
yards
distant
from
one
of
the
old
clumps
*punct* ,
i
counted
thirty-two
little
trees
*punct* ;
and
one
of
them
*punct* ,
judging
from
the
rings
of
growth
*punct* ,
had
during
twenty-six
years
tried
to
raise
its
head
above
the
stems
of
the
heath
*punct* ,
and
had
failed
*punct* .
*break*
no
wonder
that
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
the
land
was
enclosed
*punct* ,
it
became
thickly
clothed
with
vigorously
growing
young
firs
*punct* .
*break*
yet
the
heath
was
so
extremely
barren
and
so
extensive
that
no
one
would
ever
have
imagined
that
cattle
would
have
so
closely
and
effectually
searched
it
for
food
*punct* .
*break*
here
we
see
that
cattle
absolutely
determine
the
existence
of
the
scotch
fir
*punct* ;
but
in
several
parts
of
the
world
insects
determine
the
existence
of
cattle
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
paraguay
offers
the
most
curious
instance
of
this
*punct* ;
for
here
neither
cattle
nor
horses
nor
dogs
have
ever
run
wild
*punct* ,
though
they
swarm
southward
and
northward
in
a
feral
state
*punct* ;
and
azara
and
rengger
have
shown
that
this
is
caused
by
the
greater
number
in
paraguay
of
a
certain
fly
*punct* ,
which
lays
its
eggs
in
the
navels
of
these
animals
when
first
born
*punct* .
*break*
the
increase
of
these
flies
*punct* ,
numerous
as
they
are
*punct* ,
must
be
habitually
checked
by
some
means
*punct* ,
probably
by
birds
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
if
certain
insectivorous
birds
*punct* ,
whose
numbers
are
probably
regulated
by
hawks
or
beasts
of
prey
*punct* ,
were
to
increase
in
paraguay
*punct* ,
the
flies
would
decrease
*punct* ,
then
cattle
and
horses
would
become
feral
*punct* ,
and
this
would
certainly
greatly
alter
*punct* ,
as
indeed
i
have
observed
in
parts
of
south
america
*punct* ,
the
vegetation
*punct* :
this
again
would
largely
affect
the
insects
*punct* ;
and
this
*punct* ,
as
we
just
have
seen
in
staffordshire
*punct* ,
the
insectivorous
birds
*punct* ,
and
so
onwards
in
ever-increasing
circles
of
complexity
*punct* .
*break*
we
began
this
series
by
insectivorous
birds
*punct* ,
and
we
have
ended
with
them
*punct* .
*break*
not
that
in
nature
the
relations
can
ever
be
as
simple
as
this
*punct* .
*break*
battle
within
battle
must
ever
be
recurring
with
varying
success
*punct* ;
and
yet
in
the
long-run
the
forces
are
so
nicely
balanced
*punct* ,
that
the
face
of
nature
remains
uniform
for
long
periods
of
time
*punct* ,
though
assuredly
the
merest
trifle
would
often
give
the
victory
to
one
organic
being
over
another
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
so
profound
is
our
ignorance
*punct* ,
and
so
high
our
presumption
*punct* ,
that
we
marvel
when
we
hear
of
the
extinction
of
an
organic
being
*punct* ;
and
as
we
do
not
see
the
cause
*punct* ,
we
invoke
cataclysms
to
desolate
the
world
*punct* ,
or
invent
laws
on
the
duration
of
the
forms
of
life
*punct* !
*break*
i
am
tempted
to
give
one
more
instance
showing
how
plants
and
animals
*punct* ,
most
remote
in
the
scale
of
nature
*punct* ,
are
bound
together
by
a
web
of
complex
relations
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
hereafter
have
occasion
to
show
that
the
exotic
lobelia
fulgens
*punct* ,
in
this
part
of
england
*punct* ,
is
never
visited
by
insects
*punct* ,
and
consequently
*punct* ,
from
its
peculiar
structure
*punct* ,
never
can
set
a
seed
*punct* .
*break*
many
of
our
orchidaceous
plants
absolutely
require
the
visits
of
moths
to
remove
their
pollen-masses
and
thus
to
fertilise
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
reason
to
believe
that
humble-bees
are
indispensable
to
the
fertilisation
of
the
heartsease
*punct* ,
viola
tricolor
*punct* ,
for
other
bees
do
not
visit
this
flower
*punct* .
*break*
from
experiments
which
i
have
tried
*punct* ,
i
have
found
that
the
visits
of
bees
*punct* ,
if
not
indispensable
*punct* ,
are
at
least
highly
beneficial
to
the
fertilisation
of
our
clovers
*punct* ;
but
humble-bees
alone
visit
the
common
red
clover
*punct* ,
trifolium
pratense
*punct* ,
as
other
bees
cannot
reach
the
nectar
*punct* .
*break*
hence
i
have
very
little
doubt
*punct* ,
that
if
the
whole
genus
of
humble-bees
became
extinct
or
very
rare
in
england
*punct* ,
the
heartsease
and
red
clover
would
become
very
rare
*punct* ,
or
wholly
disappear
*punct* .
*break*
newman
*punct* ,
who
has
long
attended
to
the
habits
of
humble-bees
*punct* ,
believes
that
more
than
two
thirds
of
them
are
thus
destroyed
all
over
england
*punct* .
*break*
now
the
number
of
mice
is
largely
dependent
*punct* ,
as
every
one
knows
*punct* ,
on
the
number
of
cats
*punct* ;
and
mr.
newman
says
*punct* ,
near
villages
and
small
towns
i
have
found
the
nests
of
humble-bees
more
numerous
than
elsewhere
*punct* ,
which
i
attribute
to
the
number
of
cats
that
destroy
the
mice
*punct* .
*break*
hence
it
is
quite
credible
that
the
presence
of
a
feline
animal
in
large
numbers
in
a
district
might
determine
*punct* ,
through
the
intervention
first
of
mice
and
then
of

certain
flowers

in
the

of
every
species

many
different
checks
*punct* ,
acting
at
different
periods
of
life
*punct* ,
and
during
different
seasons
or
years
*punct* ,
probably
come
into
play
*punct* ;
some
one
check
or
some
few
being
generally
the
most
potent
*punct* ,
but
all
concurring
in
determining
the
average
number
or
even
the
existence
of
the
species
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
cases
it
can
be
shown
that
widely-different
checks
act
on
the
same
species
in
different
districts
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
look
at
the
plants
and
bushes
clothing
an
entangled
bank
*punct* ,
we
are
tempted
to
attribute
their
proportional
numbers
and
kinds
to
what
we
call
chance
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
false
a
view
is
this
*punct* !
*break*
every
one
has
heard
that
when
an
american
forest
is
cut
down
*punct* ,
a
very
different
vegetation
springs
up
*punct* ;
but
it
has
been
observed
that
the
trees
now
growing
on
the
ancient
indian
mounds
*punct* ,
in
the
southern
united
states
*punct* ,
display
the
same
beautiful
diversity
and
proportion
of
kinds
as
in
the
surrounding
virgin
forests
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
struggle
between
the
several
kinds
of
trees
must
here
have
gone
on
during
long
centuries
*punct* ,
each
annually
scattering
its
seeds
by
the
thousand
*punct* ;
what
war
between
insect
and
insect
*punct* ,
between
insects
*punct* ,
snails
*punct* ,
and
other
animals
with
birds
and
beasts
of
prey
*punct* ,
all
striving
to
increase
*punct* ,
and
all
feeding
on
each
other
or
on
the
trees
or
their
seeds
and
seedlings
*punct* ,
or
on
the
other
plants
which
first
clothed
the
ground
and
thus
checked
the
growth
of
the
trees
*punct* !
*break*
throw
up
a
handful
of
feathers
*punct* ,
and
all
must
fall
to
the
ground
according
to
definite
laws
*punct* ;
but
how
simple
is
this
problem
compared
to
the
action
and
reaction
of
the
innumerable
plants
and
animals
which
have
determined
*punct* ,
in
the
course
of
centuries
*punct* ,
the
proportional
numbers
and
kinds
of
trees
now
growing
on
the
old
indian
ruins
*punct* !
*break*
the
dependency
of
one
organic
being
on
another
*punct* ,
as
of
a
parasite
on
its
prey
*punct* ,
lies
generally
between
beings
remote
in
the
scale
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
often
the
case
with
those
which
may
strictly
be
said
to
struggle
with
each
other
for
existence
*punct* ,
as
in
the
case
of
locusts
and
grass-feeding
quadrupeds
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
struggle
almost
invariably
will
be
most
severe
between
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
for
they
frequent
the
same
districts
*punct* ,
require
the
same
food
*punct* ,
and
are
exposed
to
the
same
dangers
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
case
of
varieties
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
the
struggle
will
generally
be
almost
equally
severe
*punct* ,
and
we
sometimes
see
the
contest
soon
decided
*punct* :
for
instance
*punct* ,
if
several
varieties
of
wheat
be
sown
together
*punct* ,
and
the
mixed
seed
be
resown
*punct* ,
some
of
the
varieties
which
best
suit
the
soil
or
climate
*punct* ,
or
are
naturally
the
most
fertile
*punct* ,
will
beat
the
others
and
so
yield
more
seed
*punct* ,
and
will
consequently
in
a
few
years
quite
supplant
the
other
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
to
keep
up
a
mixed
stock
of
even
such
extremely
close
varieties
as
the
variously
coloured
sweet-peas
*punct* ,
they
must
be
each
year
harvested
separately
*punct* ,
and
the
seed
then
mixed
in
due
proportion
*punct* ,
otherwise
the
weaker
kinds
will
steadily
decrease
in
numbers
and
disappear
*punct* .
*break*
so
again
with
the
varieties
of
sheep
*punct* :
it
has
been
asserted
that
certain
mountain-varieties
will
starve
out
other
mountain-varieties
*punct* ,
so
that
they
cannot
be
kept
together
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
result
has
followed
from
keeping
together
different
varieties
of
the
medicinal
leech
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
even
be
doubted
whether
the
varieties
of
any
one
of
our
domestic
plants
or
animals
have
so
exactly
the
same
strength
*punct* ,
habits
*punct* ,
and
constitution
*punct* ,
that
the
original
proportions
of
a
mixed
stock
could
be
kept
up
for
half
a
dozen
generations
*punct* ,
if
they
were
allowed
to
struggle
together
*punct* ,
like
beings
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
and
if
the
seed
or
young
were
not
annually
sorted
*punct* .
*break*
as
species
of
the
same
genus
have
usually
*punct* ,
though
by
no
means
invariably
*punct* ,
some
similarity
in
habits
and
constitution
*punct* ,
and
always
in
structure
*punct* ,
the
struggle
will
generally
be
more
severe
between
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
when
they
come
into
competition
with
each
other
*punct* ,
than
between
species
of
distinct
genera
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
this
in
the
recent
extension
over
parts
of
the
united
states
of
one
species
of
swallow
having
caused
the
decrease
of
another
species
*punct* .
*break*
the
recent
increase
of
the
missel-thrush
in
parts
of
scotland
has
caused
the
decrease
of
the
song-thrush
*punct* .
*break*
how
frequently
we
hear
of
one
species
of
rat
taking
the
place
of
another
species
under
the
most
different
climates
*punct* !
*break*
in
russia
the
small
asiatic
cockroach
has
everywhere
driven
before
it
its
great
congener
*punct* .
*break*
one
species
of
charlock
will
supplant
another
*punct* ,
and
so
in
other
cases
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
dimly
see
why
the
competition
should
be
most
severe
between
allied
forms
*punct* ,
which
fill
nearly
the
same
place
in
the
economy
of
nature
*punct* ;
but
probably
in
no
one
case
could
we
precisely
say
why
one
species
has
been
victorious
over
another
in
the
great
battle
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
a
corollary
of
the
highest
importance
may
be
deduced
from
the
foregoing
remarks
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
the
structure
of
every
organic
being
is
related
*punct* ,
in
the
most
essential
yet
often
hidden
manner
*punct* ,
to
that
of
all
other
organic
beings
*punct* ,
with
which
it
comes
into
competition
for
food
or
residence
*punct* ,
or
from
which
it
has
to
escape
*punct* ,
or
on
which
it
preys
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
obvious
in
the
structure
of
the
teeth
and
talons
of
the
tiger
*punct* ;
and
in
that
of
the
legs
and
claws
of
the
parasite
which
clings
to
the
hair
on
the
tiger's
body
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
the
beautifully
plumed
seed
of
the
dandelion
*punct* ,
and
in
the
flattened
and
fringed
legs
of
the
water-beetle
*punct* ,
the
relation
seems
at
first
confined
to
the
elements
of
air
and
water
*punct* .
*break*
yet
the
advantage
of
plumed
seeds
no
doubt
stands
in
the
closest
relation
to
the
land
being
already
thickly
clothed
by
other
plants
*punct* ;
so
that
the
seeds
may
be
widely
distributed
and
fall
on
unoccupied
ground
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
water-beetle
*punct* ,
the
structure
of
its
legs
*punct* ,
so
well
adapted
for
diving
*punct* ,
allows
it
to
compete
with
other
aquatic
insects
*punct* ,
to
hunt
for
its
own
prey
*punct* ,
and
to
escape
serving
as
prey
to
other
animals
*punct* .
*break*
the
store
of
nutriment
laid
up
within
the
seeds
of
many
plants
seems
at
first
sight
to
have
no
sort
of
relation
to
other
plants
*punct* .
*break*
but
from
the
strong
growth
of
young
plants
produced
from
such
seeds
*punct* ,
as
peas
and
beans
*punct* ,
when
sown
in
the
midst
of
long
grass
*punct* ,
i
suspect
that
the
chief
use
of
the
nutriment
in
the
seed
is
to
favour
the
growth
of
the
young
seedling
*punct* ,
whilst
struggling
with
other
plants
growing
vigorously
all
around
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
a
plant
in
the
midst
of
its
range
*punct* ,
why
does
it
not
double
or
quadruple
its
numbers
*punct* ?
*break*
we
know
that
it
can
perfectly
well
withstand
a
little
more
heat
or
cold
*punct* ,
dampness
or
dryness
*punct* ,
for
elsewhere
it
ranges
into
slightly
hotter
or
colder
*punct* ,
damper
or
drier
districts
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
case
we
can
clearly
see
that
if
we
wished
in
imagination
to
give
the
plant
the
power
of
increasing
in
number
*punct* ,
we
should
have
to
give
it
some
advantage
over
its
competitors
*punct* ,
or
over
the
animals
which
preyed
on
it
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
confines
of
its
geographical
range
*punct* ,
a
change
of
constitution
with
respect
to
climate
would
clearly
be
an
advantage
to
our
plant
*punct* ;
but
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
only
a
few
plants
or
animals
range
so
far
*punct* ,
that
they
are
destroyed
by
the
rigour
of
the
climate
alone
*punct* .
*break*
not
until
we
reach
the
extreme
confines
of
life
*punct* ,
in
the
arctic
regions
or
on
the
borders
of
an
utter
desert
*punct* ,
will
competition
cease
*punct* .
*break*
the
land
may
be
extremely
cold
or
dry
*punct* ,
yet
there
will
be
competition
between
some
few
species
*punct* ,
or
between
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
for
the
warmest
or
dampest
spots
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
we
can
see
that
when
a
plant
or
animal
is
placed
in
a
new
country
amongst
new
competitors
*punct* ,
though
the
climate
may
be
exactly
the
same
as
in
its
former
home
*punct* ,
yet
the
conditions
of
its
life
will
generally
be
changed
in
an
essential
manner
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
wished
to
increase
its
average
numbers
in
its
new
home
*punct* ,
we
should
have
to
modify
it
in
a
different
way
to
what
we
should
have
done
in
its
native
country
*punct* ;
for
we
should
have
to
give
it
some
advantage
over
a
different
set
of
competitors
or
enemies
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
good
thus
to
try
in
our
imagination
to
give
any
form
some
advantage
over
another
*punct* .
*break*
probably
in
no
single
instance
should
we
know
what
to
do
*punct* ,
so
as
to
succeed
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
convince
us
of
our
ignorance
on
the
mutual
relations
of
all
organic
beings
*punct* ;
a
conviction
as
necessary
*punct* ,
as
it
seems
to
be
difficult
to
acquire
*punct* .
*break*
all
that
we
can
do
*punct* ,
is
to
keep
steadily
in
mind
that
each
organic
being
is
striving
to
increase
at
a
geometrical
ratio
*punct* ;
that
each
at
some
period
of
its
life
*punct* ,
during
some
season
of
the
year
*punct* ,
during
each
generation
or
at
intervals
*punct* ,
has
to
struggle
for
life
*punct* ,
and
to
suffer
great
destruction
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
reflect
on
this
struggle
*punct* ,
we
may
console
ourselves
with
the
full
belief
*punct* ,
that
the
war
of
nature
is
not
incessant
*punct* ,
that
no
fear
is
felt
*punct* ,
that
death
is
generally
prompt
*punct* ,
and
that
the
vigorous
*punct* ,
the
healthy
*punct* ,
and
the
happy
survive
and
multiply
*punct* .
*break*
how
will
the
struggle
for
existence
*punct* ,
discussed
too
briefly
in
the
last
chapter
*punct* ,
act
in
regard
to
variation
*punct* ?
*break*
can
the
principle
of
selection
*punct* ,
which
we
have
seen
is
so
potent
in
the
hands
of
man
*punct* ,
apply
in
nature
*punct* ?
*break*
i
think
we
shall
see
that
it
can
act
most
effectually
*punct* .
*break*
let
it
be
borne
in
mind
in
what
an
endless
number
of
strange
peculiarities
our
domestic
productions
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
a
lesser
degree
*punct* ,
those
under
nature
*punct* ,
vary
*punct* ;
and
how
strong
the
hereditary
tendency
is
*punct* .
*break*
under
domestication
*punct* ,
it
may
be
truly
said
that
the
whole
organisation
becomes
in
some
degree
plastic
*punct* .
*break*
let
it
be
borne
in
mind
how
infinitely
complex
and
close-fitting
are
the
mutual
relations
of
all
organic
beings
to
each
other
and
to
their
physical
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
can
it
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
be
thought
improbable
*punct* ,
seeing
that
variations
useful
to
man
have
undoubtedly
occurred
*punct* ,
that
other
variations
useful
in
some
way
to
each
being
in
the
great
and
complex
battle
of
life
*punct* ,
should
sometimes
occur
in
the
course
of
thousands
of
generations
*punct* ?
*break*
if
such
do
occur
*punct* ,
can
we
doubt
*punct* ,
remembering
that
many
more
individuals
are
born
than
can
possibly
survive
*punct* ,
that
individuals
having
any
advantage
*punct* ,
however
slight
*punct* ,
over
others
*punct* ,
would
have
the
best
chance
of
surviving
and
of
procreating
their
kind
*punct* ?
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
we
may
feel
sure
that
any
variation
in
the
least
degree
injurious
would
be
rigidly
destroyed
*punct* .
*break*
this
preservation
of
favourable
variations
and
the
rejection
of
injurious
variations
*punct* ,
i
call
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
variations
neither
useful
nor
injurious
would
not
be
affected
by
natural
selection
*punct* ,
and
would
be
left
a
fluctuating
element
*punct* ,
as
perhaps
we
see
in
the
species
called
polymorphic
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
best
understand
the
probable
course
of
natural
selection
by
taking
the
case
of
a
country
undergoing
some
physical
change
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
of
climate
*punct* .
*break*
the
proportional
numbers
of
its
inhabitants
would
almost
immediately
undergo
a
change
*punct* ,
and
some
species
might
become
extinct
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
conclude
*punct* ,
from
what
we
have
seen
of
the
intimate
and
complex
manner
in
which
the
inhabitants
of
each
country
are
bound
together
*punct* ,
that
any
change
in
the
numerical
proportions
of
some
of
the
inhabitants
*punct* ,
independently
of
the
change
of
climate
itself
*punct* ,
would
most
seriously
affect
many
of
the
others
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
country
were
open
on
its
borders
*punct* ,
new
forms
would
certainly
immigrate
*punct* ,
and
this
also
would
seriously
disturb
the
relations
of
some
of
the
former
inhabitants
*punct* .
*break*
let
it
be
remembered
how
powerful
the
influence
of
a
single
introduced
tree
or
mammal
has
been
shown
to
be
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
the
case
of
an
island
*punct* ,
or
of
a
country
partly
surrounded
by
barriers
*punct* ,
into
which
new
and
better
adapted
forms
could
not
freely
enter
*punct* ,
we
should
then
have
places
in
the
economy
of
nature
which
would
assuredly
be
better
filled
up
*punct* ,
if
some
of
the
original
inhabitants
were
in
some
manner
modified
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
had
the
area
been
open
to
immigration
*punct* ,
these
same
places
would
have
been
seized
on
by
intruders
*punct* .
*break*
in
such
case
*punct* ,
every
slight
modification
*punct* ,
which
in
the
course
of
ages
chanced
to
arise
*punct* ,
and
which
in
any
way
favoured
the
individuals
of
any
of
the
species
*punct* ,
by
better
adapting
them
to
their
altered
conditions
*punct* ,
would
tend
to
be
preserved
*punct* ;
and
natural
selection
would
thus
have
free
scope
for
the
work
of
improvement
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
reason
to
believe
*punct* ,
as
stated
in
the
first
chapter
*punct* ,
that
a
change
in
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
by
specially
acting
on
the
reproductive
system
*punct* ,
causes
or
increases
variability
*punct* ;
and
in
the
foregoing
case
the
conditions
of
life
are
supposed
to
have
undergone
a
change
*punct* ,
and
this
would
manifestly
be
favourable
to
natural
selection
*punct* ,
by
giving
a
better
chance
of
profitable
variations
occurring
*punct* ;
and
unless
profitable
variations
do
occur
*punct* ,
natural
selection
can
do
nothing

mere

change
*punct* ,
as

climate
*punct* ,

any
unusual
degree

isolation
to
check
immigration
*punct* ,
is
actually
necessary
to
produce
new

places
for
natural
selection
to
fill
up
by
modifying

improving
some
of
the

*break*
for
as
all
the

country
are
struggling

with
nicely
balanced
forces

extremely
slight
modifications
in
the

often
give

an
advantage
over

still
further

no

for
in

the

have
been
so

that
they
have
allowed
foreigners

foreigners
have
thus
everywhere
beaten
some

we
may
safely
conclude
that
the

might
have
been
modified

man

*break*
man
keeps
the

by
some

prominent

*break*
under

the

that

bear
the

*punct* ?
*break*
it
may
be
said
that
natural
selection
is
daily
and
hourly
scrutinising
*punct* ,
throughout
the
world
*punct* ,
every
variation
*punct* ,
even
the
slightest
*punct* ;
rejecting
that
which
is
bad
*punct* ,
preserving

adding
up
all
that
is
good
*punct* ;
silently
and
insensibly
working
*punct* ,
whenever

wherever
opportunity
offers
*punct* ,
at
the
improvement
of
each
organic
being
in
relation
to
its
organic
and
inorganic
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
nothing
of
these
slow
changes
in
progress
*punct* ,
until
the
hand
of
time
has
marked
the
long
lapse
of
ages
*punct* ,
and
then
so
imperfect
is
our
view
into
long
past
geological
ages
*punct* ,
that
we
only
see
that
the
forms
of
life
are
now
different
from
what
they
formerly
were
*punct* .
*break*
although
natural
selection
can
act
only
through
and
for
the
good
of
each
being
*punct* ,
yet
characters
and
structures
*punct* ,
which
we
are
apt
to
consider
as
of
very
trifling
importance
*punct* ,
may
thus
be
acted
on
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
see
leaf-eating
insects
green
*punct* ,
and
bark-feeders
mottled-grey
*punct* ;
the
alpine
ptarmigan
white

*punct* ,
the
red-grouse
the
colour
of
heather
*punct* ,
and
the
black-grouse
that

peaty
earth
*punct* ,
we
must
believe
that
these
tints
are
of
service
to
these
birds
and
insects
in
preserving
them
from
danger
*punct* .
*break*
grouse
*punct* ,
if
not
destroyed
at
some
period
of
their
lives
*punct* ,
would
increase
in
countless
numbers
*punct* ;
they
are
known
to
suffer
largely
from
birds
of
prey
*punct* ;
and
hawks
are
guided
by
eyesight
to
their
prey,
*punct* ,
so
much
so
*punct* ,
that
on
parts
of
the
continent
persons
are
warned
not
to
keep
white
pigeons
*punct* ,
as
being
the
most
liable
to
destruction
*punct* .
*break*
hence
i
can
see
no
reason
to
doubt
that
natural
selection
might
be
most
effective
in
giving
the
proper
colour
to
each
kind
of
grouse
*punct* ,
and
in
keeping
that
colour
*punct* ,
when
once
acquired
*punct* ,
true
and
constant
*punct* .
*break*
nor
ought
we
to
think
that
the
occasional
destruction
of
an
animal
of
any
particular
colour
would
produce
little
effect
*punct* :
we
should
remember
how
essential
it
is
in
a
flock
of
white
sheep
to
destroy
every
lamb
with
the
faintest
trace
of
black
*punct* .
*break*
in
plants
the
down
on
the
fruit
and
the
colour
of
the
flesh
are
considered
by
botanists
as
characters
of
the
most
trifling
importance
*punct* :
yet
we
hear
from
an
excellent
horticulturist
*punct* ,
downing
*punct* ,
that
in
the
united
states
smooth-skinned
fruits
suffer
far
more
from
a
beetle
*punct* ,
a
curculio
*punct* ,
than
those
with
down
*punct* ;
that
purple
plums
suffer
far
more
from
a
certain
disease
than
yellow
plums
*punct* ;
whereas
another
disease
attacks
yellow-fleshed
peaches
far
more
than
those
with
other
coloured
flesh
*punct* .
*break*
if
*punct* ,
with
all
the
aids
of
art
*punct* ,
these
slight
differences
make
a
great
difference
in
cultivating
the
several
varieties
*punct* ,
assuredly
*punct* ,
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
where
the
trees
would
have
to
struggle
with
other
trees
and
with
a
host
of
enemies
*punct* ,
such
differences
would
effectually
settle
which
variety
*punct* ,
whether
a
smooth
or
downy
*punct* ,
a
yellow
or
purple
fleshed
fruit
*punct* ,
should
succeed
*punct* .
*break*
in
looking
at
many
small
points
of
difference
between
species
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
as
far
as
our
ignorance
permits
us
to
judge
*punct* ,
seem
to
be
quite
unimportant
*punct* ,
we
must
not
forget
that
climate
*punct* ,
food
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
probably
produce
some
slight
and
direct
effect
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
far
more
necessary
to
bear
in
mind
that
there
are
many
unknown
laws
of
correlation
of
growth
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
when
one
part
of
the
organisation
is
modified
through
variation
*punct* ,
and
the
modifications
are
accumulated
by
natural
selection
for
the
good
of
the
being
*punct* ,
will
cause
other
modifications
*punct* ,
often
of
the
most
unexpected
nature
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
see
that
those
variations
which
under
domestication
appear
at
any
particular
period
of
life
*punct* ,
tend
to
reappear
in
the
offspring
at
the
same
period;
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
in
the
seeds
of
the
many
varieties
of
our
culinary
and
agricultural
plants
*punct* ;
in
the
caterpillar
and
cocoon
stages
of
the
varieties
of
the
silkworm
*punct* ;
in
the
eggs
of
poultry
*punct* ,
and
in
the
colour
of
the
down
of
their
chickens
*punct* ;
in
the
horns
of
our
sheep
and
cattle
when
nearly
adult;
*punct* ,
so
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
natural
selection
will
be
enabled
to
act
on
and
modify
organic
beings
at
any
age
*punct* ,
by
the
accumulation
of
profitable
variations
at
that
age
*punct* ,
and
by
their
inheritance
at
a
corresponding
age
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
profit
a
plant
to
have
its
seeds
more
and
more
widely
disseminated
by
the
wind
*punct* ,
i
can
see
no
greater
difficulty
in
this
being
effected
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
than
in
the
cotton-planter
increasing
and
improving
by
selection
the
down
in
the
pods
on
his
cotton-trees
*punct* .
*break*
natural
selection
may
modify
and
adapt
the
larva
of
an
insect
to
a
score
of
contingencies
*punct* ,
wholly
different
from
those
which
concern
the
mature
insect
*punct* .
*break*
these
modifications
will
no
doubt
affect
*punct* ,
through
the
laws
of
correlation
*punct* ,
the
structure
of
the
adult
*punct* ;
and
probably
in
the
case
of
those
insects
which
live
only
for
a
few
hours
*punct* ,
and
which
never
feed
*punct* ,
a
large
part
of
their
structure
is
merely
the
correlated
result
of
successive
changes
in
the
structure
of
their
larvae
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
conversely
*punct* ,
modifications
in
the
adult
will
probably
often
affect
the
structure
of
the
larva
*punct* ;
but
in
all
cases
natural
selection
will
ensure
that
modifications
consequent
on
other
modifications
at
a
different
period
of
life
*punct* ,
shall
not
be
in
the
least
degree
injurious
*punct* :
for
if
they
became
so
*punct* ,
they
would
cause
the
extinction
of
the
species
*punct* .
*break*
natural
selection
will
modify
the
structure
of
the
young
in
relation
to
the
parent
*punct* ,
and
of
the
parent
in
relation
to
the
young
*punct* .
*break*
in
social
animals
it
will
adapt
the
structure
of
each
individual
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
*punct* ;
if
each
in
consequence
profits
by
the
selected
change
*punct* .
*break*
what
natural
selection
cannot
do
*punct* ,
is
to
modify
the
structure
of
one
species
*punct* ,
without
giving
it
any
advantage
*punct* ,
for
the
good
of
another
species
*punct* ;
and
though
statements
to
this
effect
may
be
found
in
works
of
natural
history
*punct* ,
i
cannot
find
one
case
which
will
bear
investigation
*punct* .
*break*
a
structure
used
only
once
in
an
animal's
whole
life
*punct* ,
if
of
high
importance
to
it
*punct* ,
might
be
modified
to
any
extent
by
natural
selection
*punct* ;
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
great
jaws
possessed
by
certain
insects
*punct* ,
and
used
exclusively
for
opening
the
cocoon
*punct* ,
or
the
hard
tip
to
the
beak
of
nestling
birds
*punct* ,
used
for
breaking
the
egg
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
been
asserted
*punct* ,
that
of
the
best
short-beaked
tumbler-pigeons
more
perish
in
the
egg
than
are
able
to
get
out
of
it
*punct* ;
so
that
fanciers
assist
in
the
act
of
hatching
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
if
nature
had
to
make
the
beak
of
a
full-grown
pigeon
very
short
for
the
bird's
own
advantage
*punct* ,
the
process
of
modification
would
be
very
slow
*punct* ,
and
there
would
be
simultaneously
the
most
rigorous
selection
of
the
young
birds
within
the
egg
*punct* ,
which
had
the
most
powerful
and
hardest
beaks
*punct* ,
for
all
with
weak
beaks
would
inevitably
perish
*punct* :
or
*punct* ,
more
delicate
and
more
easily
broken
shells
might
be
selected
*punct* ,
the
thickness
of
the
shell
being
known
to
vary
like
every
other
structure
*punct* .
*break*
sexual
selection.
*punct* ,
inasmuch
as
peculiarities
often
appear
under
domestication
in
one
sex
and
become
hereditarily
attached
to
that
sex
*punct* ,
the
same
fact
probably
occurs
under
nature
*punct* ,
and
if
so
*punct* ,
natural
selection
will
be
able
to
modify
one
sex
in
its
functional
relations
to
the
other
sex
*punct* ,
or
in
relation
to
wholly
different
habits
of
life
in
the
two
sexes
*punct* ,
as
is
sometimes
the
case
with
insects
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
leads
me
to
say
a
few
words
on
what
i
call
sexual
selection
*punct* .
*break*
this
depends
*punct* ,
not
on
a
struggle
for
existence
*punct* ,
but
on
a
struggle
between
the
males
for
possession
of
the
females
*punct* ;
the
result
is
not
death
to
the
unsuccessful
competitor
*punct* ,
but
few
or
no
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
sexual
selection
is
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
less
rigorous
than
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
generally
*punct* ,
the
most
vigorous
males
*punct* ,
those
which
are
best
fitted
for
their
places
in
nature
*punct* ,
will
leave
most
progeny
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
many
cases
*punct* ,
victory
will
depend
not
on
general
vigour
*punct* ,
but
on
having
special
weapons
*punct* ,
confined
to
the
male
sex
*punct* .
*break*
a
hornless
stag
or
spurless
cock
would
have
a
poor
chance
of
leaving
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
sexual
selection
by
always
allowing
the
victor
to
breed
might
surely
give
indomitable
courage
*punct* ,
length
to
the
spur
*punct* ,
and
strength
to
the
wing
to
strike
in
the
spurred
leg
*punct* ,
as
well
as
the
brutal
cock-fighter
*punct* ,
who
knows
well
that
he
can
improve
his
breed
by
careful
selection
of
the
best
cocks
*punct* .
*break*
how
low
in
the
scale
of
nature
this
law
of
battle
descends
*punct* ,
i
know
not
*punct* ;
male
alligators
have
been
described
as
fighting
*punct* ,
bellowing
*punct* ,
and
whirling
round
*punct* ,
like
indians
in
a
war-dance
*punct* ,
for
the
possession
of
the
females
*punct* ;
male
salmons
have
been
seen
fighting
all
day
long
*punct* ;
male
stag-beetles
often
bear
wounds
from
the
huge
mandibles
of
other
males
*punct* .
*break*
the
war
is
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
severest
between
the
males
of
polygamous
animals
*punct* ,
and
these
seem
oftenest
provided
with
special
weapons
*punct* .
*break*
the
males
of
carnivorous
animals
are
already
well
armed
*punct* ;
though
to
them

*punct* ,
special
means
of
defence
may
be
given
through

the
mane

the
lion
*punct* ,
the
shoulder-pad
to
the
boar
*punct* ,
and
the
hooked
jaw
to

salmon

the
shield
may
be
as
important

victory

spear

*punct* ;
and
successive
males
display
their
gorgeous
plumage
and
perform
strange
antics
before
the
females
*punct* ,
which
standing
by
as
spectators
*punct* ,
at
last
choose
the
most
attractive
partner
*punct* .
*break*
heron
has
described
how
one
pied
peacock
was
eminently
attractive
to
all
his
hen
birds
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
appear
childish
to
attribute
any
effect
to
such
apparently
weak
means
*punct* :
i
cannot
here
enter
on
the
details
necessary
to
support
this
view
*punct* ;
but
if
man
can
in
a
short
time
give
elegant
carriage
and
beauty
to
his
bantams
*punct* ,
according
to
his
standard
of
beauty
*punct* ,
i
can
see
no
good
reason
to
doubt
that
female
birds
*punct* ,
by
selecting
*punct* ,
during
thousands
of
generations
*punct* ,
the
most
melodious
or
beautiful
males
*punct* ,
according
to
their
standard
of
beauty
*punct* ,
might
produce
a
marked
effect
*punct* .
*break*
i
strongly
suspect
that
some
well-known
laws
with
respect
to
the
plumage
of
male
and
female
birds
*punct* ,
in
comparison
with
the
plumage
of
the
young
*punct* ,
can
be
explained
on
the
view
of
plumage
having
been
chiefly
modified
by
sexual
selection
*punct* ,
acting
when
the
birds
have
come
to
the
breeding
age
or
during
the
breeding
season
*punct* ;
the
modifications
thus
produced
being
inherited
at
corresponding
ages
or
seasons
*punct* ,
either
by
the
males
alone
*punct* ,
or
by
the
males
and
females
*punct* ;
but
i
have
not
space
here
to
enter
on
this
subject
*punct* .
*break*
thus
it
is
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
that
when
the
males
and
females
of
any
animal
have
the
same
general
habits
of
life
*punct* ,
but
differ
in
structure
*punct* ,
colour
*punct* ,
or
ornament
*punct* ,
such
differences
have
been
mainly
caused
by
sexual
selection
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
individual
males
have
had
*punct* ,
in
successive
generations
*punct* ,
some
slight
advantage
over
other
males
*punct* ,
in
their
weapons
*punct* ,
means
of
defence
*punct* ,
or
charms
*punct* ;
and
have
transmitted
these
advantages
to
their
male
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
i
would
not
wish
to
attribute
all
such
sexual
differences
to
this
agency
*punct* :
for
we
see
peculiarities
arising
and
becoming
attached
to
the
male
sex
in
our
domestic
animals
*punct* ,
as
the
wattle
in
male
carriers
*punct* ,
horn-like
protuberances
in
the
cocks
of
certain
fowls
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
which
we
cannot
believe
to
be
either
useful
to
the
males
in
battle
*punct* ,
or
attractive
to
the
females
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
analogous
cases
under
nature
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
tuft
of
hair
on
the
breast
of
the
turkey-cock
*punct* ,
which
can
hardly
be
either
useful
or
ornamental
to
this
bird;
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
had
the
tuft
appeared
under
domestication
*punct* ,
it
would
have
been
called
a
monstrosity
*punct* .
*break*
illustrations
of
the
action
of
natural
selection.
*punct* ,
in
order
to
make
it
clear
how
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
natural
selection
acts
*punct* ,
i
must
beg
permission
to
give
one
or
two
imaginary
illustrations
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
take
the
case
of
a
wolf
*punct* ,
which
preys
on
various
animals
*punct* ,
securing
some
by
craft
*punct* ,
some
by
strength
*punct* ,
and
some
by
fleetness
*punct* ;
and
let
us
suppose
that
the
fleetest
prey
*punct* ,
a
deer
for
instance
*punct* ,
had
from
any
change
in
the
country
increased
in
numbers
*punct* ,
or
that
other
prey
had
decreased
in
numbers
*punct* ,
during
that
season
of
the
year
when
the
wolf
is
hardest
pressed
for
food
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
under
such
circumstances
see
no
reason
to
doubt
that
the
swiftest
and
slimmest
wolves
would
have
the
best
chance
of
surviving
*punct* ,
and
so
be
preserved
or
selected,
*punct* ,
provided
always
that
they
retained
strength
to
master
their
prey
at
this
or
at
some
other
period
of
the
year
*punct* ,
when
they
might
be
compelled
to
prey
on
other
animals
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
see
no
more
reason
to
doubt
this
*punct* ,
than
that
man
can
improve
the
fleetness
of
his
greyhounds
by
careful
and
methodical
selection
*punct* ,
or
by
that
unconscious
selection
which
results
from
each
man
trying
to
keep
the
best
dogs
without
any
thought
of
modifying
the
breed
*punct* .
*break*
even
without
any
change
in
the
proportional
numbers
of
the
animals
on
which
our
wolf
preyed
*punct* ,
a
cub
might
be
born
with
an
innate
tendency
to
pursue
certain
kinds
of
prey
*punct* .
*break*
nor
can
this
be
thought
very
improbable
*punct* ;
for
we
often
observe
great
differences
in
the
natural
tendencies
of
our
domestic
animals
*punct* ;
one
cat
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
taking
to
catch
rats
*punct* ,
another
mice
*punct* ;
one
cat
*punct* ,
according
to
mr.
st
*punct* .
*break*
john
*punct* ,
bringing
home
winged
game
*punct* ,
another
hares
or
rabbits
*punct* ,
and
another
hunting
on
marshy
ground
and
almost
nightly
catching
woodcocks
or
snipes
*punct* .
*break*
the
tendency
to
catch
rats
rather
than
mice
is
known
to
be
inherited
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
if
any
slight
innate
change
of
habit
or
of
structure
benefited
an
individual
wolf
*punct* ,
it
would
have
the
best
chance
of
surviving
and
of
leaving
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
its
young
would
probably
inherit
the
same
habits
or
structure
*punct* ,
and
by
the
repetition
of
this
process
*punct* ,
a
new
variety
might
be
formed
which
would
either
supplant
or
coexist
with
the
parent-form
of
wolf
*punct* .
*break*
or
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
the
wolves
inhabiting
a
mountainous
district
*punct* ,
and
those
frequenting
the
lowlands
*punct* ,
would
naturally
be
forced
to
hunt
different
prey
*punct* ;
and
from
the
continued
preservation
of
the
individuals
best
fitted
for
the
two
sites
*punct* ,
two
varieties
might
slowly
be
formed
*punct* .
*break*
these
varieties
would
cross
and
blend
where
they
met
*punct* ;
but
to
this
subject
of
intercrossing
we
shall
soon
have
to
return
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
add
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
according
to
mr.
pierce
*punct* ,
there
are
two
varieties
of
the
wolf
inhabiting
the
catskill
mountains
in
the
united
states
*punct* ,
one
with
a
light
greyhound-like
form
*punct* ,
which
pursues
deer
*punct* ,
and
the
other
more
bulky
*punct* ,
with
shorter
legs
*punct* ,
which
more
frequently
attacks
the
shepherd's
flocks
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
now
take
a
more
complex
case
*punct* .
*break*
certain
plants
excrete
a
sweet
juice
*punct* ,
apparently
for
the
sake
of
eliminating
something
injurious
from
their
sap
*punct* :
this
is
effected
by
glands
at
the
base
of
the
stipules
in
some
leguminosae
*punct* ,
and
at
the
back
of
the
leaf
of
the
common
laurel
*punct* .
*break*
this
juice
*punct* ,
though
small
in
quantity
*punct* ,
is
greedily
sought
by
insects
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
now
suppose
a
little
sweet
juice
or
nectar
to
be
excreted
by
the
inner
bases
of
the
petals
of
a
flower
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
case
insects
in
seeking
the
nectar
would
get
dusted
with
pollen
*punct* ,
and
would
certainly
often
transport
the
pollen
from
one
flower
to
the
stigma
of
another
flower
*punct* .
*break*
the
flowers
of
two
distinct
individuals
of
the
same
species
would
thus
get
crossed
*punct* ;
and
the
act
of
crossing
*punct* ,
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
*punct* ,
as
will
hereafter
be
more
fully
alluded
to
*punct* ,
would
produce
very
vigorous
seedlings
*punct* ,
which
consequently
would
have
the
best
chance
of
flourishing
and
surviving
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
these
seedli
ngs
would
probably
inherit
the
nectar-excreting
power
*punct* .
*break*
those
individual
flowers
which
had
the
largest
glands
or
nectaries
*punct* ,
and
which
excreted
most
nectar
*punct* ,
would
be
oftenest
visited
by
insects
*punct* ,
and
would
be
oftenest
crossed
*punct* ;
and
so
in
the
long-run
would
gain
the
upper
hand
*punct* .
*break*
those
flowers
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
which
had
their
stamens
and
pistils
placed
*punct* ,
in
relation
to
the
size
and
habits
of
the
particular
insects
which
visited
them
*punct* ,
so
as
to
favour
in
any
degree
the
transportal
of
their
pollen
from
flower
to
flower
*punct* ,
would
likewise
be
favoured
or
selected
*punct* .
*break*
we
might
have
taken
the
case
of
insects
visiting
flowers
for
the
sake
of
collecting
pollen
instead
of
nectar
*punct* ;
and
as
pollen
is
formed
for
the
sole
object
of
fertilisation
*punct* ,
its
destruction
appears
a
simple
loss
to
the
plant
*punct* ;
yet
if
a
little
pollen
were
carried
*punct* ,
at
first
occasionally
and
then
habitually
*punct* ,
by
the
pollen-devouring
insects
from
flower
to
flower
*punct* ,
and
a
cross
thus
effected
*punct* ,
although
nine-tenths
of
the
pollen
were
destroyed
*punct* ,
it
might
still
be
a
great
gain
to
the
plant
*punct* ;
and
those
individuals
which
produced
more
and
more
pollen
*punct* ,
and
had
larger
and
larger
anthers
*punct* ,
would
be
selected
*punct* .
*break*
when
our
plant
*punct* ,
by
this
process
of
the
continued
preservation
or
natural
selection
of
more
and
more
attractive
flowers
*punct* ,
had
been
rendered
highly
attractive
to
insects
*punct* ,
they
would
*punct* ,
unintentionally
on
their
part
*punct* ,
regularly
carry
pollen
from
flower
to
flower
*punct* ;
and
that
they
can
most
effectually
do
this
*punct* ,
i
could
easily
show
by
many
striking
instances
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
give
only
one
*punct* ,
not
as
a
very
striking
case
*punct* ,
but
as
likewise
illustrating
one
step
in
the
separation
of
the
sexes
of
plants
*punct* ,
presently
to
be
alluded
to
*punct* .
*break*
some
holly-trees
bear
only
male
flowers
*punct* ,
which
have
four
stamens
producing
rather
a
small
quantity
of
pollen
*punct* ,
and
a
rudimentary
pistil
*punct* ;
other
holly-trees
bear
only
female
flowers
*punct* ;
these
have
a
full-sized
pistil
*punct* ,
and
four
stamens
with
shrivelled
anthers
*punct* ,
in
which
not
a
grain
of
pollen
can
be
detected
*punct* .
*break*
having
found
a
female
tree
exactly
sixty
yards
from
a
male
tree
*punct* ,
i
put
the
stigmas
of
twenty
flowers
*punct* ,
taken
from
different
branches
*punct* ,
under
the
microscope
*punct* ,
and
on
all
*punct* ,
without
exception
*punct* ,
there
were
pollen-grains
*punct* ,
and
on
some
a
profusion
of
pollen
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
wind
had
set
for
several
days
from
the
female
to
the
male
tree
*punct* ,
the
pollen
could
not
thus
have
been
carried
*punct* .
*break*
the
weather
had
been
cold
and
boisterous
*punct* ,
and
therefore
not
favourable
to
bees
*punct* ,
nevertheless
every
female
flower
which
i
examined
had
been
effectually
fertilised
by
the
bees
*punct* ,
accidentally
dusted
with
pollen
*punct* ,
having
flown
from
tree
to
tree
in
search
of
nectar
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
return
to
our
imaginary
case
*punct* :
as
soon
as
the
plant
had
been
rendered
so
highly
attractive
to
insects
that
pollen
was
regularly
carried
from
flower
to
flower
*punct* ,
another
process
might
commence
*punct* .
*break*
no
naturalist
doubts
the
advantage
of
what
has
been
called
the
physiological
division
of
labour
*punct* ;
hence
we
may
believe
that
it
would
be
advantageous
to
a
plant
to
produce
stamens
alone
in
one
flower
or
on
one
whole
plant
*punct* ,
and
pistils
alone
in
another
flower
or
on
another
plant
*punct* .
*break*
in
plants
under
culture
and
placed
under
new
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
sometimes
the
male
organs
and
sometimes
the
female
organs
become
more
or
less
impotent
*punct* ;
now
if
we
suppose
this
to
occur
in
ever
so
slight
a
degree
under
nature
*punct* ,
then
as
pollen
is
already
carried
regularly
from
flower
to
flower
*punct* ,
and
as
a
more
complete
separation
of
the
sexes
of
our
plant
would
be
advantageous
on
the
principle
of
the
division
of
labour
*punct* ,
individuals
with
this
tendency
more
and
more
increased
*punct* ,
would
be
continually
favoured
or
selected
*punct* ,
until
at
last
a
complete
separation
of
the
sexes
would
be
effected
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
now
turn
to
the
nectar-feeding
insects
in
our
imaginary
case
*punct* :
we
may
suppose
the
plant
of
which
we
have
been
slowly
increasing
the
nectar
by
continued
selection
*punct* ,
to
be
a
common
plant
*punct* ;
and
that
certain
insects
depended
in
main
part
on
its
nectar
for
food
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
give
many
facts
*punct* ,
showing
how
anxious
bees
are
to
save
time
*punct* ;
for
instance
*punct* ,
their
habit
of
cutting
holes
and
sucking
the
nectar
at
the
bases
of
certain
flowers
*punct* ,
which
they
can
*punct* ,
with
a
very
little
more
trouble
*punct* ,
enter
by
the
mouth
*punct* .
*break*
bearing
such
facts
in
mind
*punct* ,
i
can
see
no
reason
to
doubt
that
an
accidental
deviation
in
the
size
and
form
of
the
body
*punct* ,
or
in
the
curvature
and
length
of
the
proboscis
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
far
too
slight
to
be
appreciated
by
us
*punct* ,
might
profit
a
bee
or
other
insect
*punct* ,
so
that
an
individual
so
characterised
would
be
able
to
obtain
its
food
more
quickly
*punct* ,
and
so
have
a
better
chance
of
living
and
leaving
descendants
*punct* .
*break*
its
descendants
would
probably
inherit
a
tendency
to
a
similar
slight
deviation
of
structure
*punct* .
*break*
the
tubes
of
the
corollas
of
the
common
red
and
incarnate
clovers
*punct* ,
trifolium
pratense
and
incarnatum
*punct* ,
do
not
on
a
hasty
glance
appear
to
differ
in
length
*punct* ;
yet
the
hive-bee
can
easily
suck
the
nectar
out
of
the
incarnate
clover
*punct* ,
but
not
out
of
the
common
red
clover
*punct* ,
which
is
visited
by
humble-bees
alone
*punct* ;
so
that
whole
fields
of
the
red
clover
offer
in
vain
an
abundant
supply
of
precious
nectar
to
the
hive-bee
*punct* .
*break*
thus
it
might
be
a
great
advantage
to
the
hive-bee
to
have
a
slightly
longer
or
differently
constructed
proboscis
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
i
have
found
by
experiment
that
the
fertility
of
clover
greatly
depends
on
bees
visiting
and
moving
parts
of
the
corolla
*punct* ,
so
as
to
push
the
pollen
on
to
the
stigmatic
surface
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
if
humble-bees
were
to
become
rare
in
any
country
*punct* ,
it
might
be
a
great
advantage
to
the
red
clover
to
have
a
shorter
or
more
deeply
divided
tube
to
its
corolla
*punct* ,
so
that
the
hive-bee
could
visit
its
flowers
*punct* .
*break*
thus
i
can
understand
how
a
flower
and
a
bee
might
slowly
become
*punct* ,
either
simultaneously
or
one
after
the
other
*punct* ,
modified
and
adapted
in
the
most
perfect
manner
to
each
other
*punct* ,
by
the
continued
preservation
of
individuals
presenting
mutual
and
slightly
favourable
deviations
of
structure
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
well
aware
that
this
doctrine
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
exemplified
in
the
above
imaginary
instances
*punct* ,
is
open
to
the
same
objections
which
were
at
first
urged
against
sir
charles
lyell's
noble
views
on
the
modern
changes
of
the
earth
*punct* ,
as
illustrative
of
geology
*punct* ;
but
we
now
very
seldom
hear
the
action
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
of
the
coast-waves
*punct* ,
called
a
trifling
and
insignificant
cause
*punct* ,
when
applied

*break*
natural
selection
can
act
only
by
the
preservation
and
accumulation
of
infinitesimally
small
inherited
modifications
*punct* ,
each
profitable
to
the
preserved
being
*punct* ;
and
as
modern
geology
has
almost
banished
such
views
as
the
excavation
of
a
great
valley
by
a
single
diluvial
wave
*punct* ,
so
will
natural
selection
*punct* ,
if
it
be
a
true
principle
*punct* ,
banish
the
belief
of
the
continued
creation
of
new
organic
beings
*punct* ,
or
of
any
great
and
sudden
modification
in
their
structure
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
intercrossing
of
individuals.
*punct* ,
i
must
here
introduce
a
short
digression
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
case
of
animals
and
plants
with
separated
sexes
*punct* ,
it
is
of
course
obvious
that
two
individuals
must
always
unite
for
each
birth
*punct* ;
but
in
the
case
of
hermaphrodites
this
is
far
from
obvious
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
believe
that
with
all
hermaphrodites
two
individuals
*punct* ,
either
occasionally
or
habitually
*punct* ,
concur
for
the
reproduction
of
their
kind
*punct* .
*break*
this
view
*punct* ,
i
may
add
*punct* ,
was
first
suggested
by
andrew
knight
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
presently
see
its
importance
*punct* ;
but
i
must
here
treat
the
subject
with
extreme
brevity
*punct* ,
though
i
have
the
materials
prepared
for
an
ample
discussion
*punct* .
*break*
all
vertebrate
animals
*punct* ,
all
insects
*punct* ,
and
some
other
large
groups
of
animals
*punct* ,
pair
for
each
birth
*punct* .
*break*
modern
research
has
much
diminished
the
number
of
supposed
hermaphrodites
*punct* ,
and
of
real
hermaphrodites
a
large
number
pair
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
two
individuals
regularly
unite
for
reproduction
*punct* ,
which
is
all
that
concerns
us
*punct* .
*break*
but
still
there
are
many
hermaphrodite
animals
which
certainly
do
not
habitually
pair
*punct* ,
and
a
vast
majority
of
plants
are
hermaphrodites
*punct* .
*break*
what
reason
*punct* ,
it
may
be
asked
*punct* ,
is
there
for
supposing
in
these
cases
that
two
individuals
ever
concur
in
reproduction
*punct* ?
*break*
as
it
is
impossible
here
to
enter
on
details
*punct* ,
i
must
trust
to
some
general
considerations
alone
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
first
place
*punct* ,
i
have
collected
so
large
a
body
of
facts
*punct* ,
showing
*punct* ,
in
accordance
with
the
almost
universal
belief
of
breeders
*punct* ,
that
with
animals
and
plants
a
cross
between
different
varieties
*punct* ,
or
between
individuals
of
the
same
variety
but
of
another
strain
*punct* ,
gives
vigour
and
fertility
to
the
offspring
*punct* ;
and
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
that
close
interbreeding
diminishes
vigour
and
fertility
*punct* ;
that
these
facts
alone
incline
me
to
believe
that
it
is
a
general
law
of
nature
*punct* ,
utterly
ignorant
though
we
be
of
the
meaning
of
the
law
*punct* ,
that
no
organic
being
self-fertilises
itself
for
an
eternity
of
generations
*punct* ;
but
that
a
cross
with
another
individual
is
occasionally
*punct* ,
perhaps
at
very
long
intervals
*punct* ,
indispensable
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
belief
that
this
is
a
law
of
nature
*punct* ,
we
can
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
understand
several
large
classes
of
facts
*punct* ,
such
as
the
following
*punct* ,
which
on
any
other
view
are
inexplicable
*punct* .
*break*
every
hybridizer
knows
how
unfavourable
exposure
to
wet
is
to
the
fertilisation
of
a
flower
*punct* ,
yet
what
a
multitude
of
flowers
have
their
anthers
and
stigmas
fully
exposed
to
the
weather
*punct* !
*break*
but
if
an
occasional
cross
be
indispensable
*punct* ,
the
fullest
freedom
for
the
entrance
of
pollen
from
another
individual
will
explain
this
state
of
exposure
*punct* ,
more
especially
as
the
plant's
own
anthers
and
pistil
generally
stand
so
close
together
that
self-fertilisation
seems
almost
inevitable
*punct* .
*break*
many
flowers
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
have
their
organs
of
fructification
closely
enclosed
*punct* ,
as
in
the
great
papilionaceous
or
pea-family
*punct* ;
but
in
several
*punct* ,
perhaps
in
all
*punct* ,
such
flowers
*punct* ,
there
is
a
very
curious
adaptation
between
the
structure
of
the
flower
and
the
manner
in
which
bees
suck
the
nectar
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
in
doing
this
*punct* ,
they
either
push
the
flower's
own
pollen
on
the
stigma
*punct* ,
or
bring
pollen
from
another
flower
*punct* .
*break*
so
necessary
are
the
visits
of
bees
to
papilionaceous
flowers
*punct* ,
that
i
have
found
*punct* ,
by
experiments
published
elsewhere
*punct* ,
that
their
fertility
is
greatly
diminished
if
these
visits
be
prevented
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
it
is
scarcely
possible
that
bees
should
fly
from
flower
to
flower
*punct* ,
and
not
carry
pollen
from
one
to
the
other
*punct* ,
to
the
great
good
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
of
the
plant
*punct* .
*break*
bees
will
act
like
a
camel-hair
pencil
*punct* ,
and
it
is
quite
sufficient
just
to
touch
the
anthers
of
one
flower
and
then
the
stigma
of
another
with
the
same
brush
to
ensure
fertilisation
*punct* ;
but
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
bees
would
thus
produce
a
multitude
of
hybrids
between
distinct
species
*punct* ;
for
if
you
bring
on
the
same
brush
a
plant's
own
pollen
and
pollen
from
another
species
*punct* ,
the
former
will
have
such
a
prepotent
effect
*punct* ,
that
it
will
invariably
and
completely
destroy
*punct* ,
as
has
been
shown
by
gartner
*punct* ,
any
influence
from
the
foreign
pollen
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
stamens
of
a
flower
suddenly
spring
towards
the
pistil
*punct* ,
or
slowly
move
one
after
the
other
towards
it
*punct* ,
the
contrivance
seems
adapted
solely
to
ensure
self-fertilisation
*punct* ;
and
no
doubt
it
is
useful
for
this
end
*punct* :
but
*punct* ,
the
agency
of
insects
is
often
required
to
cause
the
stamens
to
spring
forward
*punct* ,
as
kolreuter
has
shown
to
be
the
case
with
the
barberry
*punct* ;
and
curiously
in
this
very
genus
*punct* ,
which
seems
to
have
a
special
contrivance
for
self-fertilisation
*punct* ,
it
is
well
known
that
if
very
closely-allied
forms
or
varieties
are
planted
near
each
other
*punct* ,
it
is
hardly
possible
to
raise
pure
seedlings
*punct* ,
so
largely
do
they
naturally
cross
*punct* .
*break*
sprengel
and
from
my
own
observations
*punct* ,
which
effectually
prevent
the
stigma
receiving
pollen
from
its
own
flower
*punct* :
for
instance
*punct* ,
in
lobelia
fulgens
*punct* ,
there
is
a
really
beautiful
and
elaborate
contrivance
by
which
every
one
of
the
infinitely
numerous
pollen-granules
are
swept
out
of
the
conjoined
anthers
of
each
flower
*punct* ,
before
the
stigma
of
that
individual
flower
is
ready
to
receive
them
*punct* ;
and
as
this
flower
is
never
visited
*punct* ,
at
least
in
my
garden
*punct* ,
by
insects
*punct* ,
it
never
sets
a
seed
*punct* ,
though
by
placing
pollen
from
one
flower
on
the
stigma
of
another
*punct* ,
i
raised
plenty
of
seedlings
*punct* ;
and
whilst
another
species
of
lobelia
growing
close
by
*punct* ,
which
is
visited
by
bees
*punct* ,
seeds
freely
*punct* .
*break*
sprengel
has
shown
*punct* ,
and
as
i
can
confirm
*punct* ,
either
the
anthers
burst
before
the
stigma
is
ready
for
fertilisation
*punct* ,
or
the
stigma
is
ready
before
the
pollen
of
that
flower
is
ready
*punct* ,
so
that
these
plants
have
in
fact
separated
sexes
*punct* ,
and
must
habitually
be
crossed
*punct* .
*break*
how
strange
are
these
facts
*punct* !
*break*
how
strange
that
the
pollen
and
stigmatic
surface
of
the
same
flower
*punct* ,
though
placed
so
close
together
*punct* ,
as
if
for
the
very
purpose
of
self-fertilisation
*punct* ,
should
in
so
many
cases
be
mutually
useless
to
each
other
*punct* !
*break*
how
simply
are
these
facts
explained
on
the
view
of
an
occasional
cross
with
a
distinct
individual
being
advantageous
or
indispensable
*punct* !
*break*
if
several
varieties
of
the
cabbage
*punct* ,
radish
*punct* ,
onion
*punct* ,
and
of
some
other
plants
*punct* ,
be
allowed
to
seed
near
each
other
*punct* ,
a
large
majority
*punct* ,
as
i
have
found
*punct* ,
of
the
seedlings
thus
raised
will
turn
out
mongrels
*punct* :
for
instance
*punct* ,
i
raised
233
seedling
cabbages
from
some
plants
of
different
varieties
growing
near
each
other
*punct* ,
and
of
these
only
78
were
true
to
their
kind
*punct* ,
and
some
even
of
these
were
not
perfectly
true
*punct* .
*break*
yet
the
pistil
of
each
cabbage-flower
is
surrounded
not
only
by
its
own
six
stamens
*punct* ,
but
by
those
of
the
many
other
flowers
on
the
same
plant
*punct* .
*break*
how
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
comes
it
that
such
a
vast
number
of
the
seedlings
are
mongrelized
*punct* ?
*break*
i
suspect
that
it
must
arise
from
the
pollen
of
a
distinct
variety
having
a
prepotent
effect
over
a
flower's
own
pollen
*punct* ;
and
that
this
is
part
of
the
general
law
of
good
being
derived
from
the
intercrossing
of
distinct
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* .
*break*
when
distinct
species
are
crossed
the
case
is
directly
the
reverse
*punct* ,
for
a
plant's
own
pollen
is
always
prepotent
over
foreign
pollen
*punct* ;
but
to
this
subject
we
shall
return
in
a
future
chapter
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
case
of
a
gigantic
tree
covered
with
innumerable
flowers
*punct* ,
it
may
be
objected
that
pollen
could
seldom
be
carried
from
tree
to
tree
*punct* ,
and
at
most
only
from
flower
to
flower
on
the
same
tree
*punct* ,
and
that
flowers
on
the
same
tree
can
be
considered
as
distinct
individuals
only
in
a
limited
sense
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
this
objection
to
be
valid
*punct* ,
but
that
nature
has
largely
provided
against
it
by
giving
to
trees
a
strong
tendency
to
bear
flowers
with
separated
sexes
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
sexes
are
separated
*punct* ,
although
the
male
and
female
flowers
may
be
produced
on
the
same
tree
*punct* ,
we
can
see
that
pollen
must
be
regularly
carried
from
flower
to
flower
*punct* ;
and
this
will
give
a
better
chance
of
pollen
being
occasionally
carried
from
tree
to
tree
*punct* .
*break*
that
trees
belonging
to
all
orders
have
their
sexes
more
often
separated
than
other
plants
*punct* ,
i
find
to
be
the
case
in
this
country
*punct* ;
and
at
my
request
dr.
hooker
tabulated
the
trees
of
new
zealand
*punct* ,
and
dr.
asa
gray
those
of
the
united
states
*punct* ,
and
the
result
was
as
i
anticipated
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
dr.
hooker
has
recently
informed
me
that
he
finds
that
the
rule
does
not
hold
in
australia
*punct* ;
and
i
have
made
these
few
remarks
on
the
sexes
of
trees
simply
to
call
attention
to
the
subject
*punct* .
*break*
turning
for
a
very
brief
space
to
animals
*punct* :
on
the
land
there
are
some
hermaphrodites
*punct* ,
as
land-mollusca
and
earth-worms
*punct* ;
but
these
all
pair
*punct* .
*break*
as
yet
i
have
not
found
a
single
case
of
a
terrestrial
animal
which
fertilises
itself
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
understand
this
remarkable
fact
*punct* ,
which
offers
so
strong
a
contrast
with
terrestrial
plants
*punct* ,
on
the
view
of
an
occasional
cross
being
indispensable
*punct* ,
by
considering
the
medium
in
which
terrestrial
animals
live
*punct* ,
and
the
nature
of
the
fertilising
element
*punct* ;
for
we
know
of
no
means
*punct* ,
analogous
to
the
action
of
insects
and
of
the
wind
in
the
case
of
plants
*punct* ,
by
which
an
occasional
cross
could
be
effected
with
terrestrial
animals
without
the
concurrence
of
two
individuals
*punct* .
*break*
of
aquatic
animals
*punct* ,
there
are
many
self-fertilising
hermaphrodites
*punct* ;
but
here
currents
in
the
water
offer
an
obvious
means
for
an
occasional
cross
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
as
in
the
case
of
flowers
*punct* ,
i
have
as
yet
failed
*punct* ,
after
consultation
with
one
of
the
highest
authorities
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
professor
huxley
*punct* ,
to
discover
a
single
case
of
an
hermaphrodite
animal
with
the
organs
of
reproduction
so
perfectly
enclosed
within
the
body
*punct* ,
that
access
from
without
and
the
occasional
influence
of
a
distinct
individual
can
be
shown
to
be
physically
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
cirripedes
long
appeared
to
me
to
present
a
case
of
very
great
difficulty
under
this
point
of
view
*punct* ;
but
i
have
been
enabled
*punct* ,
by
a
fortunate
chance
*punct* ,
elsewhere
to
prove
that
two
individuals
*punct* ,
though
both
are
self-fertilising
hermaphrodites
*punct* ,
do
sometimes
cross
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
have
struck
most
naturalists
as
a
strange
anomaly
that
*punct* ,
in
the
case
of
both
animals
and
plants
*punct* ,
species
of
the
same
family
and
even
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
though
agreeing
closely
with
each
other
in
almost
their
whole
organisation
*punct* ,
yet
are
not
rarely
*punct* ,
some
of
them
hermaphrodites
*punct* ,
and
some
of
them
unisexual
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
all
hermaphrodites
do
occasionally
intercross
with
other
individuals
*punct* ,
the
difference
between
hermaphrodites
and
unisexual
species
*punct* ,
as
far
as
function
is
concerned
*punct* ,
becomes
very
small
*punct* .
*break*
from
these
several
considerations
and
from
the
many
special
facts
which
i
have
collected
*punct* ,
but
which
i
am
not
here
able
to
give
*punct* ,
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
suspect
that
*punct* ,
both
in
the
vegetable
and
animal
kingdoms
*punct* ,
an
occasional
intercross
with
a
distinct
individual
is
a
law
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
well
aware
that
there
are
*punct* ,
on
this
view
*punct* ,
many
cases
of
difficulty
*punct* ,
some
of
which
i
am
trying
to
investigate
*punct* .
*break*
finally
then
*punct* ,
we
may
conclude
that
in
many
organic
beings
*punct* ,
a
cross
between
two
individuals
is
an
obvious
necessity
for
each
birth
*punct* ;
in
many
others
it
occurs
perhaps
only
at
long
intervals
*punct* ;
but
in
none
*punct* ,
as
i
suspect
*punct* ,
can
self-fertilisation
go
on
for
perpetuity
*punct* .
*break*
circumstances
favourable
to
natural
selection.
*punct* ,
this
is
an
extremely
intricate
subject
*punct* .
*break*
a
large
amount
of
inheritable
and
diversified
variability
is
favourable
*punct* ,
but
i
believe
mere
individual
differences
suffice
for
the
work
*punct* .
*break*
a
large
number
of
individuals
*punct* ,
by
giving
a
better
chance
for
the
appearance
within
any
given
period
of
profitable
variations
*punct* ,
will
compensate
for
a
lesser
amount
of
variability
in
each
individual
*punct* ,
and
is
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
an
extremely
important
element
of
success
*punct* .
*break*
though
nature
grants
vast
periods
of
time
for
the
work
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
she
does
not
grant
an
indefinite
period
*punct* ;
for
as
all
organic
beings
are
striving
*punct* ,
it
may
be
said
*punct* ,
to
seize
on
each
place
in
the
economy
of
nature
*punct* ,
if
any
one
species
does
not
become
modified
and
improved
in
a
corresponding
degree
with
its
competitors
*punct* ,
it
will
soon
be
exterminated
*punct* .
*break*
in
man's
methodical
selection
*punct* ,
a
breeder
selects
for
some
definite
object
*punct* ,
and
free
intercrossing
will
wholly
stop
his
work
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
many
men
*punct* ,
without
intending
to
alter
the
breed
*punct* ,
have
a
nearly
common
standard
of
perfection
*punct* ,
and
all
try
to
get
and
breed
from
the
best
animals
*punct* ,
much
improvement
and
modification
surely
but
slowly
follow
from
this
unconscious
process
of
selection
*punct* ,
notwithstanding
a
large
amount
of
crossing
with
inferior
animals
*punct* .
*break*
thus
it
will
be
in
nature
*punct* ;
for
within
a
confined
area
*punct* ,
with
some
place
in
its
polity
not
so
perfectly
occupied
as
might
be
*punct* ,
natural
selection
will
always
tend
to
preserve
all
the
individuals
varying
in
the
right
direction
*punct* ,
though
in
different
degrees
*punct* ,
so
as
better
to
fill
up
the
unoccupied
place
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
the
area
be
large
*punct* ,
its
several
districts
will
almost
certainly
present
different
conditions
of
life
*punct* ;
and
then
if
natural
selection
be
modifying
and
improving
a
species
in
the
several
districts
*punct* ,
there
will
be
intercrossing
with
the
other
individuals
of
the
same
species
on
the
confines
of
each
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
this
case
the
effects
of
intercrossing
can
hardly
be
counterbalanced
by
natural
selection
always
tending
to
modify
all
the
individuals
in
each
district
in
exactly
the
same
manner
to
the
conditions
of
each
*punct* ;
for
in
a
continuous
area
*punct* ,
the
conditions
will
generally
graduate
away
insensibly
from
one
district
to
another
*punct* .
*break*
the
intercrossing
will
most
affect
those
animals
which
unite
for
each
birth
*punct* ,
which
wander
much
*punct* ,
and
which
do
not
breed
at
a
very
quick
rate
*punct* .
*break*
hence
in
animals
of
this
nature
*punct* ,
for
instance
in
birds
*punct* ,
varieties
will
generally
be
confined
to
separated
countries
*punct* ;
and
this
i
believe
to
be
the
case
*punct* .
*break*
in
hermaphrodite
organisms
which
cross
only
occasionally
*punct* ,
and
likewise
in
animals
which
unite
for
each
birth
*punct* ,
but
which
wander
little
and
which
can
increase
at
a
very
rapid
rate
*punct* ,
a
new
and
improved
variety
might
be
quickly
formed
on
any
one
spot
*punct* ,
and
might
there
maintain
itself
in
a
body
*punct* ,
so
that
whatever
intercrossing
took
place
would
be
chiefly
between
the
individuals
of
the
same
new
variety
*punct* .
*break*
a
local
variety
when
once
thus
formed
might
subsequently
slowly
spread
to
other
districts
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
above
principle
*punct* ,
nurserymen
always
prefer
getting
seed
from
a
large
body
of
plants
of
the
same
variety
*punct* ,
as
the
chance
of
intercrossing
with
other
varieties
is
thus
lessened
*punct* .
*break*
even
in
the
case
of
slow-breeding
animals
*punct* ,
which
unite
for
each
birth
*punct* ,
we
must
not
overrate
the
effects
of
intercrosses
in
retarding
natural
selection
*punct* ;
for
i
can
bring
a
considerable
catalogue
of
facts
*punct* ,
showing
that
within
the
same
area
*punct* ,
varieties
of
the
same
animal
can
long
remain
distinct
*punct* ,
from
haunting
different
stations
*punct* ,
from
breeding
at
slightly
different
seasons
*punct* ,
or
from
varieties
of
the
same
kind
preferring
to
pair
together
*punct* .
*break*
intercrossing
plays
a
very
important
part
in
nature
in
keeping
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
or
of
the
same
variety
*punct* ,
true
and
uniform
in
character
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
obviously
thus
act
far
more
efficiently
with
those
animals
which
unite
for
each
birth
*punct* ;
but
i
have
already
attempted
to
show
that
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
occasional
intercrosses
take
place
with
all
animals
and
with
all
plants
*punct* .
*break*
even
if
these
take
place
only
at
long
intervals
*punct* ,
i
am
convinced
that
the
young
thus
produced
will
gain
so
much
in
vigour
and
fertility
over
the
offspring
from
long-continued
self-fertilisation
*punct* ,
that
they
will
have
a
better
chance
of
surviving
and
propagating
their
kind
*punct* ;
and
thus
*punct* ,
in
the
long
run
*punct* ,
the
influence
of
intercrosses
*punct* ,
even
at
rare
intervals
*punct* ,
will
be
great
*punct* .
*break*
if
there
exist
organic
beings
which
never
intercross
*punct* ,
uniformity
of
character
can
be
retained
amongst
them
*punct* ,
as
long
as
their
conditions
of
life
remain
the
same
*punct* ,
only
through
the
principle
of
inheritance
*punct* ,
and
through
natural
selection
destroying
any
which
depart
from
the
proper
type
*punct* ;
but
if
their
conditions
of
life
change
and
they
undergo
modification
*punct* ,
uniformity
of
character
can
be
given
to
their
modified
offspring
*punct* ,
solely
by
natural
selection
preserving
the
same
favourable
variations
*punct* .
*break*
isolation
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
is
an
important
element
in
the
process
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
confined
or
isolated
area
*punct* ,
if
not
very
large
*punct* ,
the
organic
and
inorganic
conditions
of
life
will
generally
be
in
a
great
degree
uniform
*punct* ;
so
that
natural
selection
will
tend
to
modify
all
the
individuals
of
a
varying
species
throughout
the
area
in
the
same
manner
in
relation
to
the
same
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
intercrosses
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
with
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
which
otherwise
would
have
inhabited
the
surrounding
and
differently
circumstanced
districts
*punct* ,
will
be
prevented
*punct* .
*break*
but
isolation
probably
acts
more
efficiently
in
checking
the
immigration
of
better
adapted
organisms
*punct* ,
after
any
physical
change
*punct* ,
such
as
of
climate
or
elevation
of
the
land
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ;
and
thus
new
places
in
the
natural
economy
of
the
country
are
left
open
for
the
old
inhabitants
to
struggle
for
*punct* ,
and
become
adapted
to
*punct* ,
through
modifications
in
their
structure
and
constitution
*punct* .
*break*
lastly
*punct* ,
isolation
*punct* ,
by
checking
immigration
and
consequently
competition
*punct* ,
will
give
time
for
any
new
variety
to
be
slowly
improved
*punct* ;
and
this
may
sometimes
be
of
importance
in
the
production
of
new
species
*punct* .
*break*
if
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
an
isolated
area
be
very
small
*punct* ,
either
from
being
surrounded
by
barriers
*punct* ,
or
from
having
very
peculiar
physical
conditions
*punct* ,
the
total
number
of
the
individuals
supported
on
it
will
necessarily
be
very
small
*punct* ;
and
fewness
of
individuals
will
greatly
retard
the
production
of
new
species
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
by
decreasing
the
chance
of
the
appearance
of
favourable
variations
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
turn
to
nature
to
test
the
truth
of
these
remarks
*punct* ,
and
look
at
any
small
isolated
area
*punct* ,
such
as
an
oceanic
island
*punct* ,
although
the
total
number
of
the
species
inhabiting
it
*punct* ,
will
be
found
to
be
small
*punct* ,
as
we
shall
see
in
our
chapter
on
geographical
distribution
*punct* ;
yet
of
these
species
a
very
large
proportion
are
endemic,
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
have
been
produced
there
*punct* ,
and
nowhere
else
*punct* .
*break*
hence
an
oceanic
island
at
first
sight
seems
to
have
been
highly
favourable
for
the
production
of
new
species
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
may
thus
greatly
deceive
ourselves
*punct* ,
for
to
ascertain
whether
a
small
isolated
area
*punct* ,
or
a
large
open
area
like
a
continent
*punct* ,
has
been
most
favourable
for
the
production
of
new
organic
forms
*punct* ,
we
ought
to
make
the
comparison
within
equal
times
*punct* ;
and
this
we
are
incapable
of
doing
*punct* .
*break*
although
i
do
not
doubt
that
isolation
is
of
considerable
importance
in
the
production
of
new
species
*punct* ,
on
the
whole
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
largeness
of
area
is
of
more
importance
*punct* ,
more
especially
in
the
production
of
species
*punct* ,
which
will
prove
capable
of
enduring
for
a
long
period
*punct* ,
and
of
spreading
widely
*punct* .
*break*
throughout
a
great
and
open
area
*punct* ,
not
only
will
there
be
a
better
chance
of
favourable
variations
arising
from
the
large
number
of
individuals
of
the
same
species
there
supported
*punct* ,
but
the
conditions
of
life
are
infinitely
complex
from
the
large
number
of
already
existing
species
*punct* ;
and
if
some
of
these
many
species
become
modified
and
improved
*punct* ,
others
will
have
to
be
improved
in
a
corresponding
degree
or
they
will
be
exterminated
*punct* .
*break*
each
new
form
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
it
has
been
much
improved
*punct* ,
will
be
able
to
spread
over
the
open
and
continuous
area
*punct* ,
and
will
thus
come
into
competition
with
many
others
*punct* .
*break*
hence
more
new
places
will
be
formed
*punct* ,
and
the
competition
to
fill
them
will
be
more
severe
*punct* ,
on
a
large
than
on
a
small
and
isolated
area
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
great
areas
*punct* ,
though
now
continuous
*punct* ,
owing
to
oscillations
of
level
*punct* ,
will
often
have
recently
existed
in
a
broken
condition
*punct* ,
so
that
the
good
effects
of
isolation
will
generally
*punct* ,
to
a
certain
extent
*punct* ,
have
concurred
*punct* .
*break*
finally
*punct* ,
i
conclude
that
*punct* ,
although
small
isolated
areas
probably
have
been
in
some
respects
highly
favourable
for
the
production
of
new
species
*punct* ,
yet
that
the
course
of
modification
will
generally
have
been
more
rapid
on
large
areas
*punct* ;
and
what
is
more
important
*punct* ,
that
the
new
forms
produced
on
large
areas
*punct* ,
which
already
have
been
victorious
over
many
competitors
*punct* ,
will
be
those
that
will
spread
most
widely
*punct* ,
will
give
rise
to
most
new
varieties
and
species
*punct* ,
and
will
thus
play
an
important
part
in
the
changing
history
of
the
organic
world
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
on
these
views
*punct* ,
understand
some
facts
which
will
be
again
alluded
to
in
our
chapter
on
geographical
distribution
*punct* ;
for
instance
*punct* ,
that
the
productions
of
the
smaller
continent
of
australia
have
formerly
yielded
*punct* ,
and
apparently
are
now
yielding
*punct* ,
before
those
of
the
larger
europaeo-asiatic
area
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
it
is
that
continental
productions
have
everywhere
become
so
largely
naturalised
on
islands
*punct* .
*break*
on
a
small
island
*punct* ,
the
race
for
life
will
have
been
less
severe
*punct* ,
and
there
will
have
been
less
modification
and
less
extermination
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
it
comes
that
the
flora
of
madeira
*punct* ,
according
to
oswald
heer
*punct* ,
resembles
the
extinct
tertiary
flora
of
europe
*punct* .
*break*
all
fresh-water
basins
*punct* ,
taken
together
*punct* ,
make
a
small
area
compared
with
that
of
the
sea
or
of
the
land
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
consequently
*punct* ,
the
competition
between
fresh-water
productions
will
have
been
less
severe
than
elsewhere
*punct* ;
new
forms
will
have
been
more
slowly
formed
*punct* ,
and
old
forms
more
slowly
exterminated
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
is
in
fresh
water
that
we
find
seven
genera
of
ganoid
fishes
*punct* ,
remnants
of
a
once
preponderant
order
*punct* :
and
in
fresh
water
we
find
some
of
the
most
anomalous
forms
now
known
in
the
world
*punct* ,
as
the
ornithorhynchus
and
lepidosiren
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
like
fossils
*punct* ,
connect
to
a
certain
extent
orders
now
widely
separated
in
the
natural
scale
*punct* .
*break*
these
anomalous
forms
may
almost
be
called
living
fossils
*punct* ;
they
have
endured
to
the
present
day
*punct* ,
from
having
inhabited
a
confined
area
*punct* ,
and
from
having
thus
been
exposed
to
less
severe
competition
*punct* .
*break*
to
sum
up
the
circumstances
favourable
and
unfavourable
to
natural
selection
*punct* ,
as
far
as
the
extreme
intricacy
of
the
subject
permits
*punct* .
*break*
i
conclude
*punct* ,
looking
to
the
future
*punct* ,
that
for
terrestrial
productions
a
large
continental
area
*punct* ,
which
will
probably
undergo
many
oscillations
of
level
*punct* ,
and
which
consequently
will
exist
for
long
periods
in
a
broken
condition
*punct* ,
will
be
the
most
favourable
for
the
production
of
many
new
forms
of
life
*punct* ,
likely
to
endure
long
and
to
spread
widely
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
area
will
first
have
existed
as
a
continent
*punct* ,
and
the
inhabitants
*punct* ,
at
this
period
numerous
in
individuals
and
kinds
*punct* ,
will
have
been
subjected
to
very
severe
competition
*punct* .
*break*
when
converted
by
subsidence
into
large
separate
islands
*punct* ,
there
will
still
exist
many
individuals
of
the
same
species
on
each
island
*punct* :
intercrossing
on
the
confines
of
the
range
of
each
species
will
thus
be
checked
*punct* :
after
physical
changes
of
any
kind
*punct* ,
immigration
will
be
prevented
*punct* ,
so
that
new
places
in
the
polity
of
each
island
will
have
to
be
filled
up
by
modifications
of
the
old
inhabitants
*punct* ;
and
time
will
be
allowed
for
the
varieties
in
each
to
become
well
modified
and
perfected
*punct* .
*break*
when
*punct* ,
by
renewed
elevation
*punct* ,
the
islands
shall
be
re-converted
into
a
continental
area
*punct* ,
there
will
again
be
severe
competition
*punct* :
the
most
favoured
or
improved
varieties
will
be
enabled
to
spread
*punct* :
there
will
be
much
extinction
of
the
less
improved
forms
*punct* ,
and
the
relative
proportional
numbers
of
the
various
inhabitants
of
the
renewed
continent
will
again
be
changed
*punct* ;
and
again
there
will
be
a
fair
field
for
natural
selection
to
improve
still
further
the
inhabitants
*punct* ,
and
thus
produce
new
species
*punct* .
*break*
that
natural
selection
will
always
act
with
extreme
slowness
*punct* ,
i
fully
admit
*punct* .
*break*
its
action
depends
on
there
being
places
in
the
polity
of
nature
*punct* ,
which
can
be
better
occupied
by
some
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
undergoing
modification
of
some
kind
*punct* .
*break*
the
existence
of
such
places
will
often
depend
on
physical
changes
*punct* ,
which
are
generally
very
slow
*punct* ,
and
on
the
immigration
of
better
adapted
forms
having
been
checked
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
action
of
natural
selection
will
probably
still
oftener
depend
on
some
of
the
inhabitants
becoming
slowly
modified
*punct* ;
the
mutual
relations
of
many
of
the
other
inhabitants
being
thus
disturbed
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
can
be
effected
*punct* ,
unless
favourable
variations
occur
*punct* ,
and
variation
itself
is
apparently
always
a
very
slow
process
*punct* .
*break*
the
process
will
often
be
greatly
retarded
by
free
intercrossing
*punct* .
*break*
many
will
exclaim
that
these
several
causes
are
amply
sufficient
wholly
to
stop
the
action
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
believe
so
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
i
do
believe
that
natural
selection
will
always
act
very
slowly
*punct* ,
often
only
at
long
intervals
of
time
*punct* ,
and
generally
on
only
a
very
few
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
same
region
at
the
same
time
*punct* .
*break*
i
further
believe
*punct* ,
that
this
very
slow
*punct* ,
intermittent
action
of
natural
selection
accords
perfectly
well
with
what
geology
tells
us
of
the
rate
and
manner
at
which
the
inhabitants
of
this
world
have
changed
*punct* .
*break*
slow
though
the
process
of
selection
may
be
*punct* ,
if
feeble
man
can
do
much
by
his
powers
of
artificial
selection
*punct* ,
i
can
see
no
limit
to
the
amount
of
change
*punct* ,
to
the
beauty
and
infinite
complexity
of
the
coadaptations
between
all
organic
beings
*punct* ,
one
with
another
and
with
their
physical
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
which
may
be
effected
in
the
long
course
of
time
by
nature's
power
of
selection
*punct* .
*break*
extinction.
*punct* ,
this
subject
will
be
more
fully
discussed
in
our
chapter
on
geology
*punct* ;
but
it
must
be
here
alluded
to
from
being
intimately
connected
with
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
natural
selection
acts
solely
through
the
preservation
of
variations
in
some
way
advantageous
*punct* ,
which
consequently
endure
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
from
the
high
geometrical
powers
of
increase
of
all
organic
beings
*punct* ,
each
area
is
already
fully
stocked
with
inhabitants
*punct* ,
it
follows
that
as
each
selected
and
favoured
form
increases
in
number
*punct* ,
so
will
the
less
favoured
forms
decrease
and
become
rare
*punct* .
*break*
rarity
*punct* ,
as
geology
tells
us
*punct* ,
is
the
precursor
to
extinction
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
see
that
any
form
represented
by
few
individuals
will
*punct* ,
during
fluctuations
in
the
seasons
or
in
the
number
of
its
enemies
*punct* ,
run
a
good
chance
of
utter
extinction
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
may
go
further
than
this
*punct* ;
for
as
new
forms
are
continually
and
slowly
being
produced
*punct* ,
unless
we
believe
that
the
number
of
specific
forms
goes
on
perpetually
and
almost
indefinitely
increasing
*punct* ,
numbers
inevitably
must
become
extinct
*punct* .
*break*
that
the
number
of
specific
forms
has
not
indefinitely
increased
*punct* ,
geology
shows
us
plainly
*punct* ;
and
indeed
we
can
see
reason
why
they
should
not
have
thus
increased
*punct* ,
for
the
number
of
places
in
the
polity
of
nature
is
not
indefinitely
great,
*punct* ,
not
that
we
have
any
means
of
knowing
that
any
one
region
has
as
yet
got
its
maximum
of
species
*punct* .
*break*
probably
no
region
is
as
yet
fully
stocked
*punct* ,
for
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
*punct* ,
where
more
species
of
plants
are
crowded
together
than
in
any
other
quarter
of
the
world
*punct* ,
some
foreign
plants
have
become
naturalised
*punct* ,
without
causing
*punct* ,
as
far
as
we
know
*punct* ,
the
extinction
of
any
natives
*punct* .
*break*
furthermore
*punct* ,
the
species
which
are
most
numerous
in
individuals
will
have
the
best
chance
of
producing
within
any
given
period
favourable
variations
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
evidence
of
this
*punct* ,
in
the
facts
given
in
the
second
chapter
*punct* ,
showing
that
it
is
the
common
species
which
afford
the
greatest
number
of
recorded
varieties
*punct* ,
or
incipient
species
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
rare
species
will
be
less
quickly
modified
or
improved
within
any
given
period
*punct* ,
and
they
will
consequently
be
beaten
in
the
race
for
life
by
the
modified
descendants
of
the
commoner
species
*punct* .
*break*
from
these
several
considerations
i
think
it
inevitably
follows
*punct* ,
that
as
new
species
in
the
course
of
time
are
formed
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
others
will
become
rarer
and
rarer
*punct* ,
and
finally
extinct
*punct* .
*break*
the
forms
which
stand
in
closest
competition
with
those
undergoing
modification
and
improvement
*punct* ,
will
naturally
suffer
most
*punct* .
*break*
and
we
have
seen
in
the
chapter
on
the
struggle
for
existence
that
it
is
the
most
closely-allied
forms,
*punct* ,
varieties
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
and
species
of
the
same
genus
or
of
related
genera,
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
from
having
nearly
the
same
structure
*punct* ,
constitution
*punct* ,
and
habits
*punct* ,
generally
come
into
the
severest
competition
with
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
consequently
*punct* ,
each
new
variety
or
species
*punct* ,
during
the
progress
of
its
formation
*punct* ,
will
generally
press
hardest
on
its
nearest
kindred
*punct* ,
and
tend
to
exterminate
them
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
the
same
process
of
extermination
amongst
our
domesticated
productions
*punct* ,
through
the
selection
of
improved
forms
by
man
*punct* .
*break*
many
curious
instances
could
be
given
showing
how
quickly
new
breeds
of
cattle
*punct* ,
sheep
*punct* ,
and
other
animals
*punct* ,
and
varieties
of
flowers
*punct* ,
take
the
place
of
older
and
inferior
kinds
*punct* .
*break*
in
yorkshire
*punct* ,
it
is
historically
known
that
the
ancient
black
cattle
were
displaced
by
the
long-horns
*punct* ,
and
that
these
were
swept
away
by
the
short-horns
*punct* ,
i
quote
the
words
of
an
agricultural
writer
*punct* ,
as
if
by
some
murderous
pestilence
*punct* .
*break*
divergence
of
character.
*punct* ,
the
principle
*punct* ,
which
i
have
designated
by
this
term
*punct* ,
is
of
high
importance
on
my
theory
*punct* ,
and
explains
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
several
important
facts
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
first
place
*punct* ,
varieties
*punct* ,
even
strongly-marked
ones
*punct* ,
though
having
somewhat
of
the
character
of
species
*punct* ,
as
is
shown
by
the
hopeless
doubts
in
many
cases
how
to
rank
them
*punct* ,
yet
certainly
differ
from
each
other
far
less
than
do
good
and
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
according
to
my
view
*punct* ,
varieties
are
species
in
the
process
of
formation
*punct* ,
or
are
*punct* ,
as
i
have
called
them
*punct* ,
incipient
species
*punct* .
*break*
how
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
does
the
lesser
difference
between
varieties
become
augmented
into
the
greater
difference
between
species
*punct* ?
*break*
that
this
does
habitually
happen
*punct* ,
we
must
infer
from
most
of
the
innumerable
species
throughout
nature
presenting
well-marked
differences
*punct* ;
whereas
varieties
*punct* ,
the
supposed
prototypes
and
parents
of
future
well-marked
species
*punct* ,
present
slight
and
ill-defined
differences
*punct* .
*break*
mere
chance
*punct* ,
as
we
may
call
it
*punct* ,
might
cause
one
variety
to
differ
in
some
character
from
its
parents
*punct* ,
and
the
offspring
of
this
variety
again
to
differ
from
its
parent
in
the
very
same
character
and
in
a
greater
degree
*punct* ;
but
this
alone
would
never
account
for
so
habitual
and
large
an
amount
of
difference
as
that
between
varieties
of
the
same
species
and
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* .
*break*
as
has
always
been
my
practice
*punct* ,
let
us
seek
light
on
this
head
from
our
domestic
productions
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
here
find
something
analogous
*punct* .
*break*
a
fancier
is
struck
by
a
pigeon
having
a
slightly
shorter
beak
*punct* ;
another
fancier
is
struck
by
a
pigeon
having
a
rather
longer
beak
*punct* ;
and
on
the
acknowledged
principle
that
fanciers
do
not
and
will
not
admire
a
medium
standard
*punct* ,
but
like
extremes
*punct* ,
they
both
go
on
*punct* ,
as
has
actually
occurred
with
tumbler-pigeons
*punct* ,
choosing
and
breeding
from
birds
with
longer
and
longer
beaks
*punct* ,
or
with
shorter
and
shorter
beaks
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
we
may
suppose
that
at
an
early
period
one
man
preferred
swifter
horses
*punct* ;
another
stronger
and
more
bulky
horses
*punct* .
*break*
the
early
differences
would
be
very
slight
*punct* ;
in
the
course
of
time
*punct* ,
from
the
continued
selection
of
swifter
horses
by
some
breeders
*punct* ,
and
of
stronger
ones
by
others
*punct* ,
the
differences
would
become
greater
*punct* ,
and
would
be
noted
as
forming
two
sub-breeds
*punct* ;
finally
*punct* ,
after
the
lapse
of
centuries
*punct* ,
the
sub-breeds
would
become
converted
into
two
well-established
and
distinct
breeds
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
differences
slowly
become
greater
*punct* ,
the
inferior
animals
with
intermediate
characters
*punct* ,
being
neither
very
swift
nor
very
strong
*punct* ,
will
have
been
neglected
*punct* ,
and
will
have
tended
to
disappear
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
we
see
in
man's
productions
the
action
of
what
may
be
called
the
principle
of
divergence
*punct* ,
causing
differences
*punct* ,
at
first
barely
appreciable
*punct* ,
steadily
to
increase
*punct* ,
and
the
breeds
to
diverge
in
character
both
from
each
other
and
from
their
common
parent
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
*punct* ,
it
may
be
asked
*punct* ,
can
any
analogous
principle
apply
in
nature
*punct* ?
*break*
i
believe
it
can
and
does
apply
most
efficiently
*punct* ,
from
the
simple
circumstance
that
the
more
diversified
the
descendants
from
any
one
species
become
in
structure
*punct* ,
constitution
*punct* ,
and
habits
*punct* ,
by
so
much
will
they
be
better
enabled
to
seize
on
many
and
widely
diversified
places
in
the
polity
of
nature
*punct* ,
and
so
be
enabled
to
increase
in
numbers
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
clearly
see
this
in
the
case
of
animals
with
simple
habits
*punct* .
*break*
take
the
case
of
a
carnivorous
quadruped
*punct* ,
of
which
the
number
that
can
be
supported
in
any
country
has
long
ago
arrived
at
its
full
average
*punct* .
*break*
if
its
natural
powers
of
increase
be
allowed
to
act
*punct* ,
it
can
succeed
in
increasing
*punct* ,
the
country
not
undergoing
any
change
in
its
conditions
*punct* ,
only
by
its
varying
descendants
seizing
on
places
at
present
occupied
by
other
animals
*punct* :
some
of
them
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
being
enabled
to
feed
on
new
kinds
of
prey
*punct* ,
either
dead
or
alive
*punct* ;
some
inhabiting
new
stations
*punct* ,
climbing
trees
*punct* ,
frequenting
water
*punct* ,
and
some
perhaps
becoming
less
carnivorous
*punct* .
*break*
the
more
diversified
in
habits
and
structure
the
descendants
of
our
carnivorous
animal
became
*punct* ,
the
more
places
they
would
be
enabled
to
occupy
*punct* .
*break*
what
applies
to
one
animal
will
apply
throughout
all
time
to
all
animals
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
if
they
vary
*punct* ,
for
otherwise
natural
selection
can
do
nothing
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
will
be
with
plants
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
been
experimentally
proved
*punct* ,
that
if
a
plot
of
ground
be
sown
with
several
distinct
genera
of
grasses
*punct* ,
a
greater
number
of
plants
and
a
greater
weight
of
dry
herbage
can
thus
be
raised
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
has
been
found
to
hold
good
when
first
one
variety
and
then
several
mixed
varieties
of
wheat
have
been
sown
on
equal
spaces
of
ground
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
if
any
one
species
of
grass
were
to
go
on
varying
*punct* ,
and
those
varieties
were
continually
selected
which
differed
from
each
other
in
at
all
the
same
manner
as
distinct
species
and
genera
of
grasses
differ
from
each
other
*punct* ,
a
greater
number
of
individual
plants
of
this
species
of
grass
*punct* ,
including
its
modified
descendants
*punct* ,
would
succeed
in
living
on
the
same
piece
of
ground
*punct* .
*break*
and
we
well
know
that
each
species
and
each
variety
of
grass
is
annually
sowing
almost
countless
seeds
*punct* ;
and
thus
*punct* ,
as
it
may
be
said
*punct* ,
is
striving
its
utmost
to
increase
its
numbers
*punct* .
*break*
consequently
*punct* ,
i
cannot
doubt
that
in
the
course
of
many
thousands
of
generations
*punct* ,
the
most
distinct
varieties
of
any
one
species
of
grass
would
always
have
the
best
chance
of
succeeding
and
of
increasing
in
numbers
*punct* ,
and
thus
of
supplanting
the
less
distinct
varieties
*punct* ;
and
varieties
*punct* ,
when
rendered
very
distinct
from
each
other
*punct* ,
take
the
rank
of
species
*punct* .
*break*
the
truth
of
the
principle
*punct* ,
that
the
greatest
amount
of
life
can
be
supported
by
great
diversification
of
structure
*punct* ,
is
seen
under
many
natural
circumstances
*punct* .
*break*
in
an
extremely
small
area
*punct* ,
especially
if
freely
open
to
immigration
*punct* ,
and
where
the
contest
between
individual
and
individual
must
be
severe
*punct* ,
we
always
find
great
diversity
in
its
inhabitants
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
i
found
that
a
piece
of
turf
*punct* ,
three
feet
by
four
in
size
*punct* ,
which
had
been
exposed
for
many
years
to
exactly
the
same
conditions
*punct* ,
supported
twenty
species
of
plants
*punct* ,
and
these
belonged
to
eighteen
genera
and
to
eight
orders
*punct* ,
which
shows
how
much
these
plants
differed
from
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
is
with
the
plants
and
insects
on
small
and
uniform
islets
*punct* ;
and
so
in
small
ponds
of
fresh
water
*punct* .
*break*
farmers
find
that
they
can
raise
most
food
by
a
rotation
of
plants
belonging
to
the
most
different
orders
*punct* :
nature
follows
what
may
be
called
a
simultaneous
rotation
*punct* .
*break*
most
of
the
animals
and
plants
which
live
close
round
any
small
piece
of
ground
*punct* ,
could
live
on
it
*punct* ,
supposing
it
not
to
be
in
any
way
peculiar
in
its
nature
*punct* ,
and
may
be
said
to
be
striving
to
the
utmost
to
live
there
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
it
is
seen
*punct* ,
that
where
they
come
into
the
closest
competition
with
each
other
*punct* ,
the
advantages
of
diversification
of
structure
*punct* ,
with
the
accompanying
differences
of
habit
and
constitution
*punct* ,
determine
that
the
inhabitants
*punct* ,
which
thus
jostle
each
other
most
closely
*punct* ,
shall
*punct* ,
as
a
general
rule
*punct* ,
belong
to
what
we
call
different
genera
and
orders
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
principle
is
seen
in
the
naturalisation
of
plants
through
man's
agency
in
foreign
lands
*punct* .
*break*
it
might
have
been
expected
that
the
plants
which
have
succeeded
in
becoming
naturalised
in
any
land
would
generally
have
been
closely
allied
to
the
indigenes
*punct* ;
for
these
are
commonly
looked
at
as
specially
created
and
adapted
for
their
own
country
*punct* .
*break*
it
might
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
perhaps
have
been
expected
that
naturalised
plants
would
have
belonged
to
a
few
groups
more
especially
adapted
to
certain
stations
in
their
new
homes
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
case
is
very
different
*punct* ;
and
alph
*punct* .
*break*
de
candolle
has
well
remarked
in
his
great
and
admirable
work
*punct* ,
that
floras
gain
by
naturalisation
*punct* ,
proportionally
with
the
number
of
the
native
genera
and
species
*punct* ,
far
more
in
new
genera
than
in
new
species
*punct* .
*break*
to
give
a
single
instance
*punct* :
in
the
last
edition
of
dr.
asa
gray's
manual
of
the
flora
of
the
northern
united
states
*punct* ,
260
naturalised
plants
are
enumerated
*punct* ,
and
these
belong
to
162
genera
*punct* .
*break*
we
thus
see
that
these
naturalised
plants
are
of
a
highly
diversified
nature
*punct* .
*break*
they
differ
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
to
a
large
extent
from
the
indigenes
*punct* ,
for
out
of
the
162
genera
*punct* ,
no
less
than
100
genera
are
not
there
indigenous
*punct* ,
and
thus
a
large
proportional
addition
is
made
to
the
genera
of
these
states
*punct* .
*break*
by
considering
the
nature
of
the
plants
or
animals
which
have
struggled
successfully
with
the
indigenes
of
any
country
*punct* ,
and
have
there
become
naturalised
*punct* ,
we
can
gain
some
crude
idea
in
what
manner
some
of
the
natives
would
have
had
to
be
modified
*punct* ,
in
order
to
have
gained
an
advantage
over
the
other
natives
*punct* ;
and
we
may
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
at
least
safely
infer
that
diversification
of
structure
*punct* ,
amounting
to
new
generic
differences
*punct* ,
would
have
been
profitable
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
advantage
of
diversification
in
the
inhabitants
of
the
same
region
is
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
the
same
as
that
of
the
physiological
division
of
labour
in
the
organs
of
the
same
individual
body
*punct* ,
a
subject
so
well
elucidated
by
milne
edwards
*punct* .
*break*
no
physiologist
doubts
that
a
stomach
by
being
adapted
to
digest
vegetable
matter
alone
*punct* ,
or
flesh
alone
*punct* ,
draws
most
nutriment
from
these
substances
*punct* .
*break*
so
in
the
general
economy
of
any
land
*punct* ,
the
more
widely
and
perfectly
the
animals
and
plants
are
diversified
for
different
habits
of
life
*punct* ,
so
will
a
greater
number
of
individuals
be
capable
of
there
supporting
themselves
*punct* .
*break*
a
set
of
animals
*punct* ,
with
their
organisation
but
little
diversified
*punct* ,
could
hardly
compete
with
a
set
more
perfectly
diversified
in
structure
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
be
doubted
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
whether
the
australian
marsupials
*punct* ,
which
are
divided
into
groups
differing
but
little
from
each
other
*punct* ,
and
feebly
representing
*punct* ,
as
mr.
waterhouse
and
others
have
remarked
*punct* ,
our
carnivorous
*punct* ,
ruminant
*punct* ,
and
rodent
mammals
*punct* ,
could
successfully
compete
with
these
well-pronounced
orders
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
australian
mammals
*punct* ,
we
see
the
process
of
diversification
in
an
early
and
incomplete
stage
of
development
*punct* .
*break*
after
the
foregoing
discussion
*punct* ,
which
ought
to
have
been
much
amplified
*punct* ,
we
may
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
assume
that
the
modified
descendants
of
any
one
species
will
succeed
by
so
much
the
better
as
they
become
more
diversified
in
structure
*punct* ,
and
are
thus
enabled
to
encroach
on
places
occupied
by
other
beings
*punct* .
*break*
now
let
us
see
how
this
principle
of
great
benefit
being
derived
from
divergence
of
character
*punct* ,
combined
with
the
principles
of
natural
selection
and
of
extinction
*punct* ,
will
tend
to
act
*punct* .
*break*
the
accompanying
diagram
will
aid
us
in
understanding
this
rather
perplexing
subject
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
said
a
large
genus
*punct* ,
because
we
have
seen
in
the
second
chapter
*punct* ,
that
on
an
average
more
of
the
species
of
large
genera
vary
than
of
small
genera
*punct* ;
and
the
varying
species
of
the
large
genera
present
a
greater
number
of
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
seen
that
the
species
*punct* ,
which
are
the
commonest
and
the
most
widely-diffused
*punct* ,
vary
more
than
rare
species
with
restricted
ranges
*punct* .
*break*
let
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
be
a
common
*punct* ,
widely-diffused
*punct* ,
and
varying
species
*punct* ,
belonging
to
a
genus
large
in
its
own
country
*punct* .
*break*
the
little
fan
of
diverging
dotted
lines
of
unequal
lengths
proceeding
from
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
may
represent
its
varying
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
the
variations
are
supposed
to
be
extremely
slight
*punct* ,
but
of
the
most
diversified
nature
*punct* ;
they
are
not
supposed
all
to
appear
simultaneously
*punct* ,
but
often
after
long
intervals
of
time
*punct* ;
nor
are
they
all
supposed
to
endure
for
equal
periods
*punct* .
*break*
only
those
variations
which
are
in
some
way
profitable
will
be
preserved
or
naturally
selected
*punct* .
*break*
and
here
the
importance
of
the
principle
of
benefit
being
derived
from
divergence
of
character
comes
in
*punct* ;
for
this
will
generally
lead
to
the
most
different
or
divergent
variations
*punct* ,
represented
by
the
outer
dotted
lines
*punct* ,
being
preserved
and
accumulated
by
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
when
a
dotted
line
reaches
one
of
the
horizontal
lines
*punct* ,
and
is
there
marked
by
a
small
numbered
letter
*punct* ,
a
sufficient
amount
of
variation
is
supposed
to
have
been
accumulated
to
have
formed
a
fairly
well-marked
variety
*punct* ,
such
as
would
be
thought
worthy
of
record
in
a
systematic
work
*punct* .
*break*
the
intervals
between
the
horizontal
lines
in
the
diagram
*punct* ,
may
represent
each
a
thousand
generations
*punct* ;
but
it
would
have
been
better
if
each
had
represented
ten
thousand
generations
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
thousand
generations
*punct* ,
species
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
is
supposed
to
have
produced
two
fairly
well-marked
varieties
*punct* ,
namely
a1
and
m1
*punct* .
*break*
these
two
varieties
will
generally
continue
to
be
exposed
to
the
same
conditions
which
made
their
parents
variable
*punct* ,
and
the
tendency
to
variability
is
in
itself
hereditary
*punct* ,
consequently
they
will
tend
to
vary
*punct* ,
and
generally
to
vary
in
nearly
the
same
manner
as
their
parents
varied
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
these
two
varieties
*punct* ,
being
only
slightly
modified
forms
*punct* ,
will
tend
to
inherit
those
advantages
which
made
their
common
parent
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
more
numerous
than
most
of
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
same
country
*punct* ;
they
will
likewise
partake
of
those
more
general
advantages
which
made
the
genus
to
which
the
parent-species
belonged
*punct* ,
a
large
genus
in
its
own
country
*punct* .
*break*
and
these
circumstances
we
know
to
be
favourable
to
the
production
of
new
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
if
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
these
two
varieties
be
variable
*punct* ,
the
most
divergent
of
their
variations
will
generally
be
preserved
during
the
next
thousand
generations
*punct* .
*break*
and
after
this
interval
*punct* ,
variety
a1
is
supposed
in
the
diagram
to
have
produced
variety
a2
*punct* ,
which
will
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
principle
of
divergence
*punct* ,
differ
more
from
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
than
did
variety
a1
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
continue
the
process
by
similar
steps
for
any
length
of
time
*punct* ;
some
of
the
varieties
*punct* ,
after
each
thousand
generations
*punct* ,
producing
only
a
single
variety
*punct* ,
but
in
a
more
and
more
modified
condition
*punct* ,
some
producing
two
or
three
varieties
*punct* ,
and
some
failing
to
produce
any
*punct* .
*break*
thus
the
varieties
or
modified
descendants
*punct* ,
proceeding
from
the
common
parent
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
will
generally
go
on
increasing
in
number
and
diverging
in
character
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
diagram
the
process
is
represented
up
to
the
ten-thousandth
generation
*punct* ,
and
under
a
condensed
and
simplified
form
up
to
the
fourteen-thousandth
generation
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
must
here
remark
that
i
do
not
suppose
that
the
process
ever
goes
on
so
regularly
as
is
represented
in
the
diagram
*punct* ,
though
in
itself
made
somewhat
irregular
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
far
from
thinking
that
the
most
divergent
varieties
will
invariably
prevail
and
multiply
*punct* :
a
medium
form
may
often
long
endure
*punct* ,
and
may
or
may
not
produce
more
than
one
modified
descendant
*punct* ;
for
natural
selection
will
always
act
according
to
the
nature
of
the
places
which
are
either
unoccupied
or
not
perfectly
occupied
by
other
beings
*punct* ;
and
this
will
depend
on
infinitely
complex
relations
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
a
general
rule
*punct* ,
the
more
diversified
in
structure
the
descendants
from
any
one
species
can
be
rendered
*punct* ,
the
more
places
they
will
be
enabled
to
seize
on
*punct* ,
and
the
more
their
modified
progeny
will
be
increased
*punct* .
*break*
in
our
diagram
the
line
of
succession
is
broken
at
regular
intervals
by
small
numbered
letters
marking
the
successive
forms
which
have
become
sufficiently
distinct
to
be
recorded
as
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
but
these
breaks
are
imaginary
*punct* ,
and
might
have
been
inserted
anywhere
*punct* ,
after
intervals
long
enough
to
have
allowed
the
accumulation
of
a
considerable
amount
of
divergent
variation
*punct* .
*break*
the
modified
offspring
from
the
later
and
more
highly
improved
branches
in
the
lines
of
descent
*punct* ,
will
*punct* ,
it
is
probable
*punct* ,
often
take
the
place
of
*punct* ,
and
so
destroy
*punct* ,
the
earlier
and
less
improved
branches
*punct* :
this
is
represented
in
the
diagram
by
some
of
the
lower
branches
not
reaching
to
the
upper
horizontal
lines
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
cases
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
process
of
modification
will
be
confined
to
a
single
line
of
descent
*punct* ,
and
the
number
of
the
descendants
will
not
be
increased
*punct* ;
although
the
amount
of
divergent
modification
may
have
been
increased
in
the
successive
generations
*punct* .
*break*
this
case
would
be
represented
in
the
diagram
*punct* ,
if
all
the
lines
proceeding
from
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
were
removed
*punct* ,
excepting
that
from
a1
to
a10
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
same
way
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
english
race-horse
and
english
pointer
have
apparently
both
gone
on
slowly
diverging
in
character
from
their
original
stocks
*punct* ,
without
either
having
given
off
any
fresh
branches
or
races
*punct* .
*break*
after
ten
thousand
generations
*punct* ,
species
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
is
supposed
to
have
produced
three
forms
*punct* ,
a10
*punct* ,
f10
*punct* ,
and
m10
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
from
having
diverged
in
character
during
the
successive
generations
*punct* ,
will
have
come
to
differ
largely
*punct* ,
but
perhaps
unequally
*punct* ,
from
each
other
and
from
their
common
parent
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
suppose
the
amount
of
change
between
each
horizontal
line
in
our
diagram
to
be
excessively
small
*punct* ,
these
three
forms
may
still
be
only
well-marked
varieties
*punct* ;
or
they
may
have
arrived
at
the
doubtful
category
of
sub-species
*punct* ;
but
we
have
only
to
suppose
the
steps
in
the
process
of
modification
to
be
more
numerous
or
greater
in
amount
*punct* ,
to
convert
these
three
forms
into
well-defined
species
*punct* :
thus
the
diagram
illustrates
the
steps
by
which
the
small
differences
distinguishing
varieties
are
increased
into
the
larger
differences
distinguishing
species
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
species
are
multiplied
and
genera
are
formed
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
large
genus
it
is
probable
that
more
than
one
species
would
vary
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
diagram
i
have
assumed
that
a
second
species
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
has
produced
*punct* ,
by
analogous
steps
*punct* ,
after
ten
thousand
generations
*punct* ,
either
two
well-marked
varieties
*punct* ,
w10
and
z10
*punct* ,
or
two
species
*punct* ,
according
to
the
amount
of
change
supposed
to
be
represented
between
the
horizontal
lines
*punct* .
*break*
after
fourteen
thousand
generations
*punct* ,
six
new
species
*punct* ,
marked
by
the
letters
n14
to
z14
*punct* ,
are
supposed
to
have
been
produced
*punct* .
*break*
in
each
genus
*punct* ,
the
species
*punct* ,
which
are
already
extremely
different
in
character
*punct* ,
will
generally
tend
to
produce
the
greatest
number
of
modified
descendants
*punct* ;
for
these
will
have
the
best
chance
of
filling
new
and
widely
different
places
in
the
polity
of
nature
*punct* :
hence
in
the
diagram
i
have
chosen
the
extreme
species
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
and
the
nearly
extreme
species
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
as
those
which
have
largely
varied
*punct* ,
and
have
given
rise
to
new
varieties
and
species
*punct* .
*break*
the
other
nine
species
*punct* ,
marked
by
capital
letters
*punct* ,
of
our
original
genus
*punct* ,
may
for
a
long
period
continue
transmitting
unaltered
descendants
*punct* ;
and
this
is
shown
in
the
diagram
by
the
dotted
lines
not
prolonged
far
upwards
from
want
of
space
*punct* .
*break*
but
during
the
process
of
modification
*punct* ,
represented
in
the
diagram
*punct* ,
another
of
our
principles
*punct* ,
namely
that
of
extinction
*punct* ,
will
have
played
an
important
part
*punct* .
*break*
as
in
each
fully
stocked
country
natural
selection
necessarily
acts
by
the
selected
form
having
some
advantage
in
the
struggle
for
life
over
other
forms
*punct* ,
there
will
be
a
constant
tendency
in
the
improved
descendants
of
any
one
species
to
supplant
and
exterminate
in
each
stage
of
descent
their
predecessors
and
their
original
parent
*punct* .
*break*
for
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
competition
will
generally
be
most
severe
between
those
forms
which
are
most
nearly
related
to
each
other
in
habits
*punct* ,
constitution
*punct* ,
and
structure
*punct* .
*break*
hence
all
the
intermediate
forms
between
the
earlier
and
later
states
*punct* ,
that
is
between
the
less
and
more
improved
state
of
a
species
*punct* ,
as
well
as
the
original
parent-species
itself
*punct* ,
will
generally
tend
to
become
extinct
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
probably
will
be
with
many
whole
collateral
lines
of
descent
*punct* ,
which
will
be
conquered
by
later
and
improved
lines
of
descent
*punct* .
*break*
if
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
the
modified
offspring
of
a
species
get
into
some
distinct
country
*punct* ,
or
become
quickly
adapted
to
some
quite
new
station
*punct* ,
in
which
child
and
parent
do
not
come
into
competition
*punct* ,
both
may
continue
to
exist
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
may
go
further
than
this
*punct* .
*break*
these
two
species
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
were
also
supposed
to
be
very
common
and
widely
diffused
species
*punct* ,
so
that
they
must
originally
have
had
some
advantage
over
most
of
the
other
species
of
the
genus
*punct* .
*break*
their
modified
descendants
*punct* ,
fourteen
in
number
at
the
fourteen-thousandth
generation
*punct* ,
will
probably
have
inherited
some
of
the
same
advantages
*punct* :
they
have
also
been
modified
and
improved
in
a
diversified
manner
at
each
stage
of
descent
*punct* ,
so
as
to
have
become
adapted
to
many
related
places
in
the
natural
economy
of
their
country
*punct* .
*break*
it
seems
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
to
me
extremely
probable
that
they
will
have
taken
the
places
of
*punct* ,
and
thus
exterminated
*punct* ,
not
only
their
parents
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
but
likewise
some
of
the
original
species
which
were
most
nearly
related
to
their
parents
*punct* .
*break*
hence
very
few
of
the
original
species
will
have
transmitted
offspring
to
the
fourteen-thousandth
generation
*punct* .
*break*
the
new
species
in
our
diagram
descended
from
the
original
eleven
species
*punct* ,
will
now
be
fifteen
in
number
*punct* .
*break*
owing
to
the
divergent
tendency
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
the
extreme
amount
of
difference
in
character
between
species
a14
and
z14
will
be
much
greater
than
that
between
the
most
different
of
the
original
eleven
species
*punct* .
*break*
the
new
species
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
will
be
allied
to
each
other
in
a
widely
different
manner
*punct* .
*break*
of
the
eight
descendants
from
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
the
three
marked
a14
*punct* ,
q14
*punct* ,
p14
*punct* ,
will
be
nearly
related
from
having
recently
branched
off
from
a10
*punct* ;
b14
and
f14
*punct* ,
from
having
diverged
at
an
earlier
period
from
a5
*punct* ,
will
be
in
some
degree
distinct
from
the
three
first-named
species
*punct* ;
and
lastly
*punct* ,
o14
*punct* ,
e14
*punct* ,
and
m14
*punct* ,
will
be
nearly
related
one
to
the
other
*punct* ,
but
from
having
diverged
at
the
first
commencement
of
the
process
of
modification
*punct* ,
will
be
widely
different
from
the
other
five
species
*punct* ,
and
may
constitute
a
sub-genus
or
even
a
distinct
genus
*punct* .
*break*
the
six
descendants
from
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
will
form
two
sub-genera
or
even
genera
*punct* .
*break*
hence
the
six
new
species
descended
from
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
and
the
eight
descended
from
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
will
have
to
be
ranked
as
very
distinct
genera
*punct* ,
or
even
as
distinct
sub-families
*punct* .
*break*
thus
it
is
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
that
two
or
more
genera
are
produced
by
descent
*punct* ,
with
modification
*punct* ,
from
two
or
more
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
two
or
more
parent-species
are
supposed
to
have
descended
from
some
one
species
of
an
earlier
genus
*punct* .
*break*
in
our
diagram
*punct* ,
this
is
indicated
by
the
broken
lines
*punct* ,
beneath
the
capital
letters
*punct* ,
converging
in
sub-branches
downwards
towards
a
single
point
*punct* ;
this
point
representing
a
single
species
*punct* ,
the
supposed
single
parent
of
our
several
new
sub-genera
and
genera
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
case
*punct* ,
its
affinities
to
the
other
fourteen
new
species
will
be
of
a
curious
and
circuitous
nature
*punct* .
*break*
having
descended
from
a
form
which
stood
between
the
two
parent-species
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
now
supposed
to
be
extinct
and
unknown
*punct* ,
it
will
be
in
some
degree
intermediate
in
character
between
the
two
groups
descended
from
these
species
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
these
two
groups
have
gone
on
diverging
in
character
from
the
type
of
their
parents
*punct* ,
the
new
species
*punct* ,
f14
*punct* ,
will
not
be
directly
intermediate
between
them
*punct* ,
but
rather
between
types
of
the
two
groups
*punct* ;
and
every
naturalist
will
be
able
to
bring
some
such
case
before
his
mind
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
diagram
*punct* ,
each
horizontal
line
has
hitherto
been
supposed
to
represent
a
thousand
generations
*punct* ,
but
each
may
represent
a
million
or
hundred
million
generations
*punct* ,
and
likewise
a
section
of
the
successive
strata
of
the
earth's
crust
including
extinct
remains
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
*punct* ,
when
we
come
to
our
chapter
on
geology
*punct* ,
have
to
refer
again
to
this
subject
*punct* ,
and
i
think
we
shall
then
see
that
the
diagram
throws
light
on
the
affinities
of
extinct
beings
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
though
generally
belonging
to
the
same
orders
*punct* ,
or
families
*punct* ,
or
genera
*punct* ,
with
those
now
living
*punct* ,
yet
are
often
*punct* ,
in
some
degree
*punct* ,
intermediate
in
character
between
existing
groups
*punct* ;
and
we
can
understand
this
fact
*punct* ,
for
the
extinct
species
lived
at
very
ancient
epochs
when
the
branching
lines
of
descent
had
diverged
less
*punct* .
*break*
i
see
no
reason
to
limit
the
process
of
modification
*punct* ,
as
now
explained
*punct* ,
to
the
formation
of
genera
alone
*punct* .
*break*
if
*punct* ,
in
our
diagram
*punct* ,
we
suppose
the
amount
of
change
represented
by
each
successive
group
of
diverging
dotted
lines
to
be
very
great
*punct* ,
the
forms
marked
a14
to
p14
*punct* ,
those
marked
b14
and
f14
*punct* ,
and
those
marked
o14
to
m14
*punct* ,
will
form
three
very
distinct
genera
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
also
have
two
very
distinct
genera
descended
from
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
and
as
these
latter
two
genera
*punct* ,
both
from
continued
divergence
of
character
and
from
inheritance
from
a
different
parent
*punct* ,
will
differ
widely
from
the
three
genera
descended
from
*punct* ,
a
*punct* ,
the
two
little
groups
of
genera
will
form
two
distinct
families
*punct* ,
or
even
orders
*punct* ,
according
to
the
amount
of
divergent
modification
supposed
to
be
represented
in
the
diagram
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
two
new
families
*punct* ,
or
orders
*punct* ,
will
have
descended
from
two
species
of
the
original
genus
*punct* ;
and
these
two
species
are
supposed
to
have
descended
from
one
species
of
a
still
more
ancient
and
unknown
genus
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
seen
that
in
each
country
it
is
the
species
of
the
larger
genera
which
oftenest
present
varieties
or
incipient
species
*punct* .
*break*
this
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
might
have
been
expected
*punct* ;
for
as
natural
selection
acts
through
one
form
having
some
advantage
over
other
forms
in
the
struggle
for
existence
*punct* ,
it
will
chiefly
act
on
those
which
already
have
some
advantage
*punct* ;
and
the
largeness
of
any
group
shows
that
its
species
have
inherited
from
a
common
ancestor
some
advantage
in
common
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
the
struggle
for
the
production
of
new
and
modified
descendants
*punct* ,
will
mainly
lie
between
the
larger
groups
*punct* ,
which
are
all
trying
to
increase
in
number
*punct* .
*break*
one
large
group
will
slowly
conquer
another
large
group
*punct* ,
reduce
its
numbers
*punct* ,
and
thus
lessen
its
chance
of
further
variation
and
improvement
*punct* .
*break*
within
the
same
large
group
*punct* ,
the
later
and
more
highly
perfected
sub-groups
*punct* ,
from
branching
out
and
seizing
on
many
new
places
in
the
polity
of
nature
*punct* ,
will
constantly
tend
to
supplant
and
destroy
the
earlier
and
less
improved
sub-groups
*punct* .
*break*
small
and
broken
groups
and
sub-groups
will
finally
tend
to
disappear
*punct* .
*break*
looking
to
the
future
*punct* ,
we
can
predict
that
the
groups
of
organic
beings
which
are
now
large
and
triumphant
*punct* ,
and
which
are
least
broken
up
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
which
as
yet
have
suffered
least
extinction
*punct* ,
will
for
a
long
period
continue
to
increase
*punct* .
*break*
looking
still
more
remotely
to
the
future
*punct* ,
we
may
predict
that
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
continued
and
steady
increase
of
the
larger
groups
*punct* ,
a
multitude
of
smaller
groups
will
become
utterly
extinct
*punct* ,
and
leave
no
modified
descendants
*punct* ;
and
consequently
that
of
the
species
living
at
any
one
period
*punct* ,
extremely
few
will
transmit
descendants
to
a
remote
futurity
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
have
to
return
to
this
subject
in
the
chapter
on
classification
*punct* ,
but
i
may
add
that
on
this
view
of
extremely
few
of
the
more
ancient
species
having
transmitted
descendants
*punct* ,
and
on
the
view
of
all
the
descendants
of
the
same
species
making
a
class
*punct* ,
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
there
exist
but
very
few
classes
in
each
main
division
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
*punct* .
*break*
although
extremely
few
of
the
most
ancient
species
may
now
have
living
and
modified
descendants
*punct* ,
yet
at
the
most
remote
geological
period
*punct* ,
the
earth
may
have
been
as
well
peopled
with
many
species
of
many
genera
*punct* ,
families
*punct* ,
orders
*punct* ,
and
classes
*punct* ,
as
at
the
present
day
*punct* .
*break*
summary
of
chapter
*punct* ,
if
during
the
long
course
of
ages
and
under
varying
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
organic
beings
vary
at
all
in
the
several
parts
of
their
organisation
*punct* ,
and
i
think
this
cannot
be
disputed
*punct* ;
if
there
be
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
high
geometrical
powers
of
increase
of
each
species
*punct* ,
at
some
age
*punct* ,
season
*punct* ,
or
year
*punct* ,
a
severe
struggle
for
life
*punct* ,
and
this
certainly
cannot
be
disputed
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
considering
the
infinite
complexity
of
the
relations
of
all
organic
beings
to
each
other
and
to
their
conditions
of
existence
*punct* ,
causing
an
infinite
diversity
in
structure
*punct* ,
constitution
*punct* ,
and
habits
*punct* ,
to
be
advantageous
to
them
*punct* ,
i
think
it
would
be
a
most
extraordinary
fact
if
no
variation
ever
had
occurred
useful
to
each
being's
own
welfare
*punct* ,
in
the
same
way
as
so
many
variations
have
occurred
useful
to
man
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
variations
useful
to
any
organic
being
do
occur
*punct* ,
assuredly
individuals
thus
characterised
will
have
the
best
chance
of
being
preserved
in
the
struggle
for
life
*punct* ;
and
from
the
strong
principle
of
inheritance
they
will
tend
to
produce
offspring
similarly
characterised
*punct* .
*break*
this
principle
of
preservation
*punct* ,
i
have
called
*punct* ,
for
the
sake
of
brevity
*punct* ,
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
natural
selection
*punct* ,
on
the
principle
of
qualities
being
inherited
at
corresponding
ages
*punct* ,
can
modify
the
egg
*punct* ,
seed
*punct* ,
or
young
*punct* ,
as
easily
as
the
adult
*punct* .
*break*
amongst
many
animals
*punct* ,
sexual
selection
will
give
its
aid
to
ordinary
selection
*punct* ,
by
assuring
to
the
most
vigorous
and
best
adapted
males
the
greatest
number
of
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
sexual
selection
will
also
give
characters
useful
to
the
males
alone
*punct* ,
in
their
struggles
with
other
males
*punct* .
*break*
whether
natural
selection
has
really
thus
acted
in
nature
*punct* ,
in
modifying
and
adapting
the
various
forms
of
life
to
their
several
conditions
and
stations
*punct* ,
must
be
judged
of
by
the
general
tenour
and
balance
of
evidence
given
in
the
following
chapters
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
already
see
how
it
entails
extinction
*punct* ;
and
how
largely
extinction
has
acted
in
the
world's
history
*punct* ,
geology
plainly
declares
*punct* .
*break*
natural
selection
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
leads
to
divergence
of
character
*punct* ;
for
more
living
beings
can
be
supported
on
the
same
area
the
more
they
diverge
in
structure
*punct* ,
habits
*punct* ,
and
constitution
*punct* ,
of
which
we
see
proof
by
looking
at
the
inhabitants
of
any
small
spot
or
at
naturalised
productions
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
during
the
modification
of
the
descendants
of
any
one
species
*punct* ,
and
during
the
incessant
struggle
of
all
species
to
increase
in
numbers
*punct* ,
the
more
diversified
these
descendants
become
*punct* ,
the
better
will
be
their
chance
of
succeeding
in
the
battle
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
thus
the
small
differences
distinguishing
varieties
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
will
steadily
tend
to
increase
till
they
come
to
equal
the
greater
differences
between
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
or
even
of
distinct
genera
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
seen
that
it
is
the
common
*punct* ,
the
widely-diffused
*punct* ,
and
widely-ranging
species
*punct* ,
belonging
to
the
larger
genera
*punct* ,
which
vary
most
*punct* ;
and
these
will
tend
to
transmit
to
their
modified
offspring
that
superiority
which
now
makes
them
dominant
in
their
own
countries
*punct* .
*break*
natural
selection
*punct* ,
as
has
just
been
remarked
*punct* ,
leads
to
divergence
of
character
and
to
much
extinction
of
the
less
improved
and
intermediate
forms
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
on
these
principles
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
the
nature
of
the
affinities
of
all
organic
beings
may
be
explained
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
truly
wonderful
fact
*punct* ,
the
wonder
of
which
we
are
apt
to
overlook
from
familiarity
*punct* ,
that
all
animals
and
all
plants
throughout
all
time
and
space
should
be
related
to
each
other
in
group
subordinate
to
group
*punct* ,
in
the
manner
which
we
everywhere
behold
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
varieties
of
the
same
species
most
closely
related
together
*punct* ,
species
of
the
same
genus
less
closely
and
unequally
related
together
*punct* ,
forming
sections
and
sub-genera
*punct* ,
species
of
distinct
genera
much
less
closely
related
*punct* ,
and
genera
related
in
different
degrees
*punct* ,
forming
sub-families
*punct* ,
families
*punct* ,
orders
*punct* ,
sub-classes
*punct* ,
and
classes
*punct* .
*break*
the
several
subordinate
groups
in
any
class
cannot
be
ranked
in
a
single
file
*punct* ,
but
seem
rather
to
be
clustered
round
points
*punct* ,
and
these
round
other
points
*punct* ,
and
so
on
in
almost
endless
cycles
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
view
that
each
species
has
been
independently
created
*punct* ,
i
can
see
no
explanation
of
this
great
fact
in
the
classification
of
all
organic
beings
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
*punct* ,
it
is
explained
through
inheritance
and
the
complex
action
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
entailing
extinction
and
divergence
of
character
*punct* ,
as
we
have
seen
illustrated
in
the
diagram
*punct* .
*break*
the
affinities
of
all
the
beings
of
the
same
class
have
sometimes
been
represented
by
a
great
tree
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
this
simile
largely
speaks
the
truth
*punct* .
*break*
the
green
and
budding
twigs
may
represent
existing
species
*punct* ;
and
those
produced
during
each
former
year
may
represent
the
long
succession
of
extinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
at
each
period
of
growth
all
the
growing
twigs
have
tried
to
branch
out
on
all
sides
*punct* ,
and
to
overtop
and
kill
the
surrounding
twigs
and
branches
*punct* ,
in
the
same
manner
as
species
and
groups
of
species
have
tried
to
overmaster
other
species
in
the
great
battle
for
life
*punct* .
*break*
the
limbs
divided
into
great
branches
*punct* ,
and
these
into
lesser
and
lesser
branches
*punct* ,
were
themselves
once
*punct* ,
when
the
tree
was
small
*punct* ,
budding
twigs
*punct* ;
and
this
connexion
of
the
former
and
present
buds
by
ramifying
branches
may
well
represent
the
classification
of
all
extinct
and
living
species
in
groups
subordinate
to
groups
*punct* .
*break*
of
the
many
twigs
which
flourished
when
the
tree
was
a
mere
bush
*punct* ,
only
two
or
three
*punct* ,
now
grown
into
great
branches
*punct* ,
yet
survive
and
bear
all
the
other
branches
*punct* ;
so
with
the
species
which
lived
during
long-past
geological
periods
*punct* ,
very
few
now
have
living
and
modified
descendants
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
first
growth
of
the
tree
*punct* ,
many
a
limb
and
branch
has
decayed
and
dropped
off
*punct* ;
and
these
lost
branches
of
various
sizes
may
represent
those
whole
orders
*punct* ,
families
*punct* ,
and
genera
which
have
now
no
living
representatives
*punct* ,
and
which
are
known
to
us
only
from
having
been
found
in
a
fossil
state
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
here
and
there
see
a
thin
straggling
branch
springing
from
a
fork
low
down
in
a
tree
*punct* ,
and
which
by
some
chance
has
been
favoured
and
is
still
alive
on
its
summit
*punct* ,
so
we
occasionally
see
an
animal
like
the
ornithorhynchus
or
lepidosiren
*punct* ,
which
in
some
small
degree
connects
by
its
affinities
two
large
branches
of
life
*punct* ,
and
which
has
apparently
been
saved
from
fatal
competition
by
having
inhabited
a
protected
station
*punct* .
*break*
as
buds
give
rise
by
growth
to
fresh
buds
*punct* ,
and
these
*punct* ,
if
vigorous
*punct* ,
branch
out
and
overtop
on
all
sides
many
a
feebler
branch
*punct* ,
so
by
generation
i
believe
it
has
been
with
the
great
tree
of
life
*punct* ,
which
fills
with
its
dead
and
broken
branches
the
crust
of
the
earth
*punct* ,
and
covers
the
surface
with
its
ever
branching
and
beautiful
ramifications
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
hitherto
sometimes
spoken
as
if
the
variations
*punct* ,
so
common
and
multiform
in
organic
beings
under
domestication
*punct* ,
and
in
a
lesser
degree
in
those
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
had
been
due
to
chance
*punct* .
*break*
this
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
is
a
wholly
incorrect
expression
*punct* ,
but
it
serves
to
acknowledge
plainly
our
ignorance
of
the
cause
of
each
particular
variation
*punct* .
*break*
some
authors
believe
it
to
be
as
much
the
function
of
the
reproductive
system
to
produce
individual
differences
*punct* ,
or
very
slight
deviations
of
structure
*punct* ,
as
to
make
the
child
like
its
parents
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
much
greater
variability
*punct* ,
as
well
as
the
greater
frequency
of
monstrosities
*punct* ,
under
domestication
or
cultivation
*punct* ,
than
under
nature
*punct* ,
leads
me
to
believe
that
deviations
of
structure
are
in
some
way
due
to
the
nature
of
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
to
which
the
parents
and
their
more
remote
ancestors
have
been
exposed
during
several

*break*
i
have
remarked
in
the
first
chapter
*punct* ,
but
a
long
catalogue
of
facts
which
cannot
be
here
given
would
be
necessary
to
show
the
truth
of
the
remark
*punct* ,
that
the
reproductive
system
is
eminently
susceptible
to
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* ;
and
to
this
system
being
functionally
disturbed
in
the
parents
*punct* ,
i
chiefly
attribute
the
varying
or
plastic
condition
of
the
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
the
male
and
female
sexual
elements
seem
to
be
affected
before
that
union
takes
place
which
is
to
form
a
new
being
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
case
of
sporting
plants
*punct* ,
the
bud
*punct* ,
which
in
its
earliest
condition
does
not
apparently
differ
essentially
from
an
ovule
*punct* ,
is
alone
affected
*punct* .
*break*
but
why
*punct* ,
because
the
reproductive
system
is
disturbed
*punct* ,
this
or
that
part
should
vary
more
or
less
*punct* ,
we
are
profoundly
ignorant
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
we
can
here
and
there
dimly
catch
a
faint
ray
of
light
*punct* ,
and
we
may
feel
sure
that
there
must
be
some
cause
for
each
deviation
of
structure
*punct* ,
however
slight
*punct* .
*break*
how
much
direct
effect
difference
of
climate
*punct* ,
food
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
produces
on
any
being
is
extremely
doubtful
*punct* .
*break*
my
impression
is
*punct* ,
that
the
effect
is
extremely
small
in
the
case
of
animals
*punct* ,
but
perhaps
rather
more
in
that
of
plants
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
safely
conclude
that
such
influences
cannot
have
produced
the
many
striking
and
complex
co-adaptations
of
structure
between
one
organic
being
and
another
*punct* ,
which
we
see
everywhere
throughout
nature
*punct* .
*break*
forbes
speaks
confidently
that
shells
at
their
southern
limit
*punct* ,
and
when
living
in
shallow
water
*punct* ,
are
more
brightly
coloured
than
those
of
the
same
species
further
north
or
from
greater
depths
*punct* .
*break*
gould
believes
that
birds
of
the
same
species
are
more
brightly
coloured
under
a
clear
atmosphere
*punct* ,
than
when
living
on
islands
or
near
the
coast
*punct* .
*break*
so
with
insects
*punct* ,
wollaston
is
convinced
that
residence
near
the
sea
affects
their
colours
*punct* .
*break*
moquin-tandon
gives
a
list
of
plants
which
when
growing
near
the
sea-shore
have
their
leaves
in
some
degree
fleshy
*punct* ,
though
not
elsewhere
fleshy
*punct* .
*break*
several
other
such
cases
could
be
given
*punct* .
*break*
the
fact
of
varieties
of
one
species
*punct* ,
when
they
range
into
the
zone
of
habitation
of
other
species
*punct* ,
often
acquiring
in
a
very
slight
degree
some
of
the
characters
of
such
species
*punct* ,
accords
with
our
view
that
species
of
all
kinds
are
only
well-marked
and
permanent
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
thus
the
species
of
shells
which
are
confined
to
tropical
and
shallow
seas
are
generally
brighter-coloured
than
those
confined
to
cold
and
deeper
seas
*punct* .
*break*
the
birds
which
are
confined
to
continents
are
*punct* ,
according
to
mr.
gould
*punct* ,
brighter-coloured
than
those
of
islands
*punct* .
*break*
the
insect-species
confined
to
sea-coasts
*punct* ,
as
every
collector
knows
*punct* ,
are
often
brassy
or
lurid
*punct* .
*break*
plants
which
live
exclusively
on
the
sea-side
are
very
apt
to
have
fleshy
leaves
*punct* .
*break*
he
who
believes
in
the
creation
of
each
species
*punct* ,
will
have
to
say
that
this
shell
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
was
created
with
bright
colours
for
a
warm
sea
*punct* ;
but
that
this
other
shell
became
bright-coloured
by
variation
when
it
ranged
into
warmer
or
shallower
waters
*punct* .
*break*
when
a
variation
is
of
the
slightest
use
to
a
being
*punct* ,
we
cannot
tell
how
much
of
it
to
attribute
to
the
accumulative
action
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
and
how
much
to
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
it
is
well
known
to
furriers
that
animals
of
the
same
species
have
thicker
and
better
fur
the
more
severe
the
climate
is
under
which
they
have
lived
*punct* ;
but
who
can
tell
how
much
of
this
difference
may
be
due
to
the
warmest-clad
individuals
having
been
favoured
and
preserved
during
many
generations
*punct* ,
and
how
much
to
the
direct
action
of
the
severe
climate
*punct* ?
*break*
for
it
would
appear
that
climate
has
some
direct
action
on
the
hair
of
our
domestic
quadrupeds
*punct* .
*break*
instances
could
be
given
of
the
same
variety
being
produced
under
conditions
of
life
as
different
as
can
well
be
conceived
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
of
different
varieties
being
produced
from
the
same
species
under
the
same
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
such
facts
show
how
indirectly
the
conditions
of
life
must
act
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
innumerable
instances
are
known
to
every
naturalist
of
species
keeping
true
*punct* ,
or
not
varying
at
all
*punct* ,
although
living
under
the
most
opposite
climates
*punct* .
*break*
such
considerations
as
these
incline
me
to
lay
very
little
weight
on
the
direct
action
of
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
indirectly
*punct* ,
as
already
remarked
*punct* ,
they
seem
to
play
an
important
part
in
affecting
the
reproductive
system
*punct* ,
and
in
thus
inducing
variability
*punct* ;
and
natural
selection
will
then
accumulate
all
profitable
variations
*punct* ,
however
slight
*punct* ,
until
they
become
plainly
developed
and
appreciable
by
us
*punct* .
*break*
effects
of
use
and
disuse.
*punct* ,
from
the
facts
alluded
to
in
the
first
chapter
*punct* ,
i
think
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
use
in
our
domestic
animals
strengthens
and
enlarges
certain
parts
*punct* ,
and
disuse
diminishes
them
*punct* ;
and
that
such
modifications
are
inherited
*punct* .
*break*
under
free
nature
*punct* ,
we
can
have
no
standard
of
comparison
*punct* ,
by
which
to
judge
of
the
effects
of
long-continued
use
or
disuse
*punct* ,
for
we
know
not
the
parent-forms
*punct* ;
but
many
animals
have
structures
which
can
be
explained
by
the
effects
of
disuse
*punct* .
*break*
as
professor
owen
has
remarked
*punct* ,
there
is
no
greater
anomaly
in
nature
than
a
bird
that
cannot
fly
*punct* ;
yet
there
are
several
in
this
state
*punct* .
*break*
the
logger-headed
duck
of
south
america
can
only
flap
along
the
surface
of
the
water
*punct* ,
and
has
its
wings
in
nearly
the
same
condition
as
the
domestic
aylesbury
duck
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
larger
ground-feeding
birds
seldom
take
flight
except
to
escape
danger
*punct* ,
i
believe
that
the
nearly
wingless
condition
of
several
birds
*punct* ,
which
now
inhabit
or
have
lately
inhabited
several
oceanic
islands
*punct* ,
tenanted
by
no
beast
of
prey
*punct* ,
has
been
caused
by
disuse
*punct* .
*break*
the
ostrich
indeed
inhabits
continents
and
is
exposed
to
danger
from
which
it
cannot
escape
by
flight
*punct* ,
but
by
kicking
it
can
defend
itself
from
enemies
*punct* ,
as
well
as
any
of
the
smaller
quadrupeds
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
imagine
that
the
early
progenitor
of
the
ostrich
had
habits
like
those
of
a
bustard
*punct* ,
and
that
as
natural
selection
increased
in
successive
generations
the
size
and
weight
of
its
body
*punct* ,
its
legs
were
used
more
*punct* ,
and
its
wings
less
*punct* ,
until
they
became
incapable
of
flight
*punct* .
*break*
kirby
has
remarked
*punct* ,
and
i
have
observed
the
same
fact
*punct* ,
that
the
anterior
tarsi
*punct* ,
or
feet
*punct* ,
of
many
male
dung-feeding
beetles
are
very
often
broken
off
*punct* ;
he
examined
seventeen
specimens
in
his
own
collection
*punct* ,
and
not
one
had
even
a
relic
left
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
onites
apelles
the
tarsi
are
so
habitually
lost
*punct* ,
that
the
insect
has
been
described
as
not
having
them
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
other
genera
they
are
present
*punct* ,
but
in
a
rudimentary
condition
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
ateuchus
or
sacred
beetle
of
the
egyptians
*punct* ,
they
are
totally
deficient
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
to
induce
us
to
believe
that
mutilations
are
ever
inherited
*punct* ;
and
i
should
prefer
explaining
the
entire
absence
of
the
anterior
tarsi
in
ateuchus
*punct* ,
and
their
rudimentary
condition
in
some
other
genera
*punct* ,
by
the
long-continued
effects
of
disuse
in
their
progenitors
*punct* ;
for
as
the
tarsi
are
almost
always
lost
in
many
dung-feeding
beetles
*punct* ,
they
must
be
lost
early
in
life
*punct* ,
and
therefore
cannot
be
much
used
by
these
insects
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
cases
we
might
easily
put
down
to
disuse
modifications
of
structure
which
are
wholly
*punct* ,
or
mainly
*punct* ,
due
to
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
wollaston
has
discovered
the
remarkable
fact
that
200
beetles
*punct* ,
out
of
the
550
species
inhabiting
madeira
*punct* ,
are
so
far
deficient
in
wings
that
they
cannot
fly
*punct* ;
and
that
of
the
twenty-nine
endemic
genera
*punct* ,
no
less
than
twenty-three
genera
have
all
their
species
in
this
condition
*punct* !
*break*
several
facts
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
beetles
in
many
parts
of
the
world
are
very
frequently
blown
to
sea
and
perish
*punct* ;
that
the
beetles
in
madeira
*punct* ,
as
observed
by
mr.
wollaston
*punct* ,
lie
much
concealed
*punct* ,
until
the
wind
lulls
and
the
sun
shines
*punct* ;
that
the
proportion
of
wingless
beetles
is
larger
on
the
exposed
dezertas
than
in
madeira
itself
*punct* ;
and
especially
the
extraordinary
fact
*punct* ,
so
strongly
insisted
on
by
mr.
wollaston
*punct* ,
of
the
almost
entire
absence
of
certain
large
groups
of
beetles
*punct* ,
elsewhere
excessively
numerous
*punct* ,
and
which
groups
have
habits
of
life
almost
necessitating
frequent
flight;
*punct* ,
these
several
considerations
have
made
me
believe
that
the
wingless
condition
of
so
many
madeira
beetles
is
mainly
due
to
the
action
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
but
combined
probably
with
disuse
*punct* .
*break*
for
during
thousands
of
successive
generations
each
individual
beetle
which
flew
least
*punct* ,
either
from
its
wings
having
been
ever
so
little
less
perfectly
developed
or
from
indolent
habit
*punct* ,
will
have
had
the
best
chance
of
surviving
from
not
being
blown
out
to
sea
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
those
beetles
which
most
readily
took
to
flight
will
oftenest
have
been
blown
to
sea
and
thus
have
been
destroyed
*punct* .
*break*
the
insects
in
madeira
which
are
not
ground-feeders
*punct* ,
and
which
*punct* ,
as
the
flower-feeding
coleoptera
and
lepidoptera
*punct* ,
must
habitually
use
their
wings
to
gain
their
subsistence
*punct* ,
have
*punct* ,
as
mr.
wollaston
suspects
*punct* ,
their
wings
not
at
all
reduced
*punct* ,
but
even
enlarged
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
quite
compatible
with
the
action
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
for
when
a
new
insect
first
arrived
on
the
island
*punct* ,
the
tendency
of
natural
selection
to
enlarge
or
to
reduce
the
wings
*punct* ,
would
depend
on
whether
a
greater
number
of
individuals
were
saved
by
successfully
battling
with
the
winds
*punct* ,
or
by
giving
up
the
attempt
and
rarely
or
never
flying
*punct* .
*break*
as
with
mariners
shipwrecked
near
a
coast
*punct* ,
it
would
have
been
better
for
the
good
swimmers
if
they
had
been
able
to
swim
still
further
*punct* ,
whereas
it
would
have
been
better
for
the
bad
swimmers
if
they
had
not
been
able
to
swim
at
all
and
had
stuck
to
the
wreck
*punct* .
*break*
the
eyes
of
moles
and
of
some
burrowing
rodents
are
rudimentary
in
size
*punct* ,
and
in
some
cases
are
quite
covered
up
by
skin
and
fur
*punct* .
*break*
this
state
of
the
eyes
is
probably
due
to
gradual
reduction
from
disuse
*punct* ,
but
aided
perhaps
by
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
in
south
america
*punct* ,
a
burrowing
rodent
*punct* ,
the
tuco-tuco
*punct* ,
or
ctenomys
*punct* ,
is
even
more
subterranean
in
its
habits
than
the
mole
*punct* ;
and
i
was
assured
by
a
spaniard
*punct* ,
who
had
often
caught
them
*punct* ,
that
they
were
frequently
blind
*punct* ;
one
which
i
kept
alive
was
certainly
in
this
condition
*punct* ,
the
cause
*punct* ,
as
appeared
on
dissection
*punct* ,
having
been
inflammation
of
the
nictitating
membrane
*punct* .
*break*
as
frequent
inflammation
of
the
eyes
must
be
injurious
to
any
animal
*punct* ,
and
as
eyes
are
certainly
not
indispensable
to
animals
with
subterranean
habits
*punct* ,
a
reduction
in
their
size
with
the
adhesion
of
the
eyelids
and
growth
of
fur
over
them
*punct* ,
might
in
such
case
be
an
advantage
*punct* ;
and
if
so
*punct* ,
natural
selection
would
constantly
aid
the
effects
of
disuse
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
well
known
that
several
animals
*punct* ,
belonging
to
the
most
different
classes
*punct* ,
which
inhabit
the
caves
of
styria
and
of
kentucky
*punct* ,
are
blind
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
of
the
crabs
the
foot-stalk
for
the
eye
remains
*punct* ,
though
the
eye
is
gone
*punct* ;
the
stand
for
the
telescope
is
there
*punct* ,
though
the
telescope
with
its
glasses
has
been
lost
*punct* .
*break*
as
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
that
eyes
*punct* ,
though
useless
*punct* ,
could
be
in
any
way
injurious
to
animals
living
in
darkness
*punct* ,
i
attribute
their
loss
wholly
to
disuse
*punct* .
*break*
in
one
of
the
blind
animals
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
the
cave-rat
*punct* ,
the
eyes
are
of
immense
size
*punct* ;
and
professor
silliman
thought
that
it
regained
*punct* ,
after
living
some
days
in
the
light
*punct* ,
some
slight
power
of
vision
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
same
manner
as
in
madeira
the
wings
of
some
of
the
insects
have
been
enlarged
*punct* ,
and
the
wings
of
others
have
been
reduced
by
natural
selection
aided
by
use
and
disuse
*punct* ,
so
in
the
case
of
the
cave-rat
natural
selection
seems
to
have
struggled
with
the
loss
of
light
and
to
have
increased
the
size
of
the
eyes
*punct* ;
whereas
with
all
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
caves
*punct* ,
disuse
by
itself
seems
to
have
done
its
work
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
conditions
of
life
more
similar
than
deep
limestone
caverns
under
a
nearly
similar
climate
*punct* ;
so
that
on
the
common
view
of
the
blind
animals
having
been
separately
created
for
the
american
and
european
caverns
*punct* ,
close
similarity
in
their
organisation
and
affinities
might
have
been
expected
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
schiodte
and
others
have
remarked
*punct* ,
this
is
not
the
case
*punct* ,
and
the
cave-insects
of
the
two
continents
are
not
more
closely
allied
than
might
have
been
anticipated
from
the
general
resemblance
of
the
other
inhabitants
of
north
america
and
europe
*punct* .
*break*
on
my
view
we
must
suppose
that
american
animals
*punct* ,
having
ordinary
powers
of
vision
*punct* ,
slowly
migrated
by
successive
generations
from
the
outer
world
into
the
deeper
and
deeper
recesses
of
the
kentucky
caves
*punct* ,
as
did
european
animals
into
the
caves
of
europe
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
some
evidence
of
this
gradation
of
habit
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
as
schiodte
remarks
*punct* ,
animals
not
far
remote
from
ordinary
forms
*punct* ,
prepare
the
transition
from
light
to
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
next
follow
those

are
constructed
for
twilight
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
last
of
all
*punct* ,
those
destined
for
total
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
time
that
an
animal
had
reached
*punct* ,
after
numberless
generations
*punct* ,
the
deepest
recesses
*punct* ,
disuse
will
on
this
view
have
more
or
less
perfectly
obliterated
its
eyes
*punct* ,
and
natural
selection
will
often
have
effected
other
changes
*punct* ,
such
as
an
increase
in
the
length
of
the
antennae
or
palpi
*punct* ,
as
a
compensation
for
blindness
*punct* .
*break*
notwithstanding
such
modifications
*punct* ,
we
might
expect
still
to
see
in
the
cave-animals
of
america
*punct* ,
affinities
to
the
other
inhabitants
of
that
continent
*punct* ,
and
in
those
of
europe
*punct* ,
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
european
continent
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
is
the
case
with
some
of
the
american
cave-animals
*punct* ,
as
i
hear
from
professor
dana
*punct* ;
and
some
of
the
european
cave-insects
are
very
closely
allied
to
those
of
the
surrounding
country
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
most
difficult
to
give
any
rational
explanation
of
the
affinities
of
the
blind
cave-animals
to
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
two
continents
on
the
ordinary
view
of
their
independent
creation
*punct* .
*break*
that
several
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
caves
of
the
old
and
new
worlds
should
be
closely
related
*punct* ,
we
might
expect
from
the
well-known
relationship
of
most
of
their
other
productions
*punct* .
*break*
far
from
feeling
any
surprise
that
some
of
the
cave-animals
should
be
very
anomalous
*punct* ,
as
agassiz
has
remarked
in
regard
to
the
blind
fish
*punct* ,
the
amblyopsis
*punct* ,
and
as
is
the
case
with
the
blind
proteus
with
reference
to
the
reptiles
of
europe
*punct* ,
i
am
only
surprised
that
more
wrecks
of
ancient
life
have
not
been
preserved
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
less
severe
competition
to
which
the
inhabitants
of
these
dark
abodes
will
probably
have
been
exposed
*punct* .
*break*
acclimatisation.
*punct* ,
habit
is
hereditary
with
plants
*punct* ,
as
in
the
period
of
flowering
*punct* ,
in
the
amount
of
rain
requisite
for
seeds
to
germinate
*punct* ,
in
the
time
of
sleep
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
and
this
leads
me
to
say
a
few
words
on
acclimatisation
*punct* .
*break*
as
it
is
extremely
common
for
species
of
the
same
genus
to
inhabit
very
hot
and
very
cold
countries
*punct* ,
and
as
i
believe
that
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
have
descended
from
a
single
parent
*punct* ,
if
this
view
be
correct
*punct* ,
acclimatisation
must
be
readily
effected
during
long-continued
descent
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
notorious
that
each
species
is
adapted
to
the
climate
of
its
own
home
*punct* :
species
from
an
arctic
or
even
from
a
temperate
region
cannot
endure
a
tropical
climate
*punct* ,
or
conversely
*punct* .
*break*
so
again
*punct* ,
many
succulent
plants
cannot
endure
a
damp
climate
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
degree
of
adaptation
of
species
to
the
climates
under
which
they
live
is
often
overrated
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
infer
this
from
our
frequent
inability
to
predict
whether
or
not
an
imported
plant
will
endure
our
climate
*punct* ,
and
from
the
number
of
plants
and
animals
brought
from
warmer
countries
which
here
enjoy
good
health
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
species
in
a
state
of
nature
are
limited
in
their
ranges
by
the
competition
of
other
organic
beings
quite
as
much
as
*punct* ,
or
more
than
*punct* ,
by
adaptation
to
particular
climates
*punct* .
*break*
but
whether
or
not
the
adaptation
be
generally
very
close
*punct* ,
we
have
evidence
*punct* ,
in
the
case
of
some
few
plants
*punct* ,
of
their
becoming
*punct* ,
to
a
certain
extent
*punct* ,
naturally
habituated
to
different
temperatures
*punct* ,
or
becoming
acclimatised
*punct* :
thus
the
pines
and
rhododendrons
*punct* ,
raised
from
seed
collected
by
dr.
hooker
from
trees
growing
at
different
heights
on
the
himalaya
*punct* ,
were
found
in
this
country
to
possess
different
constitutional
powers
of
resisting
cold
*punct* .
*break*
watson
on
european
species
of
plants
brought
from
the
azores
to
england
*punct* .
*break*
in
regard
to
animals
*punct* ,
several
authentic
cases
could
be
given
of
species
within
historical
times
having
largely
extended
their
range
from
warmer
to
cooler
latitudes
*punct* ,
and
conversely
*punct* ;
but
we
do
not
positively
know
that
these
animals
were
strictly
adapted
to
their
native
climate
*punct* ,
but
in
all
ordinary
cases
we
assume
such
to
be
the
case
*punct* ;
nor
do
we
know
that
they
have
subsequently
become
acclimatised
to
their
new
homes
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
believe
that
our
domestic
animals
were
originally
chosen
by
uncivilised
man
because
they
were
useful
and
bred
readily
under
confinement
*punct* ,
and
not
because
they
were
subsequently
found
capable
of
far-extended
transportation
*punct* ,
i
think
the
common
and
extraordinary
capacity
in
our
domestic
animals
of
not
only
withstanding
the
most
different
climates
but
of
being
perfectly
fertile
*punct* ,
a
far
severer
test
*punct* ,
under
them
*punct* ,
may
be
used
as
an
argument
that
a
large
proportion
of
other
animals
*punct* ,
now
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
could
easily
be
brought
to
bear
widely
different
climates
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
not
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
push
the
foregoing
argument
too
far
*punct* ,
on
account
of
the
probable
origin
of
some
of
our
domestic
animals
from
several
wild
stocks
*punct* :
the
blood
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
of
a
tropical
and
arctic
wolf
or
wild
dog
may
perhaps
be
mingled
in
our
domestic
breeds
*punct* .
*break*
the
rat
and
mouse
cannot
be
considered
as
domestic
animals
*punct* ,
but
they
have
been
transported
by
man
to
many
parts
of
the
world
*punct* ,
and
now
have
a
far
wider
range
than
any
other
rodent
*punct* ,
living
free
under
the
cold
climate
of
faroe
in
the
north
and
of
the
falklands
in
the
south
*punct* ,
and
on
many
islands
in
the
torrid
zones
*punct* .
*break*
hence
i
am
inclined
to
look
at
adaptation
to
any
special
climate
as
a
quality
readily
grafted
on
an
innate
wide
flexibility
of
constitution
*punct* ,
which
is
common
to
most
animals
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
view
*punct* ,
the
capacity
of
enduring
the
most
different
climates
by
man
himself
and
by
his
domestic
animals
*punct* ,
and
such
facts
as
that
former
species
of
the
elephant
and
rhinoceros
were
capable
of
enduring
a
glacial
climate
*punct* ,
whereas
the
living
species
are
now
all
tropical
or
sub-tropical
in
their
habits
*punct* ,
ought
not
to
be
looked
at
as
anomalies
*punct* ,
but
merely
as
examples
of
a
very
common
flexibility
of
constitution
*punct* ,
brought
*punct* ,
under
peculiar
circumstances
*punct* ,
into
play
*punct* .
*break*
how
much
of
the
acclimatisation
of
species
to
any
peculiar
climate
is
due
to
mere
habit
*punct* ,
and
how
much
to
the
natural
selection
of
varieties
having
different
innate
constitutions
*punct* ,
and
how
much
to
both
means
combined
*punct* ,
is
a
very
obscure
question
*punct* .
*break*
that
habit
or
custom
has
some
influence
i
must
believe
*punct* ,
both
from
analogy
*punct* ,
and
from
the
incessant
advice
given
in
agricultural
works
*punct* ,
even
in
the
ancient
encyclopaedias
of
china
*punct* ,
to
be
very
cautious
in
transposing
animals
from
one
district
to
another
*punct* ;
for
it
is
not
likely
that
man
should
have
succeeded
in
selecting
so
many
breeds
and
sub-breeds
with
constitutions
specially
fitted
for
their
own
districts
*punct* :
the
result
must
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
be
due
to
habit
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
i
can
see
no
reason
to
doubt
that
natural
selection
will
continually
tend
to
preserve
those
individuals
which
are
born
with
constitutions
best
adapted
to
their
native
countries
*punct* .
*break*
in
treatises
on
many
kinds
of
cultivated
plants
*punct* ,
certain
varieties
are
said
to
withstand
certain
climates
better
than
others
*punct* :
this
is
very
strikingly
shown
in
works
on
fruit
trees
published
in
the
united
states
*punct* ,
in
which
certain
varieties
are
habitually
recommended
for
the
northern
*punct* ,
and
others
for
the
southern
states
*punct* ;
and
as
most
of
these
varieties
are
of
recent
origin
*punct* ,
they
cannot
owe
their
constitutional
differences
to
habit
*punct* .
*break*
the
case
of
the
jerusalem
artichoke
*punct* ,
which
is
never
propagated
by
seed
*punct* ,
and
of
which
consequently
new
varieties
have
not
been
produced
*punct* ,
has
even
been
advanced
*punct* ,
for
it
is
now
as
tender
as
ever
it
was
*punct* ,
as
proving
that
acclimatisation
cannot
be
effected
*punct* !
*break*
the
case
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
of
the
kidney-bean
has
been
often
cited
for
a
similar
purpose
*punct* ,
and
with
much
greater
weight
*punct* ;
but
until
some
one
will
sow
*punct* ,
during
a
score
of
generations
*punct* ,
his
kidney-beans
so
early
that
a
very
large
proportion
are
destroyed
by
frost
*punct* ,
and
then
collect
seed
from
the
few
survivors
*punct* ,
with
care
to
prevent
accidental
crosses
*punct* ,
and
then
again
get
seed
from
these
seedlings
*punct* ,
with
the
same
precautions
*punct* ,
the
experiment
cannot
be
said
to
have
been
even
tried
*punct* .
*break*
nor
let
it
be
supposed
that
no
differences
in
the
constitution
of
seedling
kidney-beans
ever
appear
*punct* ,
for
an
account
has
been
published
how
much
more
hardy
some
seedlings
appeared
to
be
than
others
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
whole
*punct* ,
i
think
we
may
conclude
that
habit
*punct* ,
use
*punct* ,
and
disuse
*punct* ,
have
*punct* ,
in
some
cases
*punct* ,
played
a
considerable
part
in
the
modification
of
the
constitution
*punct* ,
and
of
the
structure
of
various
organs
*punct* ;
but
that
the
effects
of
use
and
disuse
have
often
been
largely
combined
with
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
overmastered
by
*punct* ,
the
natural
selection
of
innate
differences
*punct* .
*break*
correlation
of
growth.
*punct* ,
i
mean
by
this
expression
that
the
whole
organisation
is
so
tied
together
during
its
growth
and
development
*punct* ,
that
when
slight
variations
in
any
one
part
occur
*punct* ,
and
are
accumulated
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
other
parts
become
modified
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
a
very
important
subject
*punct* ,
most
imperfectly
understood
*punct* .
*break*
the
most
obvious
case
is
*punct* ,
that
modifications
accumulated
solely
for
the
good
of
the
young
or
larva
*punct* ,
will
*punct* ,
it
may
safely
be
concluded
*punct* ,
affect
the
structure
of
the
adult
*punct* ;
in
the
same
manner
as
any
malconformation
affecting
the
early
embryo
*punct* ,
seriously
affects
the
whole
organisation
of
the
adult
*punct* .
*break*
the
several
parts
of
the
body
which
are
homologous
*punct* ,
and
which
*punct* ,
at
an
early
embryonic
period
*punct* ,
are
alike
*punct* ,
seem
liable
to
vary
in
an
allied
manner
*punct* :
we
see
this
in
the
right
and
left
sides
of
the
body
varying
in
the
same
manner
*punct* ;
in
the
front
and
hind
legs
*punct* ,
and
even
in
the
jaws
and
limbs
*punct* ,
varying
together
*punct* ,
for
the
lower
jaw
is
believed
to
be
homologous
with
the
limbs
*punct* .
*break*
these
tendencies
*punct* ,
i
do
not
doubt
*punct* ,
may
be
mastered
more
or
less
completely
by
natural
selection
*punct* :
thus
a
family
of
stags
once
existed
with
an
antler
only
on
one
side
*punct* ;
and
if
this
had
been
of
any
great
use
to
the
breed
it
might
probably
have
been
rendered
permanent
by
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
homologous
parts
*punct* ,
as
has
been
remarked
by
some
authors
*punct* ,
tend
to
cohere
*punct* ;
this
is
often
seen
in
monstrous
plants
*punct* ;
and
nothing
is
more
common
than
the
union
of
homologous
parts
in
normal
structures
*punct* ,
as
the
union
of
the
petals
of
the
corolla
into
a
tube
*punct* .
*break*
hard
parts
seem
to
affect
the
form
of
adjoining
soft
parts
*punct* ;
it
is
believed
by
some
authors
that
the
diversity
in
the
shape
of
the
pelvis
in
birds
causes
the
remarkable
diversity
in
the
shape
of
their
kidneys
*punct* .
*break*
others
believe
that
the
shape
of
the
pelvis
in
the
human
mother
influences
by
pressure
the
shape
of
the
head
of
the
child
*punct* .
*break*
in
snakes
*punct* ,
according
to
schlegel
*punct* ,
the
shape
of
the
body
and
the
manner
of
swallowing
determine
the
position
of
several
of
the
most
important
viscera
*punct* .
*break*
the
nature
of
the
bond
of
correlation
is
very
frequently
quite
obscure
*punct* .
*break*
hilaire
has
forcibly
remarked
*punct* ,
that
certain
malconformations
very
frequently
*punct* ,
and
that
others
rarely
coexist
*punct* ,
without
our
being
able
to
assign
any
reason
*punct* .
*break*
what
can
be
more
singular
than
the
relation
between
blue
eyes
and
deafness
in
cats
*punct* ,
and
the
tortoise-shell
colour
with
the
female
sex
*punct* ;
the
feathered
feet
and
skin
between
the
outer
toes
in
pigeons
*punct* ,
and
the
presence
of
more
or
less
down
on
the
young
birds
when
first
hatched
*punct* ,
with
the
future
colour
of
their
plumage

again
*punct* ,
the
relation
between
the
hair
and
teeth
in
the
naked
turkish
dog
*punct* ,
though
here
probably
homology
comes
into
play
*punct* ?
*break*
with
respect
to
this
latter
case
of
correlation
*punct* ,
i
think
it
can
hardly
be
accidental
*punct* ,
that
if
we
pick
out
the
two
orders
of
mammalia
which
are
most
abnormal
in

these
are
likewise

most
abnormal
in

no

the
laws

correlation
in
modifying
important
structures
*punct* ,
independently
of
utility
and
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
than
that
of
the
difference
between
the
outer
and
inner
flowers
in
some
compositous
and
umbelliferous
plants
*punct* .
*break*
every
one
knows
the
difference
in
the
ray
and
central
florets
of
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
daisy
*punct* ,
and
this
difference
is
often
accompanied
with
the
abortion
of
parts
of
the
flower
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
in
some
compositous
plants
*punct* ,
the
seeds
also
differ
in
shape
and
sculpture
*punct* ;
and
even
the
ovary
itself
*punct* ,
with
its
accessory
parts
*punct* ,
differs
*punct* ,
as
has
been
described
by
cassini
*punct* .
*break*
these
differences
have
been
attributed
by
some
authors
to
pressure
*punct* ,
and
the
shape
of
the
seeds
in
the
ray-florets
in
some
compositae
countenances
this
idea
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
in
the
case
of
the
corolla
of
the
umbelliferae
*punct* ,
it
is
by
no
means
*punct* ,
as
dr.
hooker
informs
me
*punct* ,
in
species
with
the
densest
heads
that
the
inner
and
outer
flowers
most
frequently
differ
*punct* .
*break*
it
might
have
been
thought
that
the
development
of
the
ray-petals
by
drawing
nourishment
from
certain
other
parts
of
the
flower
had
caused
their
abortion
*punct* ;
but
in
some
compositae
there
is
a
difference
in
the
seeds
of
the
outer
and
inner
florets
without
any
difference
in
the
corolla
*punct* .
*break*
possibly
*punct* ,
these
several
differences
may
be
connected
with
some
difference
in
the
flow
of
nutriment
towards
the
central
and
external
flowers
*punct* :
we
know
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
that
in
irregular
flowers
*punct* ,
those
nearest
to
the
axis
are
oftenest
subject
to
peloria
*punct* ,
and
become
regular
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
add
*punct* ,
as
an
instance
of
this
*punct* ,
and
of
a
striking
case
of
correlation
*punct* ,
that
i
have
recently
observed
in
some
garden
pelargoniums
*punct* ,
that
the
central
flower
of
the
truss
often
loses
the
patches
of
darker
colour
in
the
two
upper
petals
*punct* ;
and
that
when
this
occurs
*punct* ,
the
adherent
nectary
is
quite
aborted
*punct* ;
when
the
colour
is
absent
from
only
one
of
the
two
upper
petals
*punct* ,
the
nectary
is
only
much
shortened
*punct* .
*break*
sprengel's
idea
that
the
ray-florets
serve
to
attract
insects
*punct* ,
whose
agency
is
highly
advantageous
in
the
fertilisation
of
plants
of
these
two
orders
*punct* ,
is
so
far-fetched
*punct* ,
as
it
may
at
first
appear
*punct* :
and
if
it
be
advantageous
*punct* ,
natural
selection
may
have
come
into
play
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
regard
to
the
differences
both
in
the
internal
and
external
structure
of
the
seeds
*punct* ,
which
are
not
always
correlated
with
any
differences
in
the
flowers
*punct* ,
it
seems
impossible
that
they
can
be
in
any
way
advantageous
to
the
plant
*punct* :
yet
in
the
umbelliferae
these
differences
are
of
such
apparent
importance
*punct* ,
the
seeds
being
in
some
cases
*punct* ,
according
to
tausch
*punct* ,
orthospermous
in
the
exterior
flowers
and
coelospermous
in
the
central
flowers,
*punct* ,
that
the
elder
de
candolle
founded
his
main
divisions
of
the
order
on
analogous
differences
*punct* .
*break*
hence
we
see
that
modifications
of
structure
*punct* ,
viewed
by
systematists
as
of
high
value
*punct* ,
may
be
wholly
due
to
unknown
laws
of
correlated
growth
*punct* ,
and
without
being
*punct* ,
as
far
as
we
can
see
*punct* ,
of
the
slightest
service
to
the
species
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
often
falsely
attribute
to
correlation
of
growth
*punct* ,
structures
which
are
common
to
whole
groups
of
species
*punct* ,
and
which
in
truth
are
simply
due
to
inheritance
*punct* ;
for
an
ancient
progenitor
may
have
acquired
through
natural
selection
some
one
modification
in
structure
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
after
thousands
of
generations
*punct* ,
some
other
and
independent
modification
*punct* ;
and
these
two
modifications
*punct* ,
having
been
transmitted
to
a
whole
group
of
descendants
with
diverse
habits
*punct* ,
would
naturally
be
thought
to
be
correlated
in
some
necessary
manner
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
i
do
not
doubt
that
some
apparent
correlations
*punct* ,
occurring
throughout
whole
orders
*punct* ,
are
entirely
due
to
the
manner
alone
in
which
natural
selection
can
act
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,

*break*
de
candolle
has
remarked
that
winged
seeds
are
never
found
in
fruits
which
do
not
open
*punct* :
i
should
explain
the
rule
by
the
fact
that
seeds
could
not
gradually
become
winged
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
except
in
fruits
which
opened
*punct* ;
so
that
the
individual
plants
producing
seeds
which
were
a
little
better
fitted
to
be
wafted
further
*punct* ,
might
get
an
advantage
over
those
producing
seed
less
fitted
for
dispersal
*punct* ;
and
this
process
could
not
possibly
go
on
in
fruit
which
did
not
open
*punct* .
*break*
the
elder
geoffroy
and
goethe
propounded
*punct* ,
at
about
the
same
period
*punct* ,
their
law
of
compensation
or
balancement
of
growth
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
as
goethe
expressed
it
*punct* ,
in
order
to
spend
on
one
side
*punct* ,
nature
is
forced
to
economise
on
the
other
side
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
this
holds
true
to
a
certain
extent
with
our
domestic
productions
*punct* :
if
nourishment
flows
to
one
part
or
organ
in
excess
*punct* ,
it
rarely
flows
*punct* ,
at
least
in
excess
*punct* ,
to
another
part
*punct* ;
thus
it
is
difficult
to
get
a
cow
to
give
much
milk
and
to
fatten
readily
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
varieties
of
the
cabbage
do
not
yield
abundant
and
nutritious
foliage
and
a
copious
supply
of
oil-bearing
seeds
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
seeds
in
our
fruits
become
atrophied
*punct* ,
the
fruit
itself
gains
largely
in
size
and
quality
*punct* .
*break*
in
our
poultry
*punct* ,
a
large
tuft
of
feathers
on
the
head
is
generally
accompanied
by
a
diminished
comb
*punct* ,
and
a
large
beard
by
diminished
wattles
*punct* .
*break*
with
species
in
a
state
of
nature
it
can
hardly
be
maintained
that
the
law
is
of
universal
application
*punct* ;
but
many
good
observers
*punct* ,
more
especially
botanists
*punct* ,
believe
in
its
truth
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
not
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
here
give
any
instances
*punct* ,
for
i
see
hardly
any
way
of
distinguishing
between
the
effects
*punct* ,
on
the
one
hand
*punct* ,
of
a
part
being
largely
developed
through
natural
selection
and
another
and
adjoining
part
being
reduced
by
this
same
process
or
by
disuse
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
the
actual
withdrawal
of
nutriment
from
one
part
owing
to
the
excess
of
growth
in
another
and
adjoining
part
*punct* .
*break*
i
suspect
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
that
some
of
the
cases
of
compensation
which
have
been
advanced
*punct* ,
and
likewise
some
other
facts
*punct* ,
may
be
merged
under
a
more
general
principle
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
natural
selection
is
continually
trying
to
economise
in
every
part
of
the
organisation
*punct* .
*break*
if
under
changed
conditions
of
life
a
structure
before
useful
becomes
less
useful
*punct* ,
any
diminution
*punct* ,
however
slight
*punct* ,
in
its
development
*punct* ,
will
be
seized
on
by
natural
selection
*punct* ,
for
it
will
profit
the
individual
not
to
have
its
nutriment
wasted
in
building
up
an
useless
structure
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
thus
only
understand
a
fact
with
which
i
was
much
struck
when
examining
cirripedes
*punct* ,
and
of
which
many
other
instances
could
be
given
*punct* :
namely
*punct* ,
that
when
a
cirripede
is
parasitic
within
another
and
is
thus
protected
*punct* ,
it
loses
more
or
less
completely
its
own
shell
or
carapace
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
the
case
with
the
male
ibla
*punct* ,
and
in
a
truly
extraordinary
manner
with
the
proteolepas
*punct* :
for
the
carapace
in
all
other
cirripedes
consists
of
the
three
highly-important
anterior
segments
of
the
head
enormously
developed
*punct* ,
and
furnished
with
great
nerves
and
muscles
*punct* ;
but
in
the
parasitic
and
protected
proteolepas
*punct* ,
the
whole
anterior
part
of
the
head
is
reduced
to
the
merest
rudiment
attached
to
the
bases
of
the
prehensile
antennae
*punct* .
*break*
now
the
saving
of
a
large
and
complex
structure
*punct* ,
when
rendered
superfluous
by
the
parasitic
habits
of
the
proteolepas
*punct* ,
though
effected
by
slow
steps
*punct* ,
would
be
a
decided
advantage
to
each
successive
individual
of
the
species
*punct* ;
for
in
the
struggle
for
life
to
which
every
animal
is
exposed
*punct* ,
each
individual
proteolepas
would
have
a
better
chance
of
supporting
itself
*punct* ,
by
less
nutriment
being
wasted
in
developing
a
structure
now
become
useless
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
natural
selection
will
always
succeed
in
the
long
run
in
reducing
and
saving
every
part
of
the
organisation
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
it
is
rendered
superfluous
*punct* ,
without
by
any
means
causing
some
other
part
to
be
largely
developed
in
a
corresponding
degree
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
conversely
*punct* ,
that
natural
selection
may
perfectly
well
succeed
in
largely
developing
any
organ
*punct* ,
without
requiring
as
a
necessary
compensation
the
reduction
of
some
adjoining
part
*punct* .
*break*
it
seems
to
be
a
rule
*punct* ,
as
remarked
by
is
*punct* .
*break*
hilaire
*punct* ,
both
in
varieties
and
in
species
*punct* ,
that
when
any
part
or
organ
is
repeated
many
times
in
the
structure
of
the
same
individual
*punct* ,
as
the
vertebrae
in
snakes
*punct* ,
and
the
stamens
in
polyandrous
flowers
*punct* ,
the
number
is
variable
*punct* ;
whereas
the
number
of
the
same
part
or
organ
*punct* ,
when
it
occurs
in
lesser
numbers
*punct* ,
is
constant
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
author
and
some
botanists
have
further
remarked
that
multiple
parts
are
also
very
liable
to
variation
in
structure
*punct* .
*break*
inasmuch
as
this
vegetative
repetition
*punct* ,
to
use
prof
*punct* .
*break*
owen's
expression
*punct* ,
seems
to
be
a
sign
of
low
organisation
*punct* ;
the
foregoing
remark
seems
connected
with
the
very
general
opinion
of
naturalists
*punct* ,
that
beings
low
in
the
scale
of
nature
are
more
variable
than
those
which
are
higher
*punct* .
*break*
i
presume
that
lowness
in
this
case
means
that
the
several
parts
of
the
organisation
have
been
but
little
specialised
for
particular
functions
*punct* ;
and
as
long
as
the
same
part
has
to
perform
diversified
work
*punct* ,
we
can
perhaps
see
why
it
should
remain
variable
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
why
natural
selection
should
have
preserved
or
rejected
each
little
deviation
of
form
less
carefully
than
when
the
part
has
to
serve
for
one
special
purpose
alone
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
same
way
that
a
knife
which
has
to
cut
all
sorts
of
things
may
be
of
almost
any
shape
*punct* ;
whilst
a
tool
for
some
particular
object
had
better
be
of
some
particular
shape
*punct* .
*break*
natural
selection
*punct* ,
it
should
never
be
forgotten
*punct* ,
can
act
on
each
part
of
each
being
*punct* ,
solely
through
and
for
its
advantage
*punct* .
*break*
rudimentary
parts
*punct* ,
it
has
been
stated
by
some
authors
*punct* ,
and
i
believe
with
truth
*punct* ,
are
apt
to
be
highly
variable
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
have
to
recur
to
the
general
subject
of
rudimentary
and
aborted
organs
*punct* ;
and
i
will
here
only
add
that
their
variability
seems
to
be
owing
to
their
uselessness
*punct* ,
and
therefore
to
natural
selection
having
no
power
to
check
deviations
in
their
structure
*punct* .
*break*
thus
rudimentary
parts
are
left
to
the
free
play
of
the
various
laws
of
growth
*punct* ,
to
the
effects
of
long-continued
disuse
*punct* ,
and
to
the
tendency
to
reversion
*punct* .
*break*
a
part
developed
in
any
species
in
an
extraordinary
degree
or
manner
*punct* ,
in
comparison
with
the
same
part
in
allied
species
*punct* ,
tends
to
be
highly
variable.
*punct* ,
several
years
ago
i
was
much
struck
with
a
remark
*punct* ,
nearly
to
the
above
effect
*punct* ,
published
by
mr.
waterhouse
*punct* .
*break*
i
infer
also
from
an
observation
made
by
professor
owen
*punct* ,
with
respect
to
the
length
of
the
arms
of
the
ourang-outang
*punct* ,
that
he
has
come
to
a
nearly
similar
conclusion
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
hopeless
to
attempt
to
convince
any
one
of
the
truth
of
this
proposition
without
giving
the
long
array
of
facts
which
i
have
collected
*punct* ,
and
which
cannot
possibly
be
here
introduced
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
only
state
my
conviction
that
it
is
a
rule
of
high
generality
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
aware
of
several
causes
of
error
*punct* ,
but
i
hope
that
i
have
made
due
allowance
for
them
*punct* .
*break*
it
should
be
understood
that
the
rule
by
no
means
applies
to
any
part
*punct* ,
however
unusually
developed
*punct* ,
unless
it
be
unusually
developed
in
comparison
with
the
same
part
in
closely
allied
species
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
the
bat's
wing
is
a
most
abnormal
structure
in
the
class
mammalia
*punct* ;
but
the
rule
would
not
here
apply
*punct* ,
because
there
is
a
whole
group
of
bats
having
wings
*punct* ;
it
would
apply
only
if
some
one
species
of
bat
had
its
wings
developed
in
some
remarkable
manner
in
comparison
with
the
other
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* .
*break*
the
rule
applies
very
strongly
in
the
case
of
secondary
sexual
characters
*punct* ,
when
displayed
in
any
unusual
manner
*punct* .
*break*
the
term
*punct* ,
secondary
sexual
characters
*punct* ,
used
by
hunter
*punct* ,
applies
to
characters
which
are
attached
to
one
sex
*punct* ,
but
are
not
directly
connected
with
the
act
of
reproduction
*punct* .
*break*
the
rule
applies
to
males
and
females
*punct* ;
but
as
females
more
rarely
offer
remarkable
secondary
sexual
characters
*punct* ,
it
applies
more
rarely
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
rule
being
so
plainly
applicable
in
the
case
of
secondary
sexual
characters
*punct* ,
may
be
due
to
the
great
variability
of
these
characters
*punct* ,
whether
or
not
displayed
in
any
unusual
manner
*punct* ,
of
which
fact
i
think
there
can
be
little
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
but
that
our
rule
is
not
confined
to
secondary
sexual
characters
is
clearly
shown
in
the
case
of
hermaphrodite
cirripedes
*punct* ;
and
i
may
here
add
*punct* ,
that
i
particularly
attended
to
mr.
waterhouse's
remark
*punct* ,
whilst
investigating
this
order
*punct* ,
and
i
am
fully
convinced
that
the
rule
almost
invariably
holds
good
with
cirripedes
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
*punct* ,
in
my
future
work
*punct* ,
give
a
list
of
the
more
remarkable
cases
*punct* ;
i
will
here
only
briefly
give
one
*punct* ,
as
it
illustrates
the
rule
in
its
largest
application
*punct* .
*break*
the
opercular
valves
of
sessile
cirripedes
*punct* ,
rock
barnacles
*punct* ,
are
*punct* ,
in
every
sense
of
the
word
*punct* ,
very
important
structures
*punct* ,
and
they
differ
extremely
little
even
in
different
genera
*punct* ;
but
in
the
several
species
of
one
genus
*punct* ,
pyrgoma
*punct* ,
these
valves
present
a
marvellous
amount
of
diversification
*punct* :
the
homologous
valves
in
the
different
species
being
sometimes
wholly
unlike
in
shape
*punct* ;
and
the
amount
of
variation
in
the
individuals
of
several
of
the
species
is
so
great
*punct* ,
that
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
state
that
the
varieties
differ
more
from
each
other
in
the
characters
of
these
important
valves
than
do
other
species
of
distinct
genera
*punct* .
*break*
as
birds
within
the
same
country
vary
in
a
remarkably
small
degree
*punct* ,
i
have
particularly
attended
to
them
*punct* ,
and
the
rule
seems
to
me
certainly
to
hold
good
in
this
class
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
make
out
that
it
applies
to
plants
*punct* ,
and
this
would
seriously
have
shaken
my
belief
in
its
truth
*punct* ,
had
not
the
great
variability
in
plants
made
it
particularly
difficult
to
compare
their
relative
degrees
of
variability
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
see
any
part
or
organ
developed
in
a
remarkable
degree
or
manner
in
any
species
*punct* ,
the
fair
presumption
is
that
it
is
of
high
importance
to
that
species
*punct* ;
nevertheless
the
part
in
this
case
is
eminently
liable
to
variation
*punct* .
*break*
why
should
this
be
so
*punct* ?
*break*
on
the
view
that
each
species
has
been
independently
created
*punct* ,
with
all
its
parts
as
we
now
see
them
*punct* ,
i
can
see
no
explanation
*punct* .
*break*
but
on
the
view
that
groups
of
species
have
descended
from
other
species
*punct* ,
and
have
been
modified
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
i
think
we
can
obtain
some
light
*punct* .
*break*
in
our
domestic
animals
*punct* ,
if
any
part
*punct* ,
or
the
whole
animal
*punct* ,
be
neglected
and
no
selection
be
applied
*punct* ,
that
part
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
comb
in
the
dorking
fowl
*punct* ,
or
the
whole
breed
will
cease
to
have
a
nearly
uniform
character
*punct* .
*break*
the
breed
will
then
be
said
to
have
degenerated
*punct* .
*break*
in
rudimentary
organs
*punct* ,
and
in
those
which
have
been
but
little
specialised
for
any
particular
purpose
*punct* ,
and
perhaps
in
polymorphic
groups
*punct* ,
we
see
a
nearly
parallel
natural
case
*punct* ;
for
in
such
cases
natural
selection
either
has
not
or
cannot
come
into
full
play
*punct* ,
and
thus
the
organisation
is
left
in
a
fluctuating
condition
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
here
more
especially
concerns
us
is
*punct* ,
that
in
our
domestic
animals
those
points
*punct* ,
which
at
the
present
time
are
undergoing
rapid
change
by
continued
selection
*punct* ,
are
also
eminently
liable
to
variation
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
the
breeds
of
the
pigeon
*punct* ;
see
what
a
prodigious
amount
of
difference
there
is
in
the
beak
of
the
different
tumblers
*punct* ,
in
the
beak
and
wattle
of
the
different
carriers
*punct* ,
in
the
carriage
and
tail
of
our
fantails
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
these
being
the
points
now
mainly
attended
to
by
english
fanciers
*punct* .
*break*
even
in
the
sub-breeds
*punct* ,
as
in
the
short-faced
tumbler
*punct* ,
it
is
notoriously
difficult
to
breed
them
nearly
to
perfection
*punct* ,
and
frequently
individuals
are
born
which
depart
widely
from
the
standard
*punct* .
*break*
there
may
be
truly
said
to
be
a
constant
struggle
going
on
between
*punct* ,
on
the
one
hand
*punct* ,
the
tendency
to
reversion
to
a
less
modified
state
*punct* ,
as
well
as
an
innate
tendency
to
further
variability
of
all
kinds
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
the
power
of
steady
selection
to
keep
the
breed
true
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
long
run
selection
gains
the
day
*punct* ,
and
we
do
not
expect
to
fail
so
far
as
to
breed
a
bird
as
coarse
as
a
common
tumbler
from
a
good
short-faced
strain
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
long
as
selection
is
rapidly
going
on
*punct* ,
there
may
always
be
expected
to
be
much
variability
in
the
structure
undergoing
modification
*punct* .
*break*
it
further
deserves
notice
that
these
variable
characters
*punct* ,
produced
by
man's
selection
*punct* ,
sometimes
become
attached
*punct* ,
from
causes
quite
unknown
to
us
*punct* ,
more
to
one
sex
than
to
the
other
*punct* ,
generally
to
the
male
sex
*punct* ,
as
with
the
wattle
of
carriers
and
the
enlarged
crop
of
pouters
*punct* .
*break*
now
let
us
turn
to
nature
*punct* .
*break*
when
a
part
has
been
developed
in
an
extraordinary
manner
in
any
one
species
*punct* ,
compared
with
the
other
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
we
may
conclude
that
this
part
has
undergone
an
extraordinary
amount
of
modification
*punct* ,
since
the
period
when
the
species
branched
off
from
the
common
progenitor
of
the
genus
*punct* .
*break*
this
period
will
seldom
be
remote
in
any
extreme
degree
*punct* ,
as
species
very
rarely
endure
for
more
than
one
geological
period
*punct* .
*break*
an
extraordinary
amount
of
modification
implies
an
unusually
large
and
long-continued
amount
of
variability
*punct* ,
which
has
continually
been
accumulated
by
natural
selection
for
the
benefit
of
the
species
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
the
variability
of
the
extraordinarily-developed
part
or
organ
has
been
so
great
and
long-continued
within
a
period
not
excessively
remote
*punct* ,
we
might
*punct* ,
as
a
general
rule
*punct* ,
expect
still
to
find
more
variability
in
such
parts
than
in
other
parts
of
the
organisation
*punct* ,
which
have
remained
for
a
much
longer
period
nearly
constant
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
*punct* ,
i
am
convinced
*punct* ,
is
the
case
*punct* .
*break*
that
the
struggle
between
natural
selection
on
the
one
hand
*punct* ,
and
the
tendency
to
reversion
and
variability
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
will
in
the
course
of
time
cease
*punct* ;
and
that
the
most
abnormally
developed
organs
may
be
made
constant
*punct* ,
i
can
see
no
reason
to
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
hence
when
an
organ
*punct* ,
however
abnormal
it
may
be
*punct* ,
has
been
transmitted
in
approximately
the
same
condition
to
many
modified
descendants
*punct* ,
as
in
the
case
of
the
wing
of
the
bat
*punct* ,
it
must
have
existed
*punct* ,
according
to
my
theory
*punct* ,
for
an
immense
period
in
nearly
the
same
state
*punct* ;
and
thus
it
comes
to
be
no
more
variable
than
any
other
structure
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
only
in
those
cases
in
which
the
modification
has
been
comparatively
recent
and
extraordinarily
great
that
we
ought
to
find
the
generative
variability
*punct* ,
as
it
may
be
called
*punct* ,
still
present
in
a
high
degree
*punct* .
*break*
for
in
this
case
the
variability
will
seldom
as
yet
have
been
fixed
by
the
continued
selection
of
the
individuals
varying
in
the
required
manner
and
degree
*punct* ,
and
by
the
continued
rejection
of
those
tending
to
revert
to
a
former
and
less
modified
condition
*punct* .
*break*
the
principle
included
in
these
remarks
may
be
extended
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
notorious
that
specific
characters
are
more
variable
than
generic
*punct* .
*break*
to
explain
by
a
simple
example
what
is
meant
*punct* .
*break*
if
some
species
in
a
large
genus
of
plants
had
blue
flowers
and
some
had
red
*punct* ,
the
colour
would
be
only
a
specific
character
*punct* ,
and
no
one
would
be
surprised
at
one
of
the
blue
species
varying
into
red
*punct* ,
or
conversely
*punct* ;
but
if
all
the
species
had
blue
flowers
*punct* ,
the
colour
would
become
a
generic
character
*punct* ,
and
its
variation
would
be
a
more
unusual
circumstance
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
chosen
this
example
because
an
explanation
is
not
in
this
case
applicable
*punct* ,
which
most
naturalists
would
advance
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
specific
characters
are
more
variable
than
generic
*punct* ,
because
they
are
taken
from
parts
of
less
physiological
importance
than
those
commonly
used
for
classing
genera
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
this
explanation
is
partly
*punct* ,
yet
only
indirectly
*punct* ,
true
*punct* ;
i
shall
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
have
to
return
to
this
subject
in
our
chapter
on
classification
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
almost
superfluous
to
adduce
evidence
in
support
of
the
above
statement
*punct* ,
that
specific
characters
are
more
variable
than
generic
*punct* ;
but
i
have
repeatedly
noticed
in
works
on
natural
history
*punct* ,
that
when
an
author
has
remarked
with
surprise
that
some
important
organ
or
part
*punct* ,
which
is
generally
very
constant
throughout
large
groups
of
species
*punct* ,
has
differed
considerably
in
closely-allied
species
*punct* ,
that
it
has
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
been
variable
in
the
individuals
of
some
of
the
species
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
fact
shows
that
a
character
*punct* ,
which
is
generally
of
generic
value
*punct* ,
when
it
sinks
in
value
and
becomes
only
of
specific
value
*punct* ,
often
becomes
variable
*punct* ,
though
its
physiological
importance
may
remain
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
something
of
the
same
kind
applies
to
monstrosities
*punct* :
at
least
is
*punct* .
*break*
hilaire
seems
to
entertain
no
doubt
*punct* ,
that
the
more
an
organ
normally
differs
in
the
different
species
of
the
same
group
*punct* ,
the
more
subject
it
is
to
individual
anomalies
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
ordinary
view
of
each
species
having
been
independently
created
*punct* ,
why
should
that
part
of
the
structure
*punct* ,
which
differs
from
the
same
part
in
other
independently-created
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
be
more
variable
than
those
parts
which
are
closely
alike
in
the
several
species
*punct* ?
*break*
i
do
not
see
that
any
explanation
can
be
given
*punct* .
*break*
but
on
the
view
of
species
being
only
strongly
marked
and
fixed
varieties
*punct* ,
we
might
surely
expect
to
find
them
still
often
continuing
to
vary
in
those
parts
of
their
structure
which
have
varied
within
a
moderately
recent
period
*punct* ,
and
which
have
thus
come
to
differ
*punct* .
*break*
or
to
state
the
case
in
another
manner:
*punct* ,
the
points
in
which
all
the
species
of
a
genus
resemble
each
other
*punct* ,
and
in
which
they
differ
from
the
species
of
some
other
genus
*punct* ,
are
called
generic
characters
*punct* ;
and
these
characters
in
common
i
attribute
to
inheritance
from
a
common
progenitor
*punct* ,
for
it
can
rarely
have
happened
that
natural
selection
will
have
modified
several
species
*punct* ,
fitted
to
more
or
less
widely-different
habits
*punct* ,
in
exactly
the
same
manner
*punct* :
and
as
these
so-called
generic
characters
have
been
inherited
from
a
remote
period
*punct* ,
since
that
period
when
the
species
first
branched
off
from
their
common
progenitor
*punct* ,
and
subsequently
have
not
varied
or
come
to
differ
in
any
degree
*punct* ,
or
only
in
a
slight
degree
*punct* ,
it
is
not
probable
that
they
should
vary
at
the
present
day
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
the
points
in
which
species
differ
from
other
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
are
called
specific
characters
*punct* ;
and
as
these
specific
characters
have
varied
and
come
to
differ
within
the
period
of
the
branching
off
of
the
species
from
a
common
progenitor
*punct* ,
it
is
probable
that
they
should
still
often
be
in
some
degree
variable,
*punct* ,
at
least
more
variable
than
those
parts
of
the
organisation
which
have
for
a
very
long
period
remained
constant
*punct* .
*break*
in
connexion
with
the
present
subject
*punct* ,
i
will
make
only
two
other
remarks
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
it
will
be
admitted
*punct* ,
without
my
entering
on
details
*punct* ,
that
secondary
sexual
characters
are
very
variable
*punct* ;
i
think
it
also
will
be
admitted
that
species
of
the
same
group
differ
from
each
other
more
widely
in
their
secondary
sexual
characters
*punct* ,
than
in
other
parts
of
their
organisation
*punct* ;
compare
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
amount
of
difference
between
the
males
of
gallinaceous
birds
*punct* ,
in
which
secondary
sexual
characters
are
strongly
displayed
*punct* ,
with
the
amount
of
difference
between
their
females
*punct* ;
and
the
truth
of
this
proposition
will
be
granted
*punct* .
*break*
the
cause
of
the
original
variability
of
secondary
sexual
characters
is
not
manifest
*punct* ;
but
we
can
see
why
these
characters
should
not
have
been
rendered
as
constant
and
uniform
as
other
parts
of
the
organisation
*punct* ;
for
secondary
sexual
characters
have
been
accumulated
by
sexual
selection
*punct* ,
which
is
less
rigid
in
its
action
than
ordinary
selection
*punct* ,
as
it
does
not
entail
death
*punct* ,
but
only
gives
fewer
offspring
to
the
less
favoured
males
*punct* .
*break*
whatever
the
cause
may
be
of
the
variability
of
secondary
sexual
characters
*punct* ,
as
they
are
highly
variable
*punct* ,
sexual
selection
will
have
had
a
wide
scope
for
action
*punct* ,
and
may
thus
readily
have
succeeded
in
giving
to
the
species
of
the
same
group
a
greater
amount
of
difference
in
their
sexual
characters
*punct* ,
than
in
other
parts
of
their
structure
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
*punct* ,
that
the
secondary
sexual
differences
between
the
two
sexes
of
the
same
species
are
generally
displayed
in
the
very
same
parts
of
the
organisation
in
which
the
different
species
of
the
same
genus
differ
from
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
of
this
fact
i
will
give
in
illustration
two
instances
*punct* ,
the
first
which
happen
to
stand
on
my
list
*punct* ;
and
as
the
differences
in
these
cases
are
of
a
very
unusual
nature
*punct* ,
the
relation
can
hardly
be
accidental
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
number
of
joints
in
the
tarsi
is
a
character
generally
common
to
very
large
groups
of
beetles
*punct* ,
but
in
the
engidae
*punct* ,
as
westwood
has
remarked
*punct* ,
the
number
varies
greatly
*punct* ;
and
the
number
likewise
differs
in
the
two
sexes
of
the
same
species
*punct* :
again
in
fossorial
hymenoptera
*punct* ,
the
manner
of
neuration
of
the
wings
is
a
character
of
the
highest
importance
*punct* ,
because
common
to
large
groups
*punct* ;
but
in
certain
genera
the
neuration
differs
in
the
different
species
*punct* ,
and
likewise
in
the
two
sexes
of
the
same
species
*punct* .
*break*
this
relation
has
a
clear
meaning
on
my
view
of
the
subject
*punct* :
i
look
at
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
as
having
as
certainly
descended
from
the
same
progenitor
*punct* ,
as
have
the
two
sexes
of
any
one
of
the
species
*punct* .
*break*
consequently
*punct* ,
whatever
part
of
the
structure
of
the
common
progenitor
*punct* ,
or
of
its
early
descendants
*punct* ,
became
variable
*punct* ;
variations
of
this
part
would
it
is
highly
probable
*punct* ,
be
taken
advantage
of
by
natural
and
sexual
selection
*punct* ,
in
order
to
fit
the
several
species
to
their
several
places
in
the
economy
of
nature
*punct* ,
and
likewise
to
fit
the
two
sexes
of
the
same
species
to
each
other
*punct* ,
or
to
fit
the
males
and
females
to
different
habits
of
life
*punct* ,
or
the
males
to
struggle
with
other
males
for
the
possession
of
the
females
*punct* .
*break*
finally
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
i
conclude
that
the
greater
variability
of
specific
characters
*punct* ,
or
those
which
distinguish
species
from
species
*punct* ,
than
of
generic
characters
*punct* ,
or
those
which
the
species
possess
in
common;
*punct* ,
that
the
frequent
extreme
variability
of
any
part
which
is
developed
in
a
species
in
an
extraordinary
manner
in
comparison
with
the
same
part
in
its
congeners
*punct* ;
and
the
not
great
degree
of
variability
in
a
part
*punct* ,
however
extraordinarily
it
may
be
developed
*punct* ,
if
it
be
common
to
a
whole
group
of
species;
*punct* ,
that
the
great
variability
of
secondary
sexual
characters
*punct* ,
and
the
great
amount
of
difference
in
these
same
characters
between
closely
allied
species;
*punct* ,
that
secondary
sexual
and
ordinary
specific
differences
are
generally
displayed
in
the
same
parts
of
the
organisation,
*punct* ,
are
all
principles
closely
connected
together
*punct* .
*break*
all
being
mainly
due
to
the
species
of
the
same
group
having
descended
from
a
common
progenitor
*punct* ,
from
whom
they
have
inherited
much
in
common,
*punct* ,
to
parts
which
have
recently
and
largely
varied
being
more
likely
still
to
go
on
varying
than
parts
which
have
long
been
inherited
and
have
not
varied,
*punct* ,
to
natural
selection
having
more
or
less
completely
*punct* ,
according
to
the
lapse
of
time
*punct* ,
overmastered
the
tendency
to
reversion
and
to
further
variability,
*punct* ,
to
sexual
selection
being
less
rigid
than
ordinary
selection,
*punct* ,
and
to
variations
in
the
same
parts
having
been
accumulated
by
natural
and
sexual
selection
*punct* ,
and
thus
adapted
for
secondary
sexual
*punct* ,
and
for
ordinary
specific
purposes
*punct* .
*break*
distinct
species
present
analogous
variations
*punct* ;
and
a
variety
of
one
species
often
assumes
some
of
the
characters
of
an
allied
species
*punct* ,
or
reverts
to
some
of
the
characters
of
an
early
progenitor.
*punct* ,
these
propositions
will
be
most
readily
understood
by
looking
to
our
domestic
races
*punct* .
*break*
the
most
distinct
breeds
of
pigeons
*punct* ,
in
countries
most
widely
apart
*punct* ,
present
sub-varieties
with
reversed
feathers
on
the
head
and
feathers
on
the
feet,
*punct* ,
characters
not
possessed
by
the
aboriginal
rock-pigeon
*punct* ;
these
then
are
analogous
variations
in
two
or
more
distinct
races
*punct* .
*break*
the
frequent
presence
of
fourteen
or
even
sixteen
tail-feathers
in
the
pouter
*punct* ,
may
be
considered
as
a
variation
representing
the
normal
structure
of
another
race
*punct* ,
the
fantail
*punct* .
*break*
i
presume
that
no
one
will
doubt
that
all
such
analogous
variations
are
due
to
the
several
races
of
the
pigeon
having
inherited
from
a
common
parent
the
same
constitution
and
tendency
to
variation
*punct* ,
when
acted
on
by
similar
unknown
influences
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
we
have
a
case
of
analogous
variation
*punct* ,
in
the
enlarged
stems
*punct* ,
or
roots
as
commonly
called
*punct* ,
of
the
swedish
turnip
and
ruta
baga
*punct* ,
plants
which
several
botanists
rank
as
varieties
produced
by
cultivation
from
a
common
parent
*punct* :
if
this
be
not
so
*punct* ,
the
case
will
then
be
one
of
analogous
variation
in
two
so-called
distinct
species
*punct* ;
and
to
these
a
third
may
be
added
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
the
common
turnip
*punct* .
*break*
according
to
the
ordinary
view
of
each
species
having
been
independently
created
*punct* ,
we
should
have
to
attribute
this
similarity
in
the
enlarged
stems
of
these
three
plants
*punct* ,
not
to
the
vera
causa
of
community
of
descent
*punct* ,
and
a
consequent
tendency
to
vary
in
a
like
manner
*punct* ,
but
to
three
separate
yet
closely
related
acts
of
creation
*punct* .
*break*
with
pigeons
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
we
have
another
case
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
the
occasional
appearance
in
all
the
breeds
*punct* ,
of
slaty-blue
birds
with
two
black
bars
on
the
wings
*punct* ,
a
white
rump
*punct* ,
a
bar
at
the
end
of
the
tail
*punct* ,
with
the
outer
feathers
externally
edged
near
their
bases
with
white
*punct* .
*break*
as
all
these
marks
are
characteristic
of
the
parent
rock-pigeon
*punct* ,
i
presume
that
no
one
will
doubt
that
this
is
a
case
of
reversion
*punct* ,
and
not
of
a
new
yet
analogous
variation
appearing
in
the
several
breeds
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
i
think
confidently
come
to
this
conclusion
*punct* ,
because
*punct* ,
as
we
have
seen
*punct* ,
these
coloured
marks
are
eminently
liable
to
appear
in
the
crossed
offspring
of
two
distinct
and
differently
coloured
breeds
*punct* ;
and
in
this
case
there
is
nothing
in
the
external
conditions
of
life
to
cause
the
reappearance
of
the
slaty-blue
*punct* ,
with
the
several
marks
*punct* ,
beyond
the
influence
of
the
mere
act
of
crossing
on
the
laws
of
inheritance
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
it
is
a
very
surprising
fact
that
characters
should
reappear
after
having
been
lost
for
many
*punct* ,
perhaps
for
hundreds
of
generations
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
a
breed
has
been
crossed
only
once
by
some
other
breed
*punct* ,
the
offspring
occasionally
show
a
tendency
to
revert
in
character
to
the
foreign
breed
for
many
generations
*punct* ,
some
say
*punct* ,
for
a
dozen
or
even
a
score
of
generations
*punct* .
*break*
after
twelve
generations
*punct* ,
the
proportion
of
blood
*punct* ,
to
use
a
common
expression
*punct* ,
of
any
one
ancestor
*punct* ,
is
only
1
in
2048
*punct* ;
and
yet
*punct* ,
as
we
see
*punct* ,
it
is
generally
believed
that
a
tendency
to
reversion
is
retained
by
this
very
small
proportion
of
foreign
blood
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
breed
which
has
not
been
crossed
*punct* ,
but
in
which
both
parents
have
lost
some
character
which
their
progenitor
possessed
*punct* ,
the
tendency
*punct* ,
whether
strong
or
weak
*punct* ,
to
reproduce
the
lost
character
might
be
*punct* ,
as
was
formerly
remarked
*punct* ,
for
all
that
we
can
see
to
the
contrary
*punct* ,
transmitted
for
almost
any
number
of
generations
*punct* .
*break*
when
a
character
which
has
been
lost
in
a
breed
*punct* ,
reappears
after
a
great
number
of
generations
*punct* ,
the
most
probable
hypothesis
is
*punct* ,
not
that
the
offspring
suddenly
takes
after
an
ancestor
some
hundred
generations
distant
*punct* ,
but
that
in
each
successive
generation
there
has
been
a
tendency
to
reproduce
the
character
in
question
*punct* ,
which
at
last
*punct* ,
under
unknown
favourable
conditions
*punct* ,
gai
ns
an
ascendancy
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
it
is
probable
that
in
each
generation
of
the
barb-pigeon
*punct* ,
which
produces
most
rarely
a
blue
and
black-barred
bird
*punct* ,
there
has
been
a
tendency
in
each
generation
in
the
plumage
to
assume
this
colour
*punct* .
*break*
this
view
is
hypothetical
*punct* ,
but
could
be
supported
by
some
facts
*punct* ;
and
i
can
see
no
more
abstract
improbability
in
a
tendency
to
produce
any
character
being
inherited
for
an
endless
number
of
generations
*punct* ,
than
in
quite
useless
or
rudimentary
organs
being
*punct* ,
as
we
all
know
them
to
be
*punct* ,
thus
inherited
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
we
may
sometimes
observe
a
mere
tendency
to
produce
a
rudiment
inherited
*punct* :
for
instance
*punct* ,
in
the
common
snapdragon
*punct* ,
antirrhinum
*punct* ,
a
rudiment
of
a
fifth
stamen
so
often
appears
*punct* ,
that
this
plant
must
have
an
inherited
tendency
to
produce
it
*punct* .
*break*
as
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
are
supposed
*punct* ,
on
my
theory
*punct* ,
to
have
descended
from
a
common
parent
*punct* ,
it
might
be
expected
that
they
would
occasionally
vary
in
an
analogous
manner
*punct* ;
so
that
a
variety
of
one
species
would
resemble
in
some
of
its
characters
another
species
*punct* ;
this
other
species
being
on
my
view
only
a
well-marked
and
permanent
variety
*punct* .
*break*
but
characters
thus
gained
would
probably
be
of
an
unimportant
nature
*punct* ,
for
the
presence
of
all
important
characters
will
be
governed
by
natural
selection
*punct* ,
in
accordance
with
the
diverse
habits
of
the
species
*punct* ,
and
will
not
be
left
to
the
mutual
action
of
the
conditions
of
life
and
of
a
similar
inherited
constitution
*punct* .
*break*
it
might
further
be
expected
that
the
species
of
the
same
genus
would
occasionally
exhibit
reversions
to
lost
ancestral
characters
*punct* .
*break*
as
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
we
never
know
the
exact
character
of
the
common
ancestor
of
a
group
*punct* ,
we
could
not
distinguish
these
two
cases
*punct* :
if
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
we
did
not
know
that
the
rock-pigeon
was
not
feather-footed
or
turn-crowned
*punct* ,
we
could
not
have
told
*punct* ,
whether
these
characters
in
our
domestic
breeds
were
reversions
or
only
analogous
variations
*punct* ;
but
we
might
have
inferred
that
the
blueness
was
a
case
of
reversion
*punct* ,
from
the
number
of
the
markings
*punct* ,
which
are
correlated
with
the
blue
tint
*punct* ,
and
which
it
does
not
appear
probable
would
all
appear
together
from
simple
variation
*punct* .
*break*
more
especially
we
might
have
inferred
this
*punct* ,
from
the
blue
colour
and
marks
so
often
appearing
when
distinct
breeds
of
diverse
colours
are
crossed
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
though
under
nature
it
must
generally
be
left
doubtful
*punct* ,
what
cases
are
reversions
to
an
anciently
existing
character
*punct* ,
and
what
are
new
but
analogous
variations
*punct* ,
yet
we
ought
*punct* ,
on
my
theory
*punct* ,
sometimes
to
find
the
varying
offspring
of
a
species
assuming
characters
*punct* ,
either
from
reversion
or
from
analogous
variation
*punct* ,
which
already
occur
in
some
other
members
of
the
same
group
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
undoubtedly
is
the
case
in
nature
*punct* .
*break*
a
considerable
part
of
the
difficulty
in
recognising
a
variable
species
in
our
systematic
works
*punct* ,
is
due
to
its
varieties
mocking
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ,
some
of
the
other
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* .
*break*
a
considerable
catalogue
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
could
be
given
of
forms
intermediate
between
two
other
forms
*punct* ,
which
themselves
must
be
doubtfully
ranked
as
either
varieties
or
species
*punct* ;
and
this
shows
*punct* ,
unless
all
these
forms
be
considered
as
independently
created
species
*punct* ,
that
the
one
in
varying
has
assumed
some
of
the
characters
of
the
other
*punct* ,
so
as
to
produce
the
intermediate
form
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
best
evidence
is
afforded
by
parts
or
organs
of
an
important
and
uniform
nature
occasionally
varying
so
as
to
acquire
*punct* ,
in
some
degree
*punct* ,
the
character
of
the
same
part
or
organ
in
an
allied
species
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
collected
a
long
list
of
such
cases
*punct* ;
but
here
*punct* ,
as
before
*punct* ,
i
lie
under
a
great
disadvantage
in
not
being
able
to
give
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
only
repeat
that
such
cases
certainly
do
occur
*punct* ,
and
seem
to
me
very
remarkable
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
give
one
curious
and
complex
case
*punct* ,
not
indeed
as
affecting
any
important
character
*punct* ,
but
from
occurring
in
several
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
partly
under
domestication
and
partly
under
nature
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
case
apparently
of
reversion
*punct* .
*break*
the
ass
not
rarely
has
very
distinct
transverse
bars
on
its
legs
*punct* ,
like
those
on
the
legs
of
a
zebra
*punct* :
it
has
been
asserted
that
these
are
plainest
in
the
foal
*punct* ,
and
from
inquiries
which
i
have
made
*punct* ,
i
believe
this
to
be
true
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
also
been
asserted
that
the
stripe
on
each
shoulder
is
sometimes
double
*punct* .
*break*
the
shoulder
stripe
is
certainly
very
variable
in
length
and
outline
*punct* .
*break*
a
white
ass
*punct* ,
but
not
an
albino
*punct* ,
has
been
described
without
either
spinal
or
shoulder-stripe
*punct* ;
and
these
stripes
are
sometimes
very
obscure
*punct* ,
or
actually
quite
lost
*punct* ,
in
dark-coloured
asses
*punct* .
*break*
the
koulan
of
pallas
is
said
to
have
been
seen
with
a
double
shoulder-stripe
*punct* .
*break*
the
hemionus
has
no
shoulder-stripe
*punct* ;
but
traces
of
it
*punct* ,
as
stated
by
mr.
blyth
and
others
*punct* ,
occasionally
appear
*punct* :
and
i
have
been
informed
by
colonel
poole
that
foals
of
this
species
are
generally
striped
on
the
legs
*punct* ,
and
faintly
on
the
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
the
quagga
*punct* ,
though
so
plainly
barred
like
a
zebra
over
the
body
*punct* ,
is
without
bars
on
the
legs
*punct* ;
but
dr.
gray
has
figured
one
specimen
with
very
distinct
zebra-like
bars
on
the
hocks
*punct* .
*break*
with
respect
to
the
horse
*punct* ,
i
have
collected
cases
in
england
of
the
spinal
stripe
in
horses
of
the
most
distinct
breeds
*punct* ,
and
of
all
colours
*punct* ;
transverse
bars
on
the
legs
are
not
rare
in
duns
*punct* ,
mouse-duns
*punct* ,
and
in
one
instance
in
a
chestnut
*punct* :
a
faint
shoulder-stripe
may
sometimes
be
seen
in
duns
*punct* ,
and
i
have
seen
a
trace
in
a
bay
horse
*punct* .
*break*
my
son
made
a
careful
examination
and
sketch
for
me
of
a
dun
belgian
cart-horse
with
a
double
stripe
on
each
shoulder
and
with
leg-stripes
*punct* ;
and
a
man
*punct* ,
whom
i
can
implicitly
trust
*punct* ,
has
examined
for
me
a
small
dun
welch
pony
with
three
short
parallel
stripes
on
each
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
north-west
part
of
india
the
kattywar
breed
of
horses
is
so
generally
striped
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
as
i
hear
from
colonel
poole
*punct* ,
who
examined
the
breed
for
the
indian
government
*punct* ,
a
horse
without
stripes
is
not
considered
as
purely-bred
*punct* .
*break*
the
spine
is
always
striped
*punct* ;
the
legs
are
generally
barred
*punct* ;
and
the
shoulder-stripe
*punct* ,
which
is
sometimes
double
and
sometimes
treble
*punct* ,
is
common
*punct* ;
the
side
of
the
face
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
is
sometimes
striped
*punct* .
*break*
the
stripes
are
plainest
in
the
foal
*punct* ;
and
sometimes
quite
disappear
in
old
horses
*punct* .
*break*
colonel
poole
has
seen
both
gray
and
bay
kattywar
horses
striped
when
first
foaled
*punct* .
*break*
edwards
*punct* ,
that
with
the
english
race-horse
the
spinal
stripe
is
much
commoner
in
the
foal
than
in
the
full-grown
animal
*punct* .
*break*
without
here
entering
on
further
details
*punct* ,
i
may
state
that
i
have
collected
cases
of
leg
and
shoulder
stripes
in
horses
of
very
different
breeds
*punct* ,
in
various
countries
from
britain
to
eastern
china
*punct* ;
and
from
norway
in
the
north
to
the
malay
archipelago
in
the
south
*punct* .
*break*
in
all
parts
of
the
world
these
stripes
occur
far
oftenest
in
duns
and
mouse-duns
*punct* ;
by
the
term
dun
a
large
range
of
colour
is
included
*punct* ,
from
one
between
brown
and
black
to
a
close
approach
to
cream-colour
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
aware
that
colonel
hamilton
smith
*punct* ,
who
has
written
on
this
subject
*punct* ,
believes
that
the
several
breeds
of
the
horse
have
descended
from
several
aboriginal
species
*punct* ,
one
of
which
*punct* ,
the
dun
*punct* ,
was
striped
*punct* ;
and
that
the
above-described
appearances
are
all
due
to
ancient
crosses
with
the
dun
stock
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
am
not
at
all
satisfied
with
this
theory
*punct* ,
and
should
be
loth
to
apply
it
to
breeds
so
distinct
as
the
heavy
belgian
cart-horse
*punct* ,
welch
ponies
*punct* ,
cobs
*punct* ,
the
lanky
kattywar
race
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
inhabiting
the
most
distant
parts
of
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
now
let
us
turn
to
the
effects
of
crossing
the
several
species
of
the
horse-genus
*punct* .
*break*
rollin
asserts
*punct* ,
that
the
common
mule
from
the
ass
and
horse
is
particularly
apt
to
have
bars
on
its
legs
*punct* .
*break*
martin
*punct* ,
in
his
excellent
treatise
on
the
horse
*punct* ,
has
given
a
figure
of
a
similar
mule
*punct* .
*break*
in
four
coloured
drawings
*punct* ,
which
i
have
seen
*punct* ,
of
hybrids
between
the
ass
and
zebra
*punct* ,
the
legs
were
much
more
plainly
barred
than
the
rest
of
the
body
*punct* ;
and
in
one
of
them
there
was
a
double
shoulder-stripe
*punct* .
*break*
in
lord
moreton's
famous
hybrid
from
a
chestnut
mare
and
male
quagga
*punct* ,
the
hybrid
*punct* ,
and
even
the
pure
offspring
subsequently
produced
from
the
mare
by
a
black
arabian
sire
*punct* ,
were
much
more
plainly
barred
across
the
legs
than
is
even
the
pure
quagga
*punct* .
*break*
lastly
*punct* ,
and
this
is
another
most
remarkable
case
*punct* ,
a
hybrid
has
been
figured
by
dr.
gray
*punct* ,
and
he
informs
me
that
he
knows
of
a
second
case
*punct* ,
from
the
ass
and
the
hemionus
*punct* ;
and
this
hybrid
*punct* ,
though
the
ass
seldom
has
stripes
on
its
legs
and
the
hemionus
has
none
and
has
not
even
a
shoulder-stripe
*punct* ,
nevertheless
had
all
four
legs
barred
*punct* ,
and
had
three
short
shoulder-stripes
*punct* ,
like
those
on
the
dun
welch
pony
*punct* ,
and
even
had
some
zebra-like
stripes
on
the
sides
of
its
face
*punct* .
*break*
with
respect
to
this
last
fact
*punct* ,
i
was
so
convinced
that
not
even
a
stripe
of
colour
appears
from
what
would
commonly
be
called
an
accident
*punct* ,
that
i
was
led
solely
from
the
occurrence
of
the
face-stripes
on
this
hybrid
from
the
ass
and
hemionus
*punct* ,
to
ask
colonel
poole
whether
such
face-stripes
ever
occur
in
the
eminently
striped
kattywar
breed
of
horses
*punct* ,
and
was
*punct* ,
as
we
have
seen
*punct* ,
answered
in
the
affirmative
*punct* .
*break*
what
now
are
we
to
say
to
these
several
facts
*punct* ?
*break*
we
see
several
very
distinct
species
of
the
horse-genus
becoming
*punct* ,
by
simple
variation
*punct* ,
striped
on
the
legs
like
a
zebra
*punct* ,
or
striped
on
the
shoulders
like
an
ass
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
horse
we
see
this
tendency
strong
whenever
a
dun
tint
appears
*punct* ,
a
tint
which
approaches
to
that
of
the
general
colouring
of
the
other
species
of
the
genus
*punct* .
*break*
the
appearance
of
the
stripes
is
not
accompanied
by
any
change
of
form
or
by
any
other
new
character
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
this
tendency
to
become
striped
most
strongly
displayed
in
hybrids
from
between
several
of
the
most
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
now
observe
the
case
of
the
several
breeds
of
pigeons
*punct* :
they
are
descended
from
a
pigeon
*punct* ,
including
two
or
three
sub-species
or
geographical
races
*punct* ,
of
a
bluish
colour
*punct* ,
with
certain
bars
and
other
marks
*punct* ;
and
when
any
breed
assumes
by
simple
variation
a
bluish
tint
*punct* ,
these
bars
and
other
marks
invariably
reappear
*punct* ;
but
without
any
other
change
of
form
or
character
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
oldest
and
truest
breeds
of
various
colours
are
crossed
*punct* ,
we
see
a
strong
tendency
for
the
blue
tint
and
bars
and
marks
to
reappear
in
the
mongrels
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
stated
that
the
most
probable
hypothesis
to
account
for
the
reappearance
of
very
ancient
characters
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
that
there
is
a
tendency
in
the
young
of
each
successive
generation
to
produce
the
long-lost
character
*punct* ,
and
that
this
tendency
*punct* ,
from
unknown
causes
*punct* ,
sometimes
prevails
*punct* .
*break*
and
we
have
just
seen
that
in
several
species
of
the
horse-genus
the
stripes
are
either
plainer
or
appear
more
commonly
in
the
young
than
in
the
old
*punct* .
*break*
call
the
breeds
of
pigeons
*punct* ,
some
of
which
have
bred
true
for
centuries
*punct* ,
species
*punct* ;
and
how
exactly
parallel
is
the
case
with
that
of
the
species
of
the
horse-genus
*punct* !
*break*
for
myself
*punct* ,
i
venture
confidently
to
look
back
thousands
on
thousands
of
generations
*punct* ,
and
i
see
an
animal
striped
like
a
zebra
*punct* ,
but
perhaps
otherwise
very
differently
constructed
*punct* ,
the
common
parent
of
our
domestic
horse
*punct* ,
whether
or
not
it
be
descended
from
one
or
more
wild
stocks
*punct* ,
of
the
ass
*punct* ,
the
hemionus
*punct* ,
quagga
*punct* ,
and
zebra
*punct* .
*break*
he
who
believes
that
each
equine
species
was
independently
created
*punct* ,
will
*punct* ,
i
presume
*punct* ,
assert
that
each
species
has
been
created
with
a
tendency
to
vary
*punct* ,
both
under
nature
and
under
domestication
*punct* ,
in
this
particular
manner
*punct* ,
so
as
often
to
become
striped
like
other
species
of
the
genus
*punct* ;
and
that
each
has
been
created
with
a
strong
tendency
*punct* ,
when
crossed
with
species
inhabiting
distant
quarters
of
the
world
*punct* ,
to
produce
hybrids
resembling
in
their
stripes
*punct* ,
not
their
own
parents
*punct* ,
but
other
species
of
the
genus
*punct* .
*break*
to
admit
this
view
is
*punct* ,
as
it
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
to
reject
a
real
for
an
unreal
*punct* ,
or
at
least
for
an
unknown
*punct* ,
cause
*punct* .
*break*
it
makes
the
works
of
god
a
mere
mockery
and
deception
*punct* ;
i
would
almost
as
soon
believe
with
the
old
and
ignorant
cosmogonists
*punct* ,
that
fossil
shells
had
never
lived
*punct* ,
but
had
been
created
in
stone
so
as
to
mock
the
shells
now
living
on
the
sea-shore
*punct* .
*break*
summary.
*punct* ,
our
ignorance
of
the
laws
of
variation
is
profound
*punct* .
*break*
not
in
one
case
out
of
a
hundred
can
we
pretend
to
assign
any
reason
why
this
or
that
part
differs
*punct* ,
more
or
less
*punct* ,
from
the
same
part
in
the
parents
*punct* .
*break*
but
whenever
we
have
the
means
of
instituting
a
comparison
*punct* ,
the
same
laws
appear
to
have
acted
in
producing
the
lesser
differences
between
varieties
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
and
the
greater
differences
between
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* .
*break*
the
external
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
as
climate
and
food
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
seem
to
have
induced
some
slight
modifications
*punct* .
*break*
habit
in
producing
constitutional
differences
*punct* ,
and
use
in
strengthening
*punct* ,
and
disuse
in
weakening
and
diminishing
organs
*punct* ,
seem
to
have
been
more
potent
in
their
effects
*punct* .
*break*
homologous
parts
tend
to
vary
in
the
same
way
*punct* ,
and
homologous
parts
tend
to
cohere
*punct* .
*break*
modifications
in
hard
parts
and
in
external
parts
sometimes
affect
softer
and
internal
parts
*punct* .
*break*
when
one
part
is
largely
developed
*punct* ,
perhaps
it
tends
to
draw
nourishment
from
the
adjoining
parts
*punct* ;
and
every
part
of
the
structure
which
can
be
saved
without
detriment
to
the
individual
*punct* ,
will
be
saved
*punct* .
*break*
changes
of
structure
at
an
early
age
will
generally
affect
parts
subsequently
developed
*punct* ;
and
there
are
very
many
other
correlations
of
growth
*punct* ,
the
nature
of
which
we
are
utterly
unable
to
understand
*punct* .
*break*
multiple
parts
are
variable
in
number
and
in
structure
*punct* ,
perhaps
arising
from
such
parts
not
having
been
closely
specialised
to
any
particular
function
*punct* ,
so
that
their
modifications
have
not
been
closely
checked
by
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
probably
from
this
same
cause
that
organic
beings
low
in
the
scale
of
nature
are
more
variable
than
those
which
have
their
whole
organisation
more
specialised
*punct* ,
and
are
higher
in
the
scale
*punct* .
*break*
rudimentary
organs
*punct* ,
from
being
useless
*punct* ,
will
be
disregarded
by
natural
selection
*punct* ,
and
hence
probably
are
variable
*punct* .
*break*
specific
characters
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
the
characters
which
have
come
to
differ
since
the
several
species
of
the
same
genus
branched
off
from
a
common
parent
*punct* ,
are
more
variable
than
generic
characters
*punct* ,
or
those
which
have
long
been
inherited
*punct* ,
and
have
not
differed
within
this
same
period
*punct* .
*break*
in
these
remarks
we
have
referred
to
special
parts
or
organs
being
still
variable
*punct* ,
because
they
have
recently
varied
and
thus
come
to
differ
*punct* ;
but
we
have
also
seen
in
the
second
chapter
that
the
same
principle
applies
to
the
whole
individual
*punct* ;
for
in
a
district
where
many
species
of
any
genus
are
found
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
where
there
has
been
much
former
variation
and
differentiation
*punct* ,
or
where
the
manufactory
of
new
specific
forms
has
been
actively
at
work
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ,
on
an
average
*punct* ,
we
now
find
most
varieties
or
incipient
species
*punct* .
*break*
secondary
sexual
characters
are
highly
variable
*punct* ,
and
such
characters
differ
much
in
the
species
of
the
same
group
*punct* .
*break*
variability
in
the
same
parts
of
the
organisation
has
generally
been
taken
advantage
of
in
giving
secondary
sexual
differences
to
the
sexes
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
and
specific
differences
to
the
several
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* .
*break*
any
part
or
organ
developed
to
an
extraordinary
size
or
in
an
extraordinary
manner
*punct* ,
in
comparison
with
the
same
part
or
organ
in
the
allied
species
*punct* ,
must
have
gone
through
an
extraordinary
amount
of
modification
since
the
genus
arose
*punct* ;
and
thus
we
can
understand
why
it
should
often
still
be
variable
in
a
much
higher
degree
than
other
parts
*punct* ;
for
variation
is
a
long-continued
and
slow
process
*punct* ,
and
natural
selection
will
in
such
cases
not
as
yet
have
had
time
to
overcome
the
tendency
to
further
variability
and
to
reversion
to
a
less
modified
state
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
a
species
with
any
extraordinarily-developed
organ
has
become
the
parent
of
many
modified
descendants
*punct* ,
which
on
my
view
must
be
a
very
slow
process
*punct* ,
requiring
a
long
lapse
of
time
*punct* ,
in
this
case
*punct* ,
natural
selection
may
readily
have
succeeded
in
giving
a
fixed
character
to
the
organ
*punct* ,
in
however
extraordinary
a
manner
it
may
be
developed
*punct* .
*break*
species
inheriting
nearly
the
same
constitution
from
a
common
parent
and
exposed
to
similar
influences
will
naturally
tend
to
present
analogous
variations
*punct* ,
and
these
same
species
may
occasionally
revert
to
some
of
the
characters
of
their
ancient
progenitors
*punct* .
*break*
although
new
and
important
modifications
may
not
arise
from
reversion
and
analogous
variation
*punct* ,
such
modifications
will
add
to
the
beautiful
and
harmonious
diversity
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
whatever
the
cause
may
be
of
each
slight
difference
in
the
offspring
from
their
parents
*punct* ,
and
a
cause
for
each
must
exist
*punct* ,
it
is
the
steady
accumulation
*punct* ,
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
of
such
differences
*punct* ,
when
beneficial
to
the
individual
*punct* ,
that
gives
rise
to
all
the
more
important
modifications
of
structure
*punct* ,
by
which
the
innumerable
beings
on
the
face
of
this
earth
are
enabled
to
struggle
with
each
other
*punct* ,
and
the
best
adapted
to
survive
*punct* .
*break*
long
before
having
arrived
at
this
part
of
my
work
*punct* ,
a
crowd
of
difficulties
will
have
occurred
to
the
reader
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
them
are
so
grave
that
to
this
day
i
can
never
reflect
on
them
without
being
staggered
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
*punct* ,
the
greater
number
are
only
apparent
*punct* ,
and
those
that
are
real
are
not
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
fatal
to
my
theory
*punct* .
*break*
these
difficulties
and
objections
may
be
classed
under
the
following
heads:
*punct* -
firstly
*punct* ,
why
*punct* ,
if
species
have
descended
from
other
species
by
insensibly
fine
gradations
*punct* ,
do
we
not
everywhere
see
innumerable
transitional
forms
*punct* ?
*break*
why
is
not
all
nature
in
confusion
instead
of
the
species
being
*punct* ,
as
we
see
them
*punct* ,
well
defined
*punct* ?
*break*
secondly
*punct* ,
is
it
possible
that
an
animal
having
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
structure
and
habits
of
a
bat
*punct* ,
could
have
been
formed
by
the
modification
of
some
animal
with
wholly
different
habits
*punct* ?
*break*
can
we
believe
that
natural
selection
could
produce
*punct* ,
on
the
one
hand
*punct* ,
organs
of
trifling
importance
*punct* ,
such
as
the
tail
of
a
giraffe
*punct* ,
which
serves
as
a
fly-flapper
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
organs
of
such
wonderful
structure
*punct* ,
as
the
eye
*punct* ,
of
which
we
hardly
as
yet
fully
understand
the
inimitable
perfection
*punct* ?
*break*
thirdly
*punct* ,
can
instincts
be
acquired
and
modified
through
natural
selection
*punct* ?
*break*
what
shall
we
say
to
so
marvellous
an
instinct
as
that
which
leads
the
bee
to
make
cells
*punct* ,
which
have
practically
anticipated
the
discoveries
of
profound
mathematicians
*punct* ?
*break*
fourthly
*punct* ,
how
can
we
account
for
species
*punct* ,
when
crossed
*punct* ,
being
sterile
and
producing
sterile
offspring
*punct* ,
whereas
*punct* ,
when
varieties
are
crossed
*punct* ,
their
fertility
is
unimpaired
*punct* ?
*break*
the
two
first
heads
shall
be
here
discussed
*punct* ,
instinct
and
hybridism
in
separate
chapters
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
absence
or
rarity
of
transitional
varieties.
*punct* ,
as
natural
selection
acts
solely
by
the
preservation
of
profitable
modifications
*punct* ,
each
new
form
will
tend
in
a
fully-stocked
country
to
take
the
place
of
*punct* ,
and
finally
to
exterminate
*punct* ,
its
own
less
improved
parent
or
other
less-favoured
forms
with
which
it
comes
into
competition
*punct* .
*break*
thus
extinction
and
natural
selection
will
*punct* ,
as
we
have
seen
*punct* ,
go
hand
in
hand
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
if
we
look
at
each
species
as
descended
from
some
other
unknown
form
*punct* ,
both
the
parent
and
all
the
transitional
varieties
will
generally
have
been
exterminated
by
the
very
process
of
formation
and
perfection
of
the
new
form
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
by
this
theory
innumerable
transitional
forms
must
have
existed
*punct* ,
why
do
we
not
find
them
embedded
in
countless
numbers
in
the
crust
of
the
earth
*punct* ?
*break*
it
will
be
much
more
convenient
to
discuss
this
question
in
the
chapter
on
the
imperfection
of
the
geological
record
*punct* ;
and
i
will
here
only
state
that
i
believe
the
answer
mainly
lies
in
the
record
being
incomparably
less
perfect
than
is
generally
supposed
*punct* ;
the
imperfection
of
the
record
being
chiefly
due
to
organic
beings
not
inhabiting
profound
depths
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
and
to
their
remains
being
embedded
and
preserved
to
a
future
age
only
in
masses
of
sediment
sufficiently
thick
and
extensive
to
withstand
an
enormous
amount
of
future
degradation
*punct* ;
and
such
fossiliferous
masses
can
be
accumulated
only
where
much
sediment
is
deposited
on
the
shallow
bed
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
whilst
it
slowly
subsides
*punct* .
*break*
these
contingencies
will
concur
only
rarely
*punct* ,
and
after
enormously
long
intervals
*punct* .
*break*
whilst
the
bed
of
the
sea
is
stationary
or
is
rising
*punct* ,
or
when
very
little
sediment
is
being
deposited
*punct* ,
there
will
be
blanks
in
our
geological
history
*punct* .
*break*
the
crust
of
the
earth
is
a
vast
museum
*punct* ;
but
the
natural
collections
have
been
made
only
at
intervals
of
time
immensely
remote
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
may
be
urged
that
when
several
closely-allied
species
inhabit
the
same
territory
we
surely
ought
to
find
at
the
present
time
many
transitional
forms
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
take
a
simple
case
*punct* :
in
travelling
from
north
to
south
over
a
continent
*punct* ,
we
generally
meet
at
successive
intervals
with
closely
allied
or
representative
species
*punct* ,
evidently
filling
nearly
the
same
place
in
the
natural
economy
of
the
land
*punct* .
*break*
these
representative
species
often
meet
and
interlock
*punct* ;
and
as
the
one
becomes
rarer
and
rarer
*punct* ,
the
other
becomes
more
and
more
frequent
*punct* ,
till
the
one
replaces
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
we
compare
these
species
where
they
intermingle
*punct* ,
they
are
generally
as
absolutely
distinct
from
each
other
in
every
detail
of
structure
as
are
specimens
taken
from
the
metropolis
inhabited
by
each
*punct* .
*break*
by
my
theory
these
allied
species
have
descended
from
a
common
parent
*punct* ;
and
during
the
process
of
modification
*punct* ,
each
has
become
adapted
to
the
conditions
of
life
of
its
own
region
*punct* ,
and
has
supplanted
and
exterminated
its
original
parent
and
all
the
transitional
varieties
between
its
past
and
present
states
*punct* .
*break*
hence
we
ought
not
to
expect
at
the
present
time
to
meet
with
numerous
transitional
varieties
in
each
region
*punct* ,
though
they
must
have
existed
there
*punct* ,
and
may
be
embedded
there
in
a
fossil
condition
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
the
intermediate
region
*punct* ,
having
intermediate
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
why
do
we
not
now
find
closely-linking
intermediate
varieties
*punct* ?
*break*
this
difficulty
for
a
long
time
quite
confounded
me
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
think
it
can
be
in
large
part
explained
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
first
place
we
should
be
extremely
cautious
in
inferring
*punct* ,
because
an
area
is
now
continuous
*punct* ,
that
it
has
been
continuous
during
a
long
period
*punct* .
*break*
geology
would
lead
us
to
believe
that
almost
every
continent
has
been
broken
up
into
islands
even
during
the
later
tertiary
periods
*punct* ;
and
in
such
islands
distinct
species
might
have
been
separately
formed
without
the
possibility
of
intermediate
varieties
existing
in
the
intermediate
zones
*punct* .
*break*
by
changes
in
the
form
of
the
land
and
of
climate
*punct* ,
marine
areas
now
continuous
must
often
have
existed
within
recent
times
in
a
far
less
continuous
and
uniform
condition
than
at
present
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
will
pass
over
this
way
of
escaping
from
the
difficulty
*punct* ;
for
i
believe
that
many
perfectly
defined
species
have
been
formed
on
strictly
continuous
areas
*punct* ;
though
i
do
not
doubt
that
the
formerly
broken
condition
of
areas
now
continuous
has
played
an
important
part
in
the
formation
of
new
species
*punct* ,
more
especially
with
freely-crossing
and
wandering
animals
*punct* .
*break*
in
looking
at
species
as
they
are
now
distributed
over
a
wide
area
*punct* ,
we
generally
find
them
tolerably
numerous
over
a
large
territory
*punct* ,
then
becoming
somewhat
abruptly
rarer
and
rarer
on
the
confines
*punct* ,
and
finally
disappearing
*punct* .
*break*
hence
the
neutral
territory
between
two
representative
species
is
generally
narrow
in
comparison
with
the
territory
proper
to
each
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
the
same
fact
in
ascending
mountains
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
it
is
quite
remarkable
how
abruptly
*punct* ,
as
alph
*punct* .
*break*
de
candolle
has
observed
*punct* ,
a
common
alpine
species
disappears
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
fact
has
been
noticed
by
forbes
in
sounding
the
depths
of
the
sea
with
the
dredge
*punct* .
*break*
to
those
who
look
at
climate
and
the
physical
conditions
of
life
as
the
all-important
elements
of
distribution
*punct* ,
these
facts
ought
to
cause
surprise
*punct* ,
as
climate
and
height
or
depth
graduate
away
insensibly
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
we
bear
in
mind
that
almost
every
species
*punct* ,
even
in
its
metropolis
*punct* ,
would
increase
immensely
in
numbers
*punct* ,
were
it
not
for
other
competing
species
*punct* ;
that
nearly
all
either
prey
on
or
serve
as
prey
for
others
*punct* ;
in
short
*punct* ,
that
each
organic
being
is
either
directly
or
indirectly
related
in
the
most
important
manner
to
other
organic
beings
*punct* ,
we
must
see
that
the
range
of
the
inhabitants
of
any
country
by
no
means
exclusively
depends
on
insensibly
changing
physical
conditions
*punct* ,
but
in
large
part
on
the
presence
of
other
species
*punct* ,
on
which
it
depends
*punct* ,
or
by
which
it
is
destroyed
*punct* ,
or
with
which
it
comes
into
competition
*punct* ;
and
as
these
species
are
already
defined
objects
*punct* ,
however
they
may
have
become
so
*punct* ,
not
blending
one
into
another
by
insensible
gradations
*punct* ,
the
range
of
any
one
species
*punct* ,
depending
as
it
does
on
the
range
of
others
*punct* ,
will
tend
to
be
sharply
defined
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
each
species
on
the
confines
of
its
range
*punct* ,
where
it
exists
in
lessened
numbers
*punct* ,
will
*punct* ,
during
fluctuations
in
the
number
of
its
enemies
or
of
its
prey
*punct* ,
or
in
the
seasons
*punct* ,
be
extremely
liable
to
utter
extermination
*punct* ;
and
thus
its
geographical
range
will
come
to
be
still
more
sharply
defined
*punct* .
*break*
if
i
am
right
in
believing
that
allied
or
representative
species
*punct* ,
when
inhabiting
a
continuous
area
*punct* ,
are
generally
so
distributed
that
each
has
a
wide
range
*punct* ,
with
a
comparatively
narrow
neutral
territory
between
them
*punct* ,
in
which
they
become
rather
suddenly
rarer
and
rarer
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
as
varieties
do
not
essentially
differ
from
species
*punct* ,
the
same
rule
will
probably
apply
to
both
*punct* ;
and
if
we
in
imagination
adapt
a
varying
species
to
a
very
large
area
*punct* ,
we
shall
have
to
adapt
two
varieties
to
two
large
areas
*punct* ,
and
a
third
variety
to
a
narrow
intermediate
zone
*punct* .
*break*
the
intermediate
variety
*punct* ,
consequently
*punct* ,
will
exist
in
lesser
numbers
from
inhabiting
a
narrow
and
lesser
area
*punct* ;
and
practically
*punct* ,
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
*punct* ,
this
rule
holds
good
with
varieties
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
met
with
striking
instances
of
the
rule
in
the
case
of
varieties
intermediate
between
well-marked
varieties
in
the
genus
balanus
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
would
appear
from
information
given
me
by
mr.
watson
*punct* ,
dr.
asa
gray
*punct* ,
and
mr.
wollaston
*punct* ,
that
generally
when
varieties
intermediate
between
two
other
forms
occur
*punct* ,
they
are
much
rarer
numerically
than
the
forms
which
they
connect
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
if
we
may
trust
these
facts
and
inferences
*punct* ,
and
therefore
conclude
that
varieties
linking
two
other
varieties
together
have
generally
existed
in
lesser
numbers
than
the
forms
which
they
connect
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
we
can
understand
why
intermediate
varieties
should
not
endure
for
very
long
periods;
*punct* ,
why
as
a
general
rule
they
should
be
exterminated
and
disappear
*punct* ,
sooner
than
the
forms
which
they
originally
linked
together
*punct* .
*break*
for
any
form
existing
in
lesser
numbers
would
*punct* ,
as
already
remarked
*punct* ,
run
a
greater
chance
of
being
exterminated
than
one
existing
in
large
numbers
*punct* ;
and
in
this
particular
case
the
intermediate
form
would
be
eminently
liable
to
the
inroads
of
closely
allied
forms
existing
on
both
sides
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
far
more
important
consideration
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
is
that
*punct* ,
during
the
process
of
further
modification
*punct* ,
by
which
two
varieties
are
supposed
on
my
theory
to
be
converted
and
perfected
into
two
distinct
species
*punct* ,
the
two
which
exist
in
larger
numbers
from
inhabiting
larger
areas
*punct* ,
will
have
a
great
advantage
over
the
intermediate
variety
*punct* ,
which
exists
in
smaller
numbers
in
a
narrow
and
intermediate
zone
*punct* .
*break*
for
forms
existing
in
larger
numbers
will
always
have
a
better
chance
*punct* ,
within
any
given
period
*punct* ,
of
presenting
further
favourable
variations
for
natural
selection
to
seize
on
*punct* ,
than
will
the
rarer
forms
which
exist
in
lesser
numbers
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
the
more
common
forms
*punct* ,
in
the
race
for
life
*punct* ,
will
tend
to
beat
and
supplant
the
less
common
forms
*punct* ,
for
these
will
be
more
slowly
modified
and
improved
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
the
same
principle
which
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
accounts
for
the
common
species
in
each
country
*punct* ,
as
shown
in
the
second
chapter
*punct* ,
presenting
on
an
average
a
greater
number
of
well-marked
varieties
than
do
the
rarer
species
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
illustrate
what
i
mean
by
supposing
three
varieties
of
sheep
to
be
kept
*punct* ,
one
adapted
to
an
extensive
mountainous
region
*punct* ;
a
second
to
a
comparatively
narrow
*punct* ,
hilly
tract
*punct* ;
and
a
third
to
wide
plains
at
the
base
*punct* ;
and
that
the
inhabitants
are
all
trying
with
equal
steadiness
and
skill
to
improve
their
stocks
by
selection
*punct* ;
the
chances
in
this
case
will
be
strongly
in
favour
of
the
great
holders
on
the
mountains
or
on
the
plains
improving
their
breeds
more
quickly
than
the
small
holders
on
the
intermediate
narrow
*punct* ,
hilly
tract
*punct* ;
and
consequently
the
improved
mountain
or
plain
breed
will
soon
take
the
place
of
the
less
improved
hill
breed
*punct* ;
and
thus
the
two
breeds
*punct* ,
which
originally
existed
in
greater
numbers
*punct* ,
will
come
into
close
contact
with
each
other
*punct* ,
without
the
interposition
of
the
supplanted
*punct* ,
intermediate
hill-variety
*punct* .
*break*
to
sum
up
*punct* ,
i
believe
that
species
come
to
be
tolerably
well-defined
objects
*punct* ,
and
do
not
at
any
one
period
present
an
inextricable
chaos
of
varying
and
intermediate
links
*punct* :
firstly
*punct* ,
because
new
varieties
are
very
slowly
formed
*punct* ,
for
variation
is
a
very
slow
process
*punct* ,
and
natural
selection
can
do
nothing
until
favourable
variations
chance
to
occur
*punct* ,
and
until
a
place
in
the
natural
polity
of
the
country
can
be
better
filled
by
some
modification
of
some
one
or
more
of
its
inhabitants
*punct* .
*break*
and
such
new
places
will
depend
on
slow
changes
of
climate
*punct* ,
or
on
the
occasional
immigration
of
new
inhabitants
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
probably
*punct* ,
in
a
still
more
important
degree
*punct* ,
on
some
of
the
old
inhabitants
becoming
slowly
modified
*punct* ,
with
the
new
forms
thus
produced
and
the
old
ones
acting
and
reacting
on
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
*punct* ,
in
any
one
region
and
at
any
one
time
*punct* ,
we
ought
only
to
see
a
few
species
presenting
slight
modifications
of
structure
in
some
degree
permanent
*punct* ;
and
this
assuredly
we
do
see
*punct* .
*break*
secondly
*punct* ,
areas
now
continuous
must
often
have
existed
within
the
recent
period
in
isolated
portions
*punct* ,
in
which
many
forms
*punct* ,
more
especially
amongst
the
classes
which
unite
for
each
birth
and
wander
much
*punct* ,
may
have
separately
been
rendered
sufficiently
distinct
to
rank
as
representative
species
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
case
*punct* ,
intermediate
varieties
between
the
several
representative
species
and
their
common
parent
*punct* ,
must
formerly
have
existed
in
each
broken
portion
of
the
land
*punct* ,
but
these
links
will
have
been
supplanted
and
exterminated
during
the
process
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
so
that
they
will
no
longer
exist
in
a
living
state
*punct* .
*break*
thirdly
*punct* ,
when
two
or
more
varieties
have
been
formed
in
different
portions
of
a
strictly
continuous
area
*punct* ,
intermediate
varieties
will
*punct* ,
it
is
probable
*punct* ,
at
first
have
been
formed
in
the
intermediate
zones
*punct* ,
but
they
will
generally
have
had
a
short
duration
*punct* .
*break*
for
these
intermediate
varieties
will
*punct* ,
from
reasons
already
assigned
*punct* ,
namely
from
what
we
know
of
the
actual
distribution
of
closely
allied
or
representative
species
*punct* ,
and
likewise
of
acknowledged
varieties
*punct* ,
exist
in
the
intermediate
zones
in
lesser
numbers
than
the
varieties
which
they
tend
to
connect
*punct* .
*break*
from
this
cause
alone
the
intermediate
varieties
will
be
liable
to
accidental
extermination
*punct* ;
and
during
the
process
of
further
modification
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
they
will
almost
certainly
be
beaten
and
supplanted
by
the
forms
which
they
connect
*punct* ;
for
these
from
existing
in
greater
numbers
will
*punct* ,
in
the
aggregate
*punct* ,
present
more
variation
*punct* ,
and
thus
be
further
improved
through
natural
selection
and
gain
further
advantages
*punct* .
*break*
lastly
*punct* ,
looking
not
to
any
one
time
*punct* ,
but
to
all
time
*punct* ,
if
my
theory
be
true
*punct* ,
numberless
intermediate
varieties
*punct* ,
linking
most
closely
all
the
species
of
the
same
group
together
*punct* ,
must
assuredly
have
existed
*punct* ;
but
the
very
process
of
natural
selection
constantly
tends
*punct* ,
as
has
been
so
often
remarked
*punct* ,
to
exterminate
the
parent
forms
and
the
intermediate
links
*punct* .
*break*
consequently
evidence
of
their
former
existence
could
be
found
only
amongst
fossil
remains
*punct* ,
which
are
preserved
*punct* ,
as
we
shall
in
a
future
chapter
attempt
to
show
*punct* ,
in
an
extremely
imperfect
and
intermittent
record
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
origin
and
transitions
of
organic
beings
with
peculiar
habits
and
structure.
*punct* ,
it
has
been
asked
by
the
opponents
of
such
views
as
i
hold
*punct* ,
how
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
a
land
carnivorous
animal
could
have
been
converted
into
one
with
aquatic
habits
*punct* ;
for
how
could
the
animal
in
its
transitional
state
have
subsisted
*punct* ?
*break*
it
would
be
easy
to
show
that
within
the
same
group
carnivorous
animals
exist
having
every
intermediate
grade
between
truly
aquatic
and
strictly
terrestrial
habits
*punct* ;
and
as
each
exists
by
a
struggle
for
life
*punct* ,
it
is
clear
that
each
is
well
adapted
in
its
habits
to
its
place
in
nature
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
the
mustela
vison
of
north
america
*punct* ,
which
has
webbed
feet
and
which
resembles
an
otter
in
its
fur
*punct* ,
short
legs
*punct* ,
and
form
of
tail
*punct* ;
during
summer
this
animal
dives
for
and
preys
on
fish
*punct* ,
but
during
the
long
winter
it
leaves
the
frozen
waters
*punct* ,
and
preys
like
other
polecats
on
mice
and
land
animals
*punct* .
*break*
if
a
different
case
had
been
taken
*punct* ,
and
it
had
been
asked
how
an
insectivorous
quadruped
could
possibly
have
been
converted
into
a
flying
bat
*punct* ,
the
question
would
have
been
far
more
difficult
*punct* ,
and
i
could
have
given
no
answer
*punct* .
*break*
yet
i
think
such
difficulties
have
very
little
weight
*punct* .
*break*
here
*punct* ,
as
on
other
occasions
*punct* ,
i
lie
under
a
heavy
disadvantage
*punct* ,
for
out
of
the
many
striking
cases
which
i
have
collected
*punct* ,
i
can
give
only
one
or
two
instances
of
transitional
habits
and
structures
in
closely
allied
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ;
and
of
diversified
habits
*punct* ,
either
constant
or
occasional
*punct* ,
in
the
same
species
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
less
than
a
long
list
of
such
cases
is
sufficient
to
lessen
the
difficulty
in
any
particular
case
like
that
of
the
bat
*punct* .
*break*
richardson
has
remarked
*punct* ,
with
the
posterior
part
of
their
bodies
rather
wide
and
with
the
skin
on
their
flanks
rather
full
*punct* ,
to
the
so-called
flying
squirrels
*punct* ;
and
flying
squirrels
have
their
limbs
and
even
the
base
of
the
tail
united
by
a
broad
expanse
of
skin
*punct* ,
which
serves
as
a
parachute
and
allows
them
to
glide
through
the
air
to
an
astonishing
distance
from
tree
to
tree
*punct* .
*break*
we
cannot
doubt
that
each
structure
is
of
use
to
each
kind
of
squirrel
in
its
own
country
*punct* ,
by
enabling
it
to
escape
birds
or
beasts
of
prey
*punct* ,
or
to
collect
food
more
quickly
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
as
there
is
reason
to
believe
*punct* ,
by
lessening
the
danger
from
occasional
falls
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
does
not
follow
from
this
fact
that
the
structure
of
each
squirrel
is
the
best
that
it
is
possible
to
conceive
under
all
natural
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
let
the
climate
and
vegetation
change
*punct* ,
let
other
competing
rodents
or
new
beasts
of
prey
immigrate
*punct* ,
or
old
ones
become
modified
*punct* ,
and
all
analogy
would
lead
us
to
believe
that
some
at
least
of
the
squirrels
would

in
numbers
or
become
exterminated
*punct* ,
unless
they
also
became
modified
and
improved
in
structure
in
a
corresponding
manner
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
*punct* ,
i
can
see
no
difficulty
*punct* ,
more
especially
under
changing
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
in
the
continued
preservation
of
individuals
with
fuller
and
fuller
flank-membranes
*punct* ,
each
modification
being
useful
*punct* ,
each
being
propagated
*punct* ,
until
by
the
accumulated
effects
of
this
process
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
a
perfect
so-called
flying
squirrel
was
produced
*punct* .
*break*
now
look
at
the
galeopithecus
or
flying
lemur
*punct* ,
which
formerly
was
falsely
ranked
amongst
bats
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
an
extremely
wide
flank-membrane
*punct* ,
stretching
from
the
corners
of
the
jaw
to
the
tail
*punct* ,
and
including
the
limbs
and
the
elongated
fingers
*punct* :
the
flank
membrane
is
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
furnished
with
an
extensor
muscle
*punct* .
*break*
although
no
graduated
links
of
structure
*punct* ,
fitted
for
gliding
through
the
air
*punct* ,
now
connect
the
galeopithecus
with
the
other
lemuridae
*punct* ,
yet
i
can
see
no
difficulty
in
supposing
that
such
links
formerly
existed
*punct* ,
and
that
each
had
been
formed
by
the
same
steps
as
in
the
case
of
the
less
perfectly
gliding
squirrels
*punct* ;
and
that
each
grade
of
structure
had
been
useful
to
its
possessor
*punct* .
*break*
nor
can
i
see
any
insuperable
difficulty
in
further
believing
it
possible
that
the
membrane-connected
fingers
and
fore-arm
of
the
galeopithecus
might
be
greatly
lengthened
by
natural
selection
*punct* ;
and
this
*punct* ,
as
far
as
the
organs
of
flight
are
concerned
*punct* ,
would
convert
it
into
a
bat
*punct* .
*break*
in
bats
which
have
the
wing-membrane
extended
from
the
top
of
the
shoulder
to
the
tail
*punct* ,
including
the
hind-legs
*punct* ,
we
perhaps
see
traces
of
an
apparatus
originally
constructed
for
gliding
through
the
air
rather
than
for
flight
*punct* .
*break*
yet
the
structure
of
each
of
these
birds
is
good
for
it
*punct* ,
under
the
conditions
of
life
to
which
it
is
exposed
*punct* ,
for
each
has
to
live
by
a
struggle
*punct* ;
but
it
is
not
necessarily
the
best
possible
under
all
possible
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
not
be
inferred
from
these
remarks
that
any
of
the
grades
of
wing-structure
here
alluded
to
*punct* ,
which
perhaps
may
all
have
resulted
from
disuse
*punct* ,
indicate
the
natural
steps
by
which
birds
have
acquired
their
perfect
power
of
flight
*punct* ;
but
they
serve
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
to
show
what
diversified
means
of
transition
are
possible
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
that
a
few
members
of
such
water-breathing
classes
as
the
crustacea
and
mollusca
are
adapted
to
live
on
the
land
*punct* ,
and
seeing
that
we
have
flying
birds
and
mammals
*punct* ,
flying
insects
of
the
most
diversified
types
*punct* ,
and
formerly
had
flying
reptiles
*punct* ,
it
is
conceivable
that
flying-fish
*punct* ,
which
now
glide
far
through
the
air
*punct* ,
slightly
rising
and
turning
by
the
aid
of
their
fluttering
fins
*punct* ,
might
have
been
modified
into
perfectly
winged
animals
*punct* .
*break*
if
this
had
been
effected
*punct* ,
who
would
have
ever
imagined
that
in
an
early
transitional
state
they
had
been
inhabitants
of
the
open
ocean
*punct* ,
and
had
used
their
incipient
organs
of
flight
exclusively
*punct* ,
as
far
as
we
know
*punct* ,
to
escape
being
devoured
by
other
fish
*punct* ?
*break*
when
we
see
any
structure
highly
perfected
for
any
particular
habit
*punct* ,
as
the
wings
of
a
bird
for
flight
*punct* ,
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
animals
displaying
early
transitional
grades
of
the
structure
will
seldom
continue
to
exist
to
the
present
day
*punct* ,
for
they
will
have
been
supplanted
by
the
very
process
of
perfection
through
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
furthermore
*punct* ,
we
may
conclude
that
transitional
grades
between
structures
fitted
for
very
different
habits
of
life
will
rarely
have
been
developed
at
an
early
period
in
great
numbers
and
under
many
subordinate
forms
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
to
return
to
our
imaginary
illustration
of
the
flying-fish
*punct* ,
it
does
not
seem
probable
that
fishes
capable
of
true
flight
would
have
been
developed
under
many
subordinate
forms
*punct* ,
for
taking
prey
of
many
kinds
in
many
ways
*punct* ,
on
the
land
and
in
the
water
*punct* ,
until
their
organs
of
flight
had
come
to
a
high
stage
of
perfection
*punct* ,
so
as
to
have
given
them
a
decided
advantage
over
other
animals
in
the
battle
for
life
*punct* .
*break*
hence
the
chance
of
discovering
species
with
transitional
grades
of
structure
in
a
fossil
condition
will
always
be
less
*punct* ,
from
their
having
existed
in
lesser
numbers
*punct* ,
than
in
the
case
of
species
with
fully
developed
structures
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
now
give
two
or
three
instances
of
diversified
and
of
changed
habits
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* .
*break*
when
either
case
occurs
*punct* ,
it
would
be
easy
for
natural
selection
to
fit
the
animal
*punct* ,
by
some
modification
of
its
structure
*punct* ,
for
its
changed
habits
*punct* ,
or
exclusively
for
one
of
its
several
different
habits
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
difficult
to
tell
*punct* ,
and
immaterial
for
us
*punct* ,
whether
habits
generally
change
first
and
structure
afterwards
*punct* ;
or
whether
slight
modifications
of
structure
lead
to
changed
habits
*punct* ;
both
probably
often
change
almost
simultaneously
*punct* .
*break*
of
cases
of
changed
habits
it
will
suffice
merely
to
allude
to
that
of
the
many
british
insects
which
now
feed
on
exotic
plants
*punct* ,
or
exclusively
on
artificial
substances
*punct* .
*break*
of
diversified
habits
innumerable
instances
could
be
given
*punct* :
i
have
often
watched
a
tyrant
flycatcher
*punct* ,
saurophagus
sulphuratus
*punct* ,
in
south
america
*punct* ,
hovering
over
one
spot
and
then
proceeding
to
another
*punct* ,
like
a
kestrel
*punct* ,
and
at
other
times
standing
stationary
on
the
margin
of
water
*punct* ,
and
then
dashing
like
a
kingfisher
at
a
fish
*punct* .
*break*
in
our
own
country
the
larger
titmouse
*punct* ,
parus
major
*punct* ,
may
be
seen
climbing
branches
*punct* ,
almost
like
a
creeper
*punct* ;
it
often
*punct* ,
like
a
shrike
*punct* ,
kills
small
birds
by
blows
on
the
head
*punct* ;
and
i
have
many
times
seen
and
heard
it
hammering
the
seeds
of
the
yew
on
a
branch
*punct* ,
and
thus
breaking
them
like
a
nuthatch
*punct* .
*break*
in
north
america
the
black
bear
was
seen
by
hearne
swimming
for
hours
with
widely
open
mouth
*punct* ,
thus
catching
*punct* ,
like
a
whale
*punct* ,
insects
in
the
water
*punct* .
*break*
even
in
so
extreme
a
case
as
this
*punct* ,
if
the
supply
of
insects
were
constant
*punct* ,
and
if
better
adapted
competitors
did
not
already
exist
in
the
country
*punct* ,
i
can
see
no
difficulty
in
a
race
of
bears
being
rendered
*punct* ,
by
natural
selection
*punct* ,
more
and
more
aquatic
in
their
structure
and
habits
*punct* ,
with
larger
and
larger
mouths
*punct* ,
till
a
creature
was
produced
as
monstrous
as
a
whale
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
sometimes
see
individuals
of
a
species
following
habits
widely
different
from
those
both
of
their
own
species
and
of
the
other
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
we
might
expect
*punct* ,
on
my
theory
*punct* ,
that
such
individuals
would
occasionally
have
given
rise
to
new
species
*punct* ,
having
anomalous
habits
*punct* ,
and
with
their
structure
either
slightly
or
considerably
modified
from
that
of
their
proper
type
*punct* .
*break*
and
such
instances
do
occur
in
nature
*punct* .
*break*
can
a
more
striking
instance
of
adaptation
be
given
than
that
of
a
woodpecker
for
climbing
trees
and
for
seizing
insects
in
the
chinks
of
the
bark
*punct* ?
*break*
yet
in
north
america
there
are
woodpeckers
which
feed
largely
on
fruit
*punct* ,
and
others
with
elongated
wings
which
chase
insects
on
the
wing
*punct* ;
and
on
the
plains
of
la
plata
*punct* ,
where
not
a
tree
grows
*punct* ,
there
is
a
woodpecker
*punct* ,
which
in
every
essential
part
of
its
organisation
*punct* ,
even
in
its
colouring
*punct* ,
in
the
harsh
tone
of
its
voice
*punct* ,
and
undulatory
flight
*punct* ,
told
me
plainly
of
its
close
blood-relationship
to
our
common
species
*punct* ;
yet
it
is
a
woodpecker
which
never
climbs
a
tree
*punct* !
*break*
petrels
are
the
most
aerial
and
oceanic
of
birds
*punct* ,

the
quiet
sounds
of
tierra
del
fuego
*punct* ,
the
puffinuria
berardi
*punct* ,
in
its
general
habits
*punct* ,
in
its
astonishing
power
of
diving
*punct* ,
its
manner
of
swimming
*punct* ,
and
of
flying
when
unwillingly
it
takes
flight
*punct* ,
would
be
mistaken
by
any
one
for
an
auk
or
grebe
*punct* ;
nevertheless
*punct* ,
it
is
essentially
a
petrel
*punct* ,
but
with
many
parts
of
its
organisation
profoundly
modified
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
the
acutest
observer
by
examining
the
dead
body
of
the
water-ouzel
would
never
have
suspected
its
sub-aquatic
habits
*punct* ;
yet
this
anomalous
member
of
the
strictly
terrestrial
thrush
family
wholly
subsists
by
diving,
*punct* ,
grasping
the
stones
with
its
feet

its
wings
under

*break*
he
who
believes
that
each
being
has
been
created
as
we
now
see
it
*punct* ,
must
occasionally
have
felt
surprise
when
he
has
met
with
an
animal
having
habits
and
structure
not
at
all
in
agreement
*punct* .
*break*
what
can
be
plainer
than
that
the
webbed
feet
of
ducks
and
geese
are
formed
for
swimming
*punct* ?
*break*
yet
there
are
upland
geese
with
webbed
feet
which
rarely
or
never
go
near
the
water
*punct* ;
and
no
one
except
audubon
has
seen
the
frigate-bird
*punct* ,
which
has
all
its
four
toes
webbed
*punct* ,
alight
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
grebes
and
coots
are
eminently
aquatic
*punct* ,
although
their
toes
are
only
bordered
by
membrane
*punct* .
*break*
what
seems
plainer
than
that
the
long
toes
of
grallatores
are
formed
for
walking
over
swamps

floating

the
water-hen

nearly
as
aquatic
as
the
coot
*punct* ;

the
landrail
nearly

the
quail

partridge

*break*
in
such
cases
*punct* ,
and
many
others
could
be
given
*punct* ,
habits
have
changed
without
a
corresponding
change
of
structure
*punct* .
*break*
the
webbed
feet
of
the
upland
goose
may
be
said
to
have
become
rudimentary
in
function
*punct* ,
though
not
in
structure
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
frigate-bird
*punct* ,
the
deeply-scooped
membrane
between
the
toes
shows
that
structure
has
begun
to
change
*punct* .
*break*
he
who
believes
in
separate
and
innumerable
acts
of
creation
will
say
*punct* ,
that
in
these
cases
it
has
pleased
the
creator
to
cause
a
being
of
one
type
to
take
the
place
of
one
of
another
type
*punct* ;
but
this
seems
to
me
only
restating
the
fact
in
dignified
language
*punct* .
*break*
he
who
believes
in
the
struggle
for
existence
and
in
the
principle
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
will
acknowledge
that
every
organic
being
is
constantly
endeavouring
to
increase
in
numbers
*punct* ;
and
that
if
any
one
being
vary
ever
so
little
*punct* ,
either
in
habits
or
structure
*punct* ,
and
thus
gain
an
advantage
over
some
other
inhabitant
of
the
country
*punct* ,
it
will
seize
on
the
place
of
that
inhabitant
*punct* ,
however
different
it
may
be
from
its
own
place
*punct* .
*break*
hence
it
will
cause
him
no
surprise
that
there
should
be
geese
and
frigate-birds
with
webbed
feet
*punct* ,
either
living
on
the
dry
land
or
most
rarely
alighting
on
the
water
*punct* ;
that
there
should
be
long-toed
corncrakes
living
in
meadows
instead
of
in
swamps
*punct* ;
that
there
should
be
woodpeckers
where
not

organs

extreme
perfection

complication.
*punct* ,
to
suppose
that
the
eye
*punct* ,
with
all
its
inimitable
contrivances
for
adjusting
the
focus
to
different
distances
*punct* ,
for
admitting
different
amounts
of
light
*punct* ,
and
for
the
correction
of
spherical

chromatic
aberration
*punct* ,
could
have
been
formed
by
natural
selection
*punct* ,
seems
*punct* ,
i
freely
confess
*punct* ,
absurd
in
the
highest
possible
degree
*punct* .
*break*
yet
reason
tells
me
*punct* ,
that
if
numerous
gradations
from
a
perfect
and
complex
eye
to
one
very
imperfect
and
simple
*punct* ,
each
grade
being
useful
to
its
possessor
*punct* ,
can
be
shown
to
exist
*punct* ;
if
further
*punct* ,
the
eye
does
vary
ever
so
slightly
*punct* ,
and
the
variations
be
inherited
*punct* ,
which
is
certainly
the
case
*punct* ;
and
if
any
variation
or
modification
in
the
organ
be
ever
useful

an
animal
under
changing
conditions

then
the
difficulty
of
believing
that
a
perfect

complex
eye
could
be
formed
by
natural
selection
*punct* ,
though
insuperable
by
our
imagination
*punct* ,
can
hardly
be
considered
real
*punct* .
*break*
how
a
nerve
comes
to
be
sensitive
to
light
*punct* ,
hardly
concerns
us
more
than
how
life
itself
first
originated
*punct* ;
but
i
may
remark
that
several
facts
make
me
suspect
that
any
sensitive
nerve
may
be
rendered
sensitive
to
light
*punct* ,
and
likewise
to
those
coarser
vibrations
of
the
air
which
produce
sound
*punct* .
*break*
in
looking
for
the
gradations
by
which
an
organ
in
any
species
has
been
perfected
*punct* ,
we
ought
to
look
exclusively
to
its
lineal
ancestors
*punct* ;
but
this
is
scarcely
ever
possible
*punct* ,
and
we
are
forced
in
each
case
to
look
to
species
of
the
same
group
*punct* ,
that
is
to
the
collateral
descendants
from
the
same
original
parent-form
*punct* ,
in
order
to
see
what
gradations
are
possible
*punct* ,
and
for
the
chance
of
some
gradations
having
been
transmitted
from
the
earlier
stages
of
descent
*punct* ,
in
an
unaltered
or
little
altered
condition
*punct* .
*break*
amongst
existing
vertebrata
*punct* ,
we
find
but
a
small
amount
of
gradation
in
the
structure
of
the
eye
*punct* ,
and
from
fossil
species
we
can
learn
nothing
on
this
head
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
great
class
we
should
probably
have
to
descend
far
beneath
the
lowest
known
fossiliferous
stratum
to
discover
the
earlier
stages
*punct* ,
by
which
the
eye
has
been
perfected
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
articulata
we
can
commence
a
series
with
an
optic
nerve
merely
coated
with
pigment
*punct* ,
and
without
any
other
mechanism
*punct* ;
and
from
this
low
stage
*punct* ,
numerous
gradations
of
structure
*punct* ,
branching
off
in
two
fundamentally
different
lines
*punct* ,
can
be
shown
to
exist
*punct* ,

we
reach
a
moderately
high
stage
of
perfection
*punct* .
*break*
in
certain
crustaceans
*punct* ,

*punct* ,
there
is
a
double
cornea
*punct* ,
the
inner
one
divided
into
facets
*punct* ,
within
each

which
there
is
a
lens-shaped
swelling
*punct* .
*break*
in
other
crustaceans
the
transparent
cones
which
are
coated

which
properly
act

excluding
lateral
pencils

*break*
with
these
facts
*punct* ,
here
far
too
briefly
and
imperfectly
given
*punct* ,
which
show
that
there
is
much
graduated
diversity
in
the

of
living
crustaceans

and
bearing
in
mind
how
small
the
number
of
living
animals
is
in

to
those

i
can
see
no
very
great
difficulty
*punct* ,
not
more
than
in
the
case
of
many
other
structures
*punct* ,
in
believing
that
natural
selection
has
converted
the
simple
apparatus
of
an
optic
nerve
merely
coated
with
pigment
and
invested
by
transparent
membrane
*punct* ,
into
an
optical
instrument
as
perfect
as
is
possessed
by
any
member
of
the
great
articulate
class
*punct* .
*break*
he
who
will
go
thus
far
*punct* ,
if
he
find
on
finishing
this

that
large
bodies
of
facts
*punct* ,
otherwise
inexplicable
*punct* ,
can
be
explained
by
the
theory
of
descent
*punct* ,
ought
not
to
hesitate
to
go
further
*punct* ,
and
to
admit
that
a
structure
even
as
perfect
as
the
eye
of
an
eagle
might
be
formed
by
natural
selection
*punct* ,
although
in
this
case
he
does
not
know
any
of
the
transitional
grades
*punct* .
*break*
his
reason
ought
to
conquer
his
imagination
*punct* ;
though
i
have
felt
the
difficulty
far
too
keenly
to
be
surprised
at
any
degree
of
hesitation
in
extending
the
principle
of
natural
selection
to
such
startling
lengths
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
avoid
comparing
the
eye
to
a
telescope
*punct* .
*break*
we
know
that
this
instrument
has
been
perfected
by
the
long-continued
efforts
of
the
highest
human
intellects
*punct* ;
and
we
naturally
infer
that
the
eye
has
been
formed
by
a
somewhat
analogous
process
*punct* .
*break*
but
may
not
this
inference
be
presumptuous
*punct* ?
*break*
have
we
any
right
to
assume
that
the
creator
works
by
intellectual
powers
like
those
of
man
*punct* ?
*break*
if
we
must
compare
the
eye
to
an
optical
instrument
*punct* ,
we
ought
in
imagination
to
take
a
thick
layer
of
transparent
tissue
*punct* ,
with
a
nerve
sensitive
to
light
beneath
*punct* ,
and
then
suppose
every
part
of
this
layer
to
be
continually
changing
slowly
in
density
*punct* ,
so
as
to
separate
into
layers
of
different
densities
and
thicknesses
*punct* ,
placed
at
different
distances
from
each
other
*punct* ,
and
with
the
surfaces
of
each
layer
slowly
changing
in
form
*punct* .
*break*
further
we
must
suppose
that
there
is
a
power
always
intently
watching
each
slight
accidental
alteration
in
the
transparent
layers
*punct* ;
and
carefully
selecting
each
alteration
which
*punct* ,
under
varied
circumstances
*punct* ,
may
in
any
way
*punct* ,
or
in
any
degree
*punct* ,
tend
to
produce
a
distincter
image
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
suppose
each
new
state
of
the
instrument
to
be
multiplied
by
the
million
*punct* ;
and
each
to
be
preserved
till
a
better
be
produced
*punct* ,
and
then
the
old
ones
to
be
destroyed
*punct* .
*break*
in
living
bodies
*punct* ,
variation
will
cause
the
slight
alterations
*punct* ,
generation
will
multiply
them
almost
infinitely
*punct* ,
and
natural
selection
will
pick
out
with
unerring
skill
each
improvement
*punct* .
*break*
let
this
process
go
on
for
millions
on
millions
of
years
*punct* ;
and
during
each
year
on
millions
of
individuals
of
many
kinds
*punct* ;
and
may
we
not
believe
that
a
living
optical
instrument
might
thus
be
formed
as
superior
to
one
of
glass
*punct* ,
as
the
works
of
the
creator
are
to
those
of
man
*punct* ?
*break*
if
it
could
be
demonstrated
that
any
complex
organ
existed
*punct* ,
which
could
not
possibly
have
been
formed
by
numerous
*punct* ,
successive
*punct* ,
slight
modifications
*punct* ,
my
theory
would
absolutely
break
down
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
can
find
out
no
such
case
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
many
organs
exist
of
which
we
do
not
know
the
transitional
grades
*punct* ,
more
especially
if
we
look
to
much-isolated
species
*punct* ,
round
which
*punct* ,
according
to
my
theory
*punct* ,
there
has
been
much
extinction
*punct* .
*break*
or
again
*punct* ,
if
we
look
to
an
organ
common
to
all
the
members
of
a
large
class
*punct* ,
for
in
this
latter
case
the
organ
must
have
been
first
formed
at
an
extremely
remote
period
*punct* ,
since
which
all
the
many
members
of
the
class
have
been
developed
*punct* ;
and
in
order
to
discover
the
early
transitional
grades
through
which
the
organ
has
passed
*punct* ,
we
should
have
to
look
to
very
ancient
ancestral
forms
*punct* ,
long
since
become
extinct
*punct* .
*break*
we
should
be
extremely
cautious
in
concluding
that
an
organ
could
not
have
been
formed
by
transitional
gradations
of
some
kind
*punct* .
*break*
numerous
cases
could
be
given
amongst
the
lower
animals
of
the
same
organ
performing
at
the
same
time
wholly
distinct
functions
*punct* ;
thus
the
alimentary
canal
respires
*punct* ,
digests
*punct* ,
and
excretes
in
the
larva
of
the
dragon-fly
and
in
the
fish
cobites
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
hydra
*punct* ,
the
animal
may
be
turned
inside
out
*punct* ,
and
the
exterior
surface
will
then
digest
and
the
stomach
respire
*punct* .
*break*
in
such
cases
natural
selection
might
easily
specialise
*punct* ,
if
any
advantage
were
thus
gained
*punct* ,
a
part
or
organ
*punct* ,
which
had
performed
two
functions
*punct* ,
for
one
function
alone
*punct* ,
and
thus
wholly
change
its
nature
by
insensible
steps
*punct* .
*break*
two
distinct
organs
sometimes
perform
simultaneously
the
same
function
in
the
same
individual
*punct* ;
to
give
one
instance
*punct* ,
there
are
fish
with
gills
or
branchiae
that
breathe
the
air
dissolved
in
the
water
*punct* ,
at
the
same
time
that
they
breathe
free
air
in
their
swimbladders
*punct* ,
this
latter
organ
having
a
ductus
pneumaticus
for
its
supply
*punct* ,
and
being
divided
by
highly
vascular
partitions
*punct* .
*break*
in
these
cases
*punct* ,
one
of
the
two
organs
might
with
ease
be
modified
and
perfected
so
as
to
perform
all
the
work
by
itself
*punct* ,
being
aided
during
the
process
of
modification
by
the
other
organ
*punct* ;
and
then
this
other
organ
might
be
modified
for
some
other
and
quite
distinct
purpose
*punct* ,
or
be
quite
obliterated
*punct* .
*break*
the
illustration
of
the
swimbladder
in
fishes
is
a
good
one
*punct* ,
because
it
shows
us
clearly
the
highly
important
fact
that
an
organ
originally
constructed
for
one
purpose
*punct* ,
namely
flotation
*punct* ,
may
be
converted
into
one
for
a
wholly
different
purpose
*punct* ,
namely
respiration
*punct* .
*break*
the
swimbladder
has
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
been
worked
in
as
an
accessory
to
the
auditory
organs
of
certain
fish
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
for
i
do
not
know
which
view
is
now
generally
held
*punct* ,
a
part
of
the
auditory
apparatus
has
been
worked
in
as
a
complement
to
the
swimbladder
*punct* .
*break*
all
physiologists
admit
that
the
swimbladder
is
homologous
*punct* ,
or
ideally
similar
*punct* ,
in
position
and
structure
with
the
lungs
of
the
higher
vertebrate
animals
*punct* :
hence
there
seems
to
me
to
be
no
great
difficulty
in
believing
that
natural
selection
has
actually
converted
a
swimbladder
into
a
lung
*punct* ,
or
organ
used
exclusively
for
respiration
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
hardly
doubt
that
all
vertebrate
animals
having
true
lungs
have
descended
by
ordinary
generation
from
an
ancient
prototype
*punct* ,
of
which
we
know
nothing
*punct* ,
furnished
with
a
floating
apparatus
or
swimbladder
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
thus
*punct* ,
as
i
infer
from
professor
owen's
interesting
description
of
these
parts
*punct* ,
understand
the
strange
fact
that
every
particle
of
food
and
drink
which
we
swallow
has
to
pass
over
the
orifice
of
the
trachea
*punct* ,
with
some
risk
of
falling
into
the
lungs
*punct* ,
notwithstanding
the
beautiful
contrivance
by
which
the
glottis
is
closed
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
higher
vertebrata
the
branchiae
have
wholly
disappeared
*punct* ,
the
slits
on
the
sides
of
the
neck
and
the
loop-like
course
of
the
arteries
still
marking
in
the
embryo
their
former
position
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
conceivable
that
the
now
utterly
lost
branchiae
might
have
been
gradually
worked
in
by
natural
selection
for
some
quite
distinct
purpose
*punct* :
in
the
same
manner
as
*punct* ,
on
the
view
entertained
by
some
naturalists
that
the
branchiae
and
dorsal
scales
of
annelids
are
homologous
with
the
wings
and
wing-covers
of
insects
*punct* ,
it
is
probable
that
organs
which
at
a
very
ancient
period
served
for
respiration
have
been
actually
converted
into
organs
of
flight
*punct* .
*break*
in
considering
transitions
of
organs
*punct* ,
it
is
so
important
to
bear
in
mind
the
probability
of
conversion
from
one
function
to
another
*punct* ,
that
i
will
give
one
more
instance
*punct* .
*break*
pedunculated
cirripedes
have
two
minute
folds
of
skin
*punct* ,
called
by
me
the
ovigerous
frena
*punct* ,
which
serve
*punct* ,
through
the
means
of
a
sticky
secretion
*punct* ,
to
retain
the
eggs
until
they
are
hatched
within
the
sack
*punct* .
*break*
these
cirripedes
have
no
branchiae
*punct* ,
the
whole
surface
of
the
body
and
sack
*punct* ,
including
the
small
frena
*punct* ,
serving
for
respiration
*punct* .
*break*
the
balanidae
or
sessile
cirripedes
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
have
no
ovigerous
frena
*punct* ,
the
eggs
lying
loose
at
the
bottom
of
the
sack
*punct* ,
in
the
well-enclosed
shell
*punct* ;
but
they
have
large
folded
branchiae
*punct* .
*break*
now
i
think
no
one
will
dispute
that
the
ovigerous
frena
in
the
one
family
are
strictly
homologous
with
the
branchiae
of
the
other
family
*punct* ;
indeed
*punct* ,
they
graduate
into
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
i
do
not
doubt
that
little
folds
of
skin
*punct* ,
which
originally
served
as
ovigerous
frena
*punct* ,
but
which
*punct* ,
likewise
*punct* ,
very
slightly
aided
the
act
of
respiration
*punct* ,
have
been
gradually
converted
by
natural
selection
into
branchiae
*punct* ,
simply
through
an
increase
in
their
size
and
the
obliteration
of
their
adhesive
glands
*punct* .
*break*
if
all
pedunculated
cirripedes
had
become
extinct
*punct* ,
and
they
have
already
suffered
far
more
extinction
than
have
sessile
cirripedes
*punct* ,
who
would
ever
have
imagined
that
the
branchiae
in
this
latter
family
had
originally
existed
as
organs
for
preventing
the
ova
from
being
washed
out
of
the
sack
*punct* ?
*break*
although
we
must
be
extremely
cautious
in
concluding
that
any
organ
could
not
possibly
have
been
produced
by
successive
transitional
gradations
*punct* ,
yet
*punct* ,
undoubtedly
*punct* ,
grave
cases
of
difficulty
occur
*punct* ,
some
of
which
will
be
discussed
in
my
future
work
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
the
gravest
is
that
of
neuter
insects
*punct* ,
which
are
often
very
differently
constructed
from
either
the
males
or
fertile
females
*punct* ;
but
this
case
will
be
treated
of
in
the
next
chapter
*punct* .
*break*
the
electric
organs
of
fishes
offer
another
case
of
special
difficulty
*punct* ;
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
by
what
steps
these
wondrous
organs
have
been
produced
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
owen
and
others
have
remarked
*punct* ,
their
intimate
structure
closely
resembles
that
of
common
muscle
*punct* ;
and
as
it
has
lately
been
shown
that
rays
have
an
organ
closely
analogous
to
the
electric
apparatus
*punct* ,
and
yet
do
not
*punct* ,
as
matteuchi
asserts
*punct* ,
discharge
any
electricity
*punct* ,
we
must
own
that
we
are
far
too
ignorant
to
argue
that
no
transition
of
any
kind
is
possible
*punct* .
*break*
the
electric
organs
offer
another
and
even
more
serious
difficulty
*punct* ;
for
they
occur
in
only
about
a
dozen
fishes
*punct* ,
of
which
several
are
widely
remote
in
their
affinities
*punct* .
*break*
generally
when
the
same
organ
appears
in
several
members
of
the
same
class
*punct* ,
especially
if
in
members
having
very
different
habits
of
life
*punct* ,
we
may
attribute
its
presence
to
inheritance
from
a
common
ancestor
*punct* ;
and
its
absence
in
some
of
the
members
to
its
loss
through
disuse
or
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
the
electric
organs
had
been
inherited
from
one
ancient
progenitor
thus
provided
*punct* ,
we
might
have
expected
that
all
electric
fishes
would
have
been
specially
related
to
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
nor
does
geology
at
all
lead
to
the
belief
that
formerly
most
fishes
had
electric
organs
*punct* ,
which
most
of
their
modified
descendants
have
lost
*punct* .
*break*
the
presence
of
luminous
organs
in
a
few
insects
*punct* ,
belonging
to
different
families
and
orders
*punct* ,
offers
a
parallel
case
of
difficulty
*punct* .
*break*
other
cases
could
be
given
*punct* ;
for
instance
in
plants
*punct* ,
the
very
curious
contrivance
of
a
mass
of
pollen-grains
*punct* ,
borne
on
a
foot-stalk
with
a
sticky
gland
at
the
end
*punct* ,
is
the
same
in
orchis
and
asclepias,
*punct* ,
genera
almost
as
remote
as
possible
amongst
flowering
plants
*punct* .
*break*
in
all
these
cases
of
two
very
distinct
species
furnished
with
apparently
the
same
anomalous
organ
*punct* ,
it
should
be
observed
that
*punct* ,
although
the
general
appearance
and
function
of
the
organ
may
be
the
same
*punct* ,
yet
some
fundamental
difference
can
generally
be
detected
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
in
nearly
the
same
way
as
two
men
have
sometimes
independently
hit
on
the
very
same
invention
*punct* ,
so
natural
selection
*punct* ,
working
for
the
good
of
each
being
and
taking
advantage
of
analogous
variations
*punct* ,
has
sometimes
modified
in
very
nearly
the
same
manner
two
parts
in
two
organic
beings
*punct* ,
which
owe
but
little
of
their
structure
in
common
to
inheritance
from
the
same
ancestor
*punct* .
*break*
although
in
many
cases
it
is
most
difficult
to
conjecture
by
what
transitions
an
organ
could
have
arrived
at
its
present
state
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
considering
that
the
proportion
of
living
and
known
forms
to
the
extinct
and
unknown
is
very
small
*punct* ,
i
have
been
astonished
how
rarely
an
organ
can
be
named
*punct* ,
towards
which
no
transitional
grade
is
known
to
lead
*punct* .
*break*
the
truth
of
this
remark
is
indeed
shown
by
that
old
canon
in
natural
history
of
natura
non
facit
saltum
*punct* .
*break*
we
meet
with
this
admission
in
the
writings
of
almost
every
experienced
naturalist
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
as
milne
edwards
has
well
expressed
it
*punct* ,
nature
is
prodigal
in
variety
*punct* ,
but
niggard
in
innovation
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
on
the
theory
of
creation
*punct* ,
should
this
be
so
*punct* ?
*break*
why
should
all
the
parts
and
organs
of
many
independent
beings
*punct* ,
each
supposed
to
have
been
separately
created
for
its
proper
place
in
nature
*punct* ,
be
so
invariably
linked
together
by
graduated
steps
*punct* ?
*break*
why
should
not
nature
have
taken
a
leap
from
structure
to
structure
*punct* ?
*break*
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
we
can
clearly
understand
why
she
should
not
*punct* ;
for
natural
selection
can
act
only
by
taking
advantage
of
slight
successive
variations
*punct* ;
she
can
never
take
a
leap
*punct* ,
but
must
advance
by
the
shortest
and
slowest
steps
*punct* .
*break*
organs
of
little
apparent
importance.

natural
selection

and
by
the

i
have
sometimes
felt
much
difficulty
in
understanding
the

simple

of
which
the
importance
does
not
seem
sufficient
to
cause
the

*break*
i
have
sometimes
felt
as
much
difficulty
*punct* ,
though
of
a
very
different
kind
*punct* ,
on
this
head
*punct* ,
as
in
the
case
of
an
organ
as
perfect
and
complex
as
the
eye
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
first
place
*punct* ,
we
are
much
too
ignorant
in
regard
to
the
whole
economy
of
any
one
organic
being
*punct* ,
to
say
what
slight
modifications
would
be
of
importance
or
not
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
former
chapter
i
have
given
instances
of
most
trifling
characters
*punct* ,
such
as
the
down
on
fruit
and
the
colour
of
the
flesh
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
from
determining
the
attacks
of
insects
or
from
being
correlated
with
constitutional
differences
*punct* ,
might
assuredly
be
acted
on
by
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
the
tail
of
the
giraffe
looks
like
an
artificially
constructed
fly-flapper
*punct* ;
and
it
seems
at
first
incredible
that
this
could
have
been
adapted
for
its
present
purpose
by
successive
slight
modifications
*punct* ,
each
better
and
better
*punct* ,
for
so
trifling
an
object
as
driving
away
flies
*punct* ;
yet
we
should
pause
before
being
too
positive
even
in
this
case
*punct* ,
for
we
know
that
the
distribution
and
existence
of
cattle
and
other
animals
in
south
america
absolutely
depends
on
their
power
of
resisting
the
attacks
of
insects
*punct* :
so
that
individuals
which
could
by
any
means
defend
themselves
from
these
small
enemies
*punct* ,
would
be
able
to
range
into
new
pastures
and
thus
gain
a
great
advantage
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
that
the
larger
quadrupeds
are
actually
destroyed
*punct* ,
except
in
some
rare
cases
*punct* ,
by
the
flies
*punct* ,
but
they
are
incessantly
harassed
and
their
strength
reduced
*punct* ,
so
that
they
are
more
subject
to
disease
*punct* ,
or
not
so
well
enabled
in
a
coming
dearth
to
search
for
food
*punct* ,
or
to
escape
from
beasts
of
prey
*punct* .
*break*
organs
now
of
trifling
importance
have
probably
in
some
cases
been
of
high
importance
to
an
early
progenitor
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
after
having
been
slowly
perfected
at
a
former
period
*punct* ,
have
been
transmitted
in
nearly
the
same
state
*punct* ,
although
now
become
of
very
slight
use
*punct* ;
and
any
actually
injurious
deviations
in
their
structure
will
always
have
be
en
checked
by
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
how
important
an
organ
of
locomotion
the
tail
is
in
most
aquatic
animals
*punct* ,
its
general
presence
and
use
for
many
purposes
in
so
many
land
animals
*punct* ,
which
in
their
lungs
or
modified
swim-bladders
betray
their
aquatic
origin
*punct* ,
may
perhaps
be
thus
accounted
for
*punct* .
*break*
a
well-developed
tail
having
been
formed
in
an
aquatic
animal
*punct* ,
it
might
subsequently
come
to
be
worked
in
for
all
sorts
of
purposes
*punct* ,
as
a
fly-flapper
*punct* ,
an
organ
of
prehension
*punct* ,
or
as
an
aid
in
turning
*punct* ,
as
with
the
dog
*punct* ,
though
the
aid
must
be
slight
*punct* ,
for
the
hare
*punct* ,
with
hardly
any
tail
*punct* ,
can
double
quickly
enough
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
second
place
*punct* ,
we
may
sometimes
attribute
importance
to
characters
which
are
really
of
very
little
importance
*punct* ,
and
which
have
originated
from
quite
secondary
causes
*punct* ,
independently
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
we
should
remember
that
climate
*punct* ,
food
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
probably
have
some
little
direct
influence
on
the
organisation
*punct* ;
that
characters
reappear
from
the
law
of
reversion
*punct* ;
that
correlation
of
growth
will
have
had
a
most
important
influence
in
modifying
various
structures
*punct* ;
and
finally
*punct* ,
that
sexual
selection
will
often
have
largely
modified
the
external
characters
of
animals
having
a
will
*punct* ,
to
give
one
male
an
advantage
in
fighting
with
another
or
in
charming
the
females
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
when
a
modification
of
structure
has
primarily
arisen
from
the
above
or
other
unknown
causes
*punct* ,
it
may
at
first
have
been
of
no
advantage
to
the
species
*punct* ,
but
may
subsequently
have
been
taken
advantage
of
by
the
descendants
of
the
species
under
new
conditions
of
life
and
with
newly
acquired
habits
*punct* .
*break*
to
give
a
few
instances
to
illustrate
these
latter
remarks
*punct* .
*break*
if
green
woodpeckers
alone
had
existed
*punct* ,
and
we
did
not
know
that
there
were
many
black
and
pied
kinds
*punct* ,
i
dare
say
that
we
should
have
thought
that
the
green
colour
was
a
beautiful
adaptation
to
hide
this
tree-frequenting
bird
from
its
enemies
*punct* ;
and
consequently
that
it
was
a
character
of
importance
and
might
have
been
acquired
through
natural
selection
*punct* ;
as
it
is
*punct* ,
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
colour
is
due
to
some
quite
distinct
cause
*punct* ,
probably
to
sexual
selection
*punct* .
*break*
a
trailing
bamboo
in
the
malay
archipelago
climbs
the
loftiest
trees
by
the
aid
of
exquisitely
constructed
hooks
clustered
around
the
ends
of
the
branches
*punct* ,
and
this
contrivance
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* ,
is
of
the
highest
service
to
the
plant
*punct* ;
but
as
we
see
nearly
similar
hooks
on
many
trees
which
are
not
climbers
*punct* ,
the
hooks
on
the
bamboo
may
have
arisen
from
unknown
laws
of
growth
*punct* ,
and
have
been
subsequently
taken
advantage
of
by
the
plant
undergoing
further
modification
and
becoming
a
climber
*punct* .
*break*
the
naked
skin
on
the
head
of
a
vulture
is
generally
looked
at
as
a
direct
adaptation
for
wallowing
in
putridity
*punct* ;
and
so
it
may
be
*punct* ,
or
it
may
possibly
be
due
to
the
direct
action
of
putrid
matter
*punct* ;
but
we
should
be
very
cautious
in
drawing
any
such
inference
*punct* ,
when
we
see
that
the
skin
on
the
head
of
the
clean-feeding
male
turkey
is
likewise
naked
*punct* .
*break*
the
sutures
in
the
skulls
of
young
mammals
have
been
advanced
as
a
beautiful
adaptation
for
aiding
parturition
*punct* ,
and
no
doubt
they
facilitate
*punct* ,
or
may
be
indispensable
for
this
act
*punct* ;
but
as
sutures
occur
in
the
skulls
of
young
birds
and
reptiles
*punct* ,
which
have
only
to
escape
from
a
broken
egg
*punct* ,
we
may
infer
that
this
structure
has
arisen
from
the
laws
of
growth
*punct* ,
and
has
been
taken
advantage
of
in
the
parturition
of
the
higher
animals
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
causes
producing
slight
and
unimportant
variations
*punct* ;
and
we
are
immediately
made
conscious
of
this
by
reflecting
on
the
differences
in
the
breeds
of
our
domesticated
animals
in
different
countries,
*punct* ,
more
especially
in
the
less
civilized
countries
where
there
has
been
but
little
artificial
selection
*punct* .
*break*
careful
observers
are
convinced
that
a
damp
climate
affects
the
growth
of
the
hair
*punct* ,
and
that
with
the
hair
the
horns
are
correlated
*punct* .
*break*
mountain
breeds
always
differ
from
lowland
breeds
*punct* ;
and
a
mountainous
country
would
probably
affect
the
hind
limbs
from
exercising
them
more
*punct* ,
and
possibly
even
the
form
of
the
pelvis
*punct* ;
and
then
by
the
law
of
homologous
variation
*punct* ,
the
front
limbs
and
even
the
head
would
probably
be
affected
*punct* .
*break*
the
shape
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
of
the
pelvis
might
affect
by
pressure
the
shape
of
the
head
of
the
young
in
the
womb
*punct* .
*break*
the
laborious
breathing
necessary
in
high
regions
would
*punct* ,
we
have
some
reason
to
believe
*punct* ,
increase
the
size
of
the
chest
*punct* ;
and
again
correlation
would
come
into
play
*punct* .
*break*
animals
kept
by
savages
in
different
countries
often
have
to
struggle
for
their
own
subsistence
*punct* ,
and
would
be
exposed
to
a
certain
extent
to
natural
selection
*punct* ,
and
individuals
with
slightly
different
constitutions
would
succeed
best
under
different
climates
*punct* ;
and
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
constitution
and
colour
are
correlated
*punct* .
*break*
a
good
observer
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
states
that
in
cattle
susceptibility
to
the
attacks
of
flies
is
correlated
with
colour
*punct* ,
as
is
the
liability
to
be
poisoned
by
certain
plants
*punct* ;
so
that
colour
would
be
thus
subjected
to
the
action
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
are
far
too
ignorant
to
speculate
on
the
relative
importance
of
the
several
known
and
unknown
laws
of
variation
*punct* ;
and
i
have
here
alluded
to
them
only
to
show
that
*punct* ,
if
we
are
unable
to
account
for
the
characteristic
differences
of
our
domestic
breeds
*punct* ,
which
nevertheless
we
generally
admit
to
have
arisen
through
ordinary
generation
*punct* ,
we
ought
not
to
lay
too
much
stress
on
our
ignorance
of
the
precise
cause
of
the
slight
analogous
differences
between
species
*punct* .
*break*
i
might
have
adduced
for
this
same
purpose
the
differences
between
the
races
of
man
*punct* ,
which
are
so
strongly
marked
*punct* ;
i
may
add
that
some
little
light
can
apparently
be
thrown
on
the
origin
of
these
differences
*punct* ,
chiefly
through
sexual
selection
of
a
particular
kind
*punct* ,
but
without
here
entering
on
copious
details
my
reasoning
would
appear
frivolous
*punct* .
*break*
the
foregoing
remarks
lead
me
to
say
a
few
words
on
the
protest
lately
made
by
some
naturalists
*punct* ,
against
the
utilitarian
doctrine
that
every
detail
of
structure
has
been
produced
for
the
good
of
its
possessor
*punct* .
*break*
they
believe
that
very
many
structures
have
been
created
for
beauty
in
the
eyes
of
man
*punct* ,
or
for
mere
variety
*punct* .
*break*
this
doctrine
*punct* ,
if
true
*punct* ,
would
be
absolutely
fatal
to
my
theory
*punct* .
*break*
yet
i
fully
admit
that
many
structures
are
of
no
direct
use
to
their
possessors
*punct* .
*break*
physical
conditions
probably
have
had
some
little
effect
on
structure
*punct* ,
quite
independently
of
any
good
thus
gained
*punct* .
*break*
correlation
of
growth
has
no
doubt
played
a
most
important
part
*punct* ,
and
a
useful
modification
of
one
part
will
often
have
entailed
on
other
parts
diversified
changes
of
no
direct
use
*punct* .
*break*
so
again
characters
which
formerly
were
useful
*punct* ,
or
which
formerly
had
arisen
from
correlation
of
growth
*punct* ,
or
from
other
unknown
cause
*punct* ,
may
reappear
from
the
law
of
reversion
*punct* ,
though
now
of
no
direct
use
*punct* .
*break*
the
effects
of
sexual
selection
*punct* ,
when
displayed
in
beauty
to
charm
the
females
*punct* ,
can
be
called
useful
only
in
rather
a
forced
sense
*punct* .
*break*
but
by
far
the
most
important
consideration
is
that
the
chief
part
of
the
organisation
of
every
being
is
simply
due
to
inheritance
*punct* ;
and
consequently
*punct* ,
though
each
being
assuredly
is
well
fitted
for
its
place
in
nature
*punct* ,
many
structures
now
have
no
direct
relation
to
the
habits
of
life
of
each
species
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
we
can
hardly
believe
that
the
webbed
feet
of
the
upland
goose
or
of
the
frigate-bird
are
of
special
use
to
these
birds
*punct* ;
we
cannot
believe
that
the
same
bones
in
the
arm
of
the
monkey
*punct* ,
in
the
fore
leg
of
the
horse
*punct* ,
in
the
wing
of
the
bat
*punct* ,
and
in
the
flipper
of
the
seal
*punct* ,
are
of
special
use
to
these
animals
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
safely
attribute
these
structures
to
inheritance
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
the
progenitor
of
the
upland
goose
and
of
the
frigate-bird
*punct* ,
webbed
feet
no
doubt
were
as
useful
as
they
now
are
to
the
most
aquatic
of
existing
birds
*punct* .
*break*
so
we
may
believe
that
the
progenitor
of
the
seal
had
not
a
flipper
*punct* ,
but
a
foot
with
five
toes
fitted
for
walking
or
grasping
*punct* ;
and
we
may
further
venture
to
believe
that
the
several
bones
in
the
limbs
of
the
monkey
*punct* ,
horse
*punct* ,
and
bat
*punct* ,
which
have
been
inherited
from
a
common
progenitor
*punct* ,
were
formerly
of
more
special
use
to
that
progenitor
*punct* ,
or
its
progenitors
*punct* ,
than
they
now
are
to
these
animals
having
such
widely
diversified
habits
*punct* .
*break*
hence
every
detail
of
structure
in
every
living
creature
*punct* ,
making
some
little
allowance
for
the
direct
action
of
physical
conditions
*punct* ,
may
be
viewed
*punct* ,
either
as
having
been
of
special
use
to
some
ancestral
form
*punct* ,
or
as
being
now
of
special
use
to
the
descendants
of
this
form
*punct* ,
either
directly
*punct* ,
or
indirectly
through
the
complex
laws
of
growth
*punct* .
*break*
natural
selection
cannot
possibly
produce
any
modification
in
any
one
species
exclusively
for
the
good
of
another
species
*punct* ;
though
throughout
nature
one
species
incessantly
takes
advantage
of
*punct* ,
and
profits
by
*punct* ,
the
structure
of
another
*punct* .
*break*
but
natural
selection
can
and
does
often
produce
structures
for
the
direct
injury
of
other
species
*punct* ,
as
we
see
in
the
fang
of
the
adder
*punct* ,
and
in
the
ovipositor
of
the
ichneumon
*punct* ,
by
which
its
eggs
are
deposited
in
the
living
bodies
of
other
insects
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
could
be
proved
that
any
part
of
the
structure
of
any
one
species
had
been
formed
for
the
exclusive
good
of
another
species
*punct* ,
it
would
annihilate
my
theory
*punct* ,
for
such
could
not
have
been
produced
through
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
although
many
statements
may
be
found
in
works
on
natural
history
to
this
effect
*punct* ,
i
cannot
find
even
one
which
seems
to
me
of
any
weight
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
admitted
that
the
rattlesnake
has
a
poison-fang
for
its
own
defence
and
for
the
destruction
of
its
prey
*punct* ;
but
some
authors
suppose
that
at
the
same
time
this
snake
is
furnished
with
a
rattle
for
its
own
injury
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
to
warn
its
prey
to
escape
*punct* .
*break*
i
would
almost
as
soon
believe
that
the
cat
curls
the
end
of
its
tail
when
preparing
to
spring
*punct* ,
in
order
to
warn
the
doomed
mouse
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
have
not
space
here
to
enter
on
this
and
other
such
cases
*punct* .
*break*
natural
selection
will
never
produce
in
a
being
anything
injurious
to
itself
*punct* ,
for
natural
selection
acts
solely
by
and
for
the
good
of
each
*punct* .
*break*
no
organ
will
be
formed
*punct* ,
as
paley
has
remarked
*punct* ,
for
the
purpose
of
causing
pain
or
for
doing
an
injury
to
its
possessor
*punct* .
*break*
if
a
fair
balance
be
struck
between
the
good
and
evil
caused
by
each
part
*punct* ,
each
will

*break*
after
the
lapse
of
time
*punct* ,
under
changing
conditions
of
life

if
any
part
comes
to
be
injurious
*punct* ,
it

be
modified

the
being
will
become
extinct

myriads

natural

we

this

the

perfection
attained

nature

the

new

they
are
now
rapidly
yielding

the
advancing
legions
of
plants

animals
introduced
from
europe

*break*
natural
selection
will
not
produce
absolute
perfection
*punct* ,
nor
do
we
always
meet
*punct* ,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
*punct* ,
with
this
high
standard
under
nature
*punct* .
*break*
the
correction
for
the
aberration
of
light
is
said

on
high
authority
*punct* ,
not
to
be
perfect
even
in
that
most
perfect
organ
*punct* ,
the
eye
*punct* .
*break*
if
our
reason
leads
us
to
admire
with
enthusiasm
a
multitude
of
inimitable
contrivances
in
nature
*punct* ,
this
same
reason
tells
us
*punct* ,
though
we
may
easily
err
on
both
sides
*punct* ,
that
some
other
contrivances
are
less
perfect
*punct* .
*break*
can
we
consider
the
sting
of
the
wasp
or
of
the
bee
as
perfect
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
when
used
against
many
attacking
animals
*punct* ,
cannot
be
withdrawn
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
backward
serratures
*punct* ,
and
so
inevitably
causes
the
death
of
the
insect
by
tearing
out
its
viscera
*punct* ?
*break*
if
we
look
at
the
sting
of
the
bee
*punct* ,
as
having
originally
existed
in
a
remote
progenitor
as
a
boring
and
serrated
instrument
*punct* ,
like
that
in
so
many
members
of
the
same
great
order
*punct* ,
and
which
has
been
modified
but
not
perfected
for
its
present
purpose
*punct* ,
with
the
poison
originally
adapted
to
cause
galls
subsequently
intensified
*punct* ,
we
can
perhaps
understand
how
it
is
that
the
use
of
the
sting
should
so
often
cause
the
insect's
own
death
*punct* :
for
if
on
the
whole
the
power
of
stinging
be
useful
to
the
community
*punct* ,
it
will
fulfil
all
the
requirements
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
though
it
may
cause
the
death
of
some
few
members
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
admire
the
truly
wonderful
power
of
scent
by
which
the
males
of
many
insects
find
their
females
*punct* ,
can
we
admire
the
production
for
this
single
purpose
of
thousands
of
drones
*punct* ,
which
are
utterly
useless
to
the
community
for
any
other
end
*punct* ,
and
which
are
ultimately
slaughtered
by
their
industrious
and
sterile
sisters
*punct* ?
*break*
it
may
be
difficult
*punct* ,
but
we
ought
to
admire
the
savage
instinctive
hatred
of
the
queen-bee
*punct* ,
which
urges
her
instantly
to
destroy
the
young
queens
her
daughters
as
soon
as
born
*punct* ,
or
to
perish
herself
in
the
combat
*punct* ;
for
undoubtedly
this
is
for
the
good
of
the
community
*punct* ;
and
maternal
love
or
maternal
hatred
*punct* ,
though
the
latter
fortunately
is
most
rare
*punct* ,
is
all
the
same
to
the
inexorable
principle
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
admire
the
several
ingenious
contrivances
*punct* ,
by
which
the
flowers
of
the
orchis
and
of
many
other
plants
are
fertilised
through
insect
agency
*punct* ,
can
we
consider
as
equally
perfect
the
elaboration
by
our
fir-trees
of
dense
clouds
of
pollen
*punct* ,
in
order
that
a
few
granules
may
be
wafted
by

*break*
summary
of
chapter
*punct* ,
we
have
in
this
chapter
discussed
some
of
the
difficulties
and
objections
which
may
be
urged
against
my
theory
*punct* .
*break*
many
of
them
are
very
grave
*punct* ;
but
i
think
that
in
the
discussion
light
has
been
thrown
on
several
facts
*punct* ,
which
on
the
theory
of
independent
acts
of
creation
are
utterly
obscure
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
seen
that
species
at
any
one
period
are
not
indefinitely
variable
*punct* ,
and
are
not
linked
together
by
a
multitude
of
intermediate
gradations
*punct* ,
partly
because
the
process
of
natural
selection
will
always
be
very
slow
*punct* ,
and
will
act
*punct* ,
at
any
one
time
*punct* ,
only
on
a
very
few
forms
*punct* ;
and
partly
because
the
very
process
of
natural
selection
almost
implies
the
continual
supplanting
and
extinction
of
preceding
and
intermediate
gradations
*punct* .
*break*
closely
allied
species
*punct* ,
now
living
on
a
continuous
area
*punct* ,
must
often
have
been
formed
when
the
area
was
not
continuous
*punct* ,
and
when
the
conditions
of
life
did
not
insensibly
graduate
away
from
one
part
to
another
*punct* .
*break*
when
two
varieties
are
formed
in
two
districts
of
a
continuous
area
*punct* ,
an
intermediate
variety
will
often
be
formed
*punct* ,
fitted
for
an
intermediate
zone
*punct* ;
but
from
reasons
assigned
*punct* ,
the
intermediate
variety
will
usually
exist
in
lesser
numbers
than
the
two
forms
which
it
connects
*punct* ;
consequently
the
two
latter
*punct* ,
during
the
course
of
further
modification
*punct* ,
from
existing
in
greater
numbers
*punct* ,
will
have
a
great
advantage
over
the
less
numerous
intermediate
variety
*punct* ,
and
will
thus
generally
succeed
in
supplanting
and
exterminating
it
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
seen
in
this
chapter
how
cautious
we
should
be
in
concluding
that
the
most
different
habits
of
life
could
not
graduate
into
each
other
*punct* ;
that
a
bat
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
could
not
have
been
formed
by
natural
selection
from
an
animal
which
at
first
could
only
glide
through
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
seen
that
a
species
may
under
new
conditions
of
life
change
its
habits
*punct* ,
or
have
diversified
habits
*punct* ,
with
some
habits
very
unlike
those
of
its
nearest
congeners
*punct* .
*break*
hence
we
can
understand
*punct* ,
bearing
in
mind
that
each
organic
being
is
trying
to
live
wherever
it
can
live
*punct* ,
how
it
has
arisen
that
there
are
upland
geese
with
webbed
feet
*punct* ,
ground
woodpeckers
*punct* ,
diving
thrushes
*punct* ,
and
petrels
with
the
habits
of
auks
*punct* .
*break*
although
the
belief
that
an
organ
so
perfect
as
the
eye
could
have
been
formed
by
natural
selection
*punct* ,
is
more
than
enough
to
stagger
any
one
*punct* ;
yet
in
the
case
of
any
organ
*punct* ,
if
we
know
of
a
long
series
of
gradations
in
complexity
*punct* ,
each
good
for
its
possessor
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
under
changing
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
there
is
no
logical
impossibility
in
the
acquirement
of
any
conceivable
degree
of
perfection
through
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
cases
in
which
we
know
of
no
intermediate
or
transitional
states
*punct* ,
we
should
be
very
cautious
in
concluding
that
none
could
have
existed
*punct* ,
for
the
homologies
of
many
organs
and
their
intermediate
states
show
that
wonderful
metamorphoses
in
function
are
at
least
possible
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
a
swim-bladder
has
apparently
been
converted
into
an
air-breathing
lung
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
organ
having
performed
simultaneously
very
different
functions
*punct* ,
and
then
having
been
specialised
for
one
function
*punct* ;
and
two
very
distinct
organs
having
performed
at
the
same
time
the
same
function
*punct* ,
the
one
having
been
perfected
whilst
aided
by
the
other
*punct* ,
must
often
have
largely
facilitated
transitions
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
far
too
ignorant
*punct* ,
in
almost
every
case
*punct* ,
to
be
enabled
to
assert
that
any
part
or
organ
is
so
unimportant
for
the
welfare
of
a
species
*punct* ,
that
modifications
in
its
structure
could
not
have
been
slowly
accumulated
by
means
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
may
confidently
believe
that
many
modifications
*punct* ,
wholly
due
to
the
laws
of
growth
*punct* ,
and
at
first
in
no
way
advantageous
to
a
species
*punct* ,
have
been
subsequently
taken
advantage
of
by
the
still
further
modified
descendants
of
this
species
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
believe
that
a
part
formerly
of
high
importance
has
often
been
retained
*punct* ,
as
the
tail
of
an
aquatic
animal
by
its
terrestrial
descendants
*punct* ,
though
it
has
become
of
such
small
importance
that
it
could
not
*punct* ,
in
its
present
state
*punct* ,
have
been
acquired
by
natural
selection,
*punct* ,
a
power
which
acts
solely
by
the
preservation
of
profitable
variations
in
the
struggle
for
life
*punct* .
*break*
natural
selection
will
produce
nothing
in
one
species
for
the
exclusive
good
or
injury
of
another
*punct* ;
though
it
may
well
produce
parts
*punct* ,
organs
*punct* ,
and
excretions
highly
useful
or
even
indispensable
*punct* ,
or
highly
injurious
to
another
species
*punct* ,
but
in
all
cases
at
the
same
time
useful
to
the
owner
*punct* .
*break*
natural
selection
in
each
well-stocked
country
*punct* ,
must
act
chiefly
through
the
competition
of
the
inhabitants
one
with
another
*punct* ,
and
consequently
will
produce
perfection
*punct* ,
or
strength
in
the
battle
for
life
*punct* ,
only
according
to
the
standard
of
that
country
*punct* .
*break*
hence
the
inhabitants
of
one
country
*punct* ,
generally
the
smaller
one
*punct* ,
will
often
yield
*punct* ,
as
we
see
they
do
yield
*punct* ,
to
the
inhabitants
of
another
and
generally
larger
country
*punct* .
*break*
for
in
the
larger
country
there
will
have
existed
more
individuals
*punct* ,
and
more
diversified
forms
*punct* ,
and
the
competition
will
have
been
severer
*punct* ,
and
thus
the
standard
of
perfection
will
have
been
rendered
higher
*punct* .
*break*
natural
selection
will
not
necessarily
produce
absolute
perfection
*punct* ;
nor
*punct* ,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
by
our
limited
faculties
*punct* ,
can
absolute
perfection
be
everywhere
found
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
we
can
clearly
understand
the
full
meaning
of
that
old
canon
in
natural
history
*punct* ,
natura
non
facit
saltum
*punct* .
*break*
this
canon
*punct* ,
if
we
look
only
to
the
present
inhabitants
of
the
world
*punct* ,
is
not
strictly
correct
*punct* ,
but
if
we
include
all
those
of
past
times
*punct* ,
it
must
by
my
theory
be
strictly
true
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
generally
acknowledged
that
all
organic
beings
have
been
formed
on
two
great
laws
*punct* ,
unity
of
type
*punct* ,
and
the
conditions
of
existence
*punct* .
*break*
by
unity
of
type
is
meant
that
fundamental
agreement
in
structure
*punct* ,
which
we
see
in
organic
beings
of
the
same
class
*punct* ,
and
which
is
quite
independent
of
their
habits
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
on
my
theory
*punct* ,
unity
of
type
is
explained
by
unity
of
descent
*punct* .
*break*
the
expression
of
conditions
of
existence
*punct* ,
so
often
insisted
on
by
the
illustrious
cuvier
*punct* ,
is
fully
embraced
by
the
principle
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
for
natural
selection
acts
by
either
now
adapting
the
varying
parts
of
each
being
to
its
organic
and
inorganic
conditions
of
life
*punct* ;
or
by
having
adapted
them
during
long-past
periods
of
time
*punct* :
the
adaptations
being
aided
in
some
cases
by
use
and
disuse
*punct* ,
being
slightly
affected
by
the
direct
action
of
the
external
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
and
being
in
all
cases
subjected
to
the
several
laws
of
growth
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
the
law
of
the
conditions
of
existence
is
the
higher
law
*punct* ;
as
it
includes
*punct* ,
through
the
inheritance
of
former
adaptations
*punct* ,
that
of
unity
of
type
*punct* .
*break*
the
subject
of
instinct
might
have
been
worked
into
the
previous
chapters
*punct* ;
but
i
have
thought
that
it
would
be
more
convenient
to
treat
the
subject
separately
*punct* ,
especially
as
so
wonderful
an
instinct
as
that
of
the
hive-bee
making
its
cells
will
probably
have
occurred
to
many
readers
*punct* ,
as
a
difficulty
sufficient
to
overthrow
my
whole
theory
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
premise
*punct* ,
that
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
origin
of
the
primary
mental
powers
*punct* ,
any
more
than
i
have
with
that
of
life
itself
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
concerned
only
with
the
diversities
of
instinct
and
of
the
other
mental
qualities
of
animals
within
the
same
class
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
not
attempt
any
definition
of
instinct
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
easy
to
show
that
several
distinct
mental
actions
are
commonly
embraced
by
this
term
*punct* ;
but
every
one
understands
what
is
meant
*punct* ,
when
it
is
said
that
instinct
impels
the
cuckoo
to
migrate
and
to
lay
her
eggs
in
other
birds
nests
*punct* .
*break*
an
action
*punct* ,
which
we
ourselves
should
require
experience
to
enable
us
to
perform
*punct* ,
when
performed
by
an
animal
*punct* ,
more
especially
by
a
very
young
one
*punct* ,
without
any
experience
*punct* ,
and
when
performed
by
many
individuals
in
the
same
way
*punct* ,
without
their
knowing
for
what
purpose
it
is
performed
*punct* ,
is
usually
said
to
be
instinctive
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
could
show
that
none
of
these
characters
of
instinct
are
universal
*punct* .
*break*
a
little
dose
*punct* ,
as
pierre
huber
expresses
it
*punct* ,
of
judgment
or
reason
*punct* ,
often
comes
into
play
*punct* ,
even
in
animals
very
low
in
the
scale
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
frederick
cuvier
and
several
of
the
older
metaphysicians
have
compared
instinct
with
habit
*punct* .
*break*
this
comparison
gives
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
a
remarkably
accurate
notion
of
the
frame
of
mind
under
which
an
instinctive
action
is
performed
*punct* ,
but
not
of
its
origin
*punct* .
*break*
how
unconsciously
many
habitual
actions
are
performed
*punct* ,
indeed
not
rarely
in
direct
opposition
to
our
conscious
will
*punct* !
*break*
yet
they
may
be
modified
by
the
will
or
reason
*punct* .
*break*
habits
easily
become
associated
with
other
habits
*punct* ,
and
with
certain
periods
of
time
and
states
of
the
body
*punct* .
*break*
when
once
acquired
*punct* ,
they
often
remain
constant
throughout
life
*punct* .
*break*
several
other
points
of
resemblance
between
instincts
and
habits
could
be
pointed
out
*punct* .
*break*
huber
found
it
was
with
a
caterpillar
*punct* ,
which
makes
a
very
complicated
hammock
*punct* ;
for
if
he
took
a
caterpillar
which
had
completed
its
hammock
up
to
*punct* ,
say
*punct* ,
the
sixth
stage
of
construction
*punct* ,
and
put
it
into
a
hammock
completed
up
only
to
the
third
stage
*punct* ,
the
caterpillar
simply
re-performed
the
fourth
*punct* ,
fifth
*punct* ,
and
sixth
stages
of
construction
*punct* .
*break*
if
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
a
caterpillar
were
taken
out
of
a
hammock
made
up
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
to
the
third
stage
*punct* ,
and
were
put
into
one
finished
up
to
the
sixth
stage
*punct* ,
so
that
much
of
its
work
was
already
done
for
it
*punct* ,
far
from
feeling
the
benefit
of
this
*punct* ,
it
was
much
embarrassed
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
order
to
complete
its
hammock
*punct* ,
seemed
forced
to
start
from
the
third
stage
*punct* ,
where
it
had
left
off
*punct* ,
and
thus
tried
to
complete
the
already
finished
work
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
suppose
any
habitual
action
to
become
inherited
*punct* ,
and
i
think
it
can
be
shown
that
this
does
sometimes
happen
*punct* ,
then
the
resemblance
between
what
originally
was
a
habit
and
an
instinct
becomes
so
close
as
not
to
be
distinguished
*punct* .

little
practice
*punct* ,
had
played
a
tune
with
no
practice
at
all
*punct* ,
be
might
truly
be
said
to
have
done
so
instinctively
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
would
be
the
most
serious
error
to
suppose
that
the
greater
number
of
instincts
have
been
acquired
by
habit
in
one
generation
*punct* ,
and
then
transmitted
by
inheritance
to
succeeding
generations
*punct* .
*break*
it
can
be
clearly
shown
that
the
most
wonderful
instincts
with
which
we
are
acquainted
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
those
of
the
hive-bee
and
of
many
ants
*punct* ,
could
not
possibly
have
been
thus
acquired
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
be
universally
admitted
that
instincts
are
as
important
as
corporeal
structure
for
the
welfare
of
each
species
*punct* ,
under
its
present
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
under
changed
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
it
is
at
least
possible
that
slight
modifications
of
instinct
might
be
profitable
to
a
species
*punct* ;
and
if
it
can
be
shown
that
instincts
do
vary
ever
so
little
*punct* ,
then
i
can
see
no
difficulty
in
natural
selection
preserving
and
continually
accumulating
variations
of
instinct
to
any
extent
that
may
be
profitable
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
thus
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
that
all
the
most
complex
and
wonderful
instincts
have
originated
*punct* .
*break*
as
modifications
of
corporeal
structure
arise
from
*punct* ,
and
are
increased
by
*punct* ,
use
or
habit
*punct* ,
and
are
diminished
or
lost
by
disuse
*punct* ,
so
i
do
not
doubt
it
has
been
with
instincts
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
believe
that
the
effects
of
habit
are
of
quite
subordinate
importance
to
the
effects
of
the
natural
selection
of
what
may
be
called
accidental
variations
of
instincts;
*punct* ,
that
is
of
variations
produced
by
the
same
unknown
causes
which
produce
slight
deviations
of
bodily
structure
*punct* .
*break*
no
complex
instinct
can
possibly
be
produced
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
except
by
the
slow
and
gradual
accumulation
of
numerous
*punct* ,
slight
*punct* ,
yet
profitable
*punct* ,
variations
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
as
in
the
case
of
corporeal
structures
*punct* ,
we
ought
to
find
in
nature
*punct* ,
not
the
actual
transitional
gradations
by
which
each
complex
instinct
has
been
acquired
*punct* ,
for
these
could
be
found
only
in
the
lineal
ancestors
of
each
species
*punct* ,
but
we
ought
to
find
in
the
collateral
lines
of
descent
some
evidence
of
such
gradations
*punct* ;
or
we
ought
at
least
to
be
able
to
show
that
gradations
of
some
kind
are
possible
*punct* ;
and
this
we
certainly
can
do
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
been
surprised
to
find
*punct* ,
making
allowance
for
the
instincts
of
animals
having
been
but
little
observed
except
in
europe
and
north
america
*punct* ,
and
for
no
instinct
being
known
amongst
extinct
species
*punct* ,
how
very
generally
gradations
*punct* ,
leading
to
the
most
complex
instincts
*punct* ,
can
be
discovered
*punct* .
*break*
the
canon
of
natura
non
facit
saltum
applies
with
almost
equal
force
to
instincts
as
to
bodily
organs
*punct* .
*break*
changes
of
instinct
may
sometimes
be
facilitated
by
the
same
species
having
different
instincts
at
different
periods
of
life
*punct* ,
or
at
different
seasons
of
the
year
*punct* ,
or
when
placed
under
different
circumstances
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ;
in
which
case
either
one
or
the
other
instinct
might
be
preserved
by
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
and
such
instances
of
diversity
of
instinct
in
the
same
species
can
be
shown
to
occur
in
nature
*punct* .
*break*
again
as
in
the
case
of
corporeal
structure
*punct* ,
and
conformably
with
my
theory
*punct* ,
the
instinct
of
each
species
is
good
for
itself
*punct* ,
but
has
never
*punct* ,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
*punct* ,
been
produced
for
the
exclusive
good
of
others
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
the
strongest
instances
of
an
animal
apparently
performing
an
action
for
the
sole
good
of
another
*punct* ,
with
which
i
am
acquainted
*punct* ,
is
that
of
aphides
voluntarily
yielding
their
sweet
excretion
to
ants
*punct* :
that
they
do
so
voluntarily
*punct* ,
the
following
facts
show
*punct* .
*break*
i
removed
all
the
ants
from
a
group
of
about
a
dozen
aphides
on
a
dock-plant
*punct* ,
and
prevented
their
attendance
during
several
hours
*punct* .
*break*
after
this
interval
*punct* ,
i
felt
sure
that
the
aphides
would
want
to
excrete
*punct* .
*break*
i
watched
them
for
some
time
through
a
lens
*punct* ,
but
not
one
excreted
*punct* ;
i
then
tickled
and
stroked
them
with
a
hair
in
the
same
manner
*punct* ,
as
well
as
i
could
*punct* ,
as
the
ants
do
with
their
antennae
*punct* ;
but
not
one
excreted
*punct* .
*break*
afterwards
i
allowed
an
ant
to
visit
them
*punct* ,
and
it
immediately
seemed
*punct* ,
by
its
eager
way
of
running
about
*punct* ,
to
be
well
aware
what
a
rich
flock
it
had
discovered
*punct* ;
it
then
began
to
play
with
its
antennae
on
the
abdomen
first
of
one
aphis
and
then
of
another
*punct* ;
and
each
aphis
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
it
felt
the
antennae
*punct* ,
immediately
lifted
up
its
abdomen
and
excreted
a
limpid
drop
of
sweet
juice
*punct* ,
which
was
eagerly
devoured
by
the
ant
*punct* .
*break*
even
the
quite
young
aphides
behaved
in
this
manner
*punct* ,
showing
that
the
action
was
instinctive
*punct* ,
and
not
the
result
of
experience
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
the
excretion
is
extremely
viscid
*punct* ,
it
is
probably
a
convenience
to
the
aphides
to
have
it
removed
*punct* ;
and
therefore
probably
the
aphides
do
not
instinctively
excrete
for
the
sole
good
of
the
ants
*punct* .
*break*
although
i
do
not
believe
that
any
animal
in
the
world
performs
an
action
for
the
exclusive
good
of
another
of
a
distinct
species
*punct* ,
yet
each
species
tries
to
take
advantage
of
the
instincts
of
others
*punct* ,
as
each
takes
advantage
of
the
weaker
bodily
structure
of
others
*punct* .
*break*
so
again
*punct* ,
in
some
few
cases
*punct* ,
certain
instincts
cannot
be
considered
as
absolutely
perfect
*punct* ;
but
as
details
on
this
and
other
such
points
are
not
indispensable
*punct* ,
they
may
be
here
passed
over
*punct* .
*break*
as
some
degree
of
variation
in
instincts
under
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
and
the
inheritance
of
such
variations
*punct* ,
are
indispensable
for
the
action
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
as
many
instances
as
possible
ought
to
have
been
here
given
*punct* ;
but
want
of
space
prevents
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
only
assert
*punct* ,
that
instincts
certainly
do
vary
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
migratory
instinct
*punct* ,
both
in
extent
and
direction
*punct* ,
and
in
its
total
loss
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
is
with
the
nests
of
birds
*punct* ,
which
vary
partly
in
dependence
on
the
situations
chosen
*punct* ,
and
on
the
nature
and
temperature
of
the
country
inhabited
*punct* ,
but
often
from
causes
wholly
unknown
to
us
*punct* :
audubon
has
given
several
remarkable
cases
of
differences
in
nests
of
the
same
species
in
the
northern
and
southern
united
states
*punct* .
*break*
fear
of
any
particular
enemy
is
certainly
an
instinctive
quality
*punct* ,
as
may
be
seen
in
nestling
birds
*punct* ,
though
it
is
strengthened
by
experience
*punct* ,
and
by
the
sight
of
fear
of
the
same
enemy
in
other
animals
*punct* .
*break*
but
fear
of
man
is
slowly
acquired
*punct* ,
as
i
have
elsewhere
shown
*punct* ,
by
various
animals
inhabiting
desert
islands
*punct* ;
and
we
may
see
an
instance
of
this
*punct* ,
even
in
england
*punct* ,
in
the
greater
wildness
of
all
our
large
birds
than
of
our
small
birds
*punct* ;
for
the
large
birds
have
been
most
persecuted
by
man
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
safely
attribute
the
greater
wildness
of
our
large
birds
to
this
cause
*punct* ;
for
in
uninhabited
islands
large
birds
are
not
more
fearful
than
small
*punct* ;
and
the
magpie
*punct* ,
so
wary
in
england
*punct* ,
is
tame
in
norway
*punct* ,
as
is
the
hooded
crow
in
egypt
*punct* .
*break*
that
the
general
disposition
of
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
born
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
is
extremely
diversified
*punct* ,
can
be
shown
by
a
multitude
of
facts
*punct* .
*break*
several
cases
also
*punct* ,
could
be
given
*punct* ,
of
occasional
and
strange
habits
in
certain
species
*punct* ,
which
might
*punct* ,
if
advantageous
to
the
species
*punct* ,
give
rise
*punct* ,
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
to
quite
new
instincts
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
am
well
aware
that
these
general
statements
*punct* ,
without
facts
given
in
detail
*punct* ,
can
produce
but
a
feeble
effect
on
the
reader's
mind
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
only
repeat
my
assurance
*punct* ,
that
i
do
not
speak
without
good
evidence
*punct* .
*break*
the
possibility
*punct* ,
or
even
probability
*punct* ,
of
inherited
variations
of
instinct
in
a
state
of
nature
will
be
strengthened
by
briefly
considering
a
few
cases
under
domestication
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
thus
also
be
enabled
to
see
the
respective
parts
which
habit
and
the
selection
of
so-called
accidental
variations
have
played
in
modifying
the
mental
qualities
of
our
domestic
animals
*punct* .
*break*
a
number
of
curious
and
authentic
instances
could
be
given
of
the
inheritance
of
all
shades
of
disposition
and
tastes
*punct* ,
and
likewise
of
the
oddest
tricks
*punct* ,
associated
with
certain
frames
of
mind
or
periods
of
time
*punct* .
*break*
but
let
us
look
to
the
familiar
case
of
the
several
breeds
of
dogs
*punct* :
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
young
pointers
*punct* ,
i
have
myself
seen
a
striking
instance
*punct* ,
will
sometimes
point
and
even
back
other
dogs
the
very
first
time
that
they
are
taken
out
*punct* ;
retrieving
is
certainly
in
some
degree
inherited
by
retrievers
*punct* ;
and
a
tendency
to
run
round
*punct* ,
instead
of
at
*punct* ,
a
flock
of
sheep
*punct* ,
by
shepherd-dogs
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
see
that
these
actions
*punct* ,
performed
without
experience
by
the
young
*punct* ,
and
in
nearly
the
same
manner
by
each
individual
*punct* ,
performed
with
eager
delight
by
each
breed
*punct* ,
and
without
the
end
being
known,
*punct* ,
for
the
young
pointer
can
no
more
know
that
he
points
to
aid
his
master
*punct* ,
than
the
white
butterfly
knows
why
she
lays
her
eggs
on
the
leaf
of
the
cabbage,
*punct* ,
i
cannot
see
that
these
actions
differ
essentially
from
true
instincts
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
were
to
see
one
kind
of
wolf
*punct* ,
when
young
and
without
any
training
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
it
scented
its
prey
*punct* ,
stand
motionless
like
a
statue
*punct* ,
and
then
slowly
crawl
forward
with
a
peculiar
gait
*punct* ;
and
another
kind
of
wolf
rushing
round
*punct* ,
instead
of
at
*punct* ,
a
herd
of
deer
*punct* ,
and
driving
them
to
a
distant
point
*punct* ,
we
should
assuredly
call
these
actions
instinctive
*punct* .
*break*
domestic
instincts
*punct* ,
as
they
may
be
called
*punct* ,
are
certainly
far
less
fixed
or
invariable
than
natural
instincts
*punct* ;
but
they
have
been
acted
on
by
far
less
rigorous
selection
*punct* ,
and
have
been
transmitted
for
an
incomparably
shorter
period
*punct* ,
under
less
fixed
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
how
strongly
these
domestic
instincts
*punct* ,
habits
*punct* ,
and
dispositions
are
inherited
*punct* ,
and
how
curiously
they
become
mingled
*punct* ,
is
well
shown
when
different
breeds
of
dogs
are
crossed
*punct* .
*break*
thus
it
is
known
that
a
cross
with
a
bull-dog
has
affected
for
many
generations
the
courage
and
obstinacy
of
greyhounds
*punct* ;
and
a
cross
with
a
greyhound
has
given
to
a
whole
family
of
shepherd-dogs
a
tendency
to
hunt
hares
*punct* .
*break*
these
domestic
instincts
*punct* ,
when
thus
tested
by
crossing
*punct* ,
resemble
natural
instincts
*punct* ,
which
in
a
like
manner
become
curiously
blended
together
*punct* ,
and
for
a
long
period
exhibit
traces
of
the
instincts
of
either
parent
*punct* :
for
example
*punct* ,
le
roy
describes
a
dog
*punct* ,
whose
great-grandfather
was
a
wolf
*punct* ,
and
this
dog
showed
a
trace
of
its
wild
parentage
only
in
one
way
*punct* ,
by
not
coming
in
a
straight
line
to
his
master
when
called
*punct* .
*break*
domestic
instincts
are
sometimes
spoken
of
as
actions
which
have
become
inherited
solely
from
long-continued
and
compulsory
habit
*punct* ,
but
this
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
is
not
true
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
would
ever
have
thought
of
teaching
*punct* ,
or
probably
could
have
taught
*punct* ,
the
tumbler-pigeon
to
tumble,
*punct* ,
an
action
which
*punct* ,
as
i
have
witnessed
*punct* ,
is
performed
by
young
birds
*punct* ,
that
have
never
seen
a
pigeon
tumble
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
believe
that
some
one
pigeon
showed
a
slight
tendency
to
this
strange
habit
*punct* ,
and
that
the
long-continued
selection
of
the
best
individuals
in
successive
generations
made
tumblers
what
they
now
are
*punct* ;
and
near
glasgow
there
are
house-tumblers
*punct* ,
as
i
hear
from
mr.
brent
*punct* ,
which
cannot
fly
eighteen
inches
high
without
going
head
over
heels
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
be
doubted
whether
any
one
would
have
thought
of
training
a
dog
to
point
*punct* ,
had
not
some
one
dog
naturally
shown
a
tendency
in
this
line
*punct* ;
and
this
is
known
occasionally
to
happen
*punct* ,
as
i
once
saw
in
a
pure
terrier
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
first
tendency
was
once
displayed
*punct* ,
methodical
selection
and
the
inherited
effects
of
compulsory
training
in
each
successive
generation
would
soon
complete
the
work
*punct* ;
and
unconscious
selection
is
still
at
work
*punct* ,
as
each
man
tries
to
procure
*punct* ,
without
intending
to
improve
the
breed
*punct* ,
dogs
which
will
stand
and
hunt
best
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
habit
alone
in
some
cases
has
sufficed
*punct* ;
no
animal
is
more
difficult
to
tame
than
the
young
of
the
wild
rabbit
*punct* ;
scarcely
any
animal
is
tamer
than
the
young
of
the
tame
rabbit
*punct* ;
but
i
do
not
suppose
that
domestic
rabbits
have
ever
been
selected
for
tameness
*punct* ;
and
i
presume
that
we
must
attribute
the
whole
of
the
inherited
change
from
extreme
wildness
to
extreme
tameness
*punct* ,
simply
to
habit
and
long-continued
close
confinement
*punct* .
*break*
natural
instincts
are
lost
under
domestication
*punct* :
a
remarkable
instance
of
this
is
seen
in
those
breeds
of
fowls
which
very
rarely
or
never
become
broody
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
never
wish
to
sit
on
their
eggs
*punct* .
*break*
familiarity
alone
prevents
our
seeing
how
universally
and
largely
the
minds
of
our
domestic
animals
have
been
modified
by
domestication
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
doubt
that
the
love
of
man
has
become
instinctive
in
the
dog
*punct* .
*break*
all
wolves
*punct* ,
foxes
*punct* ,
jackals
*punct* ,
and
species
of
the
cat
genus
*punct* ,
when
kept
tame
*punct* ,
are
most
eager
to
attack
poultry
*punct* ,
sheep
*punct* ,
and
pigs
*punct* ;
and
this
tendency
has
been
found
incurable
in
dogs
which
have
been
brought
home
as
puppies
from
countries
*punct* ,
such
as
tierra
del
fuego
and
australia
*punct* ,
where
the
savages
do
not
keep
these
domestic
animals
*punct* .
*break*
how
rarely
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
do
our
civilised
dogs
*punct* ,
even
when
quite
young
*punct* ,
require
to
be
taught
not
to
attack
poultry
*punct* ,
sheep
*punct* ,
and
pigs
*punct* !
*break*
no
doubt
they
occasionally
do
make
an
attack
*punct* ,
and
are
then
beaten
*punct* ;
and
if
not
cured
*punct* ,
they
are
destroyed
*punct* ;
so
that
habit
*punct* ,
with
some
degree
of
selection
*punct* ,
has
probably
concurred
in
civilising
by
inheritance
our
dogs
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
young
chickens
have
lost
*punct* ,
wholly
by
habit
*punct* ,
that
fear
of
the
dog
and
cat
which
no
doubt
was
originally
instinctive
in
them
*punct* ,
in
the
same
way
as
it
is
so
plainly
instinctive
in
young
pheasants
*punct* ,
though
reared
under
a
hen
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
that
chickens
have
lost
all
fear
*punct* ,
but
fear
only
of
dogs
and
cats
*punct* ,
for
if
the
hen
gives
the
danger-chuckle
*punct* ,
they
will
run
*punct* ,
more
especially
young
turkeys
*punct* ,
from
under
her
*punct* ,
and
conceal
themselves
in
the
surrounding
grass
or
thickets
*punct* ;
and
this
is
evidently
done
for
the
instinctive
purpose
of
allowing
*punct* ,
as
we
see
in
wild
ground-birds
*punct* ,
their
mother
to
fly
away
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
instinct
retained
by
our
chickens
has
become
useless
under
domestication
*punct* ,
for
the
mother-hen
has
almost
lost
by
disuse
the
power
of
flight
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
we
may
conclude
*punct* ,
that
domestic
instincts
have
been
acquired
and
natural
instincts
have
been
lost
partly
by
habit
*punct* ,
and
partly
by
man
selecting
and
accumulating
during
successive
generations
*punct* ,
peculiar
mental
habits
and
actions
*punct* ,
which
at
first
appeared
from
what
we
must
in
our
ignorance
call
an
accident
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
cases
compulsory
habit
alone
has
sufficed
to
produce
such
inherited
mental
changes
*punct* ;
in
other
cases
compulsory
habit
has
done
nothing
*punct* ,
and
all
has
been
the
result
of
selection
*punct* ,
pursued
both
methodically
and
unconsciously
*punct* ;
but
in
most
cases
*punct* ,
probably
*punct* ,
habit
and
selection
have
acted
together
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
best
understand
how
instincts
in
a
state
of
nature
have
become
modified
by
selection
*punct* ,
by
considering
a
few
cases
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
select
only
three
*punct* ,
out
of
the
several
which
i
shall
have
to
discuss
in
my
future
work,
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
the
instinct
which
leads
the
cuckoo
to
lay
her
eggs
in
other
birds
nests
*punct* ;
the
slave-making
instinct
of
certain
ants
*punct* ;
and
the
comb-making
power
of
the
hive-bee
*punct* :
these
two
latter
instincts
have
generally
*punct* ,
and
most
justly
*punct* ,
been
ranked
by
naturalists
as
the
most
wonderful
of
all
known
instincts
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
now
commonly
admitted
that
the
more
immediate
and
final
cause
of
the
cuckoo's
instinct
is
*punct* ,
that
she
lays
her
eggs
*punct* ,
not
daily
*punct* ,
but
at
intervals
of
two
or
three
days
*punct* ;
so
that
*punct* ,
if
she
were
to
make
her
own
nest
and
sit
on
her
own
eggs
*punct* ,
those
first
laid
would
have
to
be
left
for
some
time
unincubated
*punct* ,
or
there
would
be
eggs
and
young
birds
of
different
ages
in
the
same
nest
*punct* .
*break*
if
this
were
the
case
*punct* ,
the
process
of
laying
and
hatching
might
be
inconveniently
long
*punct* ,
more
especially
as
she
has
to
migrate
at
a
very
early
period
*punct* ;
and
the
first
hatched
young
would
probably
have
to
be
fed
by
the
male
alone
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
american
cuckoo
is
in
this
predicament
*punct* ;
for
she
makes
her
own
nest
and
has
eggs
and
young
successively
hatched
*punct* ,
all
at
the
same
time
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
been
asserted
that
the
american
cuckoo
occasionally
lays
her
eggs
in
other
birds
nests
*punct* ;
but
i
hear
on
the
high
authority
of
dr.
brewer
*punct* ,
that
this
is
a
mistake
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
i
could
give
several
instances
of
various
birds
which
have
been
known
occasionally
to
lay
their
eggs
in
other
birds
nests
*punct* .
*break*
now
let
us
suppose
that
the
ancient
progenitor
of
our
european
cuckoo
had
the
habits
of
the
american
cuckoo
*punct* ;
but
that
occasionally
she
laid
an
egg
in
another
bird's
nest
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
old
bird
profited
by
this
occasional
habit
*punct* ,
or
if
the
young
were
made
more
vigorous
by
advantage
having
been
taken
of
the
mistaken
maternal
instinct
of
another
bird
*punct* ,
than
by
their
own
mother's
care
*punct* ,
encumbered
as
she
can
hardly
fail
to
be
by
having
eggs
and
young
of
different
ages
at
the
same
time
*punct* ;
then
the
old
birds
or
the
fostered
young
would
gain
an
advantage
*punct* .
*break*
and
analogy
would
lead
me
to
believe
*punct* ,
that
the
young
thus
reared
would
be
apt
to
follow
by
inheritance
the
occasional
and
aberrant
habit
of
their
mother
*punct* ,
and
in
their
turn
would
be
apt
to
lay
their
eggs
in
other
birds
nests
*punct* ,
and
thus
be
successful
in
rearing
their
young
*punct* .
*break*
by
a
continued
process
of
this
nature
*punct* ,
i
believe
that
the
strange
instinct
of
our
cuckoo
could
be
*punct* ,
and
has
been
*punct* ,
generated
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
add
that
*punct* ,
according
to
dr.
gray
and
to
some
other
observers
*punct* ,
the
european
cuckoo
has
not
utterly
lost
all
maternal
love
and
care
for
her
own
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
the
occasional
habit
of
birds
laying
their
eggs
in
other
birds
nests
*punct* ,
either
of
the
same
or
of
a
distinct
species
*punct* ,
is
not
very
uncommon
with
the
gallinaceae
*punct* ;
and
this
perhaps
explains
the
origin
of
a
singular
instinct
in
the
allied
group
of
ostriches
*punct* .
*break*
for
several
hen
ostriches
*punct* ,
at
least
in
the
case
of
the
american
species
*punct* ,
unite
and
lay
first
a
few
eggs
in
one
nest
and
then
in
another
*punct* ;
and
these
are
hatched
by
the
males
*punct* .
*break*
this
instinct
may
probably
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
of
the
hens
laying
a
large
number
of
eggs
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
in
the
case
of
the
cuckoo
*punct* ,
at
intervals
of
two
or
three
days
*punct* .
*break*
this
instinct
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
of
the
american
ostrich
has
not
as
yet
been
perfected
*punct* ;
for
a
surprising
number
of
eggs
lie
strewed
over
the
plains
*punct* ,
so
that
in
one
day's
hunting
i
picked
up
no
less
than
twenty
lost
and
wasted
eggs
*punct* .
*break*
many
bees
are
parasitic
*punct* ,
and
always
lay
their
eggs
in
the
nests
of
bees
of
other
kinds
*punct* .
*break*
this
case
is
more
remarkable
than
that
of
the
cuckoo
*punct* ;
for
these
bees
have
not
only
their
instincts
but
their
structure
modified
in
accordance
with
their
parasitic
habits
*punct* ;
for
they
do
not
possess
the
pollen-collecting
apparatus
which
would
be
necessary
if
they
had
to
store
food
for
their
own
young
*punct* .
*break*
some
species
*punct* ,
likewise
*punct* ,
of
sphegidae
*punct* ,
wasp-like
insects
*punct* ,
are
parasitic
on
other
species
*punct* ;
and
m.
fabre
has
lately
shown
good
reason
for
believing
that
although
the
tachytes
nigra
generally
makes
its
own
burrow
and
stores
it
with
paralysed
prey
for
its
own
larvae
to
feed
on
*punct* ,
yet
that
when
this
insect
finds
a
burrow
already
made
and
stored
by
another
sphex
*punct* ,
it
takes
advantage
of
the
prize
*punct* ,
and
becomes
for
the
occasion
parasitic
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
case
*punct* ,
as
with
the
supposed
case
of
the
cuckoo
*punct* ,
i
can
see
no
difficulty
in
natural
selection
making
an
occasional
habit
permanent
*punct* ,
if
of
advantage
to
the
species
*punct* ,
and
if
the
insect
whose
nest
and
stored
food
are
thus
feloniously
appropriated
*punct* ,
be
not
thus
exterminated

this
remarkable
instinct
was
first
discovered
in
the
formica

polyerges

rufescens
by
pierre
huber
*punct* ,
a
better
observer
even
than
his
celebrated
father
*punct* .
*break*
this
ant
is
absolutely
dependent
on
its
slaves
*punct* ;
without
their
aid
*punct* ,
the
species
would
certainly
become
extinct
in
a
single
year
*punct* .
*break*
the
males
and
fertile
females
do
no
work
*punct* .
*break*
the
workers
or
sterile
females
*punct* ,
though
most
energetic
and
courageous
in
capturing
slaves
*punct* ,
do
no
other
work
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
incapable
of
making
their
own
nests
*punct* ,
or
of
feeding
their
own
larvae
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
old
nest
is
found
inconvenient
*punct* ,
and
they
have
to
migrate
*punct* ,
it
is
the
slaves
which
determine
the
migration
*punct* ,
and
actually
carry
their
masters
in
their
jaws
*punct* .
*break*
so
utterly
helpless
are
the
masters
*punct* ,
that
when
huber
shut
up
thirty
of
them
without
a
slave
*punct* ,
but
with
plenty
of
the
food
which
they
like
best
*punct* ,
and
with
their
larvae
and
pupae
to
stimulate
them
to
work
*punct* ,
they
did

they
could

themselves

what
can

this

other
subjects
*punct* .
*break*
although
fully
trusting
to
the
statements
of
huber
and
mr.
smith
*punct* ,
i
tried
to
approach
the
subject
in
a
sceptical
frame
of
mind
*punct* ,
as
any
one
may
well
be
excused
for
doubting
the
truth
of
so
extraordinary
and
odious
an
instinct
as
that
of
making
slaves
*punct* .
*break*
hence
i
will
give
the
observations
which
i
have
myself
made
*punct* ,
in
some
little
detail
*punct* .
*break*
sanguinea
*punct* ,
and
found
a
few
slaves
in
all
*punct* .
*break*
the
slaves
are
black
and
not
above
half
the
size
of
their
red
masters
*punct* ,
so
that
the
contrast
in
their
appearance
is
very
great
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
nest
is
slightly
disturbed
*punct* ,
the
slaves
occasionally
come
out
*punct* ,
and
like
their
masters
are
much
agitated
and
defend
their
nest
*punct* :
when
the
nest
is
much
disturbed
and
the
larvae
and
pupae
are
exposed
*punct* ,
the
slaves
work
energetically
with
their
masters
in
carrying
them
away
to
a
place
of
safety
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
it
is
clear
*punct* ,
that
the
slaves
feel
quite
at
home
*punct* .
*break*
during
the
months
of
june
and
july
*punct* ,
on
three
successive
years
*punct* ,
i
have
watched
for
many
hours
several
nests
in
surrey
and
sussex
*punct* ,
and
never
saw
a
slave
either
leave
or
enter
a
nest
*punct* .
*break*
as
*punct* ,
during
these
months
*punct* ,
the
slaves
are
very
few
in
number
*punct* ,
i
thought
that
they
might
behave
differently
when
more
numerous
*punct* ;
but
mr.
smith
informs
me
that
he
has
watched
the
nests
at
various
hours
during
may
*punct* ,
june
and
august
*punct* ,
both
in
surrey
and
hampshire
*punct* ,
and
has
never
seen
the
slaves
*punct* ,
though
present
in
large
numbers
in
august
*punct* ,
either
leave
or
enter
the
nest
*punct* .
*break*
hence
he
considers
them
as
strictly
household
slaves
*punct* .
*break*
the
masters
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
may
be
constantly
seen
bringing
in
materials
for
the
nest
*punct* ,
and
food
of
all
kinds
*punct* .
*break*
during
the
present
year
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
in
the
month
of
july
*punct* ,
i
came
across
a
community
with
an
unusually
large
stock
of
slaves
*punct* ,
and
i
observed
a
few
slaves
mingled
with
their
masters
leaving
the
nest
*punct* ,
and
marching
along
the
same
road
to
a
tall
scotch-fir-tree
*punct* ,
twenty-five
yards
distant
*punct* ,
which
they
ascended
together
*punct* ,
probably
in
search
of
aphides
or
cocci
*punct* .
*break*
according
to
huber
*punct* ,
who
had
ample
opportunities
for
observation
*punct* ,
in
switzerland
the
slaves
habitually
work
with
their
masters
in
making
the
nest
*punct* ,
and
they
alone
open
and
close
the
doors
in
the
morning
and
evening
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
as
huber
expressly
states
*punct* ,
their
principal
office
is
to
search
for
aphides
*punct* .
*break*
this
difference
in
the
usual
habits
of
the
masters
and
slaves
in
the
two
countries
*punct* ,
probably
depends
merely
on
the
slaves
being
captured
in
greater
numbers
in
switzerland
than
in
england
*punct* .
*break*
one
day
i
fortunately
chanced
to
witness
a
migration
from
one
nest
to
another
*punct* ,
and
it
was
a
most
interesting
spectacle
to
behold
the
masters
carefully
carrying
*punct* ,
as
huber
has
described
*punct* ,
their
slaves
in
their
jaws
*punct* .
*break*
the
latter
ruthlessly
killed
their
small
opponents
*punct* ,
and
carried
their
dead
bodies
as
food
to
their
nest
*punct* ,
twenty-nine
yards
distant
*punct* ;
but
they
were
prevented
from
getting
any
pupae
to
rear
as
slaves

fusca
from
another
nest
*punct* ,
and
put
them
down
on
a
bare
spot
near
the
place
of
combat
*punct* ;
they
were
eagerly
seized
*punct* ,
and
carried
off
by
the
tyrants
*punct* ,
who
perhaps
fancied
that
*punct* ,
after
all
*punct* ,
they
had
been
victorious
in
their
late
combat

*break*

with
a
few
of
these
little
yellow
ants
still
clinging
to
the
fragments
of
the
nest
*punct* .
*break*
this
species
is
sometimes
*punct* ,
though
rarely
*punct* ,
made
into
slaves
*punct* ,
as
has
been
described
by
mr.
smith
*punct* .
*break*
although
so
small
a
species
*punct* ,
it
is
very
courageous
*punct* ,
and
i
have
seen
it
ferociously
attack
other
ants
*punct* .
*break*
sanguinea
*punct* ;
and
when
i

accidentally
disturbed
both
nests

the
little
ants
attacked
their
big
neighbours
with
surprising
courage

quickly
ran
away

but
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*punct* ,
shortly
after
all
the
little
yellow
ants
had
crawled
away
*punct* ,
they
took
heart

*break*
such
are
the
facts
*punct* ,
though
they
did
not
need
confirmation
by
me
*punct* ,
in
regard
to
the
wonderful
instinct
of
making
slaves
*punct* .
*break*
the
latter
does
not
build
its
own
nest
*punct* ,
does
not
determine
its
own
migrations
*punct* ,
does
not
collect
food
for
itself
or
its
young
*punct* ,
and
cannot
even
feed
itself
*punct* :
it
is
absolutely
dependent
on
its
numerous
slaves
*punct* .
*break*
formica
sanguinea
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
possesses
much
fewer
slaves
*punct* ,
and
in
the
early
part
of
the
summer
extremely
few
*punct* .
*break*
the
masters
determine
when
and
where
a
new
nest
shall
be
formed
*punct* ,
and
when
they
migrate
*punct* ,
the
masters
carry
the
slaves
*punct* .
*break*
both
in
switzerland
and
england
the
slaves
seem
to
have
the
exclusive
care
of
the
larvae
*punct* ,
and
the
masters
alone
go
on
slave-making
expeditions
*punct* .
*break*
in
switzerland
the
slaves
and
masters
work
together
*punct* ,
making
and
bringing
materials
for
the
nest
*punct* :
both
*punct* ,
but
chiefly
the
slaves
*punct* ,
tend
*punct* ,
and
milk
as
it
may
be
called
*punct* ,
their
aphides
*punct* ;
and
thus
both
collect
food
for
the
community
*punct* .
*break*
in
england
the
masters
alone
usually
leave
the
nest
to
collect
building
materials
and
food
for
themselves
*punct* ,
their
slaves
and
larvae
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
the
masters
in
this
country
receive
much
less
service
from
their
slaves
than
they
do
in
switzerland
*punct* .
*break*
sanguinea
originated
i
will
not
pretend
to
conjecture
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
ants
*punct* ,
which
are
not
slave-makers
*punct* ,
will
*punct* ,
as
i
have
seen
*punct* ,
carry
off
pupae
of
other
species
*punct* ,
if
scattered
near
their
nests
*punct* ,
it
is
possible
that
pupae
originally
stored
as
food
might
become
developed
*punct* ;
and
the
ants
thus
unintentionally
reared
would
then
follow
their
proper
instincts
*punct* ,
and
do
what
work
they
could
*punct* .
*break*
if
their
presence
proved
useful
to
the
species
which
had
seized
them
*punct* ,
if
it
were
more
advantageous
to
this
species
to
capture
workers
than
to
procreate
them
*punct* ,
the
habit
of
collecting
pupae
originally
for
food
might
by
natural
selection
be
strengthened
and
rendered
permanent
for
the
very
different
purpose
of
raising
slaves
*punct* .
*break*
sanguinea
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
as
we
have
seen
*punct* ,
is
less
aided
by
its
slaves
than
the
same
species
in
switzerland
*punct* ,
i
can
see
no
difficulty
in
natural
selection
increasing
and
modifying
the
instinct
*punct* ,
always
supposing
each
modification
to
be
of
use
to
the
species
*punct* ,
until
an
ant
was
formed
as
abjectly
dependent
on
its
slaves
as
is
the
formica
rufescens
*punct* .
*break*
cell-making
instinct
of
the
hive-bee.
*punct* ,
i
will
not
here
enter
on
minute
details
on
this
subject
*punct* ,
but
will
merely
give
an
outline
of
the
conclusions
at
which
i
have
arrived
*punct* .
*break*
he
must
be
a
dull
man
who
can
examine
the
exquisite
structure
of
a
comb
*punct* ,
so
beautifully
adapted
to
its
end
*punct* ,
without
enthusiastic
admiration
*punct* .
*break*
we
hear
from
mathematicians
that
bees
have
practically
solved
a
recondite
problem
*punct* ,
and
have
made
their
cells
of
the
proper
shape
to
hold
the
greatest
possible
amount
of
honey
*punct* ,
with
the
least
possible
consumption
of
precious
wax
in
their
construction
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
been
remarked
that
a
skilful
workman
*punct* ,
with
fitting
tools
and
measures
*punct* ,
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
make
cells
of
wax
of
the
true
form
*punct* ,
though
this
is
perfectly
effected
by
a
crowd
of
bees
working
in
a
dark
hive
*punct* .
*break*
grant
whatever
instincts
you
please
*punct* ,
and
it
seems
at
first
quite
inconceivable
how
they
can
make
all
the
necessary
angles
and
planes
*punct* ,
or
even
perceive
when
they
are
correctly
made
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
difficulty
is
not
nearly
so
great
as
it
at
first
appears
*punct* :
all
this
beautiful
work
can
be
shown
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
to
follow
from
a
few
very
simple
instincts
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
led
to
investigate
this
subject
by
mr.
waterhouse
*punct* ,
who
has
shown
that
the
form
of
the
cell
stands
in
close
relation
to
the
presence
of
adjoining
cells
*punct* ;
and
the
following
view
may
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
be
considered
only
as
a
modification
of
this
theory
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
look
to
the
great
principle
of
gradation
*punct* ,
and
see
whether
nature
does
not
reveal
to
us
her
method
of
work
*punct* .
*break*
at
one
end
of
a
short
series
we
have
humble-bees
*punct* ,
which
use
their
old
cocoons
to
hold
honey
*punct* ,
sometimes
adding
to
them
short
tubes
of
wax
*punct* ,
and
likewise
making
separate
and
very
irregular
rounded
cells
of
wax
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
other
end
of
the
series
we
have
the
cells
of
the
hive-bee
*punct* ,
placed
in
a
double
layer
*punct* :
each
cell
*punct* ,
as
is
well
known
*punct* ,
is
an
hexagonal
prism
*punct* ,
with
the
basal
edges
of
its
six
sides
bevelled
so
as
to
join
on
to
a
pyramid
*punct* ,
formed
of
three
rhombs
*punct* .
*break*
these
rhombs
have
certain
angles
*punct* ,
and
the
three
which
form
the
pyramidal
base
of
a
single
cell
on
one
side
of
the
comb
*punct* ,
enter
into
the
composition
of
the
bases
of
three
adjoining
cells
on
the
opposite
side
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
series
between
the
extreme
perfection
of
the
cells
of
the
hive-bee
and
the
simplicity
of
those
of
the
humble-bee
*punct* ,
we
have
the
cells
of
the
mexican
melipona
domestica
*punct* ,
carefully
described
and
figured
by
pierre
huber
*punct* .
*break*
the
melipona
itself
is
intermediate
in
structure
between
the
hive
and
humble
bee
*punct* ,
but
more
nearly
related
to
the
latter
*punct* :
it
forms
a
nearly
regular
waxen
comb
of
cylindrical
cells
*punct* ,
in
which
the
young
are
hatched
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
addition
*punct* ,
some
large
cells
of
wax
for
holding
honey
*punct* .
*break*
these
latter
cells
are
nearly
spherical
and
of
nearly
equal
sizes
*punct* ,
and
are
aggregated
into
an
irregular
mass
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
important
point
to
notice
*punct* ,
is
that
these
cells
are
always
made
at
that
degree
of
nearness
to
each
other
*punct* ,
that
they
would
have
intersected
or
broken
into
each
other
*punct* ,
if
the
spheres
had
been
completed
*punct* ;
but
this
is
never
permitted
*punct* ,
the
bees
building
perfectly
flat
walls
of
wax
between
the
spheres
which
thus
tend
to
intersect
*punct* .
*break*
hence
each
cell
consists
of
an
outer
spherical
portion
and
of
two
*punct* ,
three
*punct* ,
or
more
perfectly
flat
surfaces
*punct* ,
according
as
the
cell
adjoins
two
*punct* ,
three
or
more
other
cells
*punct* .
*break*
when
one
cell
comes
into
contact
with
three
other
cells
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
from
the
spheres
being
nearly
of
the
same
size
*punct* ,
is
very
frequently
and
necessarily
the
case
*punct* ,
the
three
flat
surfaces
are
united
into
a
pyramid
*punct* ;
and
this
pyramid
*punct* ,
as
huber
has
remarked
*punct* ,
is
manifestly
a
gross
imitation
of
the
three-sided
pyramidal
basis
of
the
cell
of
the
hive-bee
*punct* .
*break*
as
in
the
cells
of
the
hive-bee
*punct* ,
so
here
*punct* ,
the
three
plane
surfaces
in
any
one
cell
necessarily
enter
into
the
construction
of
three
adjoining
cells
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
obvious
that
the
melipona
saves
wax
by
this
manner
of
building
*punct* ;
for
the
flat
walls
between
the
adjoining
cells
are
not
double
*punct* ,
but
are
of
the
same
thickness
as
the
outer
spherical
portions
*punct* ,
and
yet
each
flat
portion
forms
a
part
of
two
cells
*punct* .
*break*
reflecting
on
this
case
*punct* ,
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
the
melipona
had
made
its
spheres
at
some
given
distance
from
each
other
*punct* ,
and
had
made
them
of
equal
sizes
and
had
arranged
them
symmetrically
in
a
double
layer
*punct* ,
the
resulting
structure
would
probably
have
been
as
perfect
as
the
comb
of
the
hive-bee
*punct* .
*break*
hence
we
may
safely
conclude
that
if
we
could
slightly
modify
the
instincts
already
possessed
by
the
melipona
*punct* ,
and
in
themselves
not
very
wonderful
*punct* ,
this
bee
would
make
a
structure
as
wonderfully
perfect
as
that
of
the
hive-bee
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
suppose
the
melipona
to
make
her
cells
truly
spherical
*punct* ,
and
of
equal
sizes
*punct* ;
and
this
would
not
be
very
surprising
*punct* ,
seeing
that
she
already
does
so
to
a
certain
extent
*punct* ,
and
seeing
what
perfectly
cylindrical
burrows
in
wood
many
insects
can
make
*punct* ,
apparently
by
turning
round
on
a
fixed
point
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
suppose
the
melipona
to
arrange
her
cells
in
level
layers
*punct* ,
as
she
already
does
her
cylindrical
cells
*punct* ;
and
we
must
further
suppose
*punct* ,
and
this
is
the
greatest
difficulty
*punct* ,
that
she
can
somehow
judge
accurately
at
what
distance
to
stand
from
her
fellow-labourers
when
several
are
making
their
spheres
*punct* ;
but
she
is
already
so
far
enabled
to
judge
of
distance
*punct* ,
that
she
always
describes
her
spheres
so
as
to
intersect
largely
*punct* ;
and
then
she
unites
the
points
of
intersection
by
perfectly
flat
surfaces
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
further
to
suppose
*punct* ,
but
this
is
no
difficulty
*punct* ,
that
after
hexagonal
prisms
have
been
formed
by
the
intersection
of
adjoining
spheres
in
the
same
layer
*punct* ,
she
can
prolong
the
hexagon
to
any
length
requisite
to
hold
the
stock
of
honey
*punct* ;
in
the
same
way
as
the
rude
humble-bee
adds
cylinders
of
wax
to
the
circular
mouths
of
her
old
cocoons
*punct* .
*break*
by
such
modifications
of
instincts
in
themselves
not
very
wonderful,
*punct* ,
hardly
more
wonderful
than
those
which
guide
a
bird
to
make
its
nest,
*punct* ,
i
believe
that
the
hive-bee
has
acquired
*punct* ,
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
her
inimitable
architectural
powers
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
theory
can
be
tested
by
experiment
*punct* .
*break*
following
the
example
of
mr.
tegetmeier
*punct* ,
i
separated
two
combs
*punct* ,
and
put
between
them
a
long
*punct* ,
thick
*punct* ,
square
strip
of
wax
*punct* :
the
bees
instantly
began
to
excavate
minute
circular
pits
in
it
*punct* ;
and
as
they
deepened
these
little
pits
*punct* ,
they
made
them
wider
and
wider
until
they
were
converted
into
shallow
basins
*punct* ,
appearing
to
the
eye
perfectly
true
or
parts
of
a
sphere
*punct* ,
and
of
about
the
diameter
of
a
cell
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
most
interesting
to
me
to
observe
that
wherever
several
bees
had
begun
to
excavate
these
basins
near
together
*punct* ,
they
had
begun
their
work
at
such
a
distance
from
each
other
*punct* ,
that
by
the
time
the
basins
had
acquired
the
above
stated
width
*punct* ,
i.e
*punct* .
*break*
about
the
width
of
an
ordinary
cell
*punct* ,
and
were
in
depth
about
one
sixth
of
the
diameter
of
the
sphere
of
which
they
formed
a
part
*punct* ,
the
rims
of
the
basins
intersected
or
broke
into
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
as
soon
as
this
occurred
*punct* ,
the
bees
ceased
to
excavate
*punct* ,
and
began
to
build
up
flat
walls
of
wax
on
the
lines
of
intersection
between
the
basins
*punct* ,
so
that
each
hexagonal
prism
was
built
upon
the
festooned
edge
of
a
smooth
basin
*punct* ,
instead
of
on
the
straight
edges
of
a
three-sided
pyramid
as
in
the
case
of
ordinary
cells
*punct* .
*break*
i
then
put
into
the
hive
*punct* ,
instead
of
a
thick
*punct* ,
square
piece
of
wax
*punct* ,
a
thin
and
narrow
*punct* ,
knife-edged
ridge
*punct* ,
coloured
with
vermilion
*punct* .
*break*
the
bees
instantly
began
on
both
sides
to
excavate
little
basins
near
to
each
other
*punct* ,
in
the
same
way
as
before
*punct* ;
but
the
ridge
of
wax
was
so
thin
*punct* ,
that
the
bottoms
of
the
basins
*punct* ,
if
they
had
been
excavated
to
the
same
depth
as
in
the
former
experiment
*punct* ,
would
have
broken
into
each
other
from
the
opposite
sides
*punct* .
*break*
the
bees
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
did
not
suffer
this
to
happen
*punct* ,
and
they
stopped
their
excavations
in
due
time
*punct* ;
so
that
the
basins
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
they
had
been
a
little
deepened
*punct* ,
came
to
have
flat
bottoms
*punct* ;
and
these
flat
bottoms
*punct* ,
formed
by
thin
little
plates
of
the
vermilion
wax
having
been
left
ungnawed
*punct* ,
were
situated
*punct* ,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
judge
*punct* ,
exactly
along
the
planes
of
imaginary
intersection
between
the
basins
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
ridge
of
wax
*punct* .
*break*
in
parts
*punct* ,
only
little
bits
*punct* ,
in
other
parts
*punct* ,
large
portions
of
a
rhombic
plate
had
been
left
between
the
opposed
basins
*punct* ,
but
the
work
*punct* ,
from
the
unnatural
state
of
things
*punct* ,
had
not
been
neatly
performed
*punct* .
*break*
the
bees
must
have
worked
at
very
nearly
the
same
rate
on
the
opposite
sides
of
the
ridge
of
vermilion
wax
*punct* ,
as
they
circularly
gnawed
away
and
deepened
the
basins
on
both
sides
*punct* ,
in
order
to
have
succeeded
in
thus
leaving
flat
plates
between
the
basins
*punct* ,
by
stopping
work
along
the
intermediate
planes
or
planes
of
intersection
*punct* .
*break*
considering
how
flexible
thin
wax
is
*punct* ,
i
do
not
see
that
there
is
any
difficulty
in
the
bees
*punct* ,
whilst
at
work
on
the
two
sides
of
a
strip
of
wax
*punct* ,
perceiving
when
they
have
gnawed
the
wax
away
to
the
proper
thinness
*punct* ,
and
then
stopping
their
work
*punct* .
*break*
in
ordinary
combs
it
has
appeared
to
me
that
the
bees
do
not
always
succeed
in
working
at
exactly
the
same
rate
from
the
opposite
sides
*punct* ;
for
i
have
noticed
half-completed
rhombs
at
the
base
of
a
just-commenced
cell
*punct* ,
which
were
slightly
concave
on
one
side
*punct* ,
where
i
suppose
that
the
bees
had
excavated
too
quickly
*punct* ,
and
convex
on
the
opposed
side
*punct* ,
where
the
bees
had
worked
less
quickly
*punct* .
*break*
in
one
well-marked
instance
*punct* ,
i
put
the
comb
back
into
the
hive
*punct* ,
and
allowed
the
bees
to
go
on
working
for
a
short
time
*punct* ,
and
again
examined
the
cell
*punct* ,
and
i
found
that
the
rhombic
plate
had
been
completed
*punct* ,
and
had
become
perfectly
flat
*punct* :
it
was
absolutely
impossible
*punct* ,
from
the
extreme
thinness
of
the
little
rhombic
plate
*punct* ,
that
they
could
have
effected
this
by
gnawing
away
the
convex
side
*punct* ;
and
i
suspect
that
the
bees
in
such
cases
stand
in
the
opposed
cells
and
push
and
bend
the
ductile
and
warm
wax
*punct* ,
which
as
i
have
tried
is
easily
done
*punct* ,
into
its
proper
intermediate
plane
*punct* ,
and
thus
flatten
it
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
experiment
of
the
ridge
of
vermilion
wax
*punct* ,
we
can
clearly
see
that
if
the
bees
were
to
build
for
themselves
a
thin
wall
of
wax
*punct* ,
they
could
make
their
cells
of
the
proper
shape
*punct* ,
by
standing
at
the
proper
distance
from
each
other
*punct* ,
by
excavating
at
the
same
rate
*punct* ,
and
by
endeavouring
to
make
equal
spherical
hollows
*punct* ,
but
never
allowing
the
spheres
to
break
into
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
they
do
not
make
the
whole
three-sided
pyramidal
base
of
any
one
cell
at
the
same
time
*punct* ,
but
only
the
one
rhombic
plate
which
stands
on
the
extreme
growing
margin
*punct* ,
or
the
two
plates
*punct* ,
as
the
case
may
be
*punct* ;
and
they
never
complete
the
upper
edges
of
the
rhombic
plates
*punct* ,
until
the
hexagonal
walls
are
commenced
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
these
statements
differ
from
those
made
by
the
justly
celebrated
elder
huber
*punct* ,
but
i
am
convinced
of
their
accuracy
*punct* ;
and
if
i
had
space
*punct* ,
i
could
show
that
they
are
conformable
with
my
theory
*punct* .
*break*
huber's
statement
that
the
very
first
cell
is
excavated
out
of
a
little
parallel-sided
wall
of
wax
*punct* ,
is
not
*punct* ,
as
far
as
i
have
seen
*punct* ,
strictly
correct
*punct* ;
the
first
commencement
having
always
been
a
little
hood
of
wax
*punct* ;
but
i
will
not
here
enter
on
these
details
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
how
important
a
part
excavation
plays
in
the
construction
of
the
cells
*punct* ;
but
it
would
be
a
great
error
to
suppose
that
the
bees
cannot
build
up
a
rough
wall
of
wax
in
the
proper
position
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
along
the
plane
of
intersection
between
two
adjoining
spheres
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
several
specimens
showing
clearly
that
they
can
do
this
*punct* .
*break*
even
in
the
rude
circumferential
rim
or
wall
of
wax
round
a
growing
comb
*punct* ,
flexures
may
sometimes
be
observed
*punct* ,
corresponding
in
position
to
the
planes
of
the
rhombic
basal
plates
of
future
cells
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
rough
wall
of
wax
has
in
every
case
to
be
finished
off
*punct* ,
by
being
largely
gnawed
away
on
both
sides
*punct* .
*break*
the
manner
in
which
the
bees
build
is
curious
*punct* ;
they
always
make
the
first
rough
wall
from
ten
to
twenty
times
thicker
than
the
excessively
thin
finished
wall
of
the
cell
*punct* ,
which
will
ultimately
be
left
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
understand
how
they
work
*punct* ,
by
supposing
masons
first
to
pile
up
a
broad
ridge
of
cement
*punct* ,
and
then
to
begin
cutting
it
away
equally
on
both
sides
near
the
ground
*punct* ,
till
a
smooth
*punct* ,
very
thin
wall
is
left
in
the
middle
*punct* ;
the
masons
always
piling
up
the
cut-away
cement
*punct* ,
and
adding
fresh
cement
*punct* ,
on
the
summit
of
the
ridge
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
thus
have
a
thin
wall
steadily
growing
upward
*punct* ;
but
always
crowned
by
a
gigantic
coping
*punct* .
*break*
from
all
the
cells
*punct* ,
both
those
just
commenced
and
those
completed
*punct* ,
being
thus
crowned
by
a
strong
coping
of
wax
*punct* ,
the
bees
can
cluster
and
crawl
over
the
comb
without
injuring
the
delicate
hexagonal
walls
*punct* ,
which
are
only
about
one
four-hundredth
of
an
inch
in
thickness
*punct* ;
the
plates
of
the
pyramidal
basis
being
about
twice
as
thick
*punct* .
*break*
by
this
singular
manner
of
building
*punct* ,
strength
is
continually
given
to
the
comb
*punct* ,
with
the
utmost
ultimate
economy
of
wax
*punct* .
*break*
it
seems
at
first
to
add
to
the
difficulty
of
understanding
how
the
cells
are
made
*punct* ,
that
a
multitude
of
bees
all
work
together
*punct* ;
one
bee
after
working
a
short
time
at
one
cell
going
to
another
*punct* ,
so
that
*punct* ,
as
huber
has
stated
*punct* ,
a
score
of
individuals
work
even
at
the
commencement
of
the
first
cell
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
able
practically
to
show
this
fact
*punct* ,
by
covering
the
edges
of
the
hexagonal
walls
of
a
single
cell
*punct* ,
or
the
extreme
margin
of
the
circumferential
rim
of
a
growing
comb
*punct* ,
with
an
extremely
thin
layer
of
melted
vermilion
wax
*punct* ;
and
i
invariably
found
that
the
colour
was
most
delicately
diffused
by
the
bees
*punct* ,
as
delicately
as
a
painter
could
have
done
with
his
brush
*punct* ,
by
atoms
of
the
coloured
wax
having
been
taken
from
the
spot
on
which
it
had
been
placed
*punct* ,
and
worked
into
the
growing
edges
of
the
cells
all
round
*punct* .
*break*
the
work
of
construction
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
balance
struck
between
many
bees
*punct* ,
all
instinctively
standing
at
the
same
relative
distance
from
each
other
*punct* ,
all
trying
to
sweep
equal
spheres
*punct* ,
and
then
building
up
*punct* ,
or
leaving
ungnawed
*punct* ,
the
planes
of
intersection
between
these
spheres
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
really
curious
to
note
in
cases
of
difficulty
*punct* ,
as
when
two
pieces
of
comb
met
at
an
angle
*punct* ,
how
often
the
bees
would
entirely
pull
down
and
rebuild
in
different
ways
the
same
cell
*punct* ,
sometimes
recurring
to
a
shape
which
they
had
at
first
rejected
*punct* .
*break*
when
bees
have
a
place
on
which
they
can
stand
in
their
proper
positions
for
working,
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
on
a
slip
of
wood
*punct* ,
placed
directly
under
the
middle
of
a
comb
growing
downwards
so
that
the
comb
has
to
be
built
over
one
face
of
the
slip
*punct* ,
in
this
case
the
bees
can
lay
the
foundations
of
one
wall
of
a
new
hexagon
*punct* ,
in
its
strictly
proper
place
*punct* ,
projecting
beyond
the
other
completed
cells
*punct* .
*break*
it
suffices
that
the
bees
should
be
enabled
to
stand
at
their
proper
relative
distances
from
each
other
and
from
the
walls
of
the
last
completed
cells
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
by
striking
imaginary
spheres
*punct* ,
they
can
build
up
a
wall
intermediate
between
two
adjoining
spheres
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
far
as
i
have
seen
*punct* ,
they
never
gnaw
away
and
finish
off
the
angles
of
a
cell
till
a
large
part
both
of
that
cell
and
of
the
adjoining
cells
has
been
built
*punct* .
*break*
this
capacity
in
bees
of
laying
down
under
certain
circumstances
a
rough
wall
in
its
proper
place
between
two
just-commenced
cells
*punct* ,
is
important
*punct* ,
as
it
bears
on
a
fact
*punct* ,
which
seems
at
first
quite
subversive
of
the
foregoing
theory
*punct* ;
namely
*punct* ,
that
the
cells
on
the
extreme
margin
of
wasp-combs
are
sometimes
strictly
hexagonal
*punct* ;
but
i
have
not
space
here
to
enter
on
this
subject
*punct* .
*break*
nor
does
there
seem
to
me
any
great
difficulty
in
a
single
insect
*punct* ,
as
in
the
case
of
a
queen-wasp
*punct* ,
making
hexagonal
cells
*punct* ,
if
she
work
alternately
on
the
inside
and
outside
of
two
or
three
cells
commenced
at
the
same
time
*punct* ,
always
standing
at
the
proper
relative
distance
from
the
parts
of
the
cells
just
begun
*punct* ,
sweeping
spheres
or
cylinders
*punct* ,
and
building
up
intermediate
planes
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
even
conceivable
that
an
insect
might
*punct* ,
by
fixing
on
a
point
at
which
to
commence
a
cell
*punct* ,
and
then
moving
outside
*punct* ,
first
to
one
point
*punct* ,
and
then
to
five
other
points
*punct* ,
at
the
proper
relative
distances
from
the
central
point
and
from
each
other
*punct* ,
strike
the
planes
of
intersection
*punct* ,
and
so
make
an
isolated
hexagon
*punct* :
but
i
am
not
aware
that
any
such
case
has
been
observed
*punct* ;
nor
would
any
good
be
derived
from
a
single
hexagon
being
built
*punct* ,
as
in
its
construction
more
materials
would
be
required
than
for
a
cylinder
*punct* .
*break*
as
natural
selection
acts
only
by
the
accumulation
of
slight
modifications
of
structure
or
instinct
*punct* ,
each
profitable
to
the
individual
under
its
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
it
may
reasonably
be
asked
*punct* ,
how
a
long
and
graduated
succession
of
modified
architectural
instincts
*punct* ,
all
tending
towards
the
present
perfect
plan
of
construction
*punct* ,
could
have
profited
the
progenitors
of
the
hive-bee
*punct* ?
*break*
i
think
the
answer
is
not
difficult
*punct* :
it
is
known
that
bees
are
often
hard
pressed
to
get
sufficient
nectar
*punct* ;
and
i
am
informed
by
mr.
tegetmeier
that
it
has
been
experimentally
found
that
no
less
than
from
twelve
to
fifteen
pounds
of
dry
sugar
are
consumed
by
a
hive
of
bees
for
the
secretion
of
each
pound
of
wax
*punct* ;
so
that
a
prodigious
quantity
of
fluid
nectar
must
be
collected
and
consumed
by
the
bees
in
a
hive
for
the
secretion
of
the
wax
necessary
for
the
construction
of
their
combs
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
many
bees
have
to
remain
idle
for
many
days
during
the
process
of
secretion
*punct* .
*break*
a
large
store
of
honey
is
indispensable
to
support
a
large
stock
of
bees
during
the
winter
*punct* ;
and
the
security
of
the
hive
is
known
mainly
to
depend
on
a
large
number
of
bees
being
supported
*punct* .
*break*
hence
the
saving
of
wax
by
largely
saving
honey
must
be
a
most
important
element
of
success
in
any
family
of
bees
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
the
success
of
any
species
of
bee
may
be
dependent
on
the
number
of
its
parasites
or
other
enemies
*punct* ,
or
on
quite
distinct
causes
*punct* ,
and
so
be
altogether
independent
of
the
quantity
of
honey
which
the
bees
could
collect
*punct* .
*break*
but
let
us
suppose
that
this
latter
circumstance
determined
*punct* ,
as
it
probably
often
does
determine
*punct* ,
the
numbers
of
a
humble-bee
which
could
exist
in
a
country
*punct* ;
and
let
us
further
suppose
that
the
community
lived
throughout
the
winter
*punct* ,
and
consequently
required
a
store
of
honey
*punct* :
there
can
in
this
case
be
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
an
advantage
to
our
humble-bee
*punct* ,
if
a
slight
modification
of
her
instinct
led
her
to
make
her
waxen
cells
near
together
*punct* ,
so
as
to
intersect
a
little
*punct* ;
for
a
wall
in
common
even
to
two
adjoining
cells
*punct* ,
would
save
some
little
wax
*punct* .
*break*
hence
it
would
continually
be
more
and
more
advantageous
to
our
humble-bee
*punct* ,
if
she
were
to
make
her
cells
more
and
more
regular
*punct* ,
nearer
together
*punct* ,
and
aggregated
into
a
mass
*punct* ,
like
the
cells
of
the
melipona
*punct* ;
for
in
this
case
a
large
part
of
the
bounding
surface
of
each
cell
would
serve
to
bound
other
cells
*punct* ,
and
much
wax
would
be
saved
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
from
the
same
cause
*punct* ,
it
would
be
advantageous
to
the
melipona
*punct* ,
if
she
were
to
make
her
cells
closer
together
*punct* ,
and
more
regular
in
every
way
than
at
present
*punct* ;
for
then
*punct* ,
as
we
have
seen
*punct* ,
the
spherical
surfaces
would
wholly
disappear
*punct* ,
and
would
all
be
replaced
by
plane
surfaces
*punct* ;
and
the
melipona
would
make
a
comb
as
perfect
as
that
of
the
hive-bee
*punct* .
*break*
beyond
this
stage
of
perfection
in
architecture
*punct* ,
natural
selection
could
not
lead
*punct* ;
for
the
comb
of
the
hive-bee
*punct* ,
as
far
as
we
can
see
*punct* ,
is
absolutely
perfect
in
economising
wax
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
the
most
wonderful
of
all
known
instincts
*punct* ,
that
of
the
hive-bee
*punct* ,
can
be
explained
by
natural
selection
having
taken
advantage
of
numerous
*punct* ,
successive
*punct* ,
slight
modifications
of
simpler
instincts
*punct* ;
natural
selection
having
by
slow
degrees
*punct* ,
more
and
more
perfectly
*punct* ,
led
the
bees
to
sweep
equal
spheres
at
a
given
distance
from
each
other
in
a
double
layer
*punct* ,
and
to
build
up
and
excavate
the
wax
along
the
planes
of
intersection
*punct* .
*break*
the
bees
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
no
more
knowing
that
they
swept
their
spheres
at
one
particular
distance
from
each
other
*punct* ,
than
they
know
what
are
the
several
angles
of
the
hexagonal
prisms
and
of
the
basal
rhombic
plates
*punct* .
*break*
the
motive
power
of
the
process
of
natural
selection
having
been
economy
of
wax
*punct* ;
that
individual
swarm
which
wasted
least
honey
in
the
secretion
of
wax
*punct* ,
having
succeeded
best
*punct* ,
and
having
transmitted
by
inheritance
its
newly
acquired
economical
instinct
to
new
swarms
*punct* ,
which
in
their
turn
will
have
had
the
best
chance
of
succeeding
in
the
struggle
for
existence
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
many
instincts
of
very
difficult
explanation
could
be
opposed
to
the
theory
of
natural
selection,
*punct* ,
cases
*punct* ,
in
which
we
cannot
see
how
an
instinct
could
possibly
have
originated
*punct* ;
cases
*punct* ,
in
which
no
intermediate
gradations
are
known
to
exist
*punct* ;
cases
of
instinct
of
apparently
such
trifling
importance
*punct* ,
that
they
could
hardly
have
been
acted
on
by
natural
selection
*punct* ;
cases
of
instincts
almost
identically
the
same
in
animals
so
remote
in
the
scale
of
nature
*punct* ,
that
we
cannot
account
for
their
similarity
by
inheritance
from
a
common
parent
*punct* ,
and
must
therefore
believe
that
they
have
been
acquired
by
independent
acts
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
not
here
enter
on
these
several
cases
*punct* ,
but
will
confine
myself
to
one
special
difficulty
*punct* ,
which
at
first
appeared
to
me
insuperable
*punct* ,
and
actually
fatal
to
my
whole
theory
*punct* .
*break*
i
allude
to
the
neuters
or
sterile
females
in
insect-communities
*punct* :
for
these
neuters
often
differ
widely
in
instinct
and
in
structure
from
both
the
males
and
fertile
females
*punct* ,
and
yet
*punct* ,
from
being
sterile
*punct* ,
they
cannot
propagate
their
kind
*punct* .
*break*
the
subject
well
deserves
to
be
discussed
at
great
length
*punct* ,
but
i
will
here
take
only
a
single
case
*punct* ,
that
of
working
or
sterile
ants
*punct* .
*break*
how
the
workers
have
been
rendered
sterile
is
a
difficulty
*punct* ;
but
not
much
greater
than
that
of
any
other
striking
modification
of
structure
*punct* ;
for
it
can
be
shown
that
some
insects
and
other
articulate
animals
in
a
state
of
nature
occasionally
become
sterile
*punct* ;
and
if
such
insects
had
been
social
*punct* ,
and
it
had
been
profitable
to
the
community
that
a
number
should
have
been
annually
born
capable
of
work
*punct* ,
but
incapable
of
procreation
*punct* ,
i
can
see
no
very
great
difficulty
in
this
being
effected
by
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
must
pass
over
this
preliminary
difficulty
*punct* .
*break*
the
great
difficulty
lies
in
the
working
ants
differing
widely
from
both
the
males
and
the
fertile
females
in
structure
*punct* ,
as
in
the
shape
of
the
thorax
and
in
being
destitute
of
wings
and
sometimes
of
eyes
*punct* ,
and
in
instinct
*punct* .
*break*
as
far
as
instinct
alone
is
concerned
*punct* ,
the
prodigious
difference
in
this
respect
between
the
workers
and
the
perfect
females
*punct* ,
would
have
been
far
better
exemplified
by
the
hive-bee
*punct* .
*break*
if
a
working
ant
or
other
neuter
insect
had
been
an
animal
in
the
ordinary
state
*punct* ,
i
should
have
unhesitatingly
assumed
that
all
its
characters
had
been
slowly
acquired
through
natural
selection
*punct* ;
namely
*punct* ,
by
an
individual
having
been
born
with
some
slight
profitable
modification
of
structure
*punct* ,
this
being
inherited
by
its
offspring
*punct* ,
which
again
varied
and
were
again
selected
*punct* ,
and
so
onwards
*punct* .
*break*
but
with
the
working
ant
we
have
an
insect
differing
greatly
from
its
parents
*punct* ,
yet
absolutely
sterile
*punct* ;
so
that
it
could
never
have
transmitted
successively
acquired
modifications
of
structure
or
instinct
to
its
progeny
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
well
be
asked
how
is
it
possible
to
reconcile
this
case
with
the
theory
of
natural
selection
*punct* ?
*break*
first
*punct* ,
let
it
be
remembered
that
we
have
innumerable
instances
*punct* ,
both
in
our
domestic
productions
and
in
those
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
of
all
sorts
of
differences
of
structure
which
have
become
correlated
to
certain
ages
*punct* ,
and
to
either
sex
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
differences
correlated
not
only
to
one
sex
*punct* ,
but
to
that
short
period
alone
when
the
reproductive
system
is
active
*punct* ,
as
in
the
nuptial
plumage
of
many
birds
*punct* ,
and
in
the
hooked
jaws
of
the
male
salmon
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
even
slight
differences
in
the
horns
of
different
breeds
of
cattle
in
relation
to
an
artificially
imperfect
state
of
the
male
sex
*punct* ;
for
oxen
of
certain
breeds
have
longer
horns
than
in
other
breeds
*punct* ,
in
comparison
with
the
horns
of
the
bulls
or
cows
of
these
same
breeds
*punct* .
*break*
hence
i
can
see
no
real
difficulty
in
any
character
having
become
correlated
with
the
sterile
condition
of
certain
members
of
insect-communities
*punct* :
the
difficulty
lies
in
understanding
how
such
correlated
modifications
of
structure
could
have
been
slowly
accumulated
by
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
this
difficulty
*punct* ,
though
appearing
insuperable
*punct* ,
is
lessened
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
disappears
*punct* ,
when
it
is
remembered
that
selection
may
be
applied
to
the
family
*punct* ,
as
well
as
to
the
individual
*punct* ,
and
may
thus
gain
the
desired
end
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
a
well-flavoured
vegetable
is
cooked
*punct* ,
and
the
individual
is
destroyed
*punct* ;
but
the
horticulturist
sows
seeds
of
the
same
stock
*punct* ,
and
confidently
expects
to
get
nearly
the
same
variety
*punct* ;
breeders
of
cattle
wish
the
flesh
and
fat
to
be
well
marbled
together
*punct* ;
the
animal
has
been
slaughtered
*punct* ,
but
the
breeder
goes
with
confidence
to
the
same
family
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
such
faith
in
the
powers
of
selection
*punct* ,
that
i
do
not
doubt
that
a
breed
of
cattle
*punct* ,
always
yielding
oxen
with
extraordinarily
long
horns
*punct* ,
could
be
slowly
formed
by
carefully
watching
which
individual
bulls
and
cows
*punct* ,
when
matched
*punct* ,
produced
oxen
with
the
longest
horns
*punct* ;
and
yet
no
one
ox
could
ever
have
propagated
its
kind
*punct* .
*break*
thus
i
believe
it
has
been
with
social
insects
*punct* :
a
slight
modification
of
structure
*punct* ,
or
instinct
*punct* ,
correlated
with
the
sterile
condition
of
certain
members
of
the
community
*punct* ,
has
been
advantageous
to
the
community
*punct* :
consequently
the
fertile
males
and
females
of
the
same
community
flourished
*punct* ,
and
transmitted
to
their
fertile
offspring
a
tendency
to
produce
sterile
members
having
the
same
modification
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
believe
that
this
process
has
been
repeated
*punct* ,
until
that
prodigious
amount
of
difference
between
the
fertile
and
sterile
females
of
the
same
species
has
been
produced
*punct* ,
which
we
see
in
many
social
insects
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
have
not
as
yet
touched
on
the
climax
of
the
difficulty
*punct* ;
namely
*punct* ,
the
fact
that
the
neuters
of
several
ants
differ
*punct* ,
not
only
from
the
fertile
females
and
males
*punct* ,
but
from
each
other
*punct* ,
sometimes
to
an
almost
incredible
degree
*punct* ,
and
are
thus
divided
into
two
or
even
three
castes
*punct* .
*break*
the
castes
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
do
not
generally
graduate
into
each
other
*punct* ,
but
are
perfectly
well
defined
*punct* ;
being
as
distinct
from
each
other
*punct* ,
as
are
any
two
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
or
rather
as
any
two
genera
of
the
same
family
*punct* .
*break*
thus
in
eciton
*punct* ,
there
are
working
and
soldier
neuters
*punct* ,
with
jaws
and
instincts
extraordinarily
different
*punct* :
in
cryptocerus
*punct* ,
the
workers
of
one
caste
alone
carry
a
wonderful
sort
of
shield
on
their
heads
*punct* ,
the
use
of
which
is
quite
unknown
*punct* :
in
the
mexican
myrmecocystus
*punct* ,
the
workers
of
one
caste
never
leave
the
nest
*punct* ;
they
are
fed
by
the
workers
of
another
caste
*punct* ,
and
they
have
an
enormously
developed
abdomen
which
secretes
a
sort
of
honey
*punct* ,
supplying
the
place
of
that
excreted
by
the
aphides
*punct* ,
or
the
domestic
cattle
as
they
may
be
called
*punct* ,
which
our
european
ants
guard
or
imprison
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
indeed
be
thought
that
i
have
an
overweening
confidence
in
the
principle
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
when
i
do
not
admit
that
such
wonderful
and
well-established
facts
at
once
annihilate
my
theory
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
simpler
case
of
neuter
insects
all
of
one
caste
or
of
the
same
kind
*punct* ,
which
have
been
rendered
by
natural
selection
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
to
be
quite
possible
*punct* ,
different
from
the
fertile
males
and
females,
*punct* ,
in
this
case
*punct* ,
we
may
safely
conclude
from
the
analogy
of
ordinary
variations
*punct* ,
that
each
successive
*punct* ,
slight
*punct* ,
profitable
modification
did
not
probably
at
first
appear
in
all
the
individual
neuters
in
the
same
nest
*punct* ,
but
in
a
few
alone
*punct* ;
and
that
by
the
long-continued
selection
of
the
fertile
parents
which
produced
most
neuters
with
the
profitable
modification
*punct* ,
all
the
neuters
ultimately
came
to
have
the
desired
character
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
view
we
ought
occasionally
to
find
neuter-insects
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
in
the
same
nest
*punct* ,
presenting
gradations
of
structure
*punct* ;
and
this
we
do
find
*punct* ,
even
often
*punct* ,
considering
how
few
neuter-insects
out
of
europe
have
been
carefully
examined
*punct* .
*break*
smith
has
shown
how
surprisingly
the
neuters
of
several
british
ants
differ
from
each
other
in
size
and
sometimes
in
colour
*punct* ;
and
that
the
extreme
forms
can
sometimes
be
perfectly
linked
together
by
individuals
taken
out
of
the
same
nest
*punct* :
i
have
myself
compared
perfect
gradations
of
this
kind
*punct* .
*break*
it
often
happens
that
the
larger
or
the
smaller
sized
workers
are
the
most
numerous
*punct* ;
or
that
both
large
and
small
are
numerous
*punct* ,
with
those
of
an
intermediate
size
scanty
in
numbers
*punct* .
*break*
smith
has
observed
*punct* ,
the
larger
workers
have
simple
eyes
*punct* ,
ocelli
*punct* ,
which
though
small
can
be
plainly
distinguished
*punct* ,
whereas
the
smaller
workers
have
their
ocelli
rudimentary
*punct* .
*break*
having
carefully
dissected
several
specimens
of
these
workers
*punct* ,
i
can
affirm
that
the
eyes
are
far
more
rudimentary
in
the
smaller
workers
than
can
be
accounted
for
merely
by
their
proportionally
lesser
size
*punct* ;
and
i
fully
believe
*punct* ,
though
i
dare
not
assert
so
positively
*punct* ,
that
the
workers
of
intermediate
size
have
their
ocelli
in
an
exactly
intermediate
condition
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
we
here
have
two
bodies
of
sterile
workers
in
the
same
nest
*punct* ,
differing
not
only
in
size
*punct* ,
but
in
their
organs
of
vision
*punct* ,
yet
connected
by
some
few
members
in
an
intermediate
condition
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
digress
by
adding
*punct* ,
that
if
the
smaller
workers
had
been
the
most
useful
to
the
community
*punct* ,
and
those
males
and
females
had
been
continually
selected
*punct* ,
which
produced
more
and
more
of
the
smaller
workers
*punct* ,
until
all
the
workers
had
come
to
be
in
this
condition
*punct* ;
we
should
then
have
had
a
species
of
ant
with
neuters
very
nearly
in
the
same
condition
with
those
of
myrmica
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
workers
of
myrmica
have
not
even
rudiments
of
ocelli
*punct* ,
though
the
male
and
female
ants
of
this
genus
have
well-developed
ocelli
*punct* .
*break*
smith's
offer
of
numerous
specimens
from
the
same
nest
of
the
driver
ant
*punct* ,
anomma
*punct* ,
of
west
africa
*punct* .
*break*
the
reader
will
perhaps
best
appreciate
the
amount
of
difference
in
these
workers
*punct* ,
by
my
giving
not
the
actual
measurements
*punct* ,
but
a
strictly
accurate
illustration
*punct* :
the
difference
was
the
same
as
if
we
were
to
see
a
set
of
workmen
building
a
house
of
whom
many
were
five
feet
four
inches
high
*punct* ,
and
many
sixteen
feet
high
*punct* ;
but
we
must
suppose
that
the
larger
workmen
had
heads
four
instead
of
three
times
as
big
as
those
of
the
smaller
men
*punct* ,
and
jaws
nearly
five
times
as
big
*punct* .
*break*
the
jaws
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
of
the
working
ants
of
the
several
sizes
differed
wonderfully
in
shape
*punct* ,
and
in
the
form
and
number
of
the
teeth
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
important
fact
for
us
is
*punct* ,
that
though
the
workers
can
be
grouped
into
castes
of
different
sizes
*punct* ,
yet
they
graduate
insensibly
into
each
other
*punct* ,
as
does
the
widely-different
structure
of
their
jaws
*punct* .
*break*
i
speak
confidently
on
this
latter
point
*punct* ,
as
mr.
lubbock
made
drawings
for
me
with
the
camera
lucida
of
the
jaws
which
i
had
dissected
from
the
workers
of
the
several
sizes
*punct* .
*break*
with
these
facts
before
me
*punct* ,
i
believe
that
natural
selection
*punct* ,
by
acting
on
the
fertile
parents
*punct* ,
could
form
a
species
which
should
regularly
produce
neuters
*punct* ,
either
all
of
large
size
with
one
form
of
jaw
*punct* ,
or
all
of
small
size
with
jaws
having
a
widely
different
structure
*punct* ;
or
lastly
*punct* ,
and
this
is
our
climax
of
difficulty
*punct* ,
one
set
of
workers
of
one
size
and
structure
*punct* ,
and
simultaneously
another
set
of
workers
of
a
different
size
and
structure;
*punct* ,
a
graduated
series
having
been
first
formed
*punct* ,
as
in
the
case
of
the
driver
ant
*punct* ,
and
then
the
extreme
forms
*punct* ,
from
being
the
most
useful
to
the
community
*punct* ,
having
been
produced
in
greater
and
greater
numbers
through
the
natural
selection
of
the
parents
which
generated
them
*punct* ;
until
none
with
an
intermediate
structure
were
produced
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
the
wonderful
fact
of
two
distinctly
defined
castes
of
sterile
workers
existing
in
the
same
nest
*punct* ,
both
widely
different
from
each
other
and
from
their
parents
*punct* ,
has
originated
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
see
how
useful
their
production
may
have
been
to
a
social
community
of
insects
*punct* ,
on
the
same
principle
that
the
division
of
labour
is
useful
to
civilised
man
*punct* .
*break*
as
ants
work
by
inherited
instincts
and
by
inherited
tools
or
weapons
*punct* ,
and
not
by
acquired
knowledge
and
manufactured
instruments
*punct* ,
a
perfect
division
of
labour
could
be
effected
with
them
only
by
the
workers
being
sterile
*punct* ;
for
had
they
been
fertile
*punct* ,
they
would
have
intercrossed
*punct* ,
and
their
instincts
and
structure
would
have
become
blended
*punct* .
*break*
and
nature
has
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
effected
this
admirable
division
of
labour
in
the
communities
of
ants
*punct* ,
by
the
means
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
am
bound
to
confess
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
with
all
my
faith
in
this
principle
*punct* ,
i
should
never
have
anticipated
that
natural
selection
could
have
been
efficient
in
so
high
a
degree
*punct* ,
had
not
the
case
of
these
neuter
insects
convinced
me
of
the
fact
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
discussed
this
case
*punct* ,
at
some
little
but
wholly
insufficient
length
*punct* ,
in
order
to
show
the
power
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
and
likewise
because
this
is
by
far
the
most
serious
special
difficulty
*punct* ,
which
my
theory
has
encountered
*punct* .
*break*
the
case
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
is
very
interesting
*punct* ,
as
it
proves
that
with
animals
*punct* ,
as
with
plants
*punct* ,
any
amount
of
modification
in
structure
can
be
effected
by
the
accumulation
of
numerous
*punct* ,
slight
*punct* ,
and
as
we
must
call
them
accidental
*punct* ,
variations
*punct* ,
which
are
in
any
manner
profitable
*punct* ,
without
exercise
or
habit
having
come
into
play
*punct* .
*break*
for
no
amount
of
exercise
*punct* ,
or
habit
*punct* ,
or
volition
*punct* ,
in
the
utterly
sterile
members
of
a
community
could
possibly
have
affected
the
structure
or
instincts
of
the
fertile
members
*punct* ,
which
alone
leave
descendants
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
surprised
that
no
one
has
advanced
this
demonstrative
case
of
neuter
insects
*punct* ,
against
the
well-known
doctrine
of
lamarck
*punct* .
*break*
summary.
*punct* ,
i
have
endeavoured
briefly
in
this
chapter
to
show
that
the
mental
qualities
of
our
domestic
animals
vary
*punct* ,
and
that
the
variations
are
inherited
*punct* .
*break*
still
more
briefly
i
have
attempted
to
show
that
instincts
vary
slightly
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
will
dispute
that
instincts
are
of
the
highest
importance
to
each
animal
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
i
can
see
no
difficulty
*punct* ,
under
changing
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
in
natural
selection
accumulating
slight
modifications
of
instinct
to
any
extent
*punct* ,
in
any
useful
direction
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
cases
habit
or
use
and
disuse
have
probably
come
into
play
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
pretend
that
the
facts
given
in
this
chapter
strengthen
in
any
great
degree
my
theory
*punct* ;
but
none
of
the
cases
of
difficulty
*punct* ,
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
*punct* ,
annihilate
it
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
the
fact
that
instincts
are
not
always
absolutely
perfect
and
are
liable
to
mistakes;
*punct* ,
that
no
instinct
has
been
produced
for
the
exclusive
good
of
other
animals
*punct* ,
but
that
each
animal
takes
advantage
of
the
instincts
of
others;
*punct* ,
that
the
canon
in
natural
history
*punct* ,
of
natura
non
facit
saltum
is
applicable
to
instincts
as
well
as
to
corporeal
structure
*punct* ,
and
is
plainly
explicable
on
the
foregoing
views
*punct* ,
but
is
otherwise
inexplicable,
*punct* ,
all
tend
to
corroborate
the
theory
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
this
theory
is
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
strengthened
by
some
few
other
facts
in
regard
to
instincts
*punct* ;
as
by
that
common
case
of
closely
allied
*punct* ,
but
certainly
distinct
*punct* ,
species
*punct* ,
when
inhabiting
distant
parts
of
the
world
and
living
under
considerably
different
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
yet
often
retaining
nearly
the
same
instincts
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
we
can
understand
on
the
principle
of
inheritance
*punct* ,
how
it
is
that
the
thrush
of
south
america
lines
its
nest
with
mud
*punct* ,
in
the
same
peculiar
manner
as
does
our
british
thrush
*punct* :
how
it
is
that
the
male
wrens
*punct* ,
troglodytes
*punct* ,
of
north
america
*punct* ,
build
cock-nests
*punct* ,
to
roost
in
*punct* ,
like
the
males
of
our
distinct
kitty-wrens,
*punct* ,
a
habit
wholly
unlike
that
of
any
other
known
bird
*punct* .
*break*
finally
*punct* ,
it
may
not
be
a
logical
deduction
*punct* ,
but
to
my
imagination
it
is
far
more
satisfactory
to
look
at
such
instincts
as
the
young
cuckoo
ejecting
its
foster-brothers,
*punct* ,
ants
making
slaves,
*punct* ,
the
larvae
of
ichneumonidae
feeding
within
the
live
bodies
of
caterpillars,
*punct* ,
not
as
specially
endowed
or
created
instincts
*punct* ,
but
as
small
consequences
of
one
general
law
*punct* ,
leading
to
the
advancement
of
all
organic
beings
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
multiply
*punct* ,
vary
*punct* ,
let
the
strongest
live
and
the
weakest
die
*punct* .
*break*
the
view
generally
entertained
by
naturalists
is
that
species
*punct* ,
when
intercrossed
*punct* ,
have
been
specially
endowed
with
the
quality
of
sterility
*punct* ,
in
order
to
prevent
the
confusion
of
all
organic
forms
*punct* .
*break*
this
view
certainly
seems
at
first
probable
*punct* ,
for
species
within
the
same
country
could
hardly
have
kept
distinct
had
they
been
capable
of
crossing
freely
*punct* .
*break*
the
importance
of
the
fact
that
hybrids
are
very
generally
sterile
*punct* ,
has
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
been
much
underrated
by
some
late
writers
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
the
case
is
especially
important
*punct* ,
inasmuch
as
the
sterility
of
hybrids
could
not
possibly
be
of
any
advantage
to
them
*punct* ,
and
therefore
could
not
have
been
acquired
by
the
continued
preservation
of
successive
profitable
degrees
of
sterility
*punct* .
*break*
i
hope
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
to
be
able
to
show
that
sterility
is
not
a
specially
acquired
or
endowed
quality
*punct* ,
but
is
incidental
on
other
acquired
differences
*punct* .
*break*
in
treating
this
subject
*punct* ,
two
classes
of
facts
*punct* ,
to
a
large
extent
fundamentally
different
*punct* ,
have
generally
been
confounded
together
*punct* ;
namely
*punct* ,
the
sterility
of
two
species
when
first
crossed
*punct* ,
and
the
sterility
of
the
hybrids
produced
from
them
*punct* .
*break*
pure
species
have
of
course
their
organs
of
reproduction
in
a
perfect
condition
*punct* ,
yet
when
intercrossed
they
produce
either
few
or
no
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
hybrids
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
have
their
reproductive
organs
functionally
impotent
*punct* ,
as
may
be
clearly
seen
in
the
state
of
the
male
element
in
both
plants
and
animals
*punct* ;
though
the
organs
themselves
are
perfect
in
structure
*punct* ,
as
far
as
the
microscope
reveals
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
first
case
the
two
sexual
elements
which
go
to
form
the
embryo
are
perfect
*punct* ;
in
the
second
case
they
are
either
not
at
all
developed
*punct* ,
or
are
imperfectly
developed
*punct* .
*break*
this
distinction
is
important
*punct* ,
when
the
cause
of
the
sterility
*punct* ,
which
is
common
to
the
two
cases
*punct* ,
has
to
be
considered
*punct* .
*break*
the
distinction
has
probably
been
slurred
over
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
sterility
in
both
cases
being
looked
on
as
a
special
endowment
*punct* ,
beyond
the
province
of
our
reasoning
powers
*punct* .
*break*
the
fertility
of
varieties
*punct* ,
that
is
of
the
forms
known
or
believed
to
have
descended
from
common
parents
*punct* ,
when
intercrossed
*punct* ,
and
likewise
the
fertility
of
their
mongrel
offspring
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
on
my
theory
*punct* ,
of
equal
importance
with
the
sterility
of
species
*punct* ;
for
it
seems
to
make
a
broad
and
clear
distinction
between
varieties
and
species
*punct* .
*break*
first
*punct* ,
for
the
sterility
of
species
when
crossed
and
of
their
hybrid
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
impossible
to
study
the
several
memoirs
and
works
of
those
two
conscientious
and
admirable
observers
*punct* ,
kolreuter
and
gartner
*punct* ,
who
almost
devoted
their
lives
to
this
subject
*punct* ,
without
being
deeply
impressed
with
the
high
generality
of
some
degree
of
sterility
*punct* .
*break*
kolreuter
makes
the
rule
universal
*punct* ;
but
then
he
cuts
the
knot
*punct* ,
for
in
ten
cases
in
which
he
found
two
forms
*punct* ,
considered
by
most
authors
as
distinct
species
*punct* ,
quite
fertile
together
*punct* ,
he
unhesitatingly
ranks
them
as
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
gartner
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
makes
the
rule
equally
universal
*punct* ;
and
he
disputes
the
entire
fertility
of
kolreuter's
ten
cases
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
these
and
in
many
other
cases
*punct* ,
gartner
is
obliged
carefully
to
count
the
seeds
*punct* ,
in
order
to
show
that
there
is
any
degree
of
sterility
*punct* .
*break*
he
always
compares
the
maximum
number
of
seeds
produced
by
two
species
when
crossed
and
by
their
hybrid
offspring
*punct* ,
with
the
average
number
produced
by
both
pure
parent-species
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
serious
cause
of
error
seems
to
me
to
be
here
introduced
*punct* :
a
plant
to
be
hybridised
must
be
castrated
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
what
is
often
more
important
*punct* ,
must
be
secluded
in
order
to
prevent
pollen
being
brought
to
it
by
insects
from
other
plants
*punct* .
*break*
nearly
all
the
plants
experimentised
on
by
gartner
were
potted
*punct* ,
and
apparently
were
kept
in
a
chamber
in
his
house
*punct* .
*break*
that
these
processes
are
often
injurious
to
the
fertility
of
a
plant
cannot
be
doubted
*punct* ;
for
gartner
gives
in
his
table
about
a
score
of
cases
of
plants
which
he
castrated
*punct* ,
and
artificially
fertilised
with
their
own
pollen
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
excluding
all
cases
such
as
the
leguminosae
*punct* ,
in
which
there
is
an
acknowledged
difficulty
in
the
manipulation
*punct* ,
half
of
these
twenty
plants
had
their
fertility
in
some
degree
impaired
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
as
gartner
during
several
years
repeatedly
crossed
the
primrose
and
cowslip
*punct* ,
which
we
have
such
good
reason
to
believe
to
be
varieties
*punct* ,
and
only
once
or
twice
succeeded
in
getting
fertile
seed
*punct* ;
as
he
found
the
common
red
and
blue
pimpernels
*punct* ,
anagallis
arvensis
and
coerulea
*punct* ,
which
the
best
botanists
rank
as
varieties
*punct* ,
absolutely
sterile
together
*punct* ;
and
as
he
came
to
the
same
conclusion
in
several
other
analogous
cases
*punct* ;
it
seems
to
me
that
we
may
well
be
permitted
to
doubt
whether
many
other
species
are
really
so
sterile
*punct* ,
when
intercrossed
*punct* ,
as
gartner
believes
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
certain
*punct* ,
on
the
one
hand
*punct* ,
that
the
sterility
of
various
species
when
crossed
is
so
different
in
degree
and
graduates
away
so
insensibly
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
that
the
fertility
of
pure
species
is
so
easily
affected
by
various
circumstances
*punct* ,
that
for
all
practical
purposes
it
is
most
difficult
to
say
where
perfect
fertility
ends
and
sterility
begins
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
no
better
evidence
of
this
can
be
required
than
that
the
two
most
experienced
observers
who
have
ever
lived
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
kolreuter
and
gartner
*punct* ,
should
have
arrived
at
diametrically
opposite
conclusions
in
regard
to
the
very
same
species
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
also
most
instructive
to
compare
*punct* ,
but
i
have
not
space
here
to
enter
on
details
*punct* ,
the
evidence
advanced
by
our
best
botanists
on
the
question
whether
certain
doubtful
forms
should
be
ranked
as
species
or
varieties
*punct* ,
with
the
evidence
from
fertility
adduced
by
different
hybridisers
*punct* ,
or
by
the
same
author
*punct* ,
from
experiments
made
during
different
years
*punct* .
*break*
it
can
thus
be
shown
that
neither
sterility
nor
fertility
affords
any
clear
distinction
between
species
and
varieties
*punct* ;
but
that
the
evidence
from
this
source
graduates
away
*punct* ,
and
is
doubtful
in
the
same
degree
as
is
the
evidence
derived
from
other
constitutional
and
structural
differences
*punct* .
*break*
in
regard
to
the
sterility
of
hybrids
in
successive
generations
*punct* ;
though
gartner
was
enabled
to
rear
some
hybrids
*punct* ,
carefully
guarding
them
from
a
cross
with
either
pure
parent
*punct* ,
for
six
or
seven
*punct* ,
and
in
one
case
for
ten
generations
*punct* ,
yet
he
asserts
positively
that
their
fertility
never
increased
*punct* ,
but
generally
greatly
decreased
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
doubt
that
this
is
usually
the
case
*punct* ,
and
that
the
fertility
often
suddenly
decreases
in
the
first
few
generations
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
i
believe
that
in
all
these
experiments
the
fertility
has
been
diminished
by
an
independent
cause
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
from
close
interbreeding
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
collected
so
large
a
body
of
facts
*punct* ,
showing
that
close
interbreeding
lessens
fertility
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
that
an
occasional
cross
with
a
distinct
individual
or
variety
increases
fertility
*punct* ,
that
i
cannot
doubt
the
correctness
of
this
almost
universal
belief
amongst
breeders
*punct* .
*break*
hybrids
are
seldom
raised
by
experimentalists
in
great
numbers
*punct* ;
and
as
the
parent-species
*punct* ,
or
other
allied
hybrids
*punct* ,
generally
grow
in
the
same
garden
*punct* ,
the
visits
of
insects
must
be
carefully
prevented
during
the
flowering
season
*punct* :
hence
hybrids
will
generally
be
fertilised
during
each
generation
by
their
own
individual
pollen
*punct* ;
and
i
am
convinced
that
this
would
be
injurious
to
their
fertility
*punct* ,
already
lessened
by
their
hybrid
origin
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
strengthened
in
this
conviction
by
a
remarkable
statement
repeatedly
made
by
gartner
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
if
even
the
less
fertile
hybrids
be
artificially
fertilised
with
hybrid
pollen
of
the
same
kind
*punct* ,
their
fertility
*punct* ,
notwithstanding
the
frequent
ill
effects
of
manipulation
*punct* ,
sometimes
decidedly
increases
*punct* ,
and
goes
on
increasing
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
artificial
fertilisation
pollen
is
as
often
taken
by
chance
*punct* ,
as
i
know
from
my
own
experience
*punct* ,
from
the
anthers
of
another
flower
*punct* ,
as
from
the
anthers
of
the
flower
itself
which
is
to
be
fertilised
*punct* ;
so
that
a
cross
between
two
flowers
*punct* ,
though
probably
on
the
same
plant
*punct* ,
would
be
thus
effected
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
whenever
complicated
experiments
are
in
progress
*punct* ,
so
careful
an
observer
as
gartner
would
have
castrated
his
hybrids
*punct* ,
and
this
would
have
insured
in
each
generation
a
cross
with
the
pollen
from
a
distinct
flower
*punct* ,
either
from
the
same
plant
or
from
another
plant
of
the
same
hybrid
nature
*punct* .
*break*
and
thus
*punct* ,
the
strange
fact
of
the
increase
of
fertility
in
the
successive
generations
of
artificially
fertilised
hybrids
may
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
be
accounted
for
by
close
interbreeding
having
been
avoided
*punct* .
*break*
now
let
us
turn
to
the
results
arrived
at
by
the
third
most
experienced
hybridiser
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
the
hon
*punct* .
*break*
he
is
as
emphatic
in
his
conclusion
that
some
hybrids
are
perfectly
fertile
*punct* ,
as
fertile
as
the
pure
parent-species
*punct* ,
as
are
kolreuter
and
gartner
that
some
degree
of
sterility
between
distinct
species
is
a
universal
law
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
he
experimentised
on
some
of
the
very
same
species
as
did
gartner
*punct* .
*break*
the
difference
in
their
results
may
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
be
in
part
accounted
for
by
herbert's
great
horticultural
skill
*punct* ,
and
by
his
having
hothouses
at
his
command
*punct* .
*break*
revolutum
produced
a
plant
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
he
says
*punct* ,
i
never
saw
to
occur
in
a
case
of
its
natural
fecundation
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
we
here
have
perfect
*punct* ,
or
even
more
than
commonly
perfect
*punct* ,
fertility
in
a
first
cross
between
two
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
this
case
of
the
crinum
leads
me
to
refer
to
a
most
singular
fact
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
there
are
individual
plants
*punct* ,
as
with
certain
species
of
lobelia
*punct* ,
and
with
all
the
species
of
the
genus
hippeastrum
*punct* ,
which
can
be
far
more
easily
fertilised
by
the
pollen
of
another
and
distinct
species
*punct* ,
than
by
their
own
pollen
*punct* .
*break*
for
these
plants
have
been
found
to
yield
seed
to
the
pollen
of
a
distinct
species
*punct* ,
though
quite
sterile
with
their
own
pollen
*punct* ,
notwithstanding
that
their
own
pollen
was
found
to
be
perfectly
good
*punct* ,
for
it
fertilised
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
certain
individual
plants
and
all
the
individuals
of
certain
species
can
actually
be
hybridised
much
more
readily
than
they
can
be
self-fertilised
*punct* !
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
a
bulb
of
hippeastrum
aulicum
produced
four
flowers
*punct* ;
three
were
fertilised
by
herbert
with
their
own
pollen
*punct* ,
and
the
fourth
was
subsequently
fertilised
by
the
pollen
of
a
compound
hybrid
descended
from
three
other
and
distinct
species
*punct* :
the
result
was
that
the
ovaries
of
the
three
first
flowers
soon
ceased
to
grow
*punct* ,
and
after
a
few
days
perished
entirely
*punct* ,
whereas
the
pod
impregnated
by
the
pollen
of
the
hybrid
made
vigorous
growth
and
rapid
progress
to
maturity
*punct* ,
and
bore
good
seed
*punct* ,
which
vegetated
freely
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
letter
to
me
*punct* ,
in
1839
*punct* ,
mr.
herbert
told
me
that
he
had
then
tried
the
experiment
during
five
years
*punct* ,
and
he
continued
to
try
it
during
several
subsequent
years
*punct* ,
and
always
with
the
same
result
*punct* .
*break*
this
result
has
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
been
confirmed
by
other
observers
in
the
case
of
hippeastrum
with
its
sub-genera
*punct* ,
and
in
the
case
of
some
other
genera
*punct* ,
as
lobelia
*punct* ,
passiflora
and
verbascum
*punct* .
*break*
although
the
plants
in
these
experiments
appeared
perfectly
healthy
*punct* ,
and
although
both
the
ovules
and
pollen
of
the
same
flower
were
perfectly
good
with
respect
to
other
species
*punct* ,
yet
as
they
were
functionally
imperfect
in
their
mutual
self-action
*punct* ,
we
must
infer
that
the
plants
were
in
an
unnatural
state
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
these
facts
show
on
what
slight
and
mysterious
causes
the
lesser
or
greater
fertility
of
species
when
crossed
*punct* ,
in
comparison
with
the
same
species
when
self-fertilised
*punct* ,
sometimes
depends
*punct* .
*break*
the
practical
experiments
of
horticulturists
*punct* ,
though
not
made
with
scientific
precision
*punct* ,
deserve
some
notice
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
notorious
in
how
complicated
a
manner
the
species
of
pelargonium
*punct* ,
fuchsia
*punct* ,
calceolaria
*punct* ,
petunia
*punct* ,
rhododendron
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
have
been
crossed
*punct* ,
yet
many
of
these
hybrids
seed
freely
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
herbert
asserts
that
a
hybrid
from
calceolaria
integrifolia
and
plantaginea
*punct* ,
species
most
widely
dissimilar
in
general
habit
*punct* ,
reproduced
itself
as
perfectly
as
if
it
had
been
a
natural
species
from
the
mountains
of
chile
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
taken
some
pains
to
ascertain
the
degree
of
fertility
of
some
of
the
complex
crosses
of
rhododendrons
*punct* ,
and
i
am

are
perfectly
fertile

*break*
noble

me
that
he
raises
stocks
for
grafting
from
a
hybrid
between
rhod

*break*
ponticum
and
catawbiense
*punct* ,
and
that
this
hybrid
seeds
as
freely
as
it
is
possible
to
imagine
*punct* .
*break*
had
hybrids
*punct* ,
when
fairly
treated
*punct* ,
gone
on
decreasing
in
fertility
in
each
successive
generation
*punct* ,
as
gartner
believes
to
be
the
case
*punct* ,
the
fact
would
have
been
notorious
to
nurserymen
*punct* .
*break*
horticulturists
raise
large
beds
of
the
same
hybrids
*punct* ,
and
such
alone
are
fairly
treated
*punct* ,
for
by
insect
agency
the
several
individuals
of
the
same
hybrid
variety
are
allowed
to
freely
cross
with
each
other
*punct* ,
and
the
injurious
influence
of
close
interbreeding
is
thus
prevented
*punct* .
*break*
any
one
may
readily
convince
himself
of
the
efficiency
of
insect-agency
by
examining
the
flowers
of
the
more
sterile
kinds
of
hybrid
rhododendrons
*punct* ,
which
produce
no
pollen
*punct* ,
for
he
will
find
on
their
stigmas
plenty
of
pollen
brought
from
other
flowers
*punct* .
*break*
in
regard
to
animals
*punct* ,
much
fewer
experiments
have
been
carefully
tried
than
with
plants
*punct* .
*break*
if
our
systematic
arrangements
can
be
trusted
*punct* ,
that
is
if
the
genera
of
animals
are
as
distinct
from
each
other
*punct* ,
as
are
the
genera
of
plants
*punct* ,
then
we
may
infer
that
animals
more
widely
separated
in
the
scale
of
nature
can
be
more
easily
crossed
than
in
the
case
of
plants
*punct* ;
but
the
hybrids
themselves
are
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
more
sterile
*punct* .
*break*
i
doubt
whether
any
case
of
a
perfectly
fertile
hybrid
animal
can
be
considered
as
thoroughly
well
authenticated
*punct* .
*break*
it
should
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
be
borne
in
mind
that
*punct* ,
owing
to
few
animals
breeding
freely
under
confinement
*punct* ,
few
experiments
have
been
fairly
tried
*punct* :
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
canary-bird
has
been
crossed
with
nine
other
finches
*punct* ,
but
as
not
one
of
these
nine
species
breeds
freely
in
confinement
*punct* ,
we
have
no
right
to
expect
that
the
first
crosses
between
them
and
the
canary
*punct* ,
or
that
their
hybrids
*punct* ,
should
be
perfectly
fertile
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
with
respect
to
the
fertility
in
successive
generations
of
the
more
fertile
hybrid
animals
*punct* ,
i
hardly
know
of
an
instance
in
which
two
families
of
the
same
hybrid
have
been
raised
at
the
same
time
from
different
parents
*punct* ,
so
as
to
avoid
the
ill
effects
of
close
interbreeding
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
contrary
*punct* ,
brothers
and
sisters
have
usually
been
crossed
in
each
successive
generation
*punct* ,
in
opposition
to
the
constantly
repeated
admonition
of
every
breeder
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
this
case
*punct* ,
it
is
not
at
all
surprising
that
the
inherent
sterility
in
the
hybrids
should
have
gone
on
increasing
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
were
to
act
thus
*punct* ,
and
pair
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
case
of
any
pure
animal
*punct* ,
which
from
any
cause
had
the
least
tendency
to
sterility
*punct* ,
the
breed
would
assuredly
be
lost
in
a
very
few
generations
*punct* .
*break*

perfectly
fertile
*punct* .
*break*
the
hybrids
from
the
common
and
chinese
geese
*punct* ,

*break*
cygnoides
*punct* ,
species
which
are
so
different
that
they
are
generally
ranked
in
distinct
genera
*punct* ,
have
often
bred
in
this
country
with
either
pure
parent
*punct* ,
and
in
one
single
instance
they
have
bred
inter
se
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
effected
by
mr.
eyton
*punct* ,
who
raised
two
hybrids
from
the
same
parents
but
from
different
hatches
*punct* ;
and
from
these
two
birds
he
raised
no
less
than
eight
hybrids
*punct* ,
grandchildren
of
the
pure
geese
*punct* ,
from
one
nest
*punct* .
*break*
in
india
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
these
cross-bred
geese
must
be
far
more
fertile
*punct* ;
for
i
am
assured
by
two
eminently
capable
judges
*punct* ,
namely
mr.
blyth
and
capt
*punct* .
*break*
hutton
*punct* ,
that
whole
flocks
of
these
crossed
geese
are
kept
in
various
parts
of
the
country
*punct* ;
and
as
they
are
kept
for
profit
*punct* ,
where
neither
pure
parent-species
exists
*punct* ,
they
must
certainly
be
highly
fertile
*punct* .
*break*
a
doctrine
which
originated
with
pallas
*punct* ,
has
been
largely
accepted
by
modern
naturalists
*punct* ;
namely
*punct* ,
that
most
of
our
domestic
animals
have
descended
from
two
or
more
aboriginal
species
*punct* ,
since
commingled
by
intercrossing
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
view
*punct* ,
the
aboriginal
species
must
either
at
first
have
produced
quite
fertile
hybrids
*punct* ,
or
the
hybrids
must
have
become
in
subsequent
generations
quite
fertile
under
domestication
*punct* .
*break*
this
latter
alternative
seems
to
me
the
most
probable
*punct* ,
and
i
am
inclined
to
believe
in
its
truth
*punct* ,
although
it
rests
on
no
direct
evidence
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
that
our
dogs
have
descended
from
several
wild
stocks
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
with
perhaps
the
exception
of
certain
indigenous
domestic
dogs
of
south
america
*punct* ,
all
are
quite
fertile
together
*punct* ;
and
analogy
makes
me
greatly
doubt
*punct* ,
whether
the
several
aboriginal
species
would
at
first
have
freely
bred
together
and
have
produced
quite
fertile
hybrids
*punct* .
*break*
so
again
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
our
european
and
the
humped
indian
cattle
are
quite
fertile
together
*punct* ;
but
from
facts
communicated
to
me
by
mr.
blyth
*punct* ,
i
think
they
must
be
considered
as
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
view
of
the
origin
of
many
of
our
domestic
animals
*punct* ,
we
must
either
give
up
the
belief
of
the
almost
universal
sterility
of
distinct
species
of
animals
when
crossed
*punct* ;
or
we
must
look
at
sterility
*punct* ,
not
as
an
indelible
characteristic
*punct* ,
but
as
one
capable
of
being
removed
by
domestication
*punct* .
*break*
finally
*punct* ,
looking
to
all
the
ascertained
facts
on
the
intercrossing
of
plants
and
animals
*punct* ,
it
may
be
concluded
that
some
degree
of
sterility
*punct* ,
both
in
first
crosses
and
in
hybrids
*punct* ,
is
an
extremely
general
result
*punct* ;
but
that
it
cannot
*punct* ,
under
our
present
state
of
knowledge
*punct* ,
be
considered
as
absolutely
universal
*punct* .
*break*
laws
governing
the
sterility
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids.
*punct* ,
we
will
now
consider
a
little
more
in
detail
the
circumstances
and
rules
governing
the
sterility
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
*punct* .
*break*
our
chief
object
will
be
to
see
whether
or
not
the
rules
indicate
that
species
have
specially
been
endowed
with
this
quality
*punct* ,
in
order
to
prevent
their
crossing
and
blending
together
in
utter
confusion
*punct* .
*break*
the
following
rules
and
conclusions
are
chiefly
drawn
up
from
gartner's
admirable
work
on
the
hybridisation
of
plants
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
taken
much
pains
to
ascertain
how
far
the
rules
apply
to
animals
*punct* ,
and
considering
how
scanty
our
knowledge
is
in
regard
to
hybrid
animals
*punct* ,
i
have
been
surprised
to
find
how
generally
the
same
rules
apply
to
both
kingdoms
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
been
already
remarked
*punct* ,
that
the
degree
of
fertility
*punct* ,
both
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
*punct* ,
graduates
from
zero
to
perfect
fertility
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
surprising
in
how
many
curious
ways
this
gradation
can
be
shown
to
exist
*punct* ;
but
only
the
barest
outline
of
the
facts
can
here
be
given
*punct* .
*break*
when
pollen
from
a
plant
of
one
family
is
placed
on
the
stigma
of
a
plant
of
a
distinct
family
*punct* ,
it
exerts
no
more
influence
than
so
much
inorganic
dust
*punct* .
*break*
from
this
absolute
zero
of
fertility
*punct* ,
the
pollen
of
different
species
of
the
same
genus
applied
to
the
stigma
of
some
one
species
*punct* ,
yields
a
perfect
gradation
in
the
number
of
seeds
produced
*punct* ,
up
to
nearly
complete
or
even
quite
complete
fertility
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
as
we
have
seen
*punct* ,
in
certain
abnormal
cases
*punct* ,
even
to
an
excess
of
fertility
*punct* ,
beyond
that
which
the
plant's
own
pollen
will
produce
*punct* .
*break*
so
in
hybrids
themselves
*punct* ,
there
are
some
which
never
have
produced
*punct* ,
and
probably
never
would
produce
*punct* ,
even
with
the
pollen
of
either
pure
parent
*punct* ,
a
single
fertile
seed
*punct* :
but
in
some
of
these
cases
a
first
trace
of
fertility
may
be
detected
*punct* ,
by
the
pollen
of
one
of
the
pure
parent-species
causing
the
flower
of
the
hybrid
to
wither
earlier
than
it
otherwise
would
have
done
*punct* ;
and
the
early
withering
of
the
flower
is
well
known
to
be
a
sign
of
incipient
fertilisation
*punct* .
*break*
from
this
extreme
degree
of
sterility
we
have
self-fertilised
hybrids
producing
a
greater
and
greater
number
of
seeds
up
to
perfect
fertility
*punct* .
*break*
hybrids
from
two
species
which
are
very
difficult
to
cross
*punct* ,
and
which
rarely
produce
any
offspring
*punct* ,
are
generally
very
sterile
*punct* ;
but
the
parallelism
between
the
difficulty
of
making
a
first
cross
*punct* ,
and
the
sterility
of
the
hybrids
thus
produced
*punct* ,
two
classes
of
facts
which
are
generally
confounded
together
*punct* ,
is
by
no
means
strict
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
many
cases
*punct* ,
in
which
two
pure
species
can
be
united
with
unusual
facility
*punct* ,
and
produce
numerous
hybrid-offspring
*punct* ,
yet
these
hybrids
are
remarkably
sterile
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
there
are
species
which
can
be
crossed
very
rarely
*punct* ,
or
with
extreme
difficulty
*punct* ,
but
the
hybrids
*punct* ,
when
at
last
produced
*punct* ,
are
very
fertile
*punct* .
*break*
even
within
the
limits
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
for
instance
in
dianthus
*punct* ,
these
two
opposite
cases
occur
*punct* .
*break*
the
fertility
*punct* ,
both
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
*punct* ,
is
more
easily
affected
by
unfavourable
conditions
*punct* ,
than
is
the
fertility
of
pure
species
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
degree
of
fertility
is
likewise
innately
variable
*punct* ;
for
it
is
not
always
the
same
when
the
same
two
species
are
crossed
under
the
same
circumstances
*punct* ,
but
depends
in
part
upon
the
constitution
of
the
individuals
which
happen
to
have
been
chosen
for
the
experiment
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
is
with
hybrids
*punct* ,
for
their
degree
of
fertility
is
often
found
to
differ
greatly
in
the
several
individuals
raised
from
seed
out
of
the
same
capsule
and
exposed
to
exactly
the
same
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
term
systematic
affinity
is
meant
*punct* ,
the
resemblance
between
species
in
structure
and
in
constitution
*punct* ,
more
especially
in
the
structure
of
parts
which
are
of
high
physiological
importance
and
which
differ
little
in
the
allied
species
*punct* .
*break*
now
the
fertility
of
first
crosses
between
species
*punct* ,
and
of
the
hybrids
produced
from
them
*punct* ,
is
largely
governed
by
their
systematic
affinity
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
clearly
shown
by
hybrids
never
having
been
raised
between
species
ranked
by
systematists
in
distinct
families
*punct* ;
and
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
by
very
closely
allied
species
generally
uniting
with
facility
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
correspondence
between
systematic
affinity
and
the
facility
of
crossing
is
by
no
means
strict
*punct* .
*break*
a
multitude
of
cases
could
be
given
of
very
closely
allied
species
which
will
not
unite
*punct* ,
or
only
with
extreme
difficulty
*punct* ;
and
on
the
other
hand
of
very
distinct
species
which
unite
with
the
utmost
facility
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
same
family
there
may
be
a
genus
*punct* ,
as
dianthus
*punct* ,
in
which
very
many
species
can
most
readily
be
crossed
*punct* ;
and
another
genus
*punct* ,
as
silene
*punct* ,
in
which
the
most
persevering
efforts
have
failed
to
produce
between
extremely
close
species
a
single
hybrid
*punct* .
*break*
acuminata
*punct* ,
which
is
not
a
particularly
distinct
species
*punct* ,
obstinately
failed
to
fertilise
*punct* ,
or
to
be
fertilised
by
*punct* ,
no
less
than
eight
other
species
of
nicotiana
*punct* .
*break*
very
many
analogous
facts
could
be
given
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
has
been
able
to
point
out
what
kind
*punct* ,
or
what
amount
*punct* ,
of
difference
in
any
recognisable
character
is
sufficient
to
prevent
two
species
crossing
*punct* .
*break*
it
can
be
shown
that
plants
most
widely
different
in
habit
and
general
appearance
*punct* ,
and
having
strongly
marked
differences
in
every
part
of
the
flower
*punct* ,
even
in
the
pollen
*punct* ,
in
the
fruit
*punct* ,
and
in
the
cotyledons
*punct* ,
can
be
crossed
*punct* .
*break*
annual
and
perennial
plants
*punct* ,
deciduous
and
evergreen
trees
*punct* ,
plants
inhabiting
different
stations
and
fitted
for
extremely
different
climates
*punct* ,
can
often
be
crossed
with
ease
*punct* .
*break*
by
a
reciprocal
cross
between
two
species
*punct* ,
i
mean
the
case
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
of
a
stallion-horse
being
first
crossed
with
a
female-ass
*punct* ,
and
then
a
male-ass
with
a
mare
*punct* :
these
two
species
may
then
be
said
to
have
been
reciprocally
crossed
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
often
the
widest
possible
difference
in
the
facility
of
making
reciprocal
crosses
*punct* .
*break*
such
cases
are
highly
important
*punct* ,
for
they
prove
that
the
capacity
in
any
two
species
to
cross
is
often
completely
independent
of
their
systematic
affinity
*punct* ,
or
of
any
recognisable
difference
in
their
whole
organisation
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
these
cases
clearly
show
that
the
capacity
for
crossing
is
connected
with
constitutional
differences
imperceptible
by
us
*punct* ,
and
confined
to
the
reproductive
system
*punct* .
*break*
this
difference
in
the
result
of
reciprocal
crosses
between
the
same
two
species
was
long
ago
observed
by
kolreuter
*punct* .
*break*
to
give
an
instance
*punct* :
mirabilis
jalappa
can
easily
be
fertilised
by
the
pollen
of
m.
longiflora
*punct* ,
and
the
hybrids
thus
produced
are
sufficiently
fertile
*punct* ;
but
kolreuter
tried
more
than
two
hundred
times
*punct* ,
during
eight
following
years
*punct* ,
to
fertilise
reciprocally
m.
longiflora
with
the
pollen
of
m.
jalappa
*punct* ,
and
utterly
failed
*punct* .
*break*
several
other
equally
striking
cases
could
be
given
*punct* .
*break*
thuret
has
observed
the
same
fact
with
certain
sea-weeds
or
fuci
*punct* .
*break*
gartner
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
found
that
this
difference
of
facility
in
making
reciprocal
crosses
is
extremely
common
in
a
lesser
degree
*punct* .
*break*
he
has
observed
it
even
between
forms
so
closely
related
*punct* ,
as
matthiola
annua
and
glabra
*punct* ,
that
many
botanists
rank
them
only
as
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
also
a
remarkable
fact
*punct* ,
that
hybrids
raised
from
reciprocal
crosses
*punct* ,
though
of
course
compounded
of
the
very
same
two
species
*punct* ,
the
one
species
having
first
been
used
as
the
father
and
then
as
the
mother
*punct* ,
generally
differ
in
fertility
in
a
small
*punct* ,
and
occasionally
in
a
high
degree
*punct* .
*break*
several
other
singular
rules
could
be
given
from
gartner
*punct* :
for
instance
*punct* ,
some
species
have
a
remarkable
power
of
crossing
with
other
species
*punct* ;
other
species
of
the
same
genus
have
a
remarkable
power
of
impressing
their
likeness
on
their
hybrid
offspring
*punct* ;
but
these
two
powers
do
not
at
all
necessarily
go
together
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
certain
hybrids
which
instead
of
having
*punct* ,
as
is
usual
*punct* ,
an
intermediate
character
between
their
two
parents
*punct* ,
always
closely
resemble
one
of
them
*punct* ;
and
such
hybrids
*punct* ,
though
externally
so
like
one
of
their
pure
parent-species
*punct* ,
are
with
rare
exceptions
extremely
sterile
*punct* .
*break*
so
again
amongst
hybrids
which
are
usually
intermediate
in
structure
between
their
parents
*punct* ,
exceptional
and
abnormal
individuals
sometimes
are
born
*punct* ,
which
closely
resemble
one
of
their
pure
parents
*punct* ;
and
these
hybrids
are
almost
always
utterly
sterile
*punct* ,
even
when
the
other
hybrids
raised
from
seed
from
the
same
capsule
have
a
considerable
degree
of
fertility
*punct* .
*break*
these
facts
show
how
completely
fertility
in
the
hybrid
is
independent
of
its
external
resemblance
to
either
pure
parent
*punct* .
*break*
considering
the
several
rules
now
given
*punct* ,
which
govern
the
fertility
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
*punct* ,
we
see
that
when
forms
*punct* ,
which
must
be
considered
as
good
and
distinct
species
*punct* ,
are
united
*punct* ,
their
fertility
graduates
from
zero
to
perfect
fertility
*punct* ,
or
even
to
fertility
under
certain
conditions
in
excess
*punct* .
*break*
that
their
fertility
*punct* ,
besides
being
eminently
susceptible
to
favourable
and
unfavourable
conditions
*punct* ,
is
innately
variable
*punct* .
*break*
that
it
is
by
no
means
always
the
same
in
degree
in
the
first
cross
and
in
the
hybrids
produced
from
this
cross
*punct* .
*break*
that
the
fertility
of
hybrids
is
not
related
to
the
degree
in
which
they
resemble
in
external
appearance
either
parent
*punct* .
*break*
and
lastly
*punct* ,
that
the
facility
of
making
a
first
cross
between
any
two
species
is
not
always
governed
by
their
systematic
affinity
or
degree
of
resemblance
to
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
this
latter
statement
is
clearly
proved
by
reciprocal
crosses
between
the
same
two
species
*punct* ,
for
according
as
the
one
species
or
the
other
is
used
as
the
father
or
the
mother
*punct* ,
there
is
generally
some
difference
*punct* ,
and
occasionally
the
widest
possible
difference
*punct* ,
in
the
facility
of
effecting
an
union
*punct* .
*break*
the
hybrids
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
produced
from
reciprocal
crosses
often
differ
in
fertility
*punct* .
*break*
now
do
these
complex
and
singular
rules
indicate
that
species
have
been
endowed
with
sterility
simply
to
prevent
their
becoming
confounded
in
nature
*punct* ?
*break*
i
think
not
*punct* .
*break*
for
why
should
the
sterility
be
so
extremely
different
in
degree
*punct* ,
when
various
species
are
crossed
*punct* ,
all
of
which
we
must
suppose
it
would
be
equally
important
to
keep
from
blending
together
*punct* ?
*break*
why
should
the
degree
of
sterility
be
innately
variable
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ?
*break*
why
should
some
species
cross
with
facility
*punct* ,
and
yet
produce
very
sterile
hybrids
*punct* ;
and
other
species
cross
with
extreme
difficulty
*punct* ,
and
yet
produce
fairly
fertile
hybrids
*punct* ?
*break*
why
should
there
often
be
so
great
a
difference
in
the
result
of
a
reciprocal
cross
between
the
same
two
species
*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
it
may
even
be
asked
*punct* ,
has
the
production
of
hybrids
been
permitted
*punct* ?
*break*
to
grant
to
species
the
special
power
of
producing
hybrids
*punct* ,
and
then
to
stop
their
further
propagation
by
different
degrees
of
sterility
*punct* ,
not
strictly
related
to
the
facility
of
the
first
union
between
their
parents
*punct* ,
seems
to
be
a
strange
arrangement
*punct* .
*break*
the
foregoing
rules
and
facts
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
appear
to
me
clearly
to
indicate
that
the
sterility
both
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
is
simply
incidental
or
dependent
on
unknown
differences
*punct* ,
chiefly
in
the
reproductive
systems
*punct* ,
of
the
species
which
are
crossed
*punct* .
*break*
the
differences
being
of
so
peculiar
and
limited
a
nature
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
in
reciprocal
crosses
between
two
species
the
male
sexual
element
of
the
one
will
often
freely
act
on
the
female
sexual
element
of
the
other
*punct* ,
but
not
in
a
reversed
direction
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
be
advisable
to
explain
a
little
more
fully
by
an
example
what
i
mean
by
sterility
being
incidental
on
other
differences
*punct* ,
and
not
a
specially
endowed
quality
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
capacity
of
one
plant
to
be
grafted
or
budded
on
another
is
so
entirely
unimportant
for
its
welfare
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
i
presume
that
no
one
will
suppose
that
this
capacity
is
a
specially
endowed
quality
*punct* ,
but
will
admit
that
it
is
incidental
on
differences
in
the
laws
of
growth
of
the
two
plants
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
sometimes
see
the
reason
why
one
tree
will
not
take
on
another
*punct* ,
from
differences
in
their
rate
of
growth
*punct* ,
in
the
hardness
of
their
wood
*punct* ,
in
the
period
of
the
flow
or
nature
of
their
sap
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ;
but
in
a
multitude
of
cases
we
can
assign
no
reason
whatever
*punct* .
*break*
great
diversity
in
the
size
of
two
plants
*punct* ,
one
being
woody
and
the
other
herbaceous
*punct* ,
one
being
evergreen
and
the
other
deciduous
*punct* ,
and
adaptation
to
widely
different
climates
*punct* ,
does
not
always
prevent
the
two
grafting
together
*punct* .
*break*
as
in
hybridisation
*punct* ,
so
with
grafting
*punct* ,
the
capacity
is
limited
by
systematic
affinity
*punct* ,
for
no
one
has
been
able
to
graft
trees
together
belonging
to
quite
distinct
families
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
closely
allied
species
*punct* ,
and
varieties
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
can
usually
*punct* ,
but
not
invariably
*punct* ,
be
grafted
with
ease
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
capacity
*punct* ,
as
in
hybridisation
*punct* ,
is
by
no
means
absolutely
governed
by
systematic
affinity
*punct* .
*break*
although
many
distinct
genera
within
the
same
family
have
been
grafted
together
*punct* ,
in
other
cases
species
of
the
same
genus
will
not
take
on
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
the
pear
can
be
grafted
far
more
readily
on
the
quince
*punct* ,
which
is
ranked
as
a
distinct
genus
*punct* ,
than
on
the
apple
*punct* ,
which
is
a
member
of
the
same
genus
*punct* .
*break*
even
different
varieties
of
the
pear
take
with
different
degrees
of
facility
on
the
quince
*punct* ;
so
do
different
varieties
of
the
apricot
and
peach
on
certain
varieties
of
the
plum
*punct* .
*break*
as
gartner
found
that
there
was
sometimes
an
innate
difference
in
different
individuals
of
the
same
two
species
in
crossing
*punct* ;
so
sagaret
believes
this
to
be
the
case
with
different
individuals
of
the
same
two
species
in
being
grafted
together
*punct* .
*break*
as
in
reciprocal
crosses
*punct* ,
the
facility
of
effecting
an
union
is
often
very
far
from
equal
*punct* ,
so
it
sometimes
is
in
grafting
*punct* ;
the
common
gooseberry
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
cannot
be
grafted
on
the
currant
*punct* ,
whereas
the
currant
will
take
*punct* ,
though
with
difficulty
*punct* ,
on
the
gooseberry
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
seen
that
the
sterility
of
hybrids
*punct* ,
which
have
their
reproductive
organs
in
an
imperfect
condition
*punct* ,
is
a
very
different
case
from
the
difficulty
of
uniting
two
pure
species
*punct* ,
which
have
their
reproductive
organs
perfect
*punct* ;
yet
these
two
distinct
cases
run
to
a
certain
extent
parallel
*punct* .
*break*
something
analogous
occurs
in
grafting
*punct* ;
for
thouin
found
that
three
species
of
robinia
*punct* ,
which
seeded
freely
on
their
own
roots
*punct* ,
and
which
could
be
grafted
with
no
great
difficulty
on
another
species
*punct* ,
when
thus
grafted
were
rendered
barren
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
certain
species
of
sorbus
*punct* ,
when
grafted
on
other
species
*punct* ,
yielded
twice
as
much
fruit
as
when
on
their
own
roots
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
reminded
by
this
latter
fact
of
the
extraordinary
case
of
hippeastrum
*punct* ,
lobelia
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
which
seeded
much
more
freely
when
fertilised
with
the
pollen
of
distinct
species
*punct* ,
than
when
self-fertilised
with
their
own
pollen
*punct* .
*break*
we
thus
see
*punct* ,
that
although
there
is
a
clear
and
fundamental
difference
between
the
mere
adhesion
of
grafted
stocks
*punct* ,
and
the
union
of
the
male
and
female
elements
in
the
act
of
reproduction
*punct* ,
yet
that
there
is
a
rude
degree
of
parallelism
in
the
results
of
grafting
and
of
crossing
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
we
must
look
at
the
curious
and
complex
laws
governing
the
facility
with
which
trees
can
be
grafted
on
each
other
as
incidental
on
unknown
differences
in
their
vegetative
systems
*punct* ,
so
i
believe
that
the
still
more
complex
laws
governing
the
facility
of
first
crosses
*punct* ,
are
incidental
on
unknown
differences
*punct* ,
chiefly
in
their
reproductive
systems
*punct* .
*break*
these
differences
*punct* ,
in
both
cases
*punct* ,
follow
to
a
certain
extent
*punct* ,
as
might
have
been
expected
*punct* ,
systematic
affinity
*punct* ,
by
which
every
kind
of
resemblance
and
dissimilarity
between
organic
beings
is
attempted
to
be
expressed
*punct* .
*break*
the
facts
by
no
means
seem
to
me
to
indicate
that
the
greater
or
lesser
difficulty
of
either
grafting
or
crossing
together
various
species
has
been
a
special
endowment
*punct* ;
although
in
the
case
of
crossing
*punct* ,
the
difficulty
is
as
important
for
the
endurance
and
stability
of
specific
forms
*punct* ,
as
in
the
case
of
grafting
it
is
unimportant
for
their
welfare
*punct* .
*break*
causes
of
the
sterility
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids.
*punct* ,
we
may
now
look
a
little
closer
at
the
probable
causes
of
the
sterility
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
*punct* .
*break*
these
two
cases
are
fundamentally
different
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
as
just
remarked
*punct* ,
in
the
union
of
two
pure
species
the
male
and
female
sexual
elements
are
perfect
*punct* ,
whereas
in
hybrids
they
are
imperfect
*punct* .
*break*
even
in
first
crosses
*punct* ,
the
greater
or
lesser
difficulty
in
effecting
a
union
apparently
depends
on
several
distinct
causes
*punct* .
*break*
there
must
sometimes
be
a
physical
impossibility
in
the
male
element
reaching
the
ovule
*punct* ,
as
would
be
the
case
with
a
plant
having
a
pistil
too
long
for
the
pollen-tubes
to
reach
the
ovarium
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
also
been
observed
that
when
pollen
of
one
species
is
placed
on
the
stigma
of
a
distantly
allied
species
*punct* ,
though
the
pollen-tubes
protrude
*punct* ,
they
do
not
penetrate
the
stigmatic
surface
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
the
male
element
may
reach
the
female
element
*punct* ,
but
be
incapable
of
causing
an
embryo
to
be
developed
*punct* ,
as
seems
to
have
been
the
case
with
some
of
thuret's
experiments
on
fuci
*punct* .
*break*
no
explanation
can
be
given
of
these
facts
*punct* ,
any
more
than
why
certain
trees
cannot
be
grafted
on
others
*punct* .
*break*
lastly
*punct* ,
an
embryo
may
be
developed
*punct* ,
and
then
perish
at
an
early
period
*punct* .
*break*
this
latter
alternative
has
not
been
sufficiently
attended
to
*punct* ;
but
i
believe
*punct* ,
from
observations
communicated
to
me
by
mr.
hewitt
*punct* ,
who
has
had
great
experience
in
hybridising
gallinaceous
birds
*punct* ,
that
the
early
death
of
the
embryo
is
a
very
frequent
cause
of
sterility
in
first
crosses
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
at
first
very
unwilling
to
believe
in
this
view
*punct* ;
as
hybrids
*punct* ,
when
once
born
*punct* ,
are
generally
healthy
and
long-lived
*punct* ,
as
we
see
in
the
case
of
the
common
mule
*punct* .
*break*
hybrids
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
are
differently
circumstanced
before
and
after
birth
*punct* :
when
born
and
living
in
a
country
where
their
two
parents
can
live
*punct* ,
they
are
generally
placed
under
suitable
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
hybrid
partakes
of
only
half
of
the
nature
and
constitution
of
its
mother
*punct* ,
and
therefore
before
birth
*punct* ,
as
long
as
it
is
nourished
within
its
mother's
womb
or
within
the
egg
or
seed
produced
by
the
mother
*punct* ,
it
may
be
exposed
to
conditions
in
some
degree
unsuitable
*punct* ,
and
consequently
be
liable
to
perish
at
an
early
period
*punct* ;
more
especially
as
all
very
young
beings
seem
eminently
sensitive
to
injurious
or
unnatural
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
in
regard
to
the
sterility
of
hybrids
*punct* ,
in
which
the
sexual
elements
are
imperfectly
developed
*punct* ,
the
case
is
very
different
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
more
than
once
alluded
to
a
large
body
of
facts
*punct* ,
which
i
have
collected
*punct* ,
showing
that
when
animals
and
plants
are
removed
from
their
natural
conditions
*punct* ,
they
are
extremely
liable
to
have
their
reproductive
systems
seriously
affected
*punct* .
*break*
this
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
is
the
great
bar
to
the
domestication
of
animals
*punct* .
*break*
between
the
sterility
thus
superinduced
and
that
of
hybrids
*punct* ,
there
are
many
points
of
similarity
*punct* .
*break*
in
both
cases
the
sterility
is
independent
of
general
health
*punct* ,
and
is
often
accompanied
by
excess
of
size
or
great
luxuriance
*punct* .
*break*
in
both
cases
*punct* ,
the
sterility
occurs
in
various
degrees
*punct* ;
in
both
*punct* ,
the
male
element
is
the
most
liable
to
be
affected
*punct* ;
but
sometimes
the
female
more
than
the
male
*punct* .
*break*
in
both
*punct* ,
the
tendency
goes
to
a
certain
extent
with
systematic
affinity
*punct* ,
or
whole
groups
of
animals
and
plants
are
rendered
impotent
by
the
same
unnatural
conditions
*punct* ;
and
whole
groups
of
species
tend
to
produce
sterile
hybrids
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
one
species
in
a
group
will
sometimes
resist
great
changes
of
conditions
with
un
impaired
fertility
*punct* ;
and
certain
species
in
a
group
will
produce
unusually
fertile
hybrids
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
can
tell
*punct* ,
till
he
tries
*punct* ,
whether
any
particular
animal
will
breed
under
confinement
or
any
plant
seed
freely
under
culture
*punct* ;
nor
can
he
tell
*punct* ,
till
he
tries
*punct* ,
whether
any
two
species
of
a
genus
will
produce
more
or
less
sterile
hybrids
*punct* .
*break*
lastly
*punct* ,
when
organic
beings
are
placed
during
several
generations
under
conditions
not
natural
to
them
*punct* ,
they
are
extremely
liable
to
vary
*punct* ,
which
is
due
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
to
their
reproductive
systems
having
been
specially
affected
*punct* ,
though
in
a
lesser
degree
than
when
sterility
ensues
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
is
with
hybrids
*punct* ,
for
hybrids
in
successive
generations
are
eminently
liable
to
vary
*punct* ,
as
every
experimentalist
has
observed
*punct* .
*break*
thus
we
see
that
when
organic
beings
are
placed
under
new
and
unnatural
conditions
*punct* ,
and
when
hybrids
are
produced
by
the
unnatural
crossing
of
two
species
*punct* ,
the
reproductive
system
*punct* ,
independently
of
the
general
state
of
health
*punct* ,
is
affected
by
sterility
in
a
very
similar
manner
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
one
case
*punct* ,
the
conditions
of
life
have
been
disturbed
*punct* ,
though
often
in
so
slight
a
degree
as
to
be
inappreciable
by
us
*punct* ;
in
the
other
case
*punct* ,
or
that
of
hybrids,the
external
conditions
have
remained
the
same
*punct* ,
but
the
organisation
has
been
disturbed
by
two
different
structures
and
constitutions
having
been
blended
into
one
*punct* .
*break*
for
it
is
scarcely
possible
that
two
organisations
should
be
compounded
into
one
*punct* ,
without
some
disturbance
occurring
in
the
development
*punct* ,
or
periodical
action
*punct* ,
or
mutual
relation
of
the
different
parts
and
organs
one
to
another
*punct* ,
or
to
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
when
hybrids
are
able
to
breed
inter
se
*punct* ,
they
transmit
to
their
offspring
from
generation
to
generation
the
same
compounded
organisation
*punct* ,
and
hence
we
need
not
be
surprised
that
their
sterility
*punct* ,
though
in
some
degree
variable
*punct* ,
rarely
diminishes
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
be
confessed
that
we
cannot
understand
*punct* ,
excepting
on
vague
hypotheses
*punct* ,
several
facts
with
respect
to
the
sterility
of
hybrids
*punct* ;
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
unequal
fertility
of
hybrids
produced
from
reciprocal
crosses
*punct* ;
or
the
increased
sterility
in
those
hybrids
which
occasionally
and
exceptionally
resemble
closely
either
pure
parent
*punct* .
*break*
nor
do
i
pretend
that
the
foregoing
remarks
go
to
the
root
of
the
matter
*punct* :
no
explanation
is
offered
why
an
organism
*punct* ,
when
placed
under
unnatural
conditions
*punct* ,
is
rendered
sterile
*punct* .
*break*
all
that
i
have
attempted
to
show
*punct* ,
is
that
in
two
cases
*punct* ,
in
some
respects
allied
*punct* ,
sterility
is
the
common
result,
*punct* ,
in
the
one
case
from
the
conditions
of
life
having
been
disturbed
*punct* ,
in
the
other
case
from
the
organisation
having
been
disturbed
by
two
organisations
having
been
compounded
into
one
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
seem
fanciful
*punct* ,
but
i
suspect
that
a
similar
parallelism
extends
to
an
allied
yet
very
different
class
of
facts
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
an
old
and
almost
universal
belief
*punct* ,
founded
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
on
a
considerable
body
of
evidence
*punct* ,
that
slight
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
are
beneficial
to
all
living
things
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
this
acted
on
by
farmers
and
gardeners
in
their
frequent
exchanges
of
seed
*punct* ,
tubers
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
from
one
soil
or
climate
to
another
*punct* ,
and
back
again
*punct* .
*break*
during
the
convalescence
of
animals
*punct* ,
we
plainly
see
that
great
benefit
is
derived
from
almost
any
change
in
the
habits
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
both
with
plants
and
animals
*punct* ,
there
is
abundant
evidence
*punct* ,
that
a
cross
between
very
distinct
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
that
is
between
members
of
different
strains
or
sub-breeds
*punct* ,
gives
vigour
and
fertility
to
the
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
from
the
facts
alluded
to
in
our
fourth
chapter
*punct* ,
that
a
certain
amount
of
crossing
is
indispensable
even
with
hermaphrodites
*punct* ;
and
that
close
interbreeding
continued
during
several
generations
between
the
nearest
relations
*punct* ,
especially
if
these
be
kept
under
the
same
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
always
induces
weakness
and
sterility
in
the
progeny
*punct* .
*break*
hence
it
seems
that
*punct* ,
on
the
one
hand
*punct* ,
slight
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
benefit
all
organic
beings
*punct* ,
and
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
that
slight
crosses
*punct* ,
that
is
crosses
between
the
males
and
females
of
the
same
species
which
have
varied
and
become
slightly
different
*punct* ,
give
vigour
and
fertility
to
the
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
have
seen
that
greater
changes
*punct* ,
or
changes
of
a
particular
nature
*punct* ,
often
render
organic
beings
in
some
degree
sterile
*punct* ;
and
that
greater
crosses
*punct* ,
that
is
crosses
between
males
and
females
which
have
become
widely
or
specifically
different
*punct* ,
produce
hybrids
which
are
generally
sterile
in
some
degree
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
persuade
myself
that
this
parallelism
is
an
accident
or
an
illusion
*punct* .
*break*
both
series
of
facts
seem
to
be
connected
together
by
some
common
but
unknown
bond
*punct* ,
which
is
essentially
related
to
the
principle
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
fertility
of
varieties
when
crossed
*punct* ,
and
of
their
mongrel
off-spring.
*punct* ,
it
may
be
urged
*punct* ,
as
a
most
forcible
argument
*punct* ,
that
there
must
be
some
essential
distinction
between
species
and
varieties
*punct* ,
and
that
there
must
be
some
error
in
all
the
foregoing
remarks
*punct* ,
inasmuch
as
varieties
*punct* ,
however
much
they
may
differ
from
each
other
in
external
appearance
*punct* ,
cross
with
perfect
facility
*punct* ,
and
yield
perfectly
fertile
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
i
fully
admit
that
this
is
almost
invariably
the
case
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
we
look
to
varieties
produced
under
nature
*punct* ,
we
are
immediately
involved
in
hopeless
difficulties
*punct* ;
for
if
two
hitherto
reputed
varieties
be
found
in
any
degree
sterile
together
*punct* ,
they
are
at
once
ranked
by
most
naturalists
as
species
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
blue
and
red
pimpernel
*punct* ,
the
primrose
and
cowslip
*punct* ,
which
are
considered
by
many
of
our
best
botanists
as
varieties
*punct* ,
are
said
by
gartner
not
to
be
quite
fertile
when
crossed
*punct* ,
and
he
consequently
ranks
them
as
undoubted
species
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
thus
argue
in
a
circle
*punct* ,
the
fertility
of
all
varieties
produced
under
nature
will
assuredly
have
to
be
granted
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
turn
to
varieties
*punct* ,
produced
*punct* ,
or
supposed
to
have
been
produced
*punct* ,
under
domestication
*punct* ,
we
are
still
involved
in
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
for
when
it
is
stated
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
that
the
german
spitz
dog
unites
more
easily
than
other
dogs
with
foxes
*punct* ,
or
that
certain
south
american
indigenous
domestic
dogs
do
not
readily
cross
with
european
dogs
*punct* ,
the
explanation
which
will
occur
to
everyone
*punct* ,
and
probably
the
true
one
*punct* ,
is
that
these
dogs
have
descended
from
several
aboriginally
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
the
perfect
fertility
of
so
many
domestic
varieties
*punct* ,
differing
widely
from
each
other
in
appearance
*punct* ,
for
instance
of
the
pigeon
or
of
the
cabbage
*punct* ,
is
a
remarkable
fact
*punct* ;
more
especially
when
we
reflect
how
many
species
there
are
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
though
resembling
each
other
most
closely
*punct* ,
are
utterly
sterile
when
intercrossed
*punct* .
*break*
several
considerations
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
render
the
fertility
of
domestic
varieties
less
remarkable
than
at
first
appears
*punct* .
*break*
it
can
*punct* ,
in
the
first
place
*punct* ,
be
clearly
shown
that
mere
external
dissimilarity
between
two
species
does
not
determine
their
greater
or
lesser
degree
of
sterility
when
crossed
*punct* ;
and
we
may
apply
the
same
rule
to
domestic
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
second
place
*punct* ,
some
eminent
naturalists
believe
that
a
long
course
of
domestication
tends
to
eliminate
sterility
in
the
successive
generations
of
hybrids
*punct* ,
which
were
at
first
only
slightly
sterile
*punct* ;
and
if
this
be
so
*punct* ,
we
surely
ought
not
to
expect
to
find
sterility
both
appearing
and
disappearing
under
nearly
the
same
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
lastly
*punct* ,
and
this
seems
to
me
by
far
the
most
important
consideration
*punct* ,
new
races
of
animals
and
plants
are
produced
under
domestication
by
man's
methodical
and
unconscious
power
of
selection
*punct* ,
for
his
own
use
and
pleasure
*punct* :
he
neither
wishes
to
select
*punct* ,
nor
could
select
*punct* ,
slight
differences
in
the
reproductive
system
*punct* ,
or
other
constitutional
differences
correlated
with
the
reproductive
system
*punct* .
*break*
he
supplies
his
several
varieties
with
the
same
food
*punct* ;
treats
them
in
nearly
the
same
manner
*punct* ,
and
does
not
wish
to
alter
their
general
habits
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
nature
acts
uniformly
and
slowly
during
vast
periods
of
time
on
the
whole
organisation
*punct* ,
in
any
way
which
may
be
for
each
creature's
own
good
*punct* ;
and
thus
she
may
*punct* ,
either
directly
*punct* ,
or
more
probably
indirectly
*punct* ,
through
correlation
*punct* ,
modify
the
reproductive
system
in
the
several
descendants
from
any
one
species
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
this
difference
in
the
process
of
selection
*punct* ,
as
carried
on
by
man
and
nature
*punct* ,
we
need
not
be
surprised
at
some
difference
in
the
result
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
as
yet
spoken
as
if
the
varieties
of
the
same
species
were
invariably
fertile
when
intercrossed
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
seems
to
me
impossible
to
resist
the
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
certain
amount
of
sterility
in
the
few
following
cases
*punct* ,
which
i
will
briefly
abstract
*punct* .
*break*
the
evidence
is
at
least
as
good
as
that
from
which
we
believe
in
the
sterility
of
a
multitude
of
species
*punct* .
*break*
the
evidence
is
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
derived
from
hostile
witnesses
*punct* ,
who
in
all
other
cases
consider
fertility
and
sterility
as
safe
criterions
of
specific
distinction
*punct* .
*break*
gartner
kept
during
several
years
a
dwarf
kind
of
maize
with
yellow
seeds
*punct* ,
and
a
tall
variety
with
red
seeds
*punct* ,
growing
near
each
other
in
his
garden
*punct* ;
and
although
these
plants
have
separated
sexes
*punct* ,
they
never
naturally
crossed
*punct* .
*break*
he
then
fertilised
thirteen
flowers
of
the
one
with
the
pollen
of
the
other
*punct* ;
but
only
a
single
head
produced
any
seed
*punct* ,
and
this
one
head
produced
only
five
grains
*punct* .
*break*
manipulation
in
this
case
could
not
have
been
injurious
*punct* ,
as
the
plants
have
separated
sexes
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
has
suspected
that
these
varieties
of
maize
are
distinct
species
*punct* ;
and
it
is
important
to
notice
that
the
hybrid
plants
thus
raised
were
themselves
perfectly
fertile
*punct* ;
so
that
even
gartner
did
not
venture
to
consider
the
two
varieties
as
specifically
distinct
*punct* .
*break*
girou
de
buzareingues
crossed
three
varieties
of
gourd
*punct* ,
which
like
the
maize
has
separated
sexes
*punct* ,
and
he
asserts
that
their
mutual
fertilisation
is
by
so
much
the
less
easy
as
their
differences
are
greater
*punct* .
*break*
how
far
these
experiments
may
be
trusted
*punct* ,
i
know
not
*punct* ;
but
the
forms
experimentised
on
*punct* ,
are
ranked
by
sagaret
*punct* ,
who
mainly
founds
his
classification
by
the
test
of
infertility
*punct* ,
as
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
the
following
case
is
far
more
remarkable
*punct* ,
and
seems
at
first
quite
incredible
*punct* ;
but
it
is
the
result
of
an
astonishing
number
of
experiments
made
during
many
years
on
nine
species
of
verbascum
*punct* ,
by
so
good
an
observer
and
so
hostile
a
witness
*punct* ,
as
gartner
*punct* :
namely
*punct* ,
that
yellow
and
white
varieties
of
the
same
species
of
verbascum
when
intercrossed
produce
less
seed
*punct* ,
than
do
either
coloured
varieties
when
fertilised
with
pollen
from
their
own
coloured
flowers
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
he
asserts
that
when
yellow
and
white
varieties
of
one
species
are
crossed
with
yellow
and
white
varieties
of
a
distinct
species
*punct* ,
more
seed
is
produced
by
the
crosses
between
the
same
coloured
flowers
*punct* ,
than
between
those
which
are
differently
coloured
*punct* .
*break*
yet
these
varieties
of
verbascum
present
no
other
difference
besides
the
mere
colour
of
the
flower
*punct* ;
and
one
variety
can
sometimes
be
raised
from
the
seed
of
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
from
observations
which
i
have
made
on
certain
varieties
of
hollyhock
*punct* ,
i
am
inclined
to
suspect
that
they
present
analogous
facts
*punct* .
*break*
kolreuter
*punct* ,
whose
accuracy
has
been
confirmed
by
every
subsequent
observer
*punct* ,
has
proved
the
remarkable
fact
*punct* ,
that
one
variety
of
the
common
tobacco
is
more
fertile
*punct* ,
when
crossed
with
a
widely
distinct
species
*punct* ,
than
are
the
other
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
he
experimentised
on
five
forms
*punct* ,
which
are
commonly
reputed
to
be
varieties
*punct* ,
and
which
he
tested
by
the
severest
trial
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
by
reciprocal
crosses
*punct* ,
and
he
found
their
mongrel
offspring
perfectly
fertile
*punct* .
*break*
hence
the
reproductive
system
of
this
one
variety
must
have
been
in
some
manner
and
in
some
degree
modified
*punct* .
*break*
from
these
facts
*punct* ;
from
the
great
difficulty
of
ascertaining
the
infertility
of
varieties
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
for
a
supposed
variety
if
infertile
in
any
degree
would
generally
be
ranked
as
species
*punct* ;
from
man
selecting
only
external
characters
in
the
production
of
the
most
distinct
domestic
varieties
*punct* ,
and
from
not
wishing
or
being
able
to
produce
recondite
and
functional
differences
in
the
reproductive
system
*punct* ;
from
these
several
considerations
and
facts
*punct* ,
i
do
not
think
that
the
very
general
fertility
of
varieties
can
be
proved
to
be
of
universal
occurrence
*punct* ,
or
to
form
a
fundamental
distinction
between
varieties
and
species
*punct* .
*break*
the
general
fertility
of
varieties
does
not
seem
to
me
sufficient
to
overthrow
the
view
which
i
have
taken
with
respect
to
the
very
general
*punct* ,
but
not
invariable
*punct* ,
sterility
of
first
crosses
and
of
hybrids
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
it
is
not
a
special
endowment
*punct* ,
but
is
incidental
on
slowly
acquired
modifications
*punct* ,
more
especially
in
the
reproductive
systems
of
the
forms
which
are
crossed
*punct* .
*break*
hybrids
and
mongrels
compared
*punct* ,

of
their
fertility.
*punct* ,
independently
of
the
question
of
fertility
*punct* ,
the
offspring
of
species
when
crossed
and
of
varieties
when
crossed
may
be
compared
in
several
other
respects
*punct* .
*break*
gartner
*punct* ,
whose
strong
wish
was
to
draw
a
marked
line
of
distinction
between
species
and
varieties
*punct* ,
could
find
very
few
and
*punct* ,
as
it
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
quite
unimportant
differences
between
the
so-called
hybrid
offspring
of
species
*punct* ,
and
the
so-called
mongrel
offspring
of
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
they
agree
most
closely
in
very
many
important
respects
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
here
discuss
this
subject
with
extreme
brevity
*punct* .
*break*
the
most
important
distinction
is
*punct* ,
that
in
the
first
generation
mongrels
are
more
variable
than
hybrids
*punct* ;
but
gartner
admits
that
hybrids
from
species
which
have
long
been
cultivated
are
often
variable
in
the
first
generation
*punct* ;
and
i
have
myself
seen
striking
instances
of
this
fact
*punct* .
*break*
gartner
further
admits
that
hybrids
between
very
closely
allied
species
are
more
variable
than
those
from
very
distinct
species
*punct* ;
and
this
shows
that
the
difference
in
the
degree
of
variability
graduates
away
*punct* .
*break*
when
mongrels
and
the
more
fertile
hybrids
are
propagated
for
several
generations
an
extreme
amount
of
variability
in
their
offspring
is
notorious
*punct* ;
but
some
few
cases
both
of
hybrids
and
mongrels
long
retaining
uniformity
of
character
could
be
given
*punct* .
*break*
the
variability
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
in
the
successive
generations
of
mongrels
is
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
greater
than
in
hybrids
*punct* .
*break*
this
greater
variability
of
mongrels
than
of
hybrids
does
not
seem
to
me
at
all
surprising
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
parents
of
mongrels
are
varieties
*punct* ,
and
mostly
domestic
varieties
*punct* ,
very
few
experiments
having
been
tried
on
natural
varieties
*punct* ,
and
this
implies
in
most
cases
that
there
has
been
recent
variability
*punct* ;
and
therefore
we
might
expect
that
such
variability
would
often
continue
and
be
super-added
to
that
arising
from
the
mere
act
of
crossing
*punct* .
*break*
the
slight
degree
of
variability
in
hybrids
from
the
first
cross
or
in
the
first
generation
*punct* ,
in
contrast
with
their
extreme
variability
in
the
succeeding
generations
*punct* ,
is
a
curious
fact
and
deserves
attention
*punct* .
*break*
for
it
bears
on
and
corroborates
the
view
which
i
have
taken
on
the
cause
of
ordinary
variability
*punct* ;
namely
*punct* ,
that
it
is
due
to
the
reproductive
system
being
eminently
sensitive
to
any
change
in
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
being
thus
often
rendered
either
impotent
or
at
least
incapable
of
its
proper
function
of
producing
offspring
identical
with
the
parent-form
*punct* .
*break*
now
hybrids
in
the
first
generation
are
descended
from
species
*punct* ,
excluding
those
long
cultivated
*punct* ,
which
have
not
had
their
reproductive
systems
in
any
way
affected
*punct* ,
and
they
are
not
variable
*punct* ;
but
hybrids
themselves
have
their
reproductive
systems
seriously
affected
*punct* ,
and
their
descendants
are
highly
variable
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
return
to
our
comparison
of
mongrels
and
hybrids
*punct* :
gartner
states
that
mongrels
are
more
liable
than
hybrids
to
revert
to
either
parent-form
*punct* ;
but
this
*punct* ,
if
it
be
true
*punct* ,
is
certainly
only
a
difference
in
degree
*punct* .
*break*
gartner
further
insists
that
when
any
two
species
*punct* ,
although
most
closely
allied
to
each
other
*punct* ,
are
crossed
with
a
third
species
*punct* ,
the
hybrids
are
widely
different
from
each
other
*punct* ;
whereas
if
two
very
distinct
varieties
of
one
species
are
crossed
with
another
species
*punct* ,
the
hybrids
do
not
differ
much
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
conclusion
*punct* ,
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
*punct* ,
is
founded
on
a
single
experiment
*punct* ;
and
seems
directly
opposed
to
the
results
of
several
experiments
made
by
kolreuter
*punct* .
*break*
these
alone
are
the
unimportant
differences
*punct* ,
which
gartner
is
able
to
point
out
*punct* ,
between
hybrid
and
mongrel
plants
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
the
resemblance
in
mongrels
and
in
hybrids
to
their
respective
parents
*punct* ,
more
especially
in
hybrids
produced
from
nearly
related
species
*punct* ,
follows
according
to
gartner
the
same
laws
*punct* .
*break*
when
two
species
are
crossed
*punct* ,
one
has
sometimes
a
prepotent
power
of
impressing
its
likeness
on
the
hybrid
*punct* ;
and
so
i
believe
it
to
be
with
varieties
of
plants
*punct* .
*break*
with
animals
one
variety
certainly
often
has
this
prepotent
power
over
another
variety
*punct* .
*break*
hybrid
plants
produced
from
a
reciprocal
cross
*punct* ,
generally
resemble
each
other
closely
*punct* ;
and
so
it
is
with
mongrels
from
a
reciprocal
cross
*punct* .
*break*
both
hybrids
and
mongrels
can
be
reduced
to
either
pure
parent-form
*punct* ,
by
repeated
crosses
in
successive
generations
with
either
parent
*punct* .
*break*
these
several
remarks
are
apparently
applicable
to
animals
*punct* ;
but
the
subject
is
here
excessively
complicated
*punct* ,
partly
owing
to
the
existence
of
secondary
sexual
characters
*punct* ;
but
more
especially
owing
to
prepotency
in
transmitting
likeness
running
more
strongly
in
one
sex
than
in
the
other
*punct* ,
both
when
one
species
is
crossed
with
another
*punct* ,
and
when
one
variety
is
crossed
with
another
variety
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
i
think
those
authors
are
right
*punct* ,
who
maintain
that
the
ass
has
a
prepotent
power
over
the
horse
*punct* ,
so
that
both
the
mule
and
the
hinny
more
resemble
the
ass
than
the
horse
*punct* ;
but
that
the
prepotency
runs
more
strongly
in
the
male-ass
than
in
the
female
*punct* ,
so
that
the
mule
*punct* ,
which
is
the
offspring
of
the
male-ass
and
mare
*punct* ,
is
more
like
an
ass
*punct* ,
than
is
the
hinny
*punct* ,
which
is
the
offspring
of
the
female-ass
and
stallion
*punct* .
*break*
much
stress
has
been
laid
by
some
authors
on
the
supposed
fact
*punct* ,
that
mongrel
animals
alone
are
born
closely
like
one
of
their
parents
*punct* ;
but
it
can
be
shown
that
this
does
sometimes
occur
with
hybrids
*punct* ;
yet
i
grant
much
less
frequently
with
hybrids
than
with
mongrels
*punct* .
*break*
looking
to
the
cases
which
i
have
collected
of
cross-bred
animals
closely
resembling
one
parent
*punct* ,
the
resemblances
seem
chiefly
confined
to
characters
almost
monstrous
in
their
nature
*punct* ,
and
which
have
suddenly
appeared
*punct* ,
such
as
albinism
*punct* ,
melanism
*punct* ,
deficiency
of
tail
or
horns
*punct* ,
or
additional
fingers
and
toes
*punct* ;
and
do
not
relate
to
characters
which
have
been
slowly
acquired
by
selection
*punct* .
*break*
consequently
*punct* ,
sudden
reversions
to
the
perfect
character
of
either
parent
would
be
more
likely
to
occur
with
mongrels
*punct* ,
which
are
descended
from
varieties
often
suddenly
produced
and
semi-monstrous
in
character
*punct* ,
than
with
hybrids
*punct* ,
which
are
descended
from
species
slowly
and
naturally
produced
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
whole
i
entirely
agree
with
dr.
prosper
lucas
*punct* ,
who
*punct* ,
after
arranging
an
enormous
body
of
facts
with
respect
to
animals
*punct* ,
comes
to
the
conclusion
*punct* ,
that
the
laws
of
resemblance
of
the
child
to
its
parents
are
the
same
*punct* ,
whether
the
two
parents
differ
much
or
little
from
each
other
*punct* ,
namely
in
the
union
of
individuals
of
the
same
variety
*punct* ,
or
of
different
varieties
*punct* ,
or
of
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
laying
aside
the
question
of
fertility
and
sterility
*punct* ,
in
all
other
respects
there
seems
to
be
a
general
and
close
similarity
in
the
offspring
of
crossed
species
*punct* ,
and
of
crossed
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
look
at
species
as
having
been
specially
created
*punct* ,
and
at
varieties
as
having
been
produced
by
secondary
laws
*punct* ,
this
similarity
would
be
an
astonishing
fact
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
harmonises
perfectly
with
the
view
that
there
is
no
essential
distinction
between
species
and
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
summary
of
chapter
*punct* ,
first
crosses
between
forms
sufficiently
distinct
to
be
ranked
as
species
*punct* ,
and
their
hybrids
*punct* ,
are
very
generally
*punct* ,
but
not
universally
*punct* ,
sterile
*punct* .
*break*
the
sterility
is
of
all
degrees
*punct* ,
and
is
often
so
slight
that
the
two
most
careful
experimentalists
who
have
ever
lived
*punct* ,
have
come
to
diametrically
opposite
conclusions
in
ranking
forms
by
this
test
*punct* .
*break*
the
sterility
is
innately
variable
in
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
and
is
eminently
susceptible
of
favourable
and
unfavourable
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
the
degree
of
sterility
does
not
strictly
follow
systematic
affinity
*punct* ,
but
is
governed
by
several
curious
and
complex
laws
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
generally
different
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
widely
different
*punct* ,
in
reciprocal
crosses
between
the
same
two
species
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
always
equal
in
degree
in
a
first
cross
and
in
the
hybrid
produced
from
this
cross
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
same
manner
as
in
grafting
trees
*punct* ,
the
capacity
of
one
species
or
variety
to
take
on
another
*punct* ,
is
incidental
on
generally
unknown
differences
in
their
vegetative
systems
*punct* ,
so
in
crossing
*punct* ,
the
greater
or
less
facility
of
one
species
to
unite
with
another
*punct* ,
is
incidental
on
unknown
differences
in
their
reproductive
systems
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
more
reason
to
think
that
species
have
been
specially
endowed
with
various
degrees
of
sterility
to
prevent
them
crossing
and
blending
in
nature
*punct* ,
than
to
think
that
trees
have
been
specially
endowed
with
various
and
somewhat
analogous
degrees
of
difficulty
in
being
grafted
together
in
order
to
prevent
them
becoming
inarched
in
our
forests
*punct* .
*break*
the
sterility
of
first
crosses
between
pure
species
*punct* ,
which
have
their
reproductive
systems
perfect
*punct* ,
seems
to
depend
on
several
circumstances
*punct* ;
in
some
cases
largely
on
the
early
death
of
the
embryo
*punct* .
*break*
the
sterility
of
hybrids
*punct* ,
which
have
their
reproductive
systems
imperfect
*punct* ,
and
which
have
had
this
system
and
their
whole
organisation
disturbed
by
being
compounded
of
two
distinct
species
*punct* ,
seems
closely
allied
to
that
sterility
which
so
frequently
affects
pure
species
*punct* ,
when
their
natural
conditions
of
life
have
been
disturbed
*punct* .
*break*
this
view
is
supported
by
a
parallelism
of
another
kind;
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
the
crossing
of
forms
only
slightly
different
is
favourable
to
the
vigour
and
fertility
of
their
offspring
*punct* ;
and
that
slight
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
are
apparently
favourable
to
the
vigour
and
fertility
of
all
organic
beings
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
degree
of
difficulty
in
uniting
two
species
*punct* ,
and
the
degree
of
sterility
of
their
hybrid-offspring
should
generally
correspond
*punct* ,
though
due
to
distinct
causes
*punct* ;
for
both
depend
on
the
amount
of
difference
of
some
kind
between
the
species
which
are
crossed
*punct* .
*break*
nor
is
it
surprising
that
the
facility
of
effecting
a
first
cross
*punct* ,
the
fertility
of
the
hybrids
produced
*punct* ,
and
the
capacity
of
being
grafted
together
*punct* ,
though
this
latter
capacity
evidently
depends
on
widely
different
circumstances
*punct* ,
should
all
run
*punct* ,
to
a
certain
extent
*punct* ,
parallel
with
the
systematic
affinity
of
the
forms
which
are
subjected
to
experiment
*punct* ;
for
systematic
affinity
attempts
to
express
all
kinds
of
resemblance
between
all
species
*punct* .
*break*
first
crosses
between
forms
known
to
be
varieties
*punct* ,
or
sufficiently
alike
to
be
considered
as
varieties
*punct* ,
and
their
mongrel
offspring
*punct* ,
are
very
generally
*punct* ,
but
not
quite
universally
*punct* ,
fertile
*punct* .
*break*
nor
is
this
nearly
general
and
perfect
fertility
surprising
*punct* ,
when
we
remember
how
liable
we
are
to
argue
in
a
circle
with
respect
to
varieties
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ;
and
when
we
remember
that
the
greater
number
of
varieties
have
been
produced
under
domestication
by
the
selection
of
mere
external
differences
*punct* ,
and
not
of
differences
in
the
reproductive
system
*punct* .
*break*
in
all
other
respects
*punct* ,
excluding
fertility
*punct* ,
there
is
a
close
general
resemblance
between
hybrids
and
mongrels
*punct* .
*break*
finally
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
the
facts
briefly
given
in
this
chapter
do
not
seem
to
me
opposed
to
*punct* ,
but
even
rather
to
support
the
view
*punct* ,
that
there
is
no
fundamental
distinction
between
species
and
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
sixth
chapter
i
enumerated
the
chief
objections
which
might
be
justly
urged
against
the
views
maintained
in
this
volume
*punct* .
*break*
most
of
them
have
now
been
discussed
*punct* .
*break*
one
*punct* ,
namely
the
distinctness
of
specific
forms
*punct* ,
and
their
not
being
blended
together
by
innumerable
transitional
links
*punct* ,
is
a
very
obvious
difficulty
*punct* .
*break*
i
assigned
reasons
why
such
links
do
not
commonly
occur
at
the
present
day
*punct* ,
under
the
circumstances
apparently
most
favourable
for
their
presence
*punct* ,
namely
on
an
extensive
and
continuous
area
with
graduated
physical
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
i
endeavoured
to
show
*punct* ,
that
the
life
of
each
species
depends
in
a
more
important
manner
on
the
presence
of
other
already
defined
organic
forms
*punct* ,
than
on
climate
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
that
the
really
governing
conditions
of
life
do
not
graduate
away
quite
insensibly
like
heat
or
moisture
*punct* .
*break*
i
endeavoured
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
to
show
that
intermediate
varieties
*punct* ,
from
existing
in
lesser
numbers
than
the
forms
which
they
connect
*punct* ,
will
generally
be
beaten
out
and
exterminated
during
the
course
of
further
modification
and
improvement
*punct* .
*break*
the
main
cause
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
of
innumerable
intermediate
links
not
now
occurring
everywhere
throughout
nature
depends
on
the
very
process
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
through
which
new
varieties
continually
take
the
places
of
and
exterminate
their
parent-forms
*punct* .
*break*
but
just
in
proportion
as
this
process
of
extermination
has
acted
on
an
enormous
scale
*punct* ,
so
must
the
number
of
intermediate
varieties
*punct* ,
which
have
formerly
existed
on
the
earth
*punct* ,
be
truly
enormous
*punct* .
*break*
why
then
is
not
every
geological
formation
and
every
stratum
full
of
such
intermediate
links
*punct* ?
*break*
geology
assuredly
does
not
reveal
any
such
finely
graduated
organic
chain
*punct* ;
and
this
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
is
the
most
obvious
and
gravest
objection
which
can
be
urged
against
my
theory
*punct* .
*break*
the
explanation
lies
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
in
the
extreme
imperfection
of
the
geological
record
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
first
place
it
should
always
be
borne
in
mind
what
sort
of
intermediate
forms
must
*punct* ,
on
my
theory
*punct* ,
have
formerly
existed
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
found
it
difficult
*punct* ,
when
looking
at
any
two
species
*punct* ,
to
avoid
picturing
to
myself
*punct* ,
forms
directly
intermediate
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
is
a
wholly
false
view
*punct* ;
we
should
always
look
for
forms
intermediate
between
each
species
and
a
common
but
unknown
progenitor
*punct* ;
and
the
progenitor
will
generally
have
differed
in
some
respects
from
all
its
modified
descendants
*punct* .
*break*
to
give
a
simple
illustration
*punct* :
the
fantail
and
pouter
pigeons
have
both
descended
from
the
rock-pigeon
*punct* ;
if
we
possessed
all
the
intermediate
varieties
which
have
ever
existed
*punct* ,
we
should
have
an
extremely
close
series
between
both
and
the
rock-pigeon
*punct* ;
but
we
should
have
no
varieties
directly
intermediate
between
the
fantail
and
pouter
*punct* ;
none
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
combining
a
tail
somewhat
expanded
with
a
crop
somewhat
enlarged
*punct* ,
the
characteristic
features
of
these
two
breeds
*punct* .
*break*
so
with
natural
species
*punct* ,
if
we
look
to
forms
very
distinct
*punct* ,
for
instance
to
the
horse
and
tapir
*punct* ,
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
links
ever
existed
directly
intermediate
between
them
*punct* ,
but
between
each
and
an
unknown
common
parent
*punct* .
*break*
the
common
parent
will
have
had
in
its
whole
organisation
much
general
resemblance
to
the
tapir
and
to
the
horse
*punct* ;
but
in
some
points
of
structure
may
have
differed
considerably
from
both
*punct* ,
even
perhaps
more
than
they
differ
from
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
hence
in
all
such
cases
*punct* ,
we
should
be
unable
to
recognise
the
parent-form
of
any
two
or
more
species
*punct* ,
even
if
we
closely
compared
the
structure
of
the
parent
with
that
of
its
modified
descendants
*punct* ,
unless
at
the
same
time
we
had
a
nearly
perfect
chain
of
the
intermediate
links
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
just
possible
by
my
theory
*punct* ,
that
one
of
two
living
forms
might
have
descended
from
the
other
*punct* ;
for
instance
*punct* ,
a
horse
from
a
tapir
*punct* ;
and
in
this

direct
intermediate
links
will
have
existed
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
but
such
a
case
would
imply
that
one
form
had
remained
for
a
very
long
period
unaltered
*punct* ,
whilst
its
descendants
had
undergone
a
vast
amount
of
change
*punct* ;
and
the
principle
of
competition
between
organism
and
organism
*punct* ,
between
child
and
parent
*punct* ,
will
render
this
a
very
rare
event
*punct* ;
for
in
all
cases
the
new
and
improved
forms
of
life
will
tend
to
supplant
the
old
and
unimproved
forms
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
theory
of
natural
selection
all
living
species
have
been
connected
with
the
parent-species
of
each
genus
*punct* ,
by
differences
not
greater
than
we
see
between
the
varieties
of
the

species
at
the
present
day
*punct* ;
and
these
parent-species
*punct* ,
now
generally
extinct

have
in
their
turn
been
similarly
connected
with
more
ancient
species

and
so
on
backwards

always
converging
to
the
common
ancestor
of
each
great
class

*break*
so
that
the
number
of
intermediate
and
transitional
links
*punct* ,
between
all
living
and
extinct
species
*punct* ,
must
have
been
inconceivably
great
*punct* .
*break*

assuredly
*punct* ,
if
this
theory
be
true
*punct* ,
such
have
lived
upon
this
earth

*break*
on
the
lapse

*punct* ,
independently
of
our
not
finding
fossil
remains
of
such
infinitely
numerous
connecting
links
*punct* ,
it
may
be
objected
*punct* ,
that
time
will
not
have
sufficed
for
so
great
an
amount
of
organic
change
*punct* ,
all
changes
having
been
effected
very
slowly
through

*break*
it
is
hardly
possible
for
me
even
to
recall
to
the
reader
*punct* ,
who
may
not
be
a
practical
geologist
*punct* ,
the
facts
leading
the
mind
feebly
to
comprehend
the

*break*
he
who
can
read
sir
charles
lyell's
grand
work
on
the
principles
of
geology
*punct* ,
which
the
future
historian
will
recognise
as
having
produced
a
revolution
in
natural
science
*punct* ,
yet
does
not
admit
how
incomprehensibly
vast
have
been
the
past
periods
of
time
*punct* ,
may
at
once
close
this
volume
*punct* .
*break*
not
that
it
suffices
to
study
the
principles
of
geology
*punct* ,
or
to
read
special
treatises
by
different
observers
on
separate
formations
*punct* ,
and
to
mark
how
each
author
attempts
to
give
an
inadequate
idea
of
the
duration
of
each
formation
or
even
each
stratum
*punct* .
*break*
a
man
must
for
years
examine
for
himself
great
piles
of
superimposed
strata
*punct* ,
and
watch
the
sea
at
work
grinding
down
old
rocks
and
making
fresh
sediment
*punct* ,
before
he
can
hope
to
comprehend
anything
of
the
lapse
of
time
*punct* ,
the
monuments
of
which
we
see
around
us
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
good
to
wander
along
lines
of
sea-coast
*punct* ,
when
formed
of
moderately
hard
rocks
*punct* ,
and
mark
the
process
of
degradation
*punct* .
*break*
the
tides
in
most
cases
reach
the
cliffs
only
for
a
short
time
twice
a
day
*punct* ,
and
the
waves
eat
into
them
only
when
they
are
charged
with
sand
or
pebbles
*punct* ;
for
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
pure
water
can
effect
little
or
nothing
in
wearing
away
rock
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
the
base
of
the
cliff
is
undermined
*punct* ,
huge
fragments
fall
down
*punct* ,
and
these
remaining
fixed
*punct* ,
have
to
be
worn
away
*punct* ,
atom
by
atom
*punct* ,
until
reduced
in
size
they
can
be
rolled
about
by
the
waves
*punct* ,
and
then
are
more
quickly
ground
into
pebbles
*punct* ,
sand
*punct* ,
or
mud
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
often
do
we
see
along
the
bases
of
retreating
cliffs
rounded
boulders
*punct* ,
all
thickly
clothed
by
marine
productions
*punct* ,
showing
how
little
they
are
abraded
and
how
seldom
they
are
rolled
about
*punct* !
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
if
we
follow
for
a
few
miles
any
line
of
rocky
cliff
*punct* ,
which
is
undergoing
degradation
*punct* ,
we
find
that
it
is
only
here
and
there
*punct* ,
along
a
short
length
or
round
a
promontory
*punct* ,
that
the
cliffs
are
at
the
present
time
suffering
*punct* .
*break*
the
appearance
of
the
surface
and
the
vegetation
show
that
elsewhere
years
have
elapsed
since
the
waters
washed
their
base
*punct* .
*break*
he
who
most
closely
studies
the
action
of
the
sea
on
our
shores
*punct* ,
will
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
be
most
deeply
impressed
with
the
slowness
with
which
rocky
coasts
are
worn
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
observations
on
this
head
by
hugh
miller
*punct* ,
and
by
that
excellent
observer
mr.
smith
of
jordan
hill
*punct* ,
are
most
impressive
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
mind
thus
impressed
*punct* ,
let
any
one
examine
beds
of
conglomerate
many
thousand
feet
in
thickness
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
though
probably
formed
at
a
quicker
rate
than
many
other
deposits
*punct* ,
yet
*punct* ,
from
being
formed
of
worn
and
rounded
pebbles
*punct* ,
each
of
which
bears
the
stamp
of
time
*punct* ,
are
good
to
show
how
slowly
the
mass
has
been
accumulated
*punct* .
*break*
let
him
remember
lyell's
profound
remark
*punct* ,
that
the
thickness
and
extent
of
sedimentary
formations
are
the
result
and
measure
of
the
degradation
which
the
earth's
crust
has
elsewhere
suffered
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
an
amount
of
degradation
is
implied
by
the
sedimentary
deposits
of
many
countries
*punct* !
*break*
some
of
these
formations
*punct* ,
which
are
represented
in
england
by
thin
beds
*punct* ,
are
thousands
of
feet
in
thickness
on
the
continent
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
between
each
successive
formation
*punct* ,
we
have
*punct* ,
in
the
opinion
of
most
geologists
*punct* ,
enormously
long
blank
periods
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
the
lofty
pile
of
sedimentary
rocks
in
britain
*punct* ,
gives
but
an
inadequate
idea
of
the
time
which
has
elapsed
during
their
accumulation
*punct* ;
yet
what
time
this
must
have
consumed
*punct* !
*break*
good
observers
have
estimated
that
sediment
is
deposited
by
the
great
mississippi
river
at
the
rate
of
only
600
feet
in
a
hundred
thousand
years
*punct* .
*break*
this
estimate
may
be
quite
erroneous
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
considering
over
what
wide
spaces
very
fine
sediment
is
transported
by
the
currents
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
the
process
of
accumulation
in
any
one
area
must
be
extremely
slow
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
amount
of
denudation
which
the
strata
have
in
many
places
suffered
*punct* ,
independently
of
the
rate
of
accumulation
of
the
degraded
matter
*punct* ,
probably
offers
the
best
evidence
of
the
lapse
of
time
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
having
been
much
struck
with
the
evidence
of
denudation
*punct* ,
when
viewing
volcanic
islands
*punct* ,
which
have
been
worn
by
the
waves
and
pared
all
round
into
perpendicular
cliffs
of
one
or
two
thousand
feet
in
height
*punct* ;
for
the
gentle
slope
of
the
lava-streams
*punct* ,
due
to
their
formerly
liquid
state
*punct* ,
showed
at
a
glance
how
far
the
hard
*punct* ,
rocky
beds
had
once
extended
into
the
open
ocean
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
story
is
still
more
plainly
told
by
faults,
*punct* ,
those
great
cracks
along
which
the
strata
have
been
upheaved
on
one
side
*punct* ,
or
thrown
down
on
the
other
*punct* ,
to
the
height
or
depth
of
thousands
of
feet
*punct* ;
for
since
the
crust
cracked
*punct* ,
the
surface
of
the
land
has
been
so
completely
planed
down
by
the
action
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
that
no
trace
of
these
vast
dislocations
is
externally
visible
*punct* .
*break*
the
craven
fault
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
extends
for
upwards
of
30
miles
*punct* ,
and
along
this
line
the
vertical
displacement
of
the
strata
has
varied
from
600
to
3000
feet
*punct* .
*break*
ramsay
has
published
an
account
of
a
downthrow
in
anglesea
of
2300
feet
*punct* ;
and
he
informs
me
that
he
fully
believes
there
is
one
in
merionethshire
of
12,000
feet
*punct* ;
yet
in
these
cases
there
is
nothing
on
the
surface
to
show
such
prodigious
movements
*punct* ;
the
pile
of
rocks
on
the
one
or
other
side
having
been
smoothly
swept
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
consideration
of
these
facts
impresses
my
mind
almost
in
the
same
manner
as
does
the
vain
endeavour
to
grapple
with
the
idea
of
eternity
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
tempted
to
give
one
other
case
*punct* ,
the
well-known
one
of
the
denudation
of
the
weald
*punct* .
*break*
though
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
denudation
of
the
weald
has
been
a
mere
trifle
*punct* ,
in
comparison
with
that
which
has
removed
masses
of
our
palaeozoic
strata
*punct* ,
in
parts
ten
thousand
feet
in
thickness
*punct* ,
as
shown
in
prof
*punct* .
*break*
ramsay's
masterly
memoir
on
this
subject
*punct* .
*break*
yet
it
is
an
admirable
lesson
to
stand
on
the
north
downs
and
to
look
at
the
distant
south
downs
*punct* ;
for
*punct* ,
remembering
that
at
no
great
distance
to
the
west
the
northern
and
southern
escarpments
meet
and
close
*punct* ,
one
can
safely
picture
to
oneself
the
great
dome
of
rocks
which
must
have
covered
up
the
weald
within
so
limited
a
period
as
since
the
latter
part
of
the
chalk
formation
*punct* .
*break*
the
distance
from
the
northern
to
the
southern
downs
is
about
22
miles
*punct* ,
and
the
thickness
of
the
several
formations
is
on
an
average
about
1100
feet
*punct* ,
as
i
am
informed
by
prof
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
*punct* ,
as
some
geologists
suppose
*punct* ,
a
range
of
older
rocks
underlies
the
weald
*punct* ,
on
the
flanks
of
which
the
overlying
sedimentary
deposits
might
have
accumulated
in
thinner
masses
than
elsewhere
*punct* ,
the
above
estimate
would
be
erroneous
*punct* ;
but
this
source
of
doubt
probably
would
not
greatly
affect
the
estimate
as
applied
to
the
western
extremity
of
the
district
*punct* .
*break*
if
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
we
knew
the
rate
at
which
the
sea
commonly
wears
away
a
line
of
cliff
of
any
given
height
*punct* ,
we
could
measure
the
time
requisite
to
have
denuded
the
weald
*punct* .
*break*
this
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
cannot
be
done
*punct* ;
but
we
may
*punct* ,
in
order
to
form
some
crude
notion
on
the
subject
*punct* ,
assume
that
the
sea
would
eat
into
cliffs
500
feet
in
height
at
the
rate
of
one
inch
in
a
century
*punct* .
*break*
this
will
at
first
appear
much
too
small
an
allowance
*punct* ;
but
it
is
the
same
as
if
we
were
to
assume
a
cliff
one
yard
in
height
to
be
eaten
back
along
a
whole
line
of
coast
at
the
rate
of
one
yard
in
nearly
every
twenty-two
years
*punct* .
*break*
i
doubt
whether
any
rock
*punct* ,
even
as
soft
as
chalk
*punct* ,
would
yield
at
this
rate
excepting
on
the
most
exposed
coasts
*punct* ;
though
no
doubt
the
degradation
of
a
lofty
cliff
would
be
more
rapid
from
the
breakage
of
the
fallen
fragments
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
i
do
not
believe
that
any
line
of
coast
*punct* ,
ten
or
twenty
miles
in
length
*punct* ,
ever
suffers
degradation
at
the
same
time
along
its
whole
indented
length
*punct* ;
and
we
must
remember
that
almost
all
strata
contain
harder
layers
or
nodules
*punct* ,
which
from
long
resisting
attrition
form
a
breakwater
at
the
base
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
under
ordinary
circumstances
*punct* ,
i
conclude
that
for
a
cliff
500
feet
in
height
*punct* ,
a
denudation
of
one
inch
per
century
for
the
whole
length
would
be
an
ample
allowance
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
rate
*punct* ,
on
the
above
data
*punct* ,
the
denudation
of
the
weald
must
have
required
306,662,400
years
*punct* ;
or
say
three
hundred
million
years
*punct* .
*break*
the
action
of
fresh
water
on
the
gently
inclined
wealden
district
*punct* ,
when
upraised
*punct* ,
could
hardly
have
been
great
*punct* ,
but
it
would
somewhat
reduce
the
above
estimate
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
during
oscillations
of
level
*punct* ,
which
we
know
this
area
has
undergone
*punct* ,
the
surface
may
have
existed
for
millions
of
years
as
land
*punct* ,
and
thus
have
escaped
the
action
of
the
sea
*punct* :
when
deeply
submerged
for
perhaps
equally
long
periods
*punct* ,
it
would
*punct* ,
likewise
*punct* ,
have
escaped
the
action
of
the
coast-waves
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
in
all
probability
a
far
longer
period
than
300
million
years
has
elapsed
since
the
latter
part
of
the
secondary
period
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
made
these
few
remarks
because
it
is
highly
important
for
us
to
gain
some
notion
*punct* ,
however
imperfect
*punct* ,
of
the
lapse
of
years
*punct* .
*break*
during
each
of
these
years
*punct* ,
over
the
whole
world
*punct* ,
the
land
and
the
water
has
been
peopled
by
hosts
of
living
forms
*punct* .
*break*
what
an
infinite
number
of
generations
*punct* ,
which
the
mind
cannot
grasp
*punct* ,
must
have
succeeded
each
other
in
the
long
roll
of

now
turn
to
our
richest
geological
museums

what
a
paltry
display
we
behold

on
the
poorness
of
our
palaeontological
collections.
*punct* ,
that
our
palaeontological
collections
are
very
imperfect

admitted
by

*break*
the
remark
of
that
admirable
palaeontologist
*punct* ,
the
late
edward
forbes
*punct* ,
should
not
be
forgotten
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
numbers
of
our
fossil
species
are
known
and
named
from
single
and
often
broken
specimens
*punct* ,
or
from
a
few
specimens
collected
on
some
one
spot
*punct* .
*break*
only
a
small
portion
of
the
surface
of
the
earth

been
geologically
explored
*punct* ,
and
no
part
with
sufficient
care
*punct* ,
as
the
important
discoveries
made
every

in
europe
prove
*punct* .
*break*
no
organism
wholly
soft

be
preserved

shells

bones
will
decay

disappear
when
left

accumulating

*break*
i
believe
we
are
continually
taking
a
most
erroneous
view
*punct* ,
when
we
tacitly
admit
to
ourselves
that
sediment
is
being
deposited
over
nearly
the
whole
bed
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
at
a
rate
sufficiently
quick
to
embed
and
preserve
fossil
remains

*break*
throughout

enormously
large
proportion

another

later
formation
*punct* ,
without
the
underlying
bed
having
suffered
in
the
interval
any
wear

tear
*punct* ,
seem
explicable

the
bottom

*break*
the

generally
be
dissolved

the

the

great
piles
of
sediment

charged
with

had

*break*
and
if
in

hardly
any
idea
can
be
formed
of
the
length
of
time
which
has

the
consecutive

we
may
infer
that
this
could

be

accords
with
the
belief
of
vast
intervals
of
time
having
elapsed
between

but
we
can
*punct* ,
i
think

see
why
the
geological
formations
of
each
region
are
almost
invariably
intermittent
*punct* ;

*break*
scarcely
any
fact
struck
me
more
when
examining

hundred
miles
of
the
south
american
coasts
*punct* ,
which
have
been
upraised
several
hundred
feet
within
the
recent

any

sufficiently
extensive

*break*
along
the
whole
west
coast
*punct* ,
which
is
inhabited
by
a
peculiar
marine
fauna
*punct* ,
tertiary
beds
are
so
scantily
developed
*punct* ,
that
no
record
of
several
successive
and
peculiar
marine
faunas
will
probably
be
preserved
to
a
distant
age
*punct* .
*break*
a
little
reflection
will
explain
why
along
the
rising
coast
of
the
western
side
of
south
america
*punct* ,
no
extensive
formations
with
recent
or
tertiary
remains
can
anywhere
be
found
*punct* ,
though
the
supply
of
sediment
must
for
ages
have
been
great
*punct* ,
from
the
enormous
degradation
of
the
coast-rocks
and
from
muddy
streams
entering
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
the
explanation
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
that
the
littoral
and
sub-littoral
deposits
are
continually
worn
away
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
they
are
brought
up
by
the
slow
and
gradual
rising
of
the
land
within
the
grinding
action
of
the
coast-waves
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
safely
conclude
that
sediment
must
be
accumulated
in
extremely
thick
*punct* ,
solid
*punct* ,
or
extensive
masses
*punct* ,
in
order
to
withstand
the
incessant
action
of
the
waves
*punct* ,
when
first
upraised
and
during
subsequent
oscillations
of
level
*punct* .
*break*
forbes
*punct* ,
we
may
conclude
that
the
bottom
will
be
inhabited
by
extremely
few
animals
*punct* ,
and
the
mass
when
upraised
will
give
a
most
imperfect
record
of
the
forms
of
life
which
then
existed
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
sediment
may
be
accumulated
to
any
thickness
and
extent
over
a
shallow
bottom
*punct* ,
if
it
continue
slowly
to
subside
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
latter
case
*punct* ,
as
long
as
the
rate
of
subsidence
and
supply
of
sediment
nearly
balance
each
other
*punct* ,
the
sea
will
remain
shallow
and
favourable
for
life
*punct* ,
and
thus
a
fossiliferous
formation
thick
enough
*punct* ,
when
upraised
*punct* ,
to
resist
any
amount
of
degradation
*punct* ,
may
be
formed
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
convinced
that
all
our
ancient
formations
*punct* ,
which
are
rich
in
fossils
*punct* ,
have
thus
been
formed
during
subsidence
*punct* .
*break*
since
publishing
my
views
on
this
subject
in
1845
*punct* ,
i
have
watched
the
progress
of
geology
*punct* ,
and
have
been
surprised
to
note
how
author
after
author
*punct* ,
in
treating
of
this
or
that
great
formation
*punct* ,
has
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
accumulated
during
subsidence
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
add
*punct* ,
that
the
only
ancient
tertiary
formation
on
the
west
coast
of
south
america
*punct* ,
which
has
been
bulky
enough
to
resist
such
degradation
as
it
has
as
yet
suffered
*punct* ,
but
which
will
hardly
last
to
a
distant
geological
age
*punct* ,
was
certainly
deposited
during
a
downward
oscillation
of
level
*punct* ,
and
thus
gained
considerable
thickness
*punct* .
*break*
all
geological
facts
tell
us
plainly
that
each
area
has
undergone
numerous
slow
oscillations
of
level
*punct* ,
and
apparently
these
oscillations
have
affected
wide
spaces
*punct* .
*break*
consequently
formations
rich
in
fossils
and
sufficiently
thick
and
extensive
to
resist
subsequent
degradation
*punct* ,
may
have
been
formed
over
wide
spaces
during
periods
of
subsidence
*punct* ,
but
only
where
the
supply
of
sediment
was
sufficient
to
keep
the
sea
shallow
and
to
embed
and
preserve
the
remains
before
they
had
time
to
decay
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
as
long
as
the
bed
of
the
sea
remained
stationary
*punct* ,
thick
deposits
could
not
have
been
accumulated
in
the
shallow
parts
*punct* ,
which
are
the
most
favourable
to
life
*punct* .
*break*
still
less
could
this
have
happened
during
the
alternate
periods
of
elevation
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
to
speak
more
accurately
*punct* ,
the
beds
which
were
then
accumulated
will
have
been
destroyed
by
being
upraised
and
brought
within
the
limits
of
the
coast-action
*punct* .
*break*
thus
the
geological
record
will
almost
necessarily
be
rendered
intermittent
*punct* .
*break*
forbes
independently
arrived
at
a
similar
conclusion
*punct* .
*break*
one
remark
is
here
worth
a
passing
notice
*punct* .
*break*
during
periods
of
elevation
the
area
of
the
land
and
of
the
adjoining
shoal
parts
of
the
sea
will
be
increased
*punct* ,
and
new
stations
will
often
be
formed;
*punct* ,
all
circumstances
most
favourable
*punct* ,
as
previously
explained
*punct* ,
for
the
formation
of
new
varieties
and
species
*punct* ;
but
during
such
periods
there
will
generally
be
a
blank
in
the
geological
record
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
during
subsidence
*punct* ,
the
inhabited
area
and
number
of
inhabitants
will
decrease
*punct* ,
excepting
the
productions
on
the
shores
of
a
continent
when
first
broken
up
into
an
archipelago
*punct* ,
and
consequently
during
subsidence
*punct* ,
though
there
will
be
much
extinction
*punct* ,
fewer
new
varieties
or
species
will
be
formed
*punct* ;
and
it
is
during
these
very
periods
of
subsidence
*punct* ,
that
our
great
deposits
rich
in
fossils
have
been
accumulated
*punct* .
*break*
nature
may
almost
be
said
to
have
guarded
against
the
frequent
discovery
of
her
transitional
or
linking
forms
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
foregoing
considerations
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
the
geological
record
*punct* ,
viewed
as
a
whole
*punct* ,
is
extremely
imperfect
*punct* ;
but
if
we
confine
our
attention
to
any
one
formation
*punct* ,
it
becomes
more
difficult
to
understand
*punct* ,
why
we
do
not
therein
find
closely
graduated
varieties
between
the
allied
species
which
lived
at
its
commencement
and
at
its
close
*punct* .
*break*
some
cases
are
on
record
of
the
same
species
presenting
distinct
varieties
in
the
upper
and
lower
parts
of
the
same
formation
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
as
they
are
rare
*punct* ,
they
may
be
here
passed
over
*punct* .
*break*
although
each
formation
has
indisputably
required
a
vast
number
of
years
for
its
deposition
*punct* ,
i
can
see
several
reasons
why
each
should
not
include
a
graduated
series
of
links
between
the
species
which
then
lived
*punct* ;
but
i
can
by
no
means
pretend
to
assign
due
proportional
weight
to
the
following
considerations
*punct* .
*break*
although
each
formation
may
mark
a
very
long
lapse
of
years
*punct* ,
each
perhaps
is
short
compared
with
the
period
requisite
to
change
one
species
into
another
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
aware
that
two
palaeontologists
*punct* ,
whose
opinions
are
worthy
of
much
deference
*punct* ,
namely
bronn
and
woodward
*punct* ,
have
concluded
that
the
average
duration
of
each
formation
is
twice
or
thrice
as
long
as
the
average
duration
of
specific
forms
*punct* .
*break*
but
insuperable
difficulties
*punct* ,
as
it
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
prevent
us
coming
to
any
just
conclusion
on
this
head
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
see
a
species
first
appearing
in
the
middle
of
any
formation
*punct* ,
it
would
be
rash
in
the
extreme
to
infer
that
it
had
not
elsewhere
previously
existed
*punct* .
*break*
so
again
when
we
find
a
species
disappearing
before
the
uppermost
layers
have
been
deposited
*punct* ,
it
would
be
equally
rash
to
suppose
that
it
then
became
wholly
extinct
*punct* .
*break*
we
forget
how
small
the
area
of
europe
is
compared
with
the
rest
of
the
world
*punct* ;
nor
have
the
several
stages
of
the
same
formation
throughout
europe
been
correlated
with
perfect
accuracy
*punct* .
*break*
with
marine
animals
of
all
kinds
*punct* ,
we
may
safely
infer
a
large
amount
of
migration
during
climatal
and
other
changes
*punct* ;
and
when
we
see
a
species
first
appearing
in
any
formation
*punct* ,
the
probability
is
that
it
only
then
first
immigrated
into
that
area
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
well
known
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
that
several
species
appeared
somewhat
earlier
in
the
palaeozoic
beds
of
north
america
than
in
those
of
europe
*punct* ;
time
having
apparently
been
required
for
their
migration
from
the
american
to
the
european
seas
*punct* .
*break*
in
examining
the
latest
deposits
of
various
quarters
of
the
world
*punct* ,
it
has
everywhere
been
noted
*punct* ,
that
some
few
still
existing
species
are
common
in
the
deposit
*punct* ,
but
have
become
extinct
in
the
immediately
surrounding
sea
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
conversely
*punct* ,
that
some
are
now
abundant
in
the
neighbouring
sea
*punct* ,
but
are
rare
or
absent
in
this
particular
deposit
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
an
excellent
lesson
to
reflect
on
the
ascertained
amount
of
migration
of
the
inhabitants
of
europe
during
the
glacial
period
*punct* ,
which
forms
only
a
part
of
one
whole
geological
period
*punct* ;
and
likewise
to
reflect
on
the
great
changes
of
level
*punct* ,
on
the
inordinately
great
change
of
climate
*punct* ,
on
the
prodigious
lapse
of
time
*punct* ,
all
included
within
this
same
glacial
period
*punct* .
*break*
yet
it
may
be
doubted
whether
in
any
quarter
of
the
world
*punct* ,
sedimentary
deposits
*punct* ,
including
fossil
remains
*punct* ,
have
gone
on
accumulating
within
the
same
area
during
the
whole
of
this
period
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
probable
that
sediment
was
deposited
during
the
whole
of
the
glacial
period
near
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
*punct* ,
within
that
limit
of
depth
at
which
marine
animals
can
flourish
*punct* ;
for
we
know
what
vast
geographical
changes
occurred
in
other
parts
of
america
during
this
space
of
time
*punct* .
*break*
when
such
beds
as
were
deposited
in
shallow
water
near
the
mouth
of
the
mississippi
during
some
part
of
the
glacial
period
shall
have
been
upraised
*punct* ,
organic
remains
will
probably
first
appear
and
disappear
at
different
levels
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
migration
of
species
and
to
geographical
changes
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
the
distant
future
*punct* ,
a
geologist
examining
these
beds
*punct* ,
might
be
tempted
to
conclude
that
the
average
duration
of
life
of
the
embedded
fossils
had
been
less
than
that
of
the
glacial
period
*punct* ,
instead
of
having
been
really
far
greater
*punct* ,
that
is
extending
from
before
the
glacial
epoch
to
the
present
day
*punct* .
*break*
in
order
to
get
a
perfect
gradation
between
two
forms
in
the
upper
and
lower
parts
of
the
same
formation
*punct* ,
the
deposit
must
have
gone
on
accumulating
for
a
very
long
period
*punct* ,
in
order
to
have
given
sufficient
time
for
the
slow
process
of
variation
*punct* ;
hence
the
deposit
will
generally
have
to
be
a
very
thick
one
*punct* ;
and
the
species
undergoing
modification
will
have
had
to
live
on
the
same
area
throughout
this
whole
time
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
have
seen
that
a
thick
fossiliferous
formation
can
only
be
accumulated
during
a
period
of
subsidence
*punct* ;
and
to
keep
the
depth
approximately
the
same
*punct* ,
which
is
necessary
in
order
to
enable
the
same
species
to
live
on
the
same
space
*punct* ,
the
supply
of
sediment
must
nearly
have
counterbalanced
the
amount
of
subsidence
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
same
movement
of
subsidence
will
often
tend
to
sink
the
area
whence
the
sediment
is
derived
*punct* ,
and
thus
diminish
the
supply
whilst
the
downward
movement
continues
*punct* .
*break*
in
fact
*punct* ,
this
nearly
exact
balancing
between
the
supply
of
sediment
and
the
amount
of
subsidence
is
probably
a
rare
contingency
*punct* ;
for
it
has
been
observed
by
more
than
one
palaeontologist
*punct* ,
that
very
thick
deposits
are
usually
barren
of
organic
remains
*punct* ,
except
near
their
upper
or
lower
limits
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
seem
that
each
separate
formation
*punct* ,
like
the
whole
pile
of
formations
in
any
country
*punct* ,
has
generally
been
intermittent
in
its
accumulation
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
see
*punct* ,
as
is
so
often
the
case
*punct* ,
a
formation
composed
of
beds
of
different
mineralogical
composition
*punct* ,
we
may
reasonably
suspect
that
the
process
of
deposition
has
been
much
interrupted
*punct* ,
as
a
change
in
the
currents
of
the
sea
and
a
supply
of
sediment
of
a
different
nature
will
generally
have
been
due
to
geographical
changes
requiring
much
time
*punct* .
*break*
nor
will
the
closest
inspection
of
a
formation
give
any
idea
of
the
time
which
its
deposition
has
consumed
*punct* .
*break*
many
instances
could
be
given
of
beds
only
a
few
feet
in
thickness
*punct* ,
representing
formations
*punct* ,
elsewhere
thousands
of
feet
in
thickness
*punct* ,
and
which
must
have
required
an
enormous
period
for
their
accumulation
*punct* ;
yet
no
one
ignorant
of
this
fact
would
have
suspected
the
vast
lapse
of
time
represented
by
the
thinner
formation
*punct* .
*break*
many
cases
could
be
given
of
the
lower
beds
of
a
formation
having
been
upraised
*punct* ,
denuded
*punct* ,
submerged
*punct* ,
and
then
re-covered
by
the
upper
beds
of
the
same
formation,
*punct* ,
facts
*punct* ,
showing
what
wide
*punct* ,
yet
easily
overlooked
*punct* ,
intervals
have
occurred
in
its
accumulation
*punct* .
*break*
in
other
cases
we
have
the
plainest
evidence
in
great
fossilised
trees
*punct* ,
still
standing
upright
as
they
grew
*punct* ,
of
many
long
intervals
of
time
and
changes
of
level
during
the
process
of
deposition
*punct* ,
which
would
never
even
have
been
suspected
*punct* ,
had
not
the
trees
chanced
to
have
been
preserved
*punct* :
thus
*punct* ,
messrs
*punct* .
*break*
lyell
and
dawson
found
carboniferous
beds
1400
feet
thick
in
nova
scotia
*punct* ,
with
ancient
root-bearing
strata
*punct* ,
one
above
the
other
*punct* ,
at
no
less
than
sixty-eight
different
levels
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
when
the
same
species
occur
at
the
bottom
*punct* ,
middle
*punct* ,
and
top
of
a
formation
*punct* ,
the
probability
is
that
they
have
not
lived
on
the
same
spot
during
the
whole
period
of
deposition
*punct* ,
but
have
disappeared
and
reappeared
*punct* ,
perhaps
many
times
*punct* ,
during
the
same
geological
period
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
if
such
species
were
to
undergo
a
considerable
amount
of
modification
during
any
one
geological
period
*punct* ,
a
section
would
not
probably
include
all
the
fine
intermediate
gradations
which
must
on
my
theory
have
existed
between
them
*punct* ,
but
abrupt
*punct* ,
though
perhaps
very
slight
*punct* ,
changes
of
form
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
all-important
to
remember
that
naturalists
have
no
golden
rule
by
which
to
distinguish
species
and
varieties
*punct* ;
they
grant
some
little
variability
to
each
species
*punct* ,
but
when
they
meet
with
a
somewhat
greater
amount
of
difference
between
any
two
forms
*punct* ,
they
rank
both
as
species
*punct* ,
unless
they
are
enabled
to
connect
them
together
by
close
intermediate
gradations
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
from
the
reasons
just
assigned
we
can
seldom
hope
to
effect
in
any
one
geological
section
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
we
might
obtain
the
parent-species
and
its
several
modified
descendants
from
the
lower
and
upper
beds
of
a
formation
*punct* ,
and
unless
we
obtained
numerous
transitional
gradations
*punct* ,
we
should
not
recognise
their
relationship
*punct* ,
and
should
consequently
be
compelled
to
rank
them
all
as
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
notorious
on
what
excessively
slight
differences
many
palaeontologists
have
founded
their
species
*punct* ;
and
they
do
this
the
more
readily
if
the
specimens
come
from
different
sub-stages
of
the
same
formation
*punct* .
*break*
some
experienced
conchologists
are
now
sinking
many
of
the
very
fine
species
of
d'orbigny
and
others
into
the
rank
of
varieties
*punct* ;
and
on
this
view
we
do
find
the
kind
of
evidence
of
change
which
on
my
theory
we
ought
to
find
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
if
we
look
to
rather
wider
intervals
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
to
distinct
but
consecutive
stages
of
the
same
great
formation
*punct* ,
we
find
that
the
embedded
fossils
*punct* ,
though
almost
universally
ranked
as
specifically
different
*punct* ,
yet
are
far
more
closely
allied
to
each
other
than
are
the
species
found
in
more
widely
separated
formations
*punct* ;
but
to
this
subject
i
shall
have
to
return
in
the
following
chapter
*punct* .
*break*
one
other
consideration
is
worth
notice
*punct* :
with
animals
and
plants
that
can
propagate
rapidly
and
are
not
highly
locomotive
*punct* ,
there
is
reason
to
suspect
*punct* ,
as
we
have
formerly
seen
*punct* ,
that
their
varieties
are
generally
at
first
local
*punct* ;
and
that
such
local
varieties
do
not
spread
widely
and
supplant
their
parent-forms
until
they
have
been
modified
and
perfected
in
some
considerable
degree
*punct* .
*break*
according
to
this
view
*punct* ,
the
chance
of
discovering
in
a
formation
in
any
one
country
all
the
early
stages
of
transition
between
any
two
forms
*punct* ,
is
small
*punct* ,
for
the
successive
changes
are
supposed
to
have
been
local
or
confined
to
some
one
spot
*punct* .
*break*
most
marine
animals
have
a
wide
range
*punct* ;
and
we
have
seen
that
with
plants
it
is
those
which
have
the
widest
range
*punct* ,
that
oftenest
present
varieties
*punct* ;
so
that
with
shells
and
other
marine
animals
*punct* ,
it
is
probably
those
which
have
had
the
widest
range
*punct* ,
far
exceeding
the
limits
of
the
known
geological
formations
of
europe
*punct* ,
which
have
oftenest
given
rise
*punct* ,
first
to
local
varieties
and
ultimately
to
new
species
*punct* ;
and
this
again
would
greatly
lessen
the
chance
of
our
being
able
to
trace
the
stages
of
transition
in
any
one
geological
formation
*punct* .
*break*
it
should
not
be
forgotten
*punct* ,
that
at
the
present
day
*punct* ,
with
perfect
specimens
for
examination
*punct* ,
two
forms
can
seldom
be
connected
by
intermediate
varieties
and
thus
proved
to
be
the
same
species
*punct* ,
until
many
specimens
have
been
collected
from
many
places
*punct* ;
and
in
the
case
of
fossil
species
this
could
rarely
be
effected
by
palaeontologists
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
best
perceive
the
improbability
of
our
being
enabled
to
connect
species
by
numerous
*punct* ,
fine
*punct* ,
intermediate
*punct* ,
fossil
links
*punct* ,
by
asking
ourselves
whether
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
geologists
at
some
future
period
will
be
able
to
prove
*punct* ,
that
our
different
breeds
of
cattle
*punct* ,
sheep
*punct* ,
horses
*punct* ,
and
dogs
have
descended
from
a
single
stock
or
from
several
aboriginal
stocks
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
whether
certain
sea-shells
inhabiting
the
shores
of
north
america
*punct* ,
which
are
ranked
by
some
conchologists
as
distinct
species
from
their
european
representatives
*punct* ,
and
by
other
conchologists
as
only
varieties
*punct* ,
are
really
varieties
or
are
*punct* ,
as
it
is
called
*punct* ,
specifically
distinct
*punct* .
*break*
this
could
be
effected
only
by
the
future
geologist
discovering
in
a
fossil
state
numerous
intermediate
gradations
*punct* ;
and
such
success
seems
to
me
improbable
in
the
highest
degree
*punct* .
*break*
geological
research
*punct* ,
though
it
has
added
numerous
species
to
existing
and
extinct
genera
*punct* ,
and
has
made
the
intervals
between
some
few
groups
less
wide
than
they
otherwise
would
have
been
*punct* ,
yet
has
done
scarcely
anything
in
breaking
down
the
distinction
between
species
*punct* ,
by
connecting
them
together
by
numerous
*punct* ,
fine
*punct* ,
intermediate
varieties
*punct* ;
and
this
not
having
been
effected
*punct* ,
is
probably
the
gravest
and
most
obvious
of
all
the
many
objections
which
may
be
urged
against
my
views
*punct* .
*break*
hence
it
will
be
worth
while
to
sum
up
the
foregoing
remarks
*punct* ,
under
an
imaginary
illustration
*punct* .
*break*
the
malay
archipelago
is
of
about
the
size
of
europe
from
the
north
cape
to
the
mediterranean
*punct* ,
and
from
britain
to
russia
*punct* ;
and
therefore
equals
all
the
geological
formations
which
have
been
examined
with
any
accuracy
*punct* ,
excepting
those
of
the
united
states
of
america
*punct* .
*break*
i
fully
agree
with
mr.
godwin-austen
*punct* ,
that
the
present
condition
of
the
malay
archipelago
*punct* ,
with
its
numerous
large
islands
separated
by
wide
and
shallow
seas
*punct* ,
probably
represents
the
former
state
of
europe
*punct* ,
when
most
of
our
formations
were
accumulating
*punct* .
*break*
the
malay
archipelago
is
one
of
the
richest
regions
of
the
whole
world
in
organic
beings
*punct* ;
yet
if
all
the
species
were
to
be
collected
which
have
ever
lived
there
*punct* ,
how
imperfectly
would
they
represent
the
natural
history
of
the
world
*punct* !
*break*
but
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
terrestrial
productions
of
the
archipelago
would
be
preserved
in
an
excessively
imperfect
manner
in
the
formations
which
we
suppose
to
be
there
accumulating
*punct* .
*break*
i
suspect
that
not
many
of
the
strictly
littoral
animals
*punct* ,
or
of
those
which
lived
on
naked
submarine
rocks
*punct* ,
would
be
embedded
*punct* ;
and
those
embedded
in
gravel
or
sand
*punct* ,
would
not
endure
to
a
distant
epoch
*punct* .
*break*
wherever
sediment
did
not
accumulate
on
the
bed
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
or
where
it
did
not
accumulate
at
a
sufficient
rate
to
protect
organic
bodies
from
decay
*punct* ,
no
remains
could
be
preserved
*punct* .
*break*
in
our
archipelago
*punct* ,
i
believe
that
fossiliferous
formations
could
be
formed
of
sufficient
thickness
to
last
to
an
age
*punct* ,
as
distant
in
futurity
as
the
secondary
formations
lie
in
the
past
*punct* ,
only
during
periods
of
subsidence
*punct* .
*break*
these
periods
of
subsidence
would
be
separated
from
each
other
by
enormous
intervals
*punct* ,
during
which
the
area
would
be
either
stationary
or
rising
*punct* ;
whil
st
rising
*punct* ,
each
fossiliferous
formation
would
be
destroyed
*punct* ,
almost
as
soon
as
accumulated
*punct* ,
by
the
incessant
coast-action
*punct* ,
as
we
now
see
on
the
shores
of
south
america
*punct* .
*break*
during
the
periods
of
subsidence
there
would
probably
be
much
extinction
of
life
*punct* ;
during
the
periods
of
elevation
*punct* ,
there
would
be
much
variation
*punct* ,
but
the
geological
record
would
then
be
least
perfect
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
duration
of
any
one
great
period
of
subsidence
over
the
whole
or
part
of
the
archipelago
*punct* ,
together
with
a
contemporaneous
accumulation
of
sediment
*punct* ,
would
exceed
the
average
duration
of
the
same
specific
forms
*punct* ;
and
these
contingencies
are
indispensable
for
the
preservation
of
all
the
transitional
gradations
between
any
two
or
more
species
*punct* .
*break*
if
such
gradations
were
not
fully
preserved
*punct* ,
transitional
varieties
would
merely
appear
as
so
many
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
probable
that
each
great
period
of
subsidence
would
be
interrupted
by
oscillations
of
level
*punct* ,
and
that
slight
climatal
changes
would
intervene
during
such
lengthy
periods
*punct* ;
and
in
these
cases
the
inhabitants
of
the
archipelago
would
have
to
migrate
*punct* ,
and
no
closely
consecutive
record
of
their
modifications
could
be
preserved
in
any
one
formation
*punct* .
*break*
very
many
of
the
marine
inhabitants
of
the
archipelago
now
range
thousands
of
miles
beyond
its
confines
*punct* ;
and
analogy
leads
me
to
believe
that
it
would
be
chiefly
these
far-ranging
species
which
would
oftenest
produce
new
varieties
*punct* ;
and
the
varieties
would
at
first
generally
be
local
or
confined
to
one
place
*punct* ,
but
if
possessed
of
any
decided
advantage
*punct* ,
or
when
further
modified
and
improved
*punct* ,
they
would
slowly
spread
and
supplant
their
parent-forms
*punct* .
*break*
when
such
varieties
returned
to
their
ancient
homes
*punct* ,
as
they
would
differ
from
their
former
state
*punct* ,
in
a
nearly
uniform
*punct* ,
though
perhaps
extremely
slight
degree
*punct* ,
they
would
*punct* ,
according
to
the
principles
followed
by
many
palaeontologists
*punct* ,
be
ranked
as
new
and
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
if
then
*punct* ,
there
be
some
degree
of
truth
in
these
remarks
*punct* ,
we
have
no
right
to
expect
to
find
in
our
geological
formations
*punct* ,
an
infinite
number
of
those
fine
transitional
forms
*punct* ,
which
on
my
theory
assuredly
have
connected
all
the
past
and
present
species
of
the
same
group
into
one
long
and
branching
chain
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
we
ought
only
to
look
for
a
few
links
*punct* ,
some
more
closely
*punct* ,
some
more
distantly
related
to
each
other
*punct* ;
and
these
links
*punct* ,
let
them
be
ever
so
close
*punct* ,
if
found
in
different
stages
of
the
same
formation
*punct* ,
would
*punct* ,
by
most
palaeontologists
*punct* ,
be
ranked
as
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
do
not
pretend
that
i
should
ever
have
suspected
how
poor
a
record
of
the
mutations
of
life
*punct* ,
the
best
preserved
geological
section
presented
*punct* ,
had
not
the
difficulty
of
our
not
discovering
innumerable
transitional
links
between
the
species
which
appeared
at
the
commencement
and
close
of
each
formation
*punct* ,
pressed
so
hardly
on
my
theory
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
sudden
appearance
of
whole
groups
of
allied
species.
*punct* ,
the
abrupt
manner
in
which
whole
groups
of
species
suddenly
appear
in
certain
formations
*punct* ,
has
been
urged
by
several
palaeontologists
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
by
agassiz
*punct* ,
pictet
*punct* ,
and
by
none
more
forcibly
than
by
professor
sedgwick
*punct* ,
as
a
fatal
objection
to
the
belief
in
the
transmutation
of
species
*punct* .
*break*
if
numerous
species
*punct* ,
belonging
to
the
same
genera
or
families
*punct* ,
have
really
started
into
life
all
at
once
*punct* ,
the
fact
would
be
fatal
to
the
theory
of
descent
with
slow
modification
through
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
development
of
a
group
of
forms
*punct* ,
all
of
which
have
descended
from
some
one
progenitor
*punct* ,
must
have
been
an
extremely
slow
process
*punct* ;
and
the
progenitors
must
have
lived
long
ages
before
their
modified
descendants
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
continually
over-rate
the
perfection
of
the
geological
record
*punct* ,
and
falsely
infer
*punct* ,
because
certain
genera
or
families
have
not
been
found
beneath
a
certain
stage
*punct* ,
that
they
did
not
exist
before
that
stage
*punct* .
*break*
we
continually
forget
how
large
the
world
is
*punct* ,
compared
with
the
area
over
which
our
geological
formations
have
been
carefully
examined
*punct* ;
we
forget
that
groups
of
species
may
elsewhere
have
long
existed
and
have
slowly
multiplied
before
they
invaded
the
ancient
archipelagoes
of
europe
and
of
the
united
states
*punct* .
*break*
we
do
not
make
due
allowance
for
the
enormous
intervals
of
time
*punct* ,
which
have
probably
elapsed
between
our
consecutive
formations,
*punct* ,
longer
perhaps
in
some
cases
than
the
time
required
for
the
accumulation
of
each
formation
*punct* .
*break*
these
intervals
will
have
given
time
for
the
multiplication
of
species
from
some
one
or
some
few
parent-forms
*punct* ;
and
in
the
succeeding
formation
such
species
will
appear
as
if
suddenly
created
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
here
recall
a
remark
formerly
made
*punct* ,
namely
that
it
might
require
a
long
succession
of
ages
to
adapt
an
organism
to
some
new
and
peculiar
line
of
life
*punct* ,
for
instance
to
fly
through
the
air
*punct* ;
but
that
when
this
had
been
effected
*punct* ,
and
a
few
species
had
thus
acquired
a
great
advantage
over
other
organisms
*punct* ,
a
comparatively
short
time
would
be
necessary
to
produce
many
divergent
forms
*punct* ,
which
would
be
able
to
spread
rapidly
and
widely
throughout
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
now
give
a
few
examples
to
illustrate
these
remarks
*punct* ;
and
to
show
how
liable
we
are
to
error
in
supposing
that
whole
groups
of
species
have
suddenly
been
produced
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
recall
the
well-known
fact
that
in
geological
treatises
*punct* ,
published
not
many
years
ago
*punct* ,
the
great
class
of
mammals
was
always
spoken
of
as
having
abruptly
come
in
at
the
commencement
of
the
tertiary
series
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
one
of
the
richest
known
accumulations
of
fossil
mammals
belongs
to
the
middle
of
the
secondary
series
*punct* ;
and
one
true
mammal
has
been
discovered
in
the
new
red
sandstone
at
nearly
the
commencement
of
this
great
series
*punct* .
*break*
cuvier
used
to
urge
that
no
monkey
occurred
in
any
tertiary
stratum
*punct* ;
but
now
extinct
species
have
been
discovered
in
india
*punct* ,
south
america
*punct* ,
and
in
europe
even
as
far
back
as
the
eocene
stage
*punct* .
*break*
the
most
striking
case
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
is
that
of
the
whale
family
*punct* ;
as
these
animals
have
huge
bones
*punct* ,
are
marine
*punct* ,
and
range
over
the
world
*punct* ,
the
fact
of
not
a
single
bone
of
a
whale
having
been
discovered
in
any
secondary
formation
*punct* ,
seemed
fully
to
justify
the
belief
that
this
great
and
distinct
order
had
been
suddenly
produced
in
the
interval
between
the
latest
secondary
and
earliest
tertiary
formation
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
we
may
read
in
the
supplement
to
lyell's
manual
*punct* ,
published
in
1858
*punct* ,
clear
evidence
of
the
existence
of
whales
in
the
upper
greensand
*punct* ,
some
time
before
the
close
of
the
secondary
period
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
give
another
instance
*punct* ,
which
from
having
passed
under
my
own
eyes
has
much
struck
me
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
memoir
on
fossil
sessile
cirripedes
*punct* ,
i
have
stated
that
*punct* ,
from
the
number
of
existing
and
extinct
tertiary
species
*punct* ;
from
the
extraordinary
abundance
of
the
individuals
of
many
species
all
over
the
world
*punct* ,
from
the
arctic
regions
to
the
equator
*punct* ,
inhabiting
various
zones
of
depths
from
the
upper
tidal
limits
to
50
fathoms
*punct* ;
from
the
perfect
manner
in
which
specimens
are
preserved
in
the
oldest
tertiary
beds
*punct* ;
from
the
ease
with
which
even
a
fragment
of
a
valve
can
be
recognised
*punct* ;
from
all
these
circumstances
*punct* ,
i
inferred
that
had
sessile
cirripedes
existed
during
the
secondary
periods
*punct* ,
they
would
certainly
have
been
preserved
and
discovered
*punct* ;
and
as
not
one
species
had
been
discovered
in
beds
of
this
age
*punct* ,
i
concluded
that
this
great
group
had
been
suddenly
developed
at
the
commencement
of
the
tertiary
series
*punct* .
*break*
this
was
a
sore
trouble
to
me
*punct* ,
adding
as
i
thought
one
more
instance
of
the
abrupt
appearance
of
a
great
group
of
species
*punct* .
*break*
but
my
work
had
hardly
been
published
*punct* ,
when
a
skilful
palaeontologist
*punct* ,
m.
bosquet
*punct* ,
sent
me
a
drawing
of
a
perfect
specimen
of
an
unmistakeable
sessile
cirripede
*punct* ,
which
he
had
himself
extracted
from
the
chalk
of
belgium
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
as
if
to
make
the
case
as
striking
as
possible
*punct* ,
this
sessile
cirripede
was
a
chthamalus
*punct* ,
a
very
common
*punct* ,
large
*punct* ,
and
ubiquitous
genus
*punct* ,
of
which
not
one
specimen
has
as
yet
been
found
even
in
any
tertiary
stratum
*punct* .
*break*
hence
we
now
positively
know
that
sessile
cirripedes
existed
during
the
secondary
period
*punct* ;
and
these
cirripedes
might
have
been
the
progenitors
of
our
many
tertiary
and
existing
species
*punct* .
*break*
the
case
most
frequently
insisted
on
by
palaeontologists
of
the
apparently
sudden
appearance
of
a
whole
group
of
species
*punct* ,
is
that
of
the
teleostean
fishes
*punct* ,
low
down
in
the
chalk
period
*punct* .
*break*
this
group
includes
the
large
majority
of
existing
species
*punct* .
*break*
lately
*punct* ,
professor
pictet
has
carried
their
existence
one
sub-stage
further
back
*punct* ;
and
some
palaeontologists
believe
that
certain
much
older
fishes
*punct* ,
of
which
the
affinities
are
as
yet
imperfectly
known
*punct* ,
are
really
teleostean
*punct* .
*break*
assuming
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
that
the
whole
of
them
did
appear
*punct* ,
as
agassiz
believes
*punct* ,
at
the
commencement
of
the
chalk
formation
*punct* ,
the
fact
would
certainly
be
highly
remarkable
*punct* ;
but
i
cannot
see
that
it
would
be
an
insuperable
difficulty
on
my
theory
*punct* ,
unless
it
could
likewise
be
shown
that
the
species
of
this
group
appeared
suddenly
and
simultaneously
throughout
the
world
at
this
same
period
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
almost
superfluous
to
remark
that
hardly
any
fossil-fish
are
known
from
south
of
the
equator
*punct* ;
and
by
running
through
pictet's
palaeontology
it
will
be
seen
that
very
few
species
are
known
from
several
formations
in
europe
*punct* .
*break*
some
few
families
of
fish
now
have
a
confined
range
*punct* ;
the
teleostean
fish
might
formerly
have
had
a
similarly
confined
range
*punct* ,
and
after
having
been
largely
developed
in
some
one
sea
*punct* ,
might
have
spread
widely
*punct* .
*break*
nor
have
we
any
right
to
suppose
that
the
seas
of
the
world
have
always
been
so
freely
open
from
south
to
north
as
they
are
at
present
*punct* .
*break*
even
at
this
day
*punct* ,
if
the
malay
archipelago
were
converted
into
land
*punct* ,
the
tropical
parts
of
the
indian
ocean
would
form
a
large
and
perfectly
enclosed
basin
*punct* ,
in
which
any
great
group
of
marine
animals
might
be
multiplied
*punct* ;
and
here
they
would
remain
confined
*punct* ,
until
some
of
the
species
became
adapted
to
a
cooler
climate
*punct* ,
and
were
enabled
to
double
the
southern
capes
of
africa
or
australia
*punct* ,
and
thus
reach
other
and
distant
seas
*punct* .
*break*
from
these
and
similar
considerations
*punct* ,
but
chiefly
from
our
ignorance
of
the
geology
of
other
countries
beyond
the
confines
of
europe
and
the
united
states
*punct* ;
and
from
the
revolution
in
our
palaeontological
ideas
on
many
points
*punct* ,
which
the
discoveries
of
even
the
last
dozen
years
have
effected
*punct* ,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
about
as
rash
in
us
to
dogmatize
on
the
succession
of
organic
beings
throughout
the
world
*punct* ,
as
it
would
be
for
a
naturalist
to
land
for
five
minutes
on
some
one
barren
point
in
australia
*punct* ,
and
then
to
discuss
the
number
and
range
of
its
productions
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
sudden
appearance
of
groups
of
allied
species
in
the
lowest
known
fossiliferous
strata.
*punct* ,
there
is
another
and
allied
difficulty
*punct* ,
which
is
much
graver
*punct* .
*break*
i
allude
to
the
manner
in
which
numbers
of
species
of
the
same
group
*punct* ,
suddenly
appear
in
the
lowest
known
fossiliferous
rocks
*punct* .
*break*
most
of
the
arguments
which
have
convinced
me
that
all
the
existing
species
of
the
same
group
have
descended
from
one
progenitor
*punct* ,
apply
with
nearly
equal
force
to
the
earliest
known
species
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
i
cannot
doubt
that
all
the
silurian
trilobites
have
descended
from
some
one
crustacean
*punct* ,
which
must
have
lived
long
before
the
silurian
age
*punct* ,
and
which
probably
differed
greatly
from
any
known
animal
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
the
most
ancient
silurian
animals
*punct* ,
as
the
nautilus
*punct* ,
lingula
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
do
not
differ
much
from
living
species
*punct* ;
and
it
cannot
on
my
theory
be
supposed
*punct* ,
that
these
old
species
were
the
progenitors
of
all
the
species
of
the
orders
to
which
they
belong
*punct* ,
for
they
do
not
present
characters
in
any
degree
intermediate
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
if
*punct* ,
moreover
*punct* ,
they
had
been
the
progenitors
of
these
orders
*punct* ,
they
would
almost
certainly
have
been
long
ago
supplanted
and
exterminated
by
their
numerous
and
improved
descendants
*punct* .
*break*
consequently
*punct* ,
if
my
theory
be
true
*punct* ,
it
is
indisputable
that
before
the
lowest
silurian
stratum
was
deposited
*punct* ,
long
periods
elapsed
*punct* ,
as
long
as
*punct* ,
or
probably
far
longer
than
*punct* ,
the
whole
interval
from
the
silurian
age
to
the
present
day
*punct* ;
and
that
during
these
vast
*punct* ,
yet
quite
unknown
*punct* ,
periods
of
time
*punct* ,
the
world
swarmed
with
living
creatures
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
question
why
we
do
not
find
records
of
these
vast
primordial
periods
*punct* ,
i
can
give
no
satisfactory
answer
*punct* .
*break*
murchison
at
their
head
*punct* ,
are
convinced
that
we
see
in
the
organic
remains
of
the
lowest
silurian
stratum
the
dawn
of
life
on
this
planet
*punct* .
*break*
forbes
*punct* ,
dispute
this
conclusion
*punct* .
*break*
we
should
not
forget
that
only
a
small
portion
of
the
world
is
known
with
accuracy
*punct* .
*break*
m.
barrande
has
lately
added
another
and
lower
stage
to
the
silurian
system
*punct* ,
abounding
with
new
and
peculiar
species
*punct* .
*break*
traces
of
life
have
been
detected
in
the
longmynd
beds
beneath
barrande's
so-called
primordial
zone
*punct* .
*break*
the
presence
of
phosphatic
nodules
and
bituminous
matter
in
some
of
the
lowest
azoic
rocks
*punct* ,
probably
indicates
the
former
existence
of
life
at
these
periods
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
difficulty
of
understanding
the
absence
of
vast
piles
of
fossiliferous
strata
*punct* ,
which
on
my
theory
no
doubt
were
somewhere
accumulated
before
the
silurian
epoch
*punct* ,
is
very
great
*punct* .
*break*
if
these
most
ancient
beds
had
been
wholly
worn
away
by
denudation
*punct* ,
or
obliterated
by
metamorphic
action
*punct* ,
we
ought
to
find
only
small
remnants
of
the
formations
next
succeeding
them
in
age
*punct* ,
and
these
ought
to
be
very
generally
in
a
metamorphosed
condition
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
descriptions
which
we
now
possess
of
the
silurian
deposits
over
immense
territories
in
russia
and
in
north
america
*punct* ,
do
not
support
the
view
*punct* ,
that
the
older
a
formation
is
*punct* ,
the
more
it
has
suffered
the
extremity
of
denudation
and
metamorphism
*punct* .
*break*
the
case
at
present
must
remain
inexplicable
*punct* ;
and
may
be
truly
urged
as
a
valid
argument
against
the
views
here
entertained
*punct* .
*break*
to
show
that
it
may
hereafter
receive
some
explanation
*punct* ,
i
will
give
the
following
hypothesis
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
nature
of
the
organic
remains
*punct* ,
which
do
not
appear
to
have
inhabited
profound
depths
*punct* ,
in
the
several
formations
of
europe
and
of
the
united
states
*punct* ;
and
from
the
amount
of
sediment
*punct* ,
miles
in
thickness
*punct* ,
of
which
the
formations
are
composed
*punct* ,
we
may
infer
that
from
first
to
last
large
islands
or
tracts
of
land
*punct* ,
whence
the
sediment
was
derived
*punct* ,
occurred
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
existing
continents
of
europe
and
north
america
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
do
not
know
what
was
the
state
of
things
in
the
intervals
between
the
successive
formations
*punct* ;
whether
europe
and
the
united
states
during
these
intervals
existed
as
dry
land
*punct* ,
or
as
a
submarine
surface
near
land
*punct* ,
on
which
sediment
was
not
deposited
*punct* ,
or
again
as
the
bed
of
an
open
and
unfathomable
sea
*punct* .
*break*
looking
to
the
existing
oceans
*punct* ,
which
are
thrice
as
extensive
as
the
land
*punct* ,
we
see
them
studded
with
many
islands
*punct* ;
but
not
one
oceanic
island
is
as
yet
known
to
afford
even
a
remnant
of
any
palaeozoic
or
secondary
formation
*punct* .
*break*
hence
we
may
perhaps
infer
*punct* ,
that
during
the
palaeozoic
and
secondary
periods
*punct* ,
neither
continents
nor
continental
islands
existed
where
our
oceans
now
extend
*punct* ;
for
had
they
existed
there
*punct* ,
palaeozoic
and
secondary
formations
would
in
all
probability
have
been
accumulated
from
sediment
derived
from
their
wear
and
tear
*punct* ;
and
would
have
been
at
least
partially
upheaved
by
the
oscillations
of
level
*punct* ,
which
we
may
fairly
conclude
must
have
intervened
during
these
enormously
long
periods
*punct* .
*break*
if
then
we
may
infer
anything
from
these
facts
*punct* ,
we
may
infer
that
where
our
oceans
now
extend
*punct* ,
oceans
have
extended
from
the
remotest
period
of
which
we
have
any
record
*punct* ;
and
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
that
where
continents
now
exist
*punct* ,
large
tracts
of
land
have
existed
*punct* ,
subjected
no
doubt
to
great
oscillations
of
level
*punct* ,
since
the
earliest
silurian
period
*punct* .
*break*
the
coloured
map
appended
to
my
volume
on
coral
reefs
*punct* ,
led
me
to
conclude
that
the
great
oceans
are
still
mainly
areas
of
subsidence
*punct* ,
the
great
archipelagoes
still
areas
of
oscillations
of
level
*punct* ,
and
the
continents
areas
of
elevation
*punct* .
*break*
but
have
we
any
right
to
assume
that
things
have
thus
remained
from
eternity
*punct* ?
*break*
our
continents
seem
to
have
been
formed
by
a
preponderance
*punct* ,
during
many
oscillations
of
level
*punct* ,
of
the
force
of
elevation
*punct* ;
but
may
not
the
areas
of
preponderant
movement
have
changed
in
the
lapse
of
ages
*punct* ?
*break*
at
a
period
immeasurably
antecedent
to
the
silurian
epoch
*punct* ,
continents
may
have
existed
where
oceans
are
now
spread
out
*punct* ;
and
clear
and
open
oceans
may
have
existed
where
our
continents
now
stand
*punct* .
*break*
nor
should
we
be
justified
in
assuming
that
if
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
bed
of
the
pacific
ocean
were
now
converted
into
a
continent
*punct* ,
we
should
there
find
formations
older
than
the
silurian
strata
*punct* ,
supposing
such
to
have
been
formerly
deposited
*punct* ;
for
it
might
well
happen
that
strata
which
had
subsided
some
miles
nearer
to
the
centre
of
the
earth
*punct* ,
and
which
had
been
pressed
on
by
an
enormous
weight
of
superincumbent
water
*punct* ,
might
have
undergone
far
more
metamorphic
action
than
strata
which
have
always
remained
nearer
to
the
surface
*punct* .
*break*
the
immense
areas
in
some
parts
of
the
world
*punct* ,
for
instance
in
south
america
*punct* ,
of
bare
metamorphic
rocks
*punct* ,
which
must
have
been
heated
under
great
pressure
*punct* ,
have
always
seemed
to
me
to
require
some
special
explanation
*punct* ;
and
we
may
perhaps
believe
that
we
see
in
these
large
areas
*punct* ,
the
many
formations
long
anterior
to
the
silurian
epoch
in
a
completely
metamorphosed
condition

several
difficulties
here
discussed

not
finding

the
successive
formations
infinitely

many
species
which
now
exist
or

*punct* ;
the
sudden
manner
in
which
whole
groups
of
species
appear

our
european

the
almost
entire
absence
*punct* ,
as
at

*punct* ,
of
fossiliferous
formations

it

differ
from
these

for

following

lyell's

i
look
at
the

as
a

of
the

imperfectly
kept

written

of
this
history
we
possess
the

*punct* ,
relating

two

three

which
the
history
is
supposed

be
written
*punct* ,

more

different
in
the
interrupted
succession
of

represent
the
apparently
abruptly
changed
forms
of
life
*punct* ,
entombed
in
our
consecutive
*punct* ,
but
widely
separated

*punct* .
*break*
on

view
*punct* ,
the
difficulties
above
discussed
are
greatly
diminished
*punct* ,

even
disappear
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
now
see
whether
the
several
facts
and
rules
relating
to
the
geological
succession
of
organic
beings
*punct* ,
better
accord
with
the
common
view
of
the
immutability
of
species
*punct* ,
or
with
that
of
their
slow
and
gradual
modification
*punct* ,
through
descent
and
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
new
species
have
appeared
very
slowly
*punct* ,
one
after
another
*punct* ,
both
on
the
land
and
in
the

*punct* .
*break*
lyell
has
shown
that
it
is
hardly
possible
to
resist
the
evidence
on
this
head
in
the
case
of
the
several
tertiary
stages
*punct* ;
and
every
year
tends
to
fill
up
the
blanks
between
them
*punct* ,
and
to
make
the
percentage
system
of
lost
and
new
forms
more
gradual
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
of
the
most
recent
beds
*punct* ,
though
undoubtedly
of
high
antiquity
if
measured
by
years
*punct* ,
only
one
or
two
species
are
lost
forms
*punct* ,
and
only
one
or
two
are
new
forms
*punct* ,
having
here
appeared
for
the
first
time
*punct* ,
either
locally
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
as
far
as
we
know
*punct* ,
on
the
face
of
the
earth
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
may
trust
the
observations
of
philippi
in
sicily
*punct* ,
the
successive
changes
in
the
marine
inhabitants
of
that
island
have
been
many
and
most
gradual
*punct* .
*break*
the
secondary
formations
are
more
broken
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
as
bronn
has
remarked
*punct* ,
neither
the
appearance
nor
disappearance
of
their
many
now
extinct
species
has
been
simultaneous
in
each
separate
formation
*punct* .
*break*
species
of
different
genera
and
classes
have
not
changed
at
the
same
rate
*punct* ,
or
in
the
same
degree
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
oldest
tertiary
beds
a
few
living
shells
may
still
be
found
in
the
midst
of
a
multitude
of
extinct
forms
*punct* .
*break*
falconer
has
given
a
striking
instance
of
a
similar
fact
*punct* ,
in
an
existing
crocodile
associated
with
many
strange
and
lost
mammals
and
reptiles
in
the
sub-himalayan
deposits
*punct* .
*break*
the
silurian
lingula
differs
but
little
from
the
living
species
of
this
genus
*punct* ;
whereas
most
of
the
other
silurian
molluscs
and
all
the
crustaceans
have
changed
greatly
*punct* .
*break*
the
productions
of
the
land
seem
to
change
at
a
quicker
rate
than
those
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
of
which
a
striking
instance
has
lately
been
observed
in
switzerland
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
some
reason
to
believe
that
organisms
*punct* ,
considered
high
in
the
scale
of
nature
*punct* ,
change
more
quickly
than
those
that
are
low
*punct* :
though
there
are
exceptions
to
this
rule
*punct* .
*break*
the
amount
of
organic
change
*punct* ,
as
pictet
has
remarked
*punct* ,
does
not
strictly
correspond
with
the
succession
of
our
geological
formations
*punct* ;
so
that
between
each
two
consecutive
formations
*punct* ,
the
forms
of
life
have
seldom
changed
in
exactly
the
same
degree
*punct* .
*break*
yet
if
we
compare
any
but
the
most
closely
related
formations
*punct* ,
all
the
species
will
be
found
to
have
undergone
some
change
*punct* .
*break*
when
a
species
has
once
disappeared
from
the
face
of
the
earth
*punct* ,
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
same
identical
form
never
reappears
*punct* .
*break*
the
strongest
apparent
exception
to
this
latter
rule
*punct* ,
is
that
of
the
so-called
colonies
of
m.
barrande
*punct* ,
which
intrude
for
a
period
in
the
midst
of
an
older
formation
*punct* ,
and
then
allow
the
pre-existing
fauna
to
reappear
*punct* ;
but
lyell's
explanation
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
it
is
a
case
of
temporary
migration
from
a
distinct
geographical
province
*punct* ,
seems
to
me
satisfactory
*punct* .
*break*
these
several
facts
accord
well
with
my
theory
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
in
no
fixed
law
of
development
*punct* ,
causing
all
the
inhabitants
of
a
country
to
change
abruptly
*punct* ,
or
simultaneously
*punct* ,
or
to
an
equal
degree
*punct* .
*break*
the
process
of
modification
must
be
extremely
slow
*punct* .
*break*
the
variability
of
each
species
is
quite
independent
of
that
of
all
others
*punct* .
*break*
whether
such
variability
be
taken
advantage
of
by
natural
selection
*punct* ,
and
whether
the
variations
be
accumulated
to
a
greater
or
lesser
amount
*punct* ,
thus
causing
a
greater
or
lesser
amount
of
modification
in
the
varying
species
*punct* ,
depends
on
many
complex
contingencies,
*punct* ,
on
the
variability
being
of
a
beneficial
nature
*punct* ,
on
the
power
of
intercrossing
*punct* ,
on
the
rate
of
breeding
*punct* ,
on
the
slowly
changing
physical
conditions
of
the
country
*punct* ,
and
more
especially
on
the
nature
of
the
other
inhabitants
with
which
the
varying
species
comes
into
competition
*punct* .
*break*
hence
it
is
by
no
means
surprising
that
one
species
should
retain
the
same
identical
form
much
longer
than
others
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
if
changing
*punct* ,
that
it
should
change
less
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
the
same
fact
in
geographical
distribution
*punct* ;
for
instance
*punct* ,
in
the
land-shells
and
coleopterous
insects
of
madeira
having
come
to
differ
considerably
from
their
nearest
allies
on
the
continent
of
europe
*punct* ,
whereas
the
marine
shells
and
birds
have
remained
unaltered
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
perhaps
understand
the
apparently
quicker
rate
of
change
in
terrestrial
and
in
more
highly
organised
productions
compared
with
marine
and
lower
productions
*punct* ,
by
the
more
complex
relations
of
the
higher
beings
to
their
organic
and
inorganic
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
as
explained
in
a
former
chapter
*punct* .
*break*
when
many
of
the
inhabitants
of
a
country
have
become
modified
and
improved
*punct* ,
we
can
understand
*punct* ,
on
the
principle
of
competition
*punct* ,
and
on
that
of
the
many
all-important
relations
of
organism
to
organism
*punct* ,
that
any
form
which
does
not
become
in
some
degree
modified
and
improved
*punct* ,
will
be
liable
to
be
exterminated
*punct* .
*break*
hence
we
can
see
why
all
the
species
in
the
same
region
do
at
last
*punct* ,
if
we
look
to
wide
enough
intervals
of
time
*punct* ,
become
modified
*punct* ;
for
those
which
do
not
change
will
become
extinct
*punct* .
*break*
in
members
of
the
same
class
the
average
amount
of
change
*punct* ,
during
long
and
equal
periods
of
time
*punct* ,
may
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
be
nearly
the
same
*punct* ;
but
as
the
accumulation
of
long-enduring
fossiliferous
formations
depends
on
great
masses
of
sediment
having
been
deposited
on
areas
whilst
subsiding
*punct* ,
our
formations
have
been
almost
necessarily
accumulated
at
wide
and
irregularly
intermittent
intervals
*punct* ;
consequently
the
amount
of
organic
change
exhibited
by
the
fossils
embedded
in
consecutive
formations
is
not
equal
*punct* .
*break*
each
formation
*punct* ,
on
this
view
*punct* ,
does
not
mark
a
new
and
complete
act
of
creation
*punct* ,
but
only
an
occasional
scene
*punct* ,
taken
almost
at
hazard
*punct* ,
in
a
slowly
changing
drama
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
clearly
understand
why
a
species
when
once
lost
should
never
reappear
*punct* ,
even
if
the
very
same
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
organic
and
inorganic
*punct* ,
should
recur
*punct* .
*break*
for
though
the
offspring
of
one
species
might
be
adapted
*punct* ,
and
no
doubt
this
has
occurred
in
innumerable
instances
*punct* ,
to
fill
the
exact
place
of
another
species
in
the
economy
of
nature
*punct* ,
and
thus
supplant
it
*punct* ;
yet
the
two
forms
*punct* ,
the
old
and
the
new
*punct* ,
would
not
be
identically
the
same
*punct* ;
for
both
would
almost
certainly
inherit
different
characters
from
their
distinct
progenitors
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
it
is
just
possible
*punct* ,
if
our
fantail-pigeons
were
all
destroyed
*punct* ,
that
fanciers
*punct* ,
by
striving
during
long
ages
for
the
same
object
*punct* ,
might
make
a
new
breed
hardly
distinguishable
from
our
present
fantail
*punct* ;
but
if
the
parent
rock-pigeon
were
also
destroyed
*punct* ,
and
in
nature
we
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
parent-form
will
generally
be
supplanted
and
exterminated
by
its
improved
offspring
*punct* ,
it
is
quite
incredible
that
a
fantail
*punct* ,
identical
with
the
existing
breed
*punct* ,
could
be
raised
from
any
other
species
of
pigeon
*punct* ,
or
even
from
the
other
well-established
races
of
the
domestic
pigeon
*punct* ,
for
the
newly-formed
fantail
would
be
almost
sure
to
inherit
from
its
new
progenitor
some
slight
characteristic
differences
*punct* .
*break*
groups
of
species
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
genera
and
families
*punct* ,
follow
the
same
general
rules
in
their
appearance
and
disappearance
as
do
single
species
*punct* ,
changing
more
or
less
quickly
*punct* ,
and
in
a
greater
or
lesser
degree
*punct* .
*break*
a
group
does
not
reappear
after
it
has
once
disappeared
*punct* ;
or
its
existence
*punct* ,
as
long
as
it
lasts
*punct* ,
is
continuous
*punct* .

pictet

all
strongly
opposed

such
views
as

maintain
*punct* ,
admit
its
truth
*punct* ;
and
the
rule
strictly
accords
with
my
theory
*punct* .
*break*
for
as
all
the
species
of
the
same
group
have
descended
from
some
one
species
*punct* ,
it
is
clear
that
as
long
as
any
species
of
the
group
have
appeared
in
the
long
succession
of
ages
*punct* ,
so
long
must
its
members
have
continuously
existed
*punct* ,
in
order
to
have
generated
either
new
and
modified
or
the
same
old
and
unmodified
forms
*punct* .
*break*
species
of
the
genus
lingula
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
must
have
continuously
existed
by
an
unbroken
succession
of
generations
*punct* ,
from
the
lowest
silurian
stratum
to
the
present
day
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
seen
in
the
last
chapter
that
the
species
of
a
group
sometimes
falsely
appear
to
have
come
in
abruptly
*punct* ;
and
i
have
attempted
to
give
an
explanation
of
this
fact
*punct* ,
which
if
true
would
have
been
fatal
to
my
views
*punct* .
*break*
but
such
cases
are
certainly
exceptional
*punct* ;
the
general
rule
being
a
gradual
increase
in
number
*punct* ,
till
the
group
reaches
its
maximum
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
sooner
or
later
*punct* ,
it
gradually
decreases
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
number
of
the
species
of
a
genus
*punct* ,
or
the
number
of
the
genera
of
a
family
*punct* ,
be
represented
by
a
vertical
line
of
varying
thickness
*punct* ,
crossing
the
successive
geological
formations
in
which
the
species
are
found
*punct* ,
the
line
will
sometimes
falsely
appear
to
begin
at
its
lower
end
*punct* ,
not
in
a
sharp
point
*punct* ,
but
abruptly
*punct* ;
it
then
gradually
thickens
upwards
*punct* ,
sometimes
keeping
for
a
space
of
equal
thickness
*punct* ,
and
ultimately
thins
out
in
the
upper
beds
*punct* ,
marking
the
decrease
and
final
extinction
of
the
species
*punct* .
*break*
this
gradual
increase
in
number
of
the
species
of
a
group
is
strictly
conformable
with
my
theory
*punct* ;
as
the
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
and
the
genera
of
the
same
family
*punct* ,
can
increase
only
slowly
and
progressively
*punct* ;
for
the
process
of
modification
and
the
production
of
a
number
of
allied
forms
must
be
slow
and
gradual,
*punct* ,
one
species
giving
rise
first
to
two
or
three
varieties
*punct* ,
these
being
slowly
converted
into
species
*punct* ,
which
in
their
turn
produce
by
equally
slow
steps
other
species
*punct* ,
and
so
on
*punct* ,
like
the
branching
of
a
great
tree
from
a
single
stem

the
group
becomes
large

*break*
on
extinction.

the
disappearance
of
species

species
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
the
extinction
of
old
forms
and
the
production

new

intimately
connected
together
*punct* .

the
old
notion

all
the
inhabitants

this
conclusion

the
contrary

we

every
reason

believe
*punct* ,

the
study

having
endured

some
having
disappeared

the
close

determine
the
length

*break*
there
is
reason
to
believe

their

found
to

marks
the
progress

extermination

i
think
can
have
marvelled
more
at
the
extinction
of
species
*punct* ,
than
i
have
done
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
found
in
la
plata
the
tooth
of
a
horse
embedded
with
the
remains
of
mastodon
*punct* ,
megatherium
*punct* ,
toxodon
*punct* ,
and
other
extinct
monsters
*punct* ,
which
all
co-existed
with
still
living
shells
at
a
very
late
geological
period
*punct* ,
i
was
filled
with
astonishment
*punct* ;
for
seeing
that
the
horse
*punct* ,
since
its
introduction
by
the
spaniards
into
south
america
*punct* ,
has
run
wild
over
the
whole
country
and
has
increased
in
numbers
at
an
unparalleled
rate
*punct* ,
i
asked
myself
what
could
so
recently
have
exterminated
the
former
horse
under
conditions
of
life
apparently
so
favourable
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
utterly
groundless
was
my
astonishment
*punct* !
*break*
professor
owen
soon
perceived
that
the
tooth
*punct* ,
though
so
like
that
of
the
existing
horse
*punct* ,
belonged
to
an
extinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
had
this
horse
been
still
living
*punct* ,
but
in
some
degree
rare
*punct* ,
no
naturalist
would
have
felt
the
least
surprise
at
its
rarity
*punct* ;
for
rarity
is
the
attribute
of
a
vast
number
of
species
of
all
classes
*punct* ,
in
all
countries
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
ask
ourselves
why
this
or
that
species
is
rare
*punct* ,
we
answer
that
something
is
unfavourable
in
its
conditions
of
life
*punct* ;
but
what
that
something
is
*punct* ,
we
can
hardly
ever
tell
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
supposition
of
the
fossil
horse
still
existing
as
a
rare
species
*punct* ,
we
might
have
felt
certain
from
the
analogy
of
all
other
mammals
*punct* ,
even
of
the
slow-breeding
elephant
*punct* ,
and
from
the
history
of
the
naturalisation
of
the
domestic
horse
in
south
america
*punct* ,
that
under
more
favourable
conditions
it
would
in
a
very
few
years
have
stocked
the
whole
continent
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
could
not
have
told
what
the
unfavourable
conditions
were
which
checked
its
increase
*punct* ,
whether
some
one
or
several
contingencies
*punct* ,
and
at
what
period
of
the
horse's
life
*punct* ,
and
in
what
degree
*punct* ,
they
severally
acted
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
conditions
had
gone
on
*punct* ,
however
slowly
*punct* ,
becoming
less
and
less
favourable
*punct* ,
we
assuredly
should
not
have
perceived
the
fact
*punct* ,
yet
the
fossil
horse
would
certainly
have
become
rarer
and
rarer
*punct* ,
and
finally
extinct;
*punct* ,
its
place
being
seized
on
by
some
more
successful
competitor
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
most
difficult
always
to
remember
that
the
increase
of
every
living
being
is
constantly
being
checked
by
unperceived
injurious
agencies
*punct* ;
and
that
these
same
unperceived
agencies
are
amply
sufficient
to
cause
rarity
*punct* ,
and
finally
extinction
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
in
many
cases
in
the
more
recent
tertiary
formations
*punct* ,
that
rarity
precedes
extinction
*punct* ;
and
we
know
that
this
has
been
the
progress
of
events
with
those
animals
which
have
been
exterminated
*punct* ,
either
locally
or
wholly
*punct* ,
through
man's
agency
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
repeat
what
i
published
in
1845
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
to
admit
that
species
generally
become
rare
before
they
become
extinct
*punct* ,
to
feel
no
surprise
at
the
rarity
of
a
species
*punct* ,
and
yet
to
marvel
greatly
when
it
ceases
to
exist
*punct* ,
is
much
the
same
as
to
admit
that
sickness
in
the
individual
is
the
forerunner
of
death
*punct* ,
to
feel
no
surprise
at
sickness
*punct* ,
but
when
the
sick
man
dies
*punct* ,
to
wonder
and
to
suspect
that
he
died
by
some
unknown
deed
of
violence
*punct* .
*break*
the
theory
of
natural
selection
is
grounded
on
the
belief
that
each
new
variety
*punct* ,
and
ultimately
each
new
species
*punct* ,
is
produced
and
maintained
by
having
some
advantage
over
those
with
which
it
comes
into
competition
*punct* ;
and
the
consequent
extinction
of
less-favoured
forms
almost
inevitably
follows
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
the
same
with
our
domestic
productions
*punct* :
when
a
new
and
slightly
improved
variety
has
been
raised
*punct* ,
it
at
first
supplants
the
less
improved
varieties
in
the
same
neighbourhood
*punct* ;
when
much
improved
it
is
transported
far
and
near
*punct* ,
like
our
short-horn
cattle
*punct* ,
and
takes
the
place
of
other
breeds
in
other
countries
*punct* .
*break*
thus
the
appearance
of
new
forms
and
the
disappearance
of
old
forms
*punct* ,
both
natural
and
artificial
*punct* ,
are
bound
together
*punct* .
*break*
in
certain
flourishing
groups
*punct* ,
the
number
of
new
specific
forms
which
have
been
produced
within
a
given
time
is
probably
greater
than
that
of
the
old
forms
which
have
been
exterminated
*punct* ;
but
we
know
that
the
number
of
species
has
not
gone
on
indefinitely
increasing
*punct* ,
at
least
during
the
later
geological
periods
*punct* ,
so
that
looking
to
later
times
we
may
believe
that
the
production
of
new
forms
has
caused
the
extinction
of
about
the
same
number
of
old
forms
*punct* .
*break*
the
competition
will
generally
be
most
severe
*punct* ,
as
formerly
explained
and
illustrated
by
examples
*punct* ,
between
the
forms
which
are
most
like
each
other
in
all
respects
*punct* .
*break*
hence
the
improved
and
modified
descendants
of
a
species
will
generally
cause
the
extermination
of
the
parent-species
*punct* ;
and
if
many
new
forms
have
been
developed
from
any
one
species
*punct* ,
the
nearest
allies
of
that
species
*punct* ,
i.e
*punct* .
*break*
the
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
will
be
the
most
liable
to
extermination
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
a
number
of
new
species
descended
from
one
species
*punct* ,
that
is
a
new
genus
*punct* ,
comes
to
supplant
an
old
genus
*punct* ,
belonging
to
the
same
family
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
must
often
have
happened
that
a
new
species
belonging
to
some
one
group
will
have
seized
on
the
place
occupied
by
a
species
belonging
to
a
distinct
group
*punct* ,
and
thus
caused
its
extermination
*punct* ;
and
if
many
allied
forms
be
developed
from
the
successful
intruder
*punct* ,
many
will
have
to
yield
their
places
*punct* ;
and
it
will
generally
be
allied
forms
*punct* ,
which
will
suffer
from
some
inherited
inferiority
in
common
*punct* .
*break*
but
whether
it
be
species
belonging
to
the
same
or
to
a
distinct
class
*punct* ,
which
yield
their
places
to
other
species
which
have
been
modified
and
improved
*punct* ,
a
few
of
the
sufferers
may
often
long
be
preserved
*punct* ,
from
being
fitted
to
some
peculiar
line
of
life
*punct* ,
or
from
inhabiting
some
distant
and
isolated
station
*punct* ,
where
they
have
escaped
severe
competition
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
a
single
species
of
trigonia
*punct* ,
a
great
genus
of
shells
in
the
secondary
formations
*punct* ,
survives
in
the
australian
seas
*punct* ;
and
a
few
members
of
the
great
and
almost
extinct
group
of
ganoid
fishes
still
inhabit
our
fresh
waters
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
the
utter
extinction
of
a
group
is
generally
*punct* ,
as
we
have
seen
*punct* ,
a
slower
process
than
its
production
*punct* .
*break*
with
respect
to
the
apparently
sudden
extermination
of
whole
families
or
orders
*punct* ,
as
of
trilobites
at
the
close
of
the
palaeozoic
period
and
of
ammonites
at
the
close
of
the
secondary
period
*punct* ,
we
must
remember
what
has
been
already
said
on
the
probable
wide
intervals
of
time
between
our
consecutive
formations
*punct* ;
and
in
these
intervals
there
may
have
been
much
slow
extermination
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
when
by
sudden
immigration
or
by
unusually
rapid
development
*punct* ,
many
species
of
a
new
group
have
taken
possession
of
a
new
area
*punct* ,
they
will
have
exterminated
in
a
correspondingly
rapid
manner
many
of
the
old
inhabitants
*punct* ;
and
the
forms
which
thus
yield
their
places
will
commonly
be
allied
*punct* ,
for
they
will
partake
of
some
inferiority
in
common
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
as
it
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
the
manner
in
which
single
species
and
whole
groups
of
species
become
extinct
*punct* ,
accords
well
with
the
theory
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
we
need
not
marvel
at
extinction
*punct* ;
if
we
must
marvel
*punct* ,
let
it
be
at
our
presumption
in
imagining
for
a
moment
that
we
understand
the
many
complex
contingencies
*punct* ,
on
which
the
existence
of
each
species
depends
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
forget
for
an
instant
*punct* ,
that
each
species
tends
to
increase
inordinately
*punct* ,
and
that
some
check
is
always
in
action
*punct* ,
yet
seldom
perceived
by
us
*punct* ,
the
whole
economy
of
nature
will
be
utterly
obscured
*punct* .
*break*
whenever
we
can
precisely
say
why
this
species
is
more
abundant
in
individuals
than
that
*punct* ;
why
this
species
and
not
another
can
be
naturalised
in
a
given
country
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
and
not
till
then
*punct* ,
we
may
justly
feel
surprise
why
we
cannot
account
for
the
extinction
of
this
particular
species
or
group
of
species
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
forms
of
life
changing
almost
simultaneously
throughout
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* -
scarcely
any
palaeontological
discovery
is
more
striking
than
the
fact
*punct* ,
that
the
forms
of
life
change
almost
simultaneously
throughout
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
thus
our
european
chalk
formation
can
be
recognised
in
many
distant
parts
of
the
world
*punct* ,
under
the
most
different
climates
*punct* ,
where
not
a
fragment
of
the
mineral
chalk
itself
can
be
found
*punct* ;
namely
*punct* ,
in
north
america
*punct* ,
in
equatorial
south
america
*punct* ,
in
tierra
del
fuego
*punct* ,
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
*punct* ,
and
in
the
peninsula
of
india
*punct* .
*break*
for
at
these
distant
points
*punct* ,
the
organic
remains
in
certain
beds
present
an
unmistakeable
degree
of
resemblance
to
those
of
the
chalk
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
that
the
same
species
are
met
with
*punct* ;
for
in
some
cases
not
one
species
is
identically
the
same
*punct* ,
but
they
belong
to
the
same
families
*punct* ,
genera
*punct* ,
and
sections
of
genera
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
are
similarly
characterised
in
such
trifling
points
as
mere
superficial
sculpture
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
other
forms
*punct* ,
which
are
not
found
in
the
chalk
of
europe
*punct* ,
but
which
occur
in
the
formations
either
above
or
below
*punct* ,
are
similarly
absent
at
these
distant
points
of
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
several
successive
palaeozoic
formations
of
russia
*punct* ,
western
europe
and
north
america
*punct* ,
a
similar
parallelism
in
the
forms
of
life
has
been
observed
by
several
authors
*punct* :
so
it
is
*punct* ,
according
to
lyell
*punct* ,
with
the
several
european
and
north
american
tertiary
deposits
*punct* .
*break*
even
if
the
few
fossil
species
which
are
common
to
the
old
and
new
worlds
be
kept
wholly
out
of
view
*punct* ,
the
general
parallelism
in
the
successive
forms
of
life
*punct* ,
in
the
stages
of
the
widely
separated
palaeozoic
and
tertiary
periods
*punct* ,
would
still
be
manifest
*punct* ,
and
the
several
formations
could
be
easily
correlated
*punct* .
*break*
these
observations
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
relate
to
the
marine
inhabitants
of
distant
parts
of
the
world
*punct* :
we
have
not
sufficient
data
to
judge
whether
the
productions
of
the
land
and
of
fresh
water
change
at
distant
points
in
the
same
parallel
manner
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
doubt
whether
they
have
thus
changed
*punct* :
if
the
megatherium
*punct* ,
mylodon
*punct* ,
macrauchenia
*punct* ,
and
toxodon
had
been
brought
to
europe
from
la
plata
*punct* ,
without
any
information
in
regard
to
their
geological
position
*punct* ,
no
one
would
have
suspected
that
they
had
coexisted
with
still
living
sea-shells
*punct* ;
but
as
these
anomalous
monsters
coexisted
with
the
mastodon
and
horse
*punct* ,
it
might
at
least
have
been
inferred
that
they
had
lived
during
one
of
the
latter
tertiary
stages
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
marine
forms
of
life
are
spoken
of
as
having
changed
simultaneously
throughout
the
world
*punct* ,
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
this
expression
relates
to
the
same
thousandth
or
hundred-thousandth
year
*punct* ,
or
even
that
it
has
a
very
strict
geological
sense
*punct* ;
for
if
all
the
marine
animals
which
live
at
the
present
day
in
europe
*punct* ,
and
all
those
that
lived
in
europe
during
the
pleistocene
period
*punct* ,
an
enormously
remote
period
as
measured
by
years
*punct* ,
including
the
whole
glacial
epoch
*punct* ,
were
to
be
compared
with
those
now
living
in
south
america
or
in
australia
*punct* ,
the
most
skilful
naturalist
would
hardly
be
able
to
say
whether
the
existing
or
the
pleistocene
inhabitants
of
europe
resembled
most
closely
those
of
the
southern
hemisphere
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
several
highly
competent
observers
believe
that
the
existing
productions
of
the
united
states
are
more
closely
related
to
those
which
lived
in
europe
during
certain
later
tertiary
stages
*punct* ,
than
to
those
which
now
live
here
*punct* ;
and
if
this
be
so
*punct* ,
it
is
evident
that
fossiliferous
beds
deposited
at
the
present
day
on
the
shores
of
north
america
would
hereafter
be
liable
to
be
classed
with
somewhat
older
european
beds
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
looking
to
a
remotely
future
epoch
*punct* ,
there
can
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
be
little
doubt
that
all
the
more
modern
marine
formations
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
the
upper
pliocene
*punct* ,
the
pleistocene
and
strictly
modern
beds
*punct* ,
of
europe
*punct* ,
north
and
south
america
*punct* ,
and
australia
*punct* ,
from
containing
fossil
remains
in
some
degree
allied
*punct* ,
and
from
not
including
those
forms
which
are
only
found
in
the
older
underlying
deposits
*punct* ,
would
be
correctly
ranked
as
simultaneous
in
a
geological
sense
*punct* .
*break*
the
fact
of
the
forms
of
life
changing
simultaneously
*punct* ,
in
the
above
large
sense
*punct* ,
at
distant

has
greatly
struck

admirable
observers

*break*
after
referring
to
the

in
various
parts

*punct* ,
they
add
*punct* ,
if
struck
by
this
strange
sequence
*punct* ,
we
turn
our
attention
to
north
america
*punct* ,
and
there
discover
a
series
of
analogous
phenomena
*punct* ,
it
will
appear
certain
that
all
these
modifications
of
species
*punct* ,
their
extinction
*punct* ,
and
the
introduction
of
new
ones
*punct* ,
cannot
be
owing
to
mere
changes
in
marine
currents
or
other
causes
more
or

depend

general

m.

has
made
forcible
remarks

precisely
the

*break*
it
is
*punct* ,
indeed

quite
futile
to
look
to
changes

climate

other
physical

these
great

most
different

*break*
we

as
barrande

look
to
some
special
law
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
see
this

the
relation
between
the
physical
conditions
of
various
countries
*punct* ,
and
the
nature
of
their
inhabitants
*punct* .
*break*
this
great
fact
of
the
parallel
succession
of
the
forms
of
life
throughout
the
world
*punct* ,
is
explicable
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
new
species
are
formed
by
new
varieties
arising
*punct* ,
which
have
some
advantage
over
older
forms
*punct* ;
and
those
forms
*punct* ,
which
are
already
dominant
*punct* ,
or
have
some
advantage
over
the
other
forms
in
their
own
country
*punct* ,
would
naturally
oftenest
give
rise
to
new
varieties
or
incipient
species
*punct* ;
for
these
latter
must
be
victorious
in
a
still
higher
degree
in
order
to
be
preserved
and
to
survive
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
distinct
evidence
on
this
head
*punct* ,
in
the
plants
which
are
dominant
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
which
are
commonest
in
their
own
homes
*punct* ,
and
are
most
widely
diffused
*punct* ,
having
produced
the
greatest
number
of
new
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
also
natural
that
the
dominant
*punct* ,
varying
*punct* ,
and
far-spreading
species
*punct* ,
which
already
have
invaded
to
a
certain
extent
the
territories
of
other
species
*punct* ,
should
be
those
which
would
have
the
best
chance
of
spreading
still
further
*punct* ,
and
of
giving
rise
in
new
countries
to
new
varieties
and
species
*punct* .
*break*
the
process
of
diffusion
may
often
be
very
slow
*punct* ,
being
dependent
on
climatal
and
geographical
changes
*punct* ,
or
on
strange
accidents
*punct* ,
but
in
the
long
run
the
dominant
forms
will
generally
succeed
in
spreading
*punct* .
*break*
the
diffusion
would
*punct* ,
it
is
probable
*punct* ,
be
slower
with
the
terrestrial
inhabitants
of
distinct
continents
than
with
the
marine
inhabitants
of
the
continuous
sea
*punct* .
*break*
we
might
therefore
expect
to
find
*punct* ,
as
we
apparently
do
find
*punct* ,
a
less
strict
degree
of
parallel
succession
in
the
productions
of
the
land
than
of
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
dominant
species
spreading
from
any
region
might
encounter
still
more
dominant
species
*punct* ,
and
then
their
triumphant
course
*punct* ,
or
even
their
existence
*punct* ,
would
cease
*punct* .
*break*
we
know
not
at
all
precisely
what
are
all
the
conditions
most
favourable
for
the
multiplication
of
new
and
dominant
species
*punct* ;
but
we
can
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
clearly
see
that
a
number
of
individuals
*punct* ,
from
giving
a
better
chance
of
the
appearance
of
favourable
variations
*punct* ,
and
that
severe
competition
with
many
already
existing
forms
*punct* ,
would
be
highly
favourable
*punct* ,
as
would
be
the
power
of
spreading
into
new
territories
*punct* .
*break*
a
certain
amount
of
isolation
*punct* ,
recurring
at
long
intervals
of
time
*punct* ,
would
probably
be
also
favourable
*punct* ,
as
before
explained
*punct* .
*break*
one
quarter
of
the
world
may
have
been
most
favourable
for
the
production
of
new
and
dominant
species
on
the
land
*punct* ,
and
another
for
those
in
the
waters
of
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
if
two
great
regions
had
been
for
a
long
period
favourably
circumstanced
in
an
equal
degree
*punct* ,
whenever
their
inhabitants
met
*punct* ,
the
battle
would
be
prolonged
and
severe
*punct* ;
and
some
from
one
birthplace
and
some
from
the
other
might
be
victorious
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
the
course
of
time
*punct* ,
the
forms
dominant
in
the
highest
degree
*punct* ,
wherever
produced
*punct* ,
would
tend
everywhere
to
prevail
*punct* .
*break*
as
they
prevailed
*punct* ,
they
would
cause
the
extinction
of
other
and
inferior
forms
*punct* ;
and
as
these
inferior
forms
would
be
allied
in
groups
by
inheritance
*punct* ,
whole
groups
would
tend
slowly
to
disappear
*punct* ;
though
here
and
there
a
single
member
might
long
be
enabled
to
survive
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
as
it
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
the
parallel
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
taken
in
a
large
sense
*punct* ,
simultaneous
*punct* ,
succession
of
the
same
forms
of
life
throughout
the
world
*punct* ,
accords
well
with
the
principle
of
new
species
having
been
formed
by
dominant
species
spreading
widely
and
varying
*punct* ;
the
new
species
thus
produced
being
themselves
dominant
owing
to
inheritance
*punct* ,
and
to
having
already
had
some
advantage
over
their
parents
or
over
other
species
*punct* ;
these
again
spreading
*punct* ,
varying
*punct* ,
and
producing
new
species
*punct* .
*break*
the
forms
which
are
beaten
and
which
yield
their
places
to
the
new
and
victorious
forms
*punct* ,
will
generally
be
allied
in
groups
*punct* ,
from
inheriting
some
inferiority
in
common
*punct* ;
and
therefore
as
new
and
improved
groups
spread
throughout
the
world
*punct* ,
old
groups
will
disappear
from
the
world
*punct* ;
and
the
succession
of
forms
in
both
ways
will
everywhere
tend
to
correspond
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
one
other
remark
connected
with
this
subject
worth
making
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
given
my
reasons
for
believing
that
all
our
greater
fossiliferous
formations
were
deposited
during
periods
of
subsidence
*punct* ;
and
that
blank
intervals
of
vast
duration
occurred
during
the
periods
when
the
bed
of
the
sea
was
either
stationary
or
rising
*punct* ,
and
likewise
when
sediment
was
not
thrown
down
quickly
enough
to
embed
and
preserve
organic
remains
*punct* .
*break*
during
these
long
and
blank
intervals
i
suppose
that
the
inhabitants
of
each
region
underwent
a
considerable
amount
of
modification
and
extinction
*punct* ,
and
that
there
was
much
migration
from
other
parts
of
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
large
areas
are
affected
by
the
same
movement
*punct* ,
it
is
probable
that
strictly
contemporaneous
formations
have
often
been
accumulated
over
very
wide
spaces
in
the
same
quarter
of
the
world
*punct* ;
but
we
are
far
from
having
any
right
to
conclude
that
this
has
invariably
been
the
case
*punct* ,
and
that
large
areas
have
invariably
been
affected
by
the
same
movements
*punct* .
*break*
when
two
formations
have
been
deposited
in
two
regions
during
nearly
*punct* ,
but
not
exactly
the
same
period
*punct* ,
we
should
find
in
both
*punct* ,
from
the
causes
explained
in
the
foregoing
paragraphs
*punct* ,
the
same
general
succession
in
the
forms
of
life
*punct* ;
but
the
species
would
not
exactly
correspond
*punct* ;
for
there
will
have
been
a
little
more
time
in
the
one
region
than
in
the
other
for
modification
*punct* ,
extinction
*punct* ,
and
immigration
*punct* .
*break*
i
suspect
that
cases
of
this
nature
have
occurred
in
europe
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
prestwich
*punct* ,
in
his
admirable
memoirs
on
the
eocene
deposits
of
england
and
france
*punct* ,
is
able
to
draw
a
close
general
parallelism
between
the
successive
stages
in
the
two
countries
*punct* ;
but
when
he
compares
certain
stages
in
england
with
those
in
france
*punct* ,
although
he
finds
in
both
a
curious
accordance
in
the
numbers
of
the
species
belonging
to
the
same
genera
*punct* ,
yet
the
species
themselves
differ
in
a
manner
very
difficult
to
account
for
*punct* ,
considering
the
proximity
of
the
two
areas,
*punct* ,
unless
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
it
be
assumed
that
an
isthmus
separated
two
seas
inhabited
by
distinct
*punct* ,
but
contemporaneous
*punct* ,
faunas
*punct* .
*break*
lyell
has
made
similar
observations
on
some
of
the
later
tertiary
formations
*punct* .
*break*
barrande
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
shows
that
there
is
a
striking
general
parallelism
in
the
successive
silurian
deposits
of
bohemia
and
scandinavia
*punct* ;
nevertheless
he
finds
a
surprising
amount
of
difference
in
the
species
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
several
formations
in
these
regions
have
not
been
deposited
during
the
same
exact
periods,
*punct* ,
a
formation
in
one
region
often
corresponding
with
a
blank
interval
in
the
other,
*punct* ,
and
if
in
both
regions
the
species
have
gone
on
slowly
changing
during
the
accumulation
of
the
several
formations
and
during
the
long
intervals
of
time
between
them
*punct* ;
in
this
case
*punct* ,
the
several
formations
in
the
two
regions
could
be
arranged
in
the
same
order
*punct* ,
in
accordance
with
the
general
succession
of
the
form
of
life
*punct* ,
and
the
order
would
falsely
appear
to
be
strictly
parallel
*punct* ;

the
species
would
not

be

corresponding

*punct* ,
let
us
now
look
to
the
mutual
affinities
of
extinct
and
living
species
*punct* .
*break*
they
all
fall
into
one
grand
natural
system
*punct* ;
and
this
fact
is
at
once
explained
on
the
principle
of
descent
*punct* .
*break*
the
more
ancient
any
form
is
*punct* ,
the
more
*punct* ,
as
a
general
rule
*punct* ,
it
differs
from
living
forms
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
buckland
long
ago
remarked
*punct* ,
all
fossils
can
be
classed
either
in
still
existing
groups
*punct* ,
or
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
that
the
extinct
forms
of
life
help
to
fill
up
the
wide
intervals
between
existing
genera
*punct* ,
families
*punct* ,
and
orders
*punct* ,
cannot
be
disputed
*punct* .
*break*
for
if
we
confine
our
attention
either
to
the
living
or
to
the
extinct
alone
*punct* ,
the
series
is
far
less
perfect
than
if
we
combine
both
into
one
general
system
*punct* .
*break*
with
respect
to
the
vertebrata
*punct* ,
whole
pages
could
be
filled
with
striking
illustrations
from
our
great
palaeontologist
*punct* ,
owen
*punct* ,
showing
how
extinct
animals
fall
in
between
existing
groups
*punct* .
*break*
cuvier
ranked
the
ruminants
and
pachyderms
*punct* ,
as
the
two
most
distinct
orders
of
mammals
*punct* ;
but
owen
has
discovered
so
many
fossil
links
*punct* ,
that
he
has
had
to
alter
the
whole
classification
of
these
two
orders
*punct* ;
and
has
placed
certain
pachyderms
in
the
same
sub-order
with
ruminants
*punct* :
for
example
*punct* ,
he
dissolves
by
fine
gradations
the
apparently
wide
difference
between
the
pig
and
the
camel
*punct* .
*break*
in
regard
to
the
invertebrata
*punct* ,
barrande
*punct* ,
and
a
higher
authority
could
not
be
named
*punct* ,
asserts
that
he
is
every
day
taught
that
palaeozoic
animals
*punct* ,
though
belonging
to
the
same
orders
*punct* ,
families
*punct* ,
or
genera
with
those
living
at
the
present
day
*punct* ,
were
not
at
this
early
epoch
limited
in
such
distinct
groups
as
they
now
are
*punct* .
*break*
some
writers
have
objected
to
any
extinct
species
or
group
of
species
being
considered
as
intermediate
between
living
species
or
groups
*punct* .
*break*
if
by
this
term
it
is
meant
that
an
extinct
form
is
directly
intermediate
in
all
its
characters
between
two
living
forms
*punct* ,
the
objection
is
probably
valid
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
apprehend
that
in
a
perfectly
natural
classification
many
fossil
species
would
have
to
stand
between
living
species
*punct* ,
and
some
extinct
genera
between
living
genera
*punct* ,
even
between
genera
belonging
to
distinct
families
*punct* .
*break*
the
most
common
case
*punct* ,
especially
with
respect
to
very
distinct
groups
*punct* ,
such
as
fish
and
reptiles
*punct* ,
seems
to
be
*punct* ,
that
supposing
them
to
be
distinguished
at
the
present
day
from
each
other
by
a
dozen
characters
*punct* ,
the
ancient
members
of
the
same
two
groups
would
be
distinguished
by
a
somewhat
lesser
number
of
characters
*punct* ,
so
that
the
two
groups
*punct* ,
though
formerly
quite
distinct
*punct* ,
at
that
period
made
some
small
approach
to
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
common
belief
that
the
more
ancient
a
form
is
*punct* ,
by
so
much
the
more
it
tends
to
connect
by
some
of
its
characters
groups
now
widely
separated
from
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
this
remark
no
doubt
must
be
restricted
to
those
groups
which
have
undergone
much
change
in
the
course
of
geological
ages
*punct* ;
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
proposition
*punct* ,
for
every
now
and
then
even
a
living
animal
*punct* ,
as
the
lepidosiren
*punct* ,
is
discovered
having
affinities
directed
towards
very
distinct
groups
*punct* .
*break*
yet
if
we
compare
the
older
reptiles
and
batrachians
*punct* ,
the
older
fish
*punct* ,
the
older
cephalopods
*punct* ,
and
the
eocene
mammals
*punct* ,
with
the
more
recent
members
of
the
same
classes
*punct* ,
we
must
admit
that
there
is
some
truth
in
the
remark
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
see
how
far
these
several
facts
and
inferences
accord
with
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
subject
is
somewhat
complex
*punct* ,
i
must
request
the
reader
to
turn
to
the
diagram
in
the
fourth
chapter
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
suppose
that
the
numbered
letters
represent
genera
*punct* ,
and
the
dotted
lines
diverging
from
them
the
species
in
each
genus
*punct* .
*break*
the
diagram
is
much
too
simple
*punct* ,
too
few
genera
and
too
few
species
being
given
*punct* ,
but
this
is
unimportant
for
us
*punct* .
*break*
the
horizontal
lines
may
represent
successive
geological
formations
*punct* ,
and
all
the
forms
beneath
the
uppermost
line
may
be
considered
as
extinct
*punct* .
*break*
the
three
existing
genera
*punct* ,
a14
*punct* ,
q14
*punct* ,
p14
*punct* ,
will
form
a
small
family
*punct* ;
b14
and
f14
a
closely
allied
family
or
sub-family
*punct* ;
and
o14
*punct* ,
e14
*punct* ,
m14
*punct* ,
a
third
family
*punct* .
*break*
these
three
families
*punct* ,
together
with
the
many
extinct
genera
on
the
several
lines
of
descent
diverging
from
the
parent-form
a
*punct* ,
will
form
an
order
*punct* ;
for
all
will
have
inherited
something
in
common
from
their
ancient
and
common
progenitor
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
principle
of
the
continued
tendency
to
divergence
of
character
*punct* ,
which
was
formerly
illustrated
by
this
diagram
*punct* ,
the
more
recent
any
form
is
*punct* ,
the
more
it
will
generally
differ
from
its
ancient
progenitor
*punct* .
*break*
hence
we
can
understand
the
rule
that
the
most
ancient
fossils
differ
most
from
existing
forms
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
not
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
assume
that
divergence
of
character
is
a
necessary
contingency
*punct* ;
it
depends
solely
on
the
descendants
from
a
species
being
thus
enabled
to
seize
on
many
and
different
places
in
the
economy
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
it
is
quite
possible
*punct* ,
as
we
have
seen
in
the
case
of
some
silurian
forms
*punct* ,
that
a
species
might
go
on
being
slightly
modified
in
relation
to
its
slightly
altered
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
and
yet
retain
throughout
a
vast
period
the
same
general
characteristics
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
represented
in
the
diagram
by
the
letter
f14
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
many
forms
*punct* ,
extinct
and
recent
*punct* ,
descended
from
a
*punct* ,
make
*punct* ,
as
before
remarked
*punct* ,
one
order
*punct* ;
and
this
order
*punct* ,
from
the
continued
effects
of
extinction
and
divergence
of
character
*punct* ,
has
become
divided
into
several
sub-families
and
families
*punct* ,
some
of
which
are
supposed
to
have
perished
at
different
periods
*punct* ,
and
some
to
have
endured
to
the
present
day
*punct* .
*break*
by
looking
at
the
diagram
we
can
see
that
if
many
of
the
extinct
forms
*punct* ,
supposed
to
be
embedded
in
the
successive
formations
*punct* ,
were
discovered
at
several
points
low
down
in
the
series
*punct* ,
the
three
existing
families

by
a

circuitous
course
through

a14

would
have

the

namely
*punct* ,
a14
to
f14
now
including
five
genera
*punct* ,
and
o14

remain

*break*
these
two

however
*punct* ,
would
be
less
distinct
from
each
other
than
they
were
before
the
discovery
of
the

*punct* .
*break*
if
*punct* ,
for

*punct* ,
we
suppose
the
existing
genera
of
the
two
families
to
differ
from
each
other
by
a
dozen
characters
*punct* ,
in
this
case
the
genera
*punct* ,
at
the
early
period
marked
vi.
*punct* ,
would
differ
by
a
lesser
number
of
characters
*punct* ;
for
at
this
early
stage
of
descent
they
have
not
diverged
in
character
from
the
common
progenitor
of
the
order
*punct* ,
nearly
so
much
as
they
subsequently
diverged
*punct* .
*break*
thus
it
comes
that
ancient
and
extinct
genera
are
often
in
some
slight
degree
intermediate
in
character
between
their
modified
descendants
*punct* ,
or
between
their
collateral
relations
*punct* .
*break*
in
nature
the
case
will
be
far
more
complicated
than
is
represented
in
the
diagram
*punct* ;
for
the
groups
will
have
been
more
numerous
*punct* ,
they
will
have
endured
for
extremely
unequal
lengths
of
time
*punct* ,
and
will
have
been
modified
in
various
degrees
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
possess
only
the
last
volume
of
the
geological
record
*punct* ,
and
that
in
a
very
broken
condition
*punct* ,
we
have
no
right
to
expect
*punct* ,
except
in
very
rare
cases
*punct* ,
to
fill
up
wide
intervals
in
the
natural
system
*punct* ,
and
thus
unite
distinct
families
or
orders
*punct* .
*break*
all
that
we
have
a
right
to
expect
*punct* ,
is
that
those
groups
*punct* ,
which
have
within
known
geological
periods
undergone
much
modification
*punct* ,
should
in
the
older
formations
make
some
slight
approach
to
each
other
*punct* ;
so
that
the
older
members
should
differ
less
from
each
other
in
some
of
their
characters
than
do
the
existing
members
of
the
same
groups
*punct* ;
and
this
by
the
concurrent
evidence
of
our
best
palaeontologists
seems
frequently
to
be
the
case
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
on
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
*punct* ,
the
main
facts
with
respect
to
the
mutual
affinities
of
the
extinct
forms
of
life
to
each
other
and
to
living
forms
*punct* ,
seem
to
me
explained
in
a
satisfactory
manner
*punct* .
*break*
and
they
are
wholly
inexplicable
on
any
other
view
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
same
theory
*punct* ,
it
is
evident
that
the
fauna
of
any
great
period
in
the
earth's
history
will
be
intermediate
in
general
character
between
that
which
preceded
and
that
which
succeeded
it
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
the
species
which
lived
at
the
sixth
great
stage
of
descent
in
the
diagram
are
the
modified
offspring
of
those
which
lived
at
the
fifth
stage
*punct* ,
and
are
the
parents
of
those
which
became
still
more
modified
at
the
seventh
stage
*punct* ;
hence
they
could
hardly
fail
to
be
nearly
intermediate
in
character
between
the
forms
of
life
above
and
below
*punct* .
*break*
we
must
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
allow
for
the
entire
extinction
of
some
preceding
forms
*punct* ,
and
for
the
coming
in
of
quite
new
forms
by
immigration
*punct* ,
and
for
a
large
amount
of
modification
*punct* ,
during
the
long
and
blank
intervals
between
the
successive
formations
*punct* .
*break*
subject
to
these
allowances
*punct* ,
the
fauna
of
each
geological
period
undoubtedly
is
intermediate
in
character
*punct* ,
between
the
preceding
and
succeeding
faunas
*punct* .
*break*
i
need
give
only
one
instance
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
the
manner
in
which
the
fossils
of
the
devonian
system
*punct* ,
when
this
system
was
first
discovered
*punct* ,
were
at
once
recognised
by
palaeontologists
as
intermediate
in
character
between
those
of
the
overlying
carboniferous
*punct* ,
and
underlying
silurian
system
*punct* .
*break*
but
each
fauna
is
not
necessarily
exactly
intermediate
*punct* ,
as
unequal
intervals
of
time
have
elapsed
between
consecutive
formations
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
no
real
objection
to
the
truth
of
the
statement
*punct* ,
that
the
fauna
of
each
period
as
a
whole
is
nearly
intermediate
in
character
between
the
preceding
and
succeeding
faunas
*punct* ,
that
certain
genera
offer
exceptions
to
the
rule
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
mastodons
and
elephants
*punct* ,
when
arranged
by
dr.
falconer
in
two
series
*punct* ,
first
according
to
their
mutual
affinities
and
then
according
to
their
periods
of
existence
*punct* ,
do
not
accord
in
arrangement
*punct* .
*break*
the
species
extreme
in
character
are
not
the
oldest
*punct* ,
or
the
most
recent
*punct* ;
nor
are
those
which
are
intermediate
in
character
*punct* ,
intermediate
in
age
*punct* .
*break*
but
supposing
for
an
instant
*punct* ,
in
this
and
other
such
cases
*punct* ,
that
the
record
of
the
first
appearance
and
disappearance
of
the
species
was
perfect
*punct* ,
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
forms
successively
produced
necessarily
endure
for
corresponding
lengths
of
time
*punct* :
a
very
ancient
form
might
occasionally
last
much
longer
than
a
form
elsewhere
subsequently
produced
*punct* ,
especially
in
the
case
of
terrestrial
productions
inhabiting
separated
districts
*punct* .
*break*
to
compare
small
things
with
great
*punct* :
if
the
principal
living
and
extinct
races
of
the
domestic
pigeon
were
arranged
as
well
as
they
could
be
in
serial
affinity
*punct* ,
this
arrangement
would
not
closely
accord
with
the
order
in
time
of
their
production
*punct* ,
and
still
less
with
the
order
of
their
disappearance
*punct* ;
for
the
parent
rock-pigeon
now
lives
*punct* ;
and
many
varieties
between
the
rock-pigeon
and
the
carrier
have
become
extinct
*punct* ;
and
carriers
which
are
extreme
in
the
important
character
of
length
of
beak
originated
earlier
than
short-beaked
tumblers
*punct* ,
which
are
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
series
in
this
same
respect
*punct* .
*break*
closely
connected
with
the
statement
*punct* ,
that
the
organic
remains
from
an
intermediate
formation
are
in
some
degree
intermediate
in
character
*punct* ,
is
the
fact
*punct* ,
insisted
on
by
all
palaeontologists
*punct* ,
that
fossils
from
two
consecutive
formations
are
far
more
closely
related
to
each
other
*punct* ,
than
are
the
fossils
from
two
remote
formations
*punct* .
*break*
pictet
gives
as
a
well-known
instance
*punct* ,
the
general
resemblance
of
the
organic
remains
from
the
several
stages
of
the
chalk
formation
*punct* ,
though
the
species
are
distinct
in
each
stage
*punct* .
*break*
this
fact
alone
*punct* ,
from
its
generality
*punct* ,
seems
to
have
shaken
professor
pictet
in
his
firm
belief
in
the
immutability
of
species
*punct* .
*break*
he
who
is
acquainted
with
the
distribution
of
existing
species
over
the
globe
*punct* ,
will
not
attempt
to
account
for
the
close
resemblance
of
the
distinct
species
in
closely
consecutive
formations
*punct* ,
by
the
physical
conditions
of
the
ancient
areas
having
remained
nearly
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
let
it
be
remembered
that
the
forms
of
life
*punct* ,
at
least
those
inhabiting
the
sea
*punct* ,
have
changed
almost
simultaneously
throughout
the
world
*punct* ,
and
therefore
under
the
most
different
climates
and
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
consider
the
prodigious
vicissitudes
of
climate
during
the
pleistocene
period
*punct* ,
which
includes
the
whole
glacial
period
*punct* ,
and
note
how
little
the
specific
forms
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
sea
have
been
affected
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
theory
of

the
full
meaning

the
fact
of
fossil
remains
from
closely
consecutive
formations
*punct* ,
though
ranked
as
distinct
species
*punct* ,
being
closely
related
*punct* ,
is
obvious
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
accumulation
of
each
formation
has
often
been
interrupted
*punct* ,
and
as
long
blank
intervals
have
intervened
between
successive
formations
*punct* ,
we
ought
not
to
expect
to
find
*punct* ,
as
i
attempted
to
show
in
the
last
chapter
*punct* ,
in
any
one

two
formations
all
the
intermediate
varieties
between
the
species
which
appeared
at
the
commencement

these
periods

but
we
ought
to
find
after
intervals
*punct* ,
very
long
as
measured
by
years

only
moderately
long
as
measured
geologically
*punct* ,
closely
allied
forms

they
have
been
called
by
some
authors

representative
species

these
we
assuredly
do
find
*punct* .
*break*
we
find
*punct* ,
in
short
*punct* ,
such
evidence
of
the
slow
and
scarcely
sensible
mutation
of
specific
forms
*punct* ,
as
we
have
a
just
right
to
expect
to
find
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
state
of
development
of
ancient
forms.
*punct* ,
there
has
been
much
discussion
whether
recent
forms
are
more
highly
developed
than
ancient
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
not
here
enter
on
this
subject
*punct* ,
for
naturalists
have
not
as
yet
defined
to
each
other's
satisfaction
what
is
meant
by
high
and
low
forms
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
one
particular
sense
the
more
recent
forms
must
*punct* ,
on
my
theory
*punct* ,
be
higher
than
the
more
ancient
*punct* ;
for
each
new
species
is
formed
by
having
had
some
advantage
in
the
struggle
for
life
over
other
and
preceding
forms
*punct* .
*break*
if
under
a
nearly
similar
climate
*punct* ,
the
eocene
inhabitants
of
one
quarter
of
the
world
were
put
into
competition
with
the
existing
inhabitants
of
the
same
or
some
other
quarter
*punct* ,
the
eocene
fauna
or
flora
would
certainly
be
beaten
and
exterminated
*punct* ;
as
would
a
secondary
fauna
by
an
eocene
*punct* ,
and
a
palaeozoic
fauna
by
a
secondary
fauna
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
doubt
that
this
process
of
improvement
has
affected
in
a
marked
and
sensible
manner
the
organisation
of
the
more
recent
and
victorious
forms
of
life
*punct* ,
in
comparison
with
the
ancient
and
beaten
forms
*punct* ;
but
i
can
see
no
way
of
testing
this
sort
of
progress
*punct* .
*break*
crustaceans
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
not
the
highest
in
their
own
class
*punct* ,
may
have
beaten
the
highest
molluscs
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
extraordinary
manner
in
which
european
productions
have
recently
spread
over
new
zealand
*punct* ,
and
have
seized
on
places
which
must
have
been
previously
occupied
*punct* ,
we
may
believe
*punct* ,
if
all
the
animals
and
plants
of
great
britain
were
set
free
in
new
zealand
*punct* ,
that
in
the
course
of
time
a
multitude
of
british
forms
would
become
thoroughly
naturalized
there
*punct* ,
and
would
exterminate
many
of
the
natives
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
from
what
we
see
now
occurring
in
new
zealand
*punct* ,
and
from
hardly
a
single
inhabitant
of
the
southern
hemisphere
having
become
wild
in
any
part
of
europe
*punct* ,
we
may
doubt
*punct* ,
if
all
the
productions
of
new
zealand
were
set
free
in
great
britain
*punct* ,
whether
any
considerable
number
would
be
enabled
to
seize
on
places
now
occupied
by
our
native
plants
and
animals
*punct* .
*break*
under
this
point
of
view
*punct* ,
the
productions
of
great
britain
may
be
said
to
be
higher
than
those
of
new
zealand
*punct* .
*break*
yet
the
most
skilful
naturalist
from
an
examination
of
the
species
of
the
two
countries
could
not
have
foreseen
this
result
*punct* .
*break*
agassiz
insists
that
ancient
animals
resemble
to
a
certain
extent
the
embryos
of
recent
animals
of
the
same
classes
*punct* ;
or
that
the
geological
succession
of
extinct
forms
is
in
some
degree
parallel
to
the
embryological
development
of
recent
forms
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
follow
pictet
and
huxley
in
thinking
that
the
truth
of
this
doctrine
is
very
far
from
proved
*punct* .
*break*
yet
i
fully
expect
to
see
it
hereafter
confirmed
*punct* ,
at
least
in
regard
to
subordinate
groups
*punct* ,
which
have
branched
off
from
each
other
within
comparatively
recent
times
*punct* .
*break*
for
this
doctrine
of
agassiz
accords
well
with
the
theory
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
future
chapter
i
shall
attempt
to
show
that
the
adult
differs
from
its
embryo
*punct* ,
owing
to
variations
supervening
at
a
not
early
age
*punct* ,
and
being
inherited
at
a
corresponding
age
*punct* .
*break*
this
process
*punct* ,
whilst
it
leaves
the
embryo
almost
unaltered
*punct* ,
continually
adds
*punct* ,
in
the
course
of
successive
generations
*punct* ,
more
and
more
difference
to
the
adult
*punct* .
*break*
thus
the
embryo
comes
to
be
left
as
a
sort
of
picture
*punct* ,
preserved
by
nature
*punct* ,
of
the
ancient
and
less
modified
condition
of
each
animal
*punct* .
*break*
this
view
may
be
true
*punct* ,
and
yet
it
may
never
be
capable
of
full
proof
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
that
the
oldest
known
mammals
*punct* ,
reptiles
*punct* ,
and
fish
strictly
belong
to
their
own
proper
classes
*punct* ,
though
some
of
these
old
forms
are
in
a
slight
degree
less
distinct
from
each
other
than
are
the
typical
members
of
the

groups
at
the
present
day
*punct* ,
it
would
be
vain
to
look
for
animals
having
the
common
embryological
character
of
the
vertebrata
*punct* ,
until
beds
far
beneath
the
lowest
silurian
strata
are
discovered
*punct* ,
a
discovery

which
the
chance
is
very
small

the
succession
of
the

types

the

the
later
tertiary
periods.
*punct* ,
mr.
clift
many
years
ago
showed
that
the
fossil
mammals
from

australian
caves
were
closely
allied
to
the
living
marsupials
of
that
continent
*punct* .
*break*

a
similar
relationship

manifest

gigantic

much
impressed
with
these
facts
that
i
strongly
insisted
*punct* ,
in

1845
*punct* ,
on
this
law
of
the
succession
of
types,'

on
this
wonderful
relationship

the

professor
owen
has
subsequently
extended
the
same
generalisation
to
the
mammals
of
the
old
world
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
the
same
law
in
this
author's
restorations
of
the
extinct

gigantic
birds
of
new
zealand
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
it
also
in
the
birds
of
the
caves
of
brazil
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
woodward
has
shown
that
the
same
law
holds
good
with
sea-shells
*punct* ,
but
from
the
wide
distribution
of
most
genera
of
molluscs
*punct* ,
it
is
not
well
displayed
by
them
*punct* .
*break*
other
cases
could
be
added
*punct* ,
as
the
relation
between
the
extinct
and
living
land-shells
of
madeira
*punct* ;
and
between
the
extinct
and
living
brackish-water
shells
of
the
aralo-caspian
sea
*punct* .
*break*
now
what
does
this
remarkable
law
of
the
succession
of
the
same
types
within
the
same
areas
mean
*punct* ?
*break*
he
would
be
a
bold
man
*punct* ,
who
after
comparing
the
present
climate
of
australia
and
of
parts
of
south
america
under
the
same
latitude
*punct* ,
would
attempt
to
account
*punct* ,
on
the
one
hand
*punct* ,
by
dissimilar
physical
conditions
for
the
dissimilarity
of
the
inhabitants
of
these
two
continents
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
by
similarity
of
conditions
*punct* ,
for
the
uniformity
of
the
same
types
in
each
during
the
later
tertiary
periods
*punct* .
*break*
nor
can
it
be
pretended
that
it
is
an
immutable
law
that
marsupials
should
have
been
chiefly
or
solely
produced
in
australia
*punct* ;
or
that
edentata
and
other
american
types
should
have
been
solely
produced
in
south
america
*punct* .
*break*
for
we
know
that
europe
in
ancient
times
was
peopled
by
numerous
marsupials
*punct* ;
and
i
have
shown
in
the
publications
above
alluded
to
*punct* ,
that
in
america
the
law
of
distribution
of
terrestrial
mammals
was
formerly
different
from
what
it
now
is
*punct* .
*break*
north
america
formerly
partook
strongly
of
the
present
character
of
the
southern
half
of
the
continent
*punct* ;
and
the
southern
half
was
formerly
more
closely
allied
*punct* ,
than
it
is
at
present
*punct* ,
to
the
northern
half
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
similar
manner
we
know
from
falconer
and
cautley's
discoveries
*punct* ,
that
northern
india
was
formerly
more
closely
related
in
its
mammals
to
africa
than
it
is
at
the
present
time
*punct* .
*break*
analogous
facts
could
be
given
in
relation
to
the
distribution
of
marine
animals
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
*punct* ,
the
great
law
of
the
long
enduring
*punct* ,
but
not
immutable
*punct* ,
succession
of
the
same
types
within
the
same
areas
*punct* ,
is
at
once
explained
*punct* ;
for
the
inhabitants
of
each
quarter
of
the
world
will
obviously
tend
to
leave
in
that
quarter
*punct* ,
during
the
next
succeeding
period
of
time
*punct* ,
closely
allied
though
in
some
degree
modified
descendants
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
inhabitants
of
one
continent
formerly
differed
greatly
from
those
of
another
continent
*punct* ,
so
will
their
modified
descendants
still
differ
in
nearly
the
same
manner
and
degree
*punct* .
*break*
but
after
very
long
intervals
of
time
and
after
great
geographical
changes
*punct* ,
permitting
much
inter-migration
*punct* ,
the
feebler
will
yield
to
the
more
dominant
forms
*punct* ,
and
there
will
be
nothing
immutable
in
the
laws
of
past
and
present
distribution
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
be
asked
in
ridicule
*punct* ,
whether
i
suppose
that
the
megatherium
and
other
allied
huge
monsters
have
left
behind
them
in
south
america
the
sloth
*punct* ,
armadillo
*punct* ,
and
anteater
*punct* ,
as
their
degenerate
descendants
*punct* .
*break*
this
cannot
for
an
instant
be
admitted
*punct* .
*break*
these
huge
animals
have
become
wholly
extinct
*punct* ,
and
have
left
no
progeny
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
the
caves
of
brazil
*punct* ,
there
are
many
extinct
species
which
are
closely
allied
in
size
and
in
other
characters
to
the
species
still
living
in
south
america
*punct* ;
and
some
of
these
fossils
may
be
the
actual
progenitors
of
living
species
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
*punct* ,
on
my
theory
*punct* ,
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
have
descended
from
some
one
species
*punct* ;
so
that
if
six
genera
*punct* ,
each
having
eight
species
*punct* ,
be
found
in
one
geological
formation
*punct* ,
and
in
the
next
succeeding
formation
there
be
six
other
allied
or
representative
genera
with
the
same
number
of
species
*punct* ,
then
we
may
conclude
that
only
one
species
of
each
of
the
six
older
genera
has
left
modified
descendants
*punct* ,
constituting
the
six
new
genera
*punct* .
*break*
the
other
seven
species
of
the
old
genera
have
all
died
out
and
have
left
no
progeny
*punct* .
*break*
or
*punct* ,
which
would
probably
be
a
far
commoner
case
*punct* ,
two
or
three
species
of
two
or
three
alone
of
the
six
older
genera
will
have
been
the
parents
of
the
six
new
genera
*punct* ;
the
other
old
species
and
the
other
whole
genera
having
become
utterly
extinct
*punct* .
*break*
in
failing
orders
*punct* ,
with
the
genera
and
species
decreasing
in
numbers
*punct* ,
as
apparently
is
the
case
of
the
edentata
of
south
america
*punct* ,
still
fewer
genera
and
species
will
have
left
modified
blood-descendants
*punct* .
*break*
summary
of
the
preceding
and
present
chapters
*punct* ,
i
have
attempted
to
show
that
the
geological
record
is
extremely
imperfect
*punct* ;
that
only
a
small
portion
of
the
globe
has
been
geologically
explored
with
care
*punct* ;
that
only
certain
classes
of
organic
beings
have
been
largely
preserved
in
a
fossil
state
*punct* ;
that
the
number
both
of
specimens
and
of
species
*punct* ,
preserved
in
our
museums
*punct* ,
is
absolutely
as
nothing
compared
with
the
incalculable
number
of
generations
which
must
have
passed
away
even
during
a
single
formation
*punct* ;
that
*punct* ,
owing
to
subsidence
being
necessary
for
the
accumulation
of
fossiliferous
deposits
thick
enough
to
resist
future
degradation
*punct* ,
enormous
intervals
of
time
have
elapsed
between
the
successive
formations
*punct* ;
that
there
has
probably
been
more
extinction
during
the
periods
of
subsidence
*punct* ,
and
more
variation
during
the
periods
of
elevation
*punct* ,
and
during
the
latter
the
record
will
have
been
least
perfectly
kept
*punct* ;
that
each
single
formation
has
not
been
continuously
deposited
*punct* ;
that
the
duration
of
each
formation
is
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
short
compared
with
the
average
duration
of
specific
forms
*punct* ;
that
migration
has
played
an
important
part
in
the
first
appearance
of
new
forms
in
any
one
area
and
formation
*punct* ;
that
widely
ranging
species
are
those
which
have
varied
most
*punct* ,
and
have
oftenest
given
rise
to
new
species
*punct* ;
and
that
varieties
have
at
first
often
been
local
*punct* .
*break*
all
these
causes
taken
conjointly
*punct* ,
must
have
tended
to
make
the
geological
record
extremely
imperfect
*punct* ,
and
will
to
a
large
extent
explain
why
we
do
not
find
interminable
varieties
*punct* ,
connecting
together
all
the
extinct
and
existing
forms
of
life
by
the
finest
graduated
steps
*punct* .
*break*
he
who
rejects
these
views
on
the
nature
of
the
geological
record
*punct* ,
will
rightly
reject
my
whole
theory
*punct* .
*break*
for
he
may
ask
in
vain
where
are
the
numberless
transitional
links
which
must
formerly
have
connected
the
closely
allied
or
representative
species
*punct* ,
found
in
the
several
stages
of
the
same
great
formation
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
disbelieve
in
the
enormous
intervals
of
time
which
have
elapsed
between
our
consecutive
formations
*punct* ;
he
may
overlook
how
important
a
part
migration
must
have
played
*punct* ,
when
the
formations
of
any
one
great
region
alone
*punct* ,
as
that
of
europe
*punct* ,
are
considered
*punct* ;
he
may
urge
the
apparent
*punct* ,
but
often
falsely
apparent
*punct* ,
sudden
coming
in
of
whole
groups
of
species
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
ask
where
are
the
remains
of
those
infinitely
numerous
organisms
which
must
have
existed
long
before
the
first
bed
of
the
silurian
system
was
deposited
*punct* :
i
can
answer
this
latter
question
only
hypothetically
*punct* ,
by
saying
that
as
far
as
we
can
see
*punct* ,
where
our
oceans
now
extend
they
have
for
an
enormous
period
extended
*punct* ,
and
where
our
oscillating
continents
now
stand
they
have
stood
ever
since
the
silurian
epoch
*punct* ;
but
that
long
before
that
period
*punct* ,
the
world
may
have
presented
a
wholly
different
aspect
*punct* ;
and
that
the
older
continents
*punct* ,
formed
of
formations
older
than
any
known
to
us
*punct* ,
may
now
all
be
in
a
metamorphosed
condition
*punct* ,
or
may
lie
buried
under
the
ocean
*punct* .
*break*
passing
from
these
difficulties
*punct* ,
all
the
other
great
leading
facts
in
palaeontology
seem
to
me
simply
to
follow
on
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
through
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
thus
understand
how
it
is
that
new
species
come
in
slowly
and
successively
*punct* ;
how
species
of
different
classes
do
not
necessarily
change
together
*punct* ,
or
at
the
same
rate
*punct* ,
or
in
the
same
degree
*punct* ;
yet
in
the
long
run
that
all
undergo
modification
to
some
extent
*punct* .
*break*
the
extinction
of
old
forms
is
the
almost
inevitable
consequence
of
the
production
of
new
forms
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
understand
why
when
a
species
has
once
disappeared
it
never
reappears
*punct* .
*break*
groups
of
species
increase
in
numbers
slowly
*punct* ,
and
endure
for
unequal
periods
of
time
*punct* ;
for
the
process
of
modification
is
necessarily
slow
*punct* ,
and
depends
on
many
complex
contingencies
*punct* .
*break*
the
dominant
species
of
the
larger
dominant
groups
tend
to
leave
many
modified
descendants
*punct* ,
and
thus
new
sub-groups
and
groups
are
formed
*punct* .
*break*
as
these
are
formed
*punct* ,
the
species
of
the
less
vigorous
groups
*punct* ,
from
their
inferiority
inherited
from
a
common
progenitor
*punct* ,
tend
to
become
extinct
together
*punct* ,
and
to
leave
no
modified
offspring
on
the
face
of
the
earth
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
utter
extinction
of
a
whole
group
of
species
may
often
be
a
very
slow
process
*punct* ,
from
the
survival
of
a
few
descendants
*punct* ,
lingering
in
protected
and
isolated
situations
*punct* .
*break*
when
a
group
has
once
wholly
disappeared
*punct* ,
it
does
not
reappear
*punct* ;
for
the
link
of
generation
has
been
broken
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
understand
how
the
spreading
of
the
dominant
forms
of
life
*punct* ,
which
are
those
that
oftenest
vary
*punct* ,
will
in
the
long
run
tend
to
people
the
world
with
allied
*punct* ,
but
modified
*punct* ,
descendants
*punct* ;
and
these
will
generally
succeed
in
taking
the
places
of
those
groups
of
species
which
are
their
inferiors
in
the
struggle
for
existence
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
after
long
intervals
of
time
*punct* ,
the
productions
of
the
world
will
appear
to
have
changed
simultaneously
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
all
the
forms
of
life
*punct* ,
ancient
and
recent
*punct* ,
make
together
one
grand
system
*punct* ;
for
all
are
connected
by
generation
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
understand
*punct* ,
from
the
continued
tendency
to
divergence
of
character
*punct* ,
why
the
more
ancient
a
form
is
*punct* ,
the
more
it
generally
differs
from
those
now
living
*punct* .
*break*
why
ancient
and
extinct
forms
often
tend
to
fill
up
gaps
between
existing
forms
*punct* ,
sometimes
blending
two
groups
previously
classed
as
distinct
into
one
*punct* ;
but
more
commonly
only
bringing
them
a
little
closer
together
*punct* .
*break*
the
more
ancient
a
form
is
*punct* ,
the
more
often
*punct* ,
apparently
*punct* ,
it
displays
characters
in
some
degree
intermediate
between
groups
now
distinct
*punct* ;
for
the
more
ancient
a
form
is
*punct* ,
the
more
nearly
it
will
be
related
to
*punct* ,
and
consequently
resemble
*punct* ,
the
common
progenitor
of
groups
*punct* ,
since
become
widely
divergent
*punct* .
*break*
extinct
forms
are
seldom
directly
intermediate
between
existing
forms
*punct* ;
but
are
intermediate
only
by
a
long
and
circuitous
course
through
many
extinct
and
very
different
forms
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
clearly
see
why
the
organic
remains
of
closely
consecutive
formations
are
more
closely
allied
to
each
other
*punct* ,
than
are
those
of
remote
formations
*punct* ;
for
the
forms
are
more
closely
linked
together
by
generation
*punct* :
we
can
clearly
see
why
the
remains
of
an
intermediate
formation
are
intermediate
in
character
*punct* .
*break*
the
inhabitants
of
each
successive
period
in
the
world's
history
have
beaten
their
predecessors
in
the
race
for
life
*punct* ,
and
are
*punct* ,
in
so
far
*punct* ,
higher
in
the
scale
of
nature
*punct* ;
and
this
may
account
for
that
vague
yet
ill-defined
sentiment
*punct* ,
felt
by
many
palaeontologists
*punct* ,
that
organisation
on
the
whole
has
progressed
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
should
hereafter
be
proved
that
ancient
animals
resemble
to
a
certain
extent
the
embryos
of
more
recent
animals
of
the
same
class
*punct* ,
the
fact
will
be
intelligible
*punct* .
*break*
the
succession
of
the
same
types
of
structure
within
the
same
areas
during
the
later
geological
periods
ceases
to
be
mysterious
*punct* ,
and
is
simply
explained
by
inheritance
*punct* .
*break*
if
then
the
geological
record
be
as
imperfect
as
i
believe
it
to
be
*punct* ,
and
it
may
at
least
be
asserted
that
the
record
cannot
be
proved
to
be
much
more
perfect
*punct* ,
the
main
objections
to
the
theory
of
natural
selection
are
greatly
diminished
or
disappear
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
all
the
chief
laws
of
palaeontology
plainly
proclaim
*punct* ,
as
it
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
that
species
have
been
produced
by
ordinary
generation
*punct* :
old
forms
having
been
supplanted
by
new
and
improved
forms
of
life
*punct* ,
produced
by
the
laws
of
variation
still
acting
round
us
*punct* ,
and
preserved
by
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
in
considering
the
distribution
of
organic
beings
over
the
face
of
the
globe
*punct* ,
the
first
great
fact
which
strikes
us
is
*punct* ,
that
neither
the
similarity
nor
the
dissimilarity
of
the
inhabitants
of
various
regions
can
be
accounted
for
by
their
climatal
and
other
physical
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
of
late
*punct* ,
almost
every
author
who
has
studied
the
subject
has
come
to
this
conclusion
*punct* .
*break*
the
case
of
america
alone
would
almost
suffice
to
prove
its
truth
*punct* :
for
if
we
exclude
the
northern
parts
where
the
circumpolar
land
is
almost
continuous
*punct* ,
all
authors
agree
that
one
of
the
most
fundamental
divisions
in
geographical
distribution
is
that
between
the
new
and
old
worlds
*punct* ;
yet
if
we
travel
over
the
vast
american
continent
*punct* ,
from
the
central
parts
of
the
united
states
to
its
extreme
southern
point
*punct* ,
we
meet
with
the
most
diversified
conditions

most
humid

arid
deserts

lofty

climate
or
condition
in
the
old
world
which
cannot
be
paralleled
in
the
new
*punct* ,
at
least
as
closely
as
the
same
species
generally
require
*punct* ;
for
it
is
a
most
rare
case
to
find
a
group
of
organisms
confined
to
any
small
spot
*punct* ,
having
conditions
peculiar
in
only
a
slight
degree
*punct* ;
for
instance
*punct* ,
small
areas
in
the
old
world
could
be
pointed
out
hotter
than
any
in
the
new
world
*punct* ,
yet
these
are
not
inhabited
by
a
peculiar
fauna
or
flora
*punct* .
*break*
notwithstanding
this
parallelism
in
the
conditions
of
the
old
and
new
worlds
*punct* ,
how
widely
different
are
their
living
productions
*punct* !
*break*
in
the
southern
hemisphere
*punct* ,
if
we
compare
large
tracts
of
land
in
australia
*punct* ,
south
africa
*punct* ,
and
western
south
america
*punct* ,
between
latitudes
25
deg
and
35
deg
*punct* ,
we
shall
find
parts
extremely
similar
in
all
their
conditions
*punct* ,
yet
it
would
not
be
possible
to
point
out
three
faunas
and
floras
more
utterly
dissimilar
*punct* .
*break*
or
again
we
may
compare
the
productions
of
south
america
south
of
lat
*punct* .
*break*
35
deg
with
those
north
of
25
deg
*punct* ,
which
consequently
inhabit
a
considerably
different
climate
*punct* ,
and
they
will
be
found
incomparably
more
closely
related
to
each
other
*punct* ,
than
they
are
to
the
productions
of
australia
or
africa
under
nearly
the
same
climate
*punct* .
*break*
analogous
facts
could
be
given
with
respect
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
a
second
great
fact
which
strikes
us
in
our
general
review
is
*punct* ,
that
barriers
of
any
kind
*punct* ,
or
obstacles
to
free
migration
*punct* ,
are
related
in
a
close
and
important
manner
to
the
differences
between
the
productions
of
various
regions
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
this
in
the
great
difference
of
nearly
all
the
terrestrial
productions
of
the
new
and
old
worlds
*punct* ,
excepting
in
the
northern
parts
*punct* ,
where
the
land
almost
joins
*punct* ,
and
where
*punct* ,
under
a
slightly
different
climate
*punct* ,
there
might
have
been
free
migration
for
the
northern
temperate
forms
*punct* ,
as
there
now
is
for
the
strictly
arctic
productions
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
the
same
fact
in
the
great
difference
between
the
inhabitants
of
australia
*punct* ,
africa
*punct* ,
and
south
america
under
the
same
latitude
*punct* :
for
these
countries
are
almost
as
much
isolated
from
each
other
as
is
possible
*punct* .
*break*
on
each
continent
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
we
see
the
same
fact
*punct* ;
for
on
the
opposite
sides
of
lofty
and
continuous
mountain-ranges
*punct* ,
and
of
great
deserts
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
even
of
large
rivers
*punct* ,
we
find
different
productions
*punct* ;
though
as
mountain
chains
*punct* ,
deserts
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
are
not
as
impassable
*punct* ,
or
likely
to
have
endured
so
long
as
the
oceans
separating
continents
*punct* ,
the
differences
are
very
inferior
in
degree
to
those
characteristic
of
distinct
continents
*punct* .
*break*
turning
to
the
sea
*punct* ,
we
find
the
same
law
*punct* .
*break*
no
two
marine
faunas
are
more
distinct
*punct* ,
with
hardly
a
fish
*punct* ,
shell
*punct* ,
or
crab
in
common
*punct* ,
than
those
of
the
eastern
and
western
shores
of
south
and
central
america
*punct* ;
yet
these
great
faunas
are
separated
only
by
the
narrow
*punct* ,
but
impassable
*punct* ,
isthmus
of
panama
*punct* .
*break*
westward
of
the
shores
of
america
*punct* ,
a
wide
space
of
open
ocean
extends
*punct* ,
with
not
an
island
as
a
halting-place
for
emigrants
*punct* ;
here
we
have
a
barrier
of
another
kind
*punct* ,
and
as
soon
as
this
is
passed
we
meet
in
the
eastern
islands
of
the
pacific
*punct* ,
with
another
and
totally
distinct
fauna
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
here
three
marine
faunas
range
far
northward
and
southward
*punct* ,
in
parallel
lines
not
far
from
each
other
*punct* ,
under
corresponding
climates
*punct* ;
but
from
being
separated
from
each
other
by
impassable
barriers
*punct* ,
either
of
land
or
open
sea
*punct* ,
they
are
wholly
distinct
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
proceeding
still
further
westward
from
the
eastern
islands
of
the
tropical
parts
of
the
pacific
*punct* ,
we
encounter
no
impassable
barriers
*punct* ,
and
we
have
innumerable
islands
as
halting-places
*punct* ,
until
after
travelling
over
a
hemisphere
we
come
to
the
shores
of
africa
*punct* ;
and
over
this
vast
space
we
meet
with
no
well-defined
and
distinct
marine
faunas
*punct* .
*break*
although
hardly
one
shell
*punct* ,
crab
or
fish
is
common
to
the
above-named
three
approximate
faunas
of
eastern
and
western
america
and
the
eastern
pacific
islands
*punct* ,
yet
many
fish
range
from
the
pacific
into
the
indian
ocean
*punct* ,
and
many
shells
are
common
to
the
eastern
islands
of
the
pacific
and
the
eastern
shores
of
africa
*punct* ,
on
almost
exactly
opposite
meridians
of
longitude
*punct* .
*break*
a
third
great
fact
*punct* ,
partly
included
in
the
foregoing
statements
*punct* ,
is
the
affinity
of
the
productions
of
the
same
continent
or
sea
*punct* ,
though
the
species
themselves
are
distinct
at
different
points
and
stations
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
law
of
the
widest
generality
*punct* ,
and
every
continent
offers
innumerable
instances
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
the
naturalist
in
travelling
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
from
north
to
south
never
fails
to
be
struck
by
the
manner
in
which
successive
groups
of
beings
*punct* ,
specifically
distinct
*punct* ,
yet
clearly
related
*punct* ,
replace
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
he
hears
from
closely
allied
*punct* ,
yet
distinct
kinds
of
birds
*punct* ,
notes
nearly
similar
*punct* ,
and
sees
their
nests
similarly
constructed
*punct* ,
but
not
quite
alike
*punct* ,
with
eggs
coloured
in
nearly
the
same
manner
*punct* .
*break*
the
plains
near
the
straits
of
magellan
are
inhabited
by
one
species
of
rhea
*punct* ,
american
ostrich
*punct* ,
and
northward
the
plains
of
la
plata
by
another
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ;
and
not
by
a
true
ostrich
or
emeu
*punct* ,
like
those
found
in
africa
and
australia
under
the
same
latitude
*punct* .
*break*
on
these
same
plains
of
la
plata
*punct* ,
we
see
the
agouti
and
bizcacha
*punct* ,
animals
having
nearly
the
same
habits
as
our
hares
and
rabbits
and
belonging
to
the
same
order
of
rodents
*punct* ,
but
they
plainly
display
an
american
type
of
structure
*punct* .
*break*
we
ascend
the
lofty
peaks
of
the
cordillera
and
we
find
an
alpine
species
of
bizcacha
*punct* ;
we
look
to
the
waters
*punct* ,
and
we
do
not
find
the
beaver
or
musk-rat
*punct* ,
but
the
coypu
and
capybara
*punct* ,
rodents
of
the
american
type
*punct* .
*break*
innumerable
other
instances
could
be
given
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
look
to
the
islands
off
the
american
shore
*punct* ,
however
much
they
may
differ
in
geological
structure
*punct* ,
the
inhabitants
*punct* ,
though
they
may
be
all
peculiar
species
*punct* ,
are
essentially
american
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
look
back
to
past
ages
*punct* ,
as
shown
in
the
last
chapter
*punct* ,
and
we
find
american
types
then
prevalent
on
the
american
continent
and
in
the
american
seas
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
in
these
facts
some
deep
organic
bond
*punct* ,
prevailing
throughout
space
and
time
*punct* ,
over
the
same
areas
of
land
and
water
*punct* ,
and
independent
of
their
physical
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
the
naturalist
must
feel
little
curiosity
*punct* ,
who
is
not
led
to
inquire
what
this
bond
is
*punct* .
*break*
this
bond
*punct* ,
on
my
theory
*punct* ,
is
simply
inheritance
*punct* ,
that
cause
which
alone
*punct* ,
as
far
as
we
positively
know
*punct* ,
produces
organisms
quite
like
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
as
we
see
in
the
case
of
varieties
nearly
like
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
the
dissimilarity
of
the
inhabitants
of
different
regions
may
be
attributed
to
modification
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
and
in
a
quite
subordinate
degree
to
the
direct
influence
of
different
physical
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
the
degree
of
dissimilarity
will
depend
on
the
migration
of
the
more
dominant
forms
of
life
from
one
region
into
another
having
been
effected
with
more
or
less
ease
*punct* ,
at
periods
more
or
less
remote;
*punct* ,
on
the
nature
and
number
of
the
former
immigrants;
*punct* ,
and
on
their
action
and
reaction
*punct* ,
in
their
mutual
struggles
for
life;
*punct* ,
the
relation
of
organism
to
organism
being
*punct* ,
as
i
have
already
often
remarked
*punct* ,
the
most
important
of
all
relations
*punct* .
*break*
thus
the
high
importance
of
barriers
comes
into
play
by
checking
migration
*punct* ;
as
does
time
for
the
slow
process
of
modification
through
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
widely-ranging
species
*punct* ,
abounding
in
individuals
*punct* ,
which
have
already
triumphed
over
many
competitors
in
their
own
widely-extended
homes
will
have
the
best
chance
of
seizing
on
new
places
*punct* ,
when
they
spread
into
new
countries
*punct* .
*break*
in
their
new
homes
they
will
be
exposed
to
new
conditions
*punct* ,
and
will
frequently
undergo
further
modification
and
improvement
*punct* ;
and
thus
they
will
become
still
further
victorious
*punct* ,
and
will
produce
groups
of
modified
descendants
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
principle
of
inheritance
with
modification
*punct* ,
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
sections
of
genera
*punct* ,
whole
genera
*punct* ,
and
even
families
are
confined
to
the
same
areas
*punct* ,
as
is
so
commonly
and
notoriously
the
case
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
*punct* ,
as
was
remarked
in
the
last
chapter
*punct* ,
in
no
law
of
necessary
development
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
variability
of
each
species
is
an
independent
property
*punct* ,
and
will
be
taken
advantage
of
by
natural
selection
*punct* ,
only
so
far
as
it
profits
the
individual
in
its
complex
struggle
for
life
*punct* ,
so
the
degree
of
modification
in
different
species
will
be
no
uniform
quantity
*punct* .
*break*
if
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
a
number
of
species
*punct* ,
which
stand
in
direct
competition
with
each
other
*punct* ,
migrate
in
a
body
into
a
new
and
afterwards
isolated
country
*punct* ,
they
will
be
little
liable
to
modification
*punct* ;
for
neither
migration
nor
isolation
in
themselves
can
do
anything
*punct* .
*break*
these
principles
come
into
play
only
by
bringing
organisms
into
new
relations
with
each
other
*punct* ,
and
in
a
lesser
degree
with
the
surrounding
physical
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
have
seen
in
the
last
chapter
that
some
forms
have
retained
nearly
the
same
character
from
an
enormously
remote
geological
period
*punct* ,
so
certain
species
have
migrated
over
vast
spaces
*punct* ,
and
have
not
become
greatly
modified
*punct* .
*break*
on
these
views
*punct* ,
it
is
obvious
*punct* ,
that
the
several
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
though
inhabiting
the
most
distant
quarters
of
the
world
*punct* ,
must
originally
have
proceeded
from
the
same
source
*punct* ,
as
they
have
descended
from
the
same
progenitor
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
case
of
those
species
*punct* ,
which
have
undergone
during
whole
geological
periods
but
little
modification
*punct* ,
there
is
not
much
difficulty
in
believing
that
they
may
have
migrated
from
the
same
region
*punct* ;
for
during
the
vast
geographical
and
climatal
changes
which
will
have
supervened
since
ancient
times
*punct* ,
almost
any
amount
of
migration
is
possible
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
many
other
cases
*punct* ,
in
which
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
species
of
a
genus
have
been
produced
within
comparatively
recent
times
*punct* ,
there
is
great
difficulty
on
this
head
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
also
obvious
that
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
though
now
inhabiting
distant
and
isolated
regions
*punct* ,
must
have
proceeded
from
one
spot
*punct* ,
where
their
parents
were
first
produced
*punct* :
for
*punct* ,
as
explained
in
the
last
chapter
*punct* ,
it
is
incredible
that
individuals
identically
the
same
should
ever
have
been
produced
through
natural
selection
from
parents
specifically
distinct
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
thus
brought
to
the
question
which
has
been
largely
discussed
by
naturalists
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
whether
species
have
been
created
at
one
or
more
points
of
the
earth's
surface
*punct* .
*break*
undoubtedly
there
are
very
many
cases
of
extreme
difficulty
*punct* ,
in
understanding
how
the
same
species
could
possibly
have
migrated
from
some
one
point
to
the
several
distant
and
isolated
points
*punct* ,
where
now
found
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
the
simplicity
of
the
view
that
each
species
was
first
produced
within
a
single
region
captivates
the
mind
*punct* .
*break*
he
who
rejects
it
*punct* ,
rejects
the
vera
causa
of
ordinary
generation
with
subsequent
migration
*punct* ,
and
calls
in
the
agency
of
a
miracle
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
universally
admitted
*punct* ,
that
in
most
cases
the
area
inhabited
by
a
species
is
continuous
*punct* ;
and
when
a
plant
or
animal
inhabits
two
points
so
distant
from
each
other
*punct* ,
or
with
an
interval
of
such
a
nature
*punct* ,
that
the
space
could
not
be
easily
passed
over
by
migration
*punct* ,
the
fact
is
given
as
something
remarkable
and
exceptional
*punct* .
*break*
the
capacity
of
migrating
across
the
sea
is
more
distinctly
limited
in
terrestrial
mammals
*punct* ,
than
perhaps
in
any
other
organic
beings
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
accordingly
*punct* ,
we
find
no
inexplicable
cases
of
the
same
mammal
inhabiting
distant
points
of
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
no
geologist
will
feel
any
difficulty
in
such
cases
as
great
britain
having
been
formerly
united
to
europe
*punct* ,
and
consequently
possessing
the
same
quadrupeds
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
the
same
species
can
be
produced
at
two
separate
points
*punct* ,
why
do
we
not
find
a
single
mammal
common
to
europe
and
australia
or
south
america
*punct* ?
*break*
the
conditions
of
life
are
nearly
the
same
*punct* ,
so
that
a
multitude
of
european
animals
and
plants
have
become
naturalised
in
america
and
australia
*punct* ;
and
some
of
the
aboriginal
plants
are
identically
the
same
at
these
distant
points
of
the
northern
and
southern
hemispheres
*punct* ?
*break*
the
answer
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
that
mammals
have
not
been
able
to
migrate
*punct* ,
whereas
some
plants
*punct* ,
from
their
varied
means
of
dispersal
*punct* ,
have
migrated
across
the
vast
and
broken
interspace
*punct* .
*break*
the
great
and
striking
influence
which
barriers
of
every
kind
have
had
on
distribution
*punct* ,
is
intelligible
only
on
the
view
that
the
great
majority
of
species
have
been
produced
on
one
side
alone
*punct* ,
and
have
not
been
able
to
migrate
to
the
other
side
*punct* .
*break*
some
few
families
*punct* ,
many
sub-families
*punct* ,
very
many
genera
*punct* ,
and
a
still
greater
number
of
sections
of
genera
are
confined
to
a
single
region
*punct* ;
and
it
has
been
observed
by
several
naturalists
*punct* ,
that
the
most
natural
genera
*punct* ,
or
those
genera
in
which
the
species
are
most
closely
related
to
each
other
*punct* ,
are
generally
local
*punct* ,
or
confined
to
one
area
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
strange
anomaly
it
would
be
*punct* ,
if
*punct* ,
when
coming
one
step
lower
in
the
series
*punct* ,
to
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
a
directly
opposite
rule
prevailed
*punct* ;
and
species
were
not
local
*punct* ,
but
had
been
produced
in
two
or
more
distinct
areas
*punct* !
*break*
hence
it
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
as
it
has
to
many
other
naturalists
*punct* ,
that
the
view
of
each
species
having
been
produced
in
one
area
alone
*punct* ,
and
having
subsequently
migrated
from
that
area
as
far
as
its
powers
of
migration
and
subsistence
under
past
and
present
conditions
permitted
*punct* ,
is
the
most
probable
*punct* .
*break*
undoubtedly
many
cases
occur
*punct* ,
in
which
we
cannot
explain
how
the
same
species
could
have
passed
from
one
point
to
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
geographical
and
climatal
changes
*punct* ,
which
have
certainly
occurred
within
recent
geological
times
*punct* ,
must
have
interrupted
or
rendered
discontinuous
the
formerly
continuous
range
of
many
species
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
we
are
reduced
to
consider
whether
the
exceptions
to
continuity
of
range
are
so
numerous
and
of
so
grave
a
nature
*punct* ,
that
we
ought
to
give
up
the
belief
*punct* ,
rendered
probable
by
general
considerations
*punct* ,
that
each
species
has
been
produced
within
one
area
*punct* ,
and
has
migrated
thence
as
far
as
it
could
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
hopelessly
tedious
to
discuss
all
the
exceptional
cases
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
now
living
at
distant
and
separated
points
*punct* ;
nor
do
i
for
a
moment
pretend
that
any
explanation
could
be
offered
of
many
such
cases
*punct* .
*break*
but
after
some
preliminary
remarks
*punct* ,
i
will
discuss
a
few
of
the
most
striking
classes
of
facts
*punct* ;
namely
*punct* ,
the
existence
of
the
same
species
on
the
summits
of
distant
mountain-ranges
*punct* ,
and
at
distant
points
in
the
arctic
and
antarctic
regions
*punct* ;
and
secondly
*punct* ,
in
the
following
chapter
*punct* ,
the
wide
distribution
of
freshwater
productions
*punct* ;
and
thirdly
*punct* ,
the
occurrence
of
the
same
terrestrial
species
on
islands
and
on
the
mainland
*punct* ,
though
separated
by
hundreds
of
miles
of
open
sea
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
existence
of
the
same
species
at
distant
and
isolated
points
of
the
earth's
surface
*punct* ,
can
in
many
instances
be
explained
on
the
view
of
each
species
having
migrated
from
a
single
birthplace
*punct* ;
then
*punct* ,
considering
our
ignorance
with
respect
to
former
climatal
and
geographical
changes
and
various
occasional
means
of
transport
*punct* ,
the
belief
that
this
has
been
the
universal
law
*punct* ,
seems
to
me
incomparably
the
safest
*punct* .
*break*
in
discussing
this
subject
*punct* ,
we
shall
be
enabled
at
the
same
time
to
consider
a
point
equally
important
for
us
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
whether
the
several
distinct
species
of
a
genus
*punct* ,
which
on
my
theory
have
all
descended
from
a
common
progenitor
*punct* ,
can
have
migrated
*punct* ,
undergoing
modification
during
some
part
of
their
migration
*punct* ,
from
the
area
inhabited
by
their
progenitor
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
can
be
shown
to
be
almost
invariably
the
case
*punct* ,
that
a
region
*punct* ,
of
which
most
of
its
inhabitants
are
closely
related
to
*punct* ,
or
belong
to
the
same
genera
with
the
species
of
a
second
region
*punct* ,
has
probably
received
at
some
former
period
immigrants
from
this
other
region
*punct* ,
my
theory
will
be
strengthened
*punct* ;
for
we
can
clearly
understand
*punct* ,
on
the
principle
of
modification
*punct* ,
why
the
inhabitants
of
a
region
should
be
related
to
those
of
another
region
*punct* ,
whence
it
has
been
stocked
*punct* .
*break*
a
volcanic
island
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
upheaved
and
formed
at
the
distance
of
a
few
hundreds
of
miles
from
a
continent
*punct* ,
would
probably
receive
from
it
in
the
course
of
time
a
few
colonists
*punct* ,
and
their
descendants
*punct* ,
though
modified
*punct* ,
would
still
be
plainly
related
by
inheritance
to
the
inhabitants
of
the
continent
*punct* .
*break*
cases
of
this
nature
are
common
*punct* ,
and
are
*punct* ,
as
we
shall
hereafter
more
fully
see
*punct* ,
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
independent
creation
*punct* .
*break*
this
view
of
the
relation
of
species
in
one
region
to
those
in
another
*punct* ,
does
not
differ
much
*punct* ,
by
substituting
the
word
variety
for
species
*punct* ,
from
that
lately
advanced
in
an
ingenious
paper
by
mr.
wallace
*punct* ,
in
which
he
concludes
*punct* ,
that
every
species
has
come
into
existence
coincident
both
in
space
and
time
with
a
pre-existing
closely
allied
species
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
now
know
from
correspondence
*punct* ,
that
this
coincidence
he
attributes
to
generation
with
modification
*punct* .
*break*
the
previous
remarks
on
single
and
multiple
centres
of
creation
do
not
directly
bear
on
another
allied
question,
*punct* ,
namely
whether
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
have
descended
from
a
single
pair
*punct* ,
or
single
hermaphrodite
*punct* ,
or
whether
*punct* ,
as
some
authors
suppose
*punct* ,
from
many
individuals
simultaneously
created
*punct* .
*break*
with
those
organic
beings
which
never
intercross
*punct* ,
if
such
exist
*punct* ,
the
species
*punct* ,
on
my
theory
*punct* ,
must
have
descended
from
a
succession
of
improved
varieties
*punct* ,
which
will
never
have
blended
with
other
individuals
or
varieties
*punct* ,
but
will
have
supplanted
each
other
*punct* ;
so
that
*punct* ,
at
each
successive
stage
of
modification
and
improvement
*punct* ,
all
the
individuals
of
each
variety
will
have
descended
from
a
single
parent
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
the
majority
of
cases
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
with
all
organisms
which
habitually
unite
for
each
birth
*punct* ,
or
which
often
intercross
*punct* ,
i
believe
that
during
the
slow
process
of
modification
the
individuals
of
the
species
will
have
been
kept
nearly
uniform
by
intercrossing
*punct* ;
so
that
many
individuals
will
have
gone
on
simultaneously
changing
*punct* ,
and
the
whole
amount
of
modification
will
not
have
been
due
*punct* ,
at
each
stage
*punct* ,
to
descent
from
a
single
parent
*punct* .
*break*
to
illustrate
what
i
mean
*punct* :
our
english
racehorses
differ
slightly
from
the
horses
of
every
other
breed
*punct* ;
but
they
do
not
owe
their
difference
and
superiority
to
descent
from
any
single
pair
*punct* ,
but
to
continued
care
in
selecting
and
training
many
individuals
during
many
generations
*punct* .
*break*
before
discussing
the
three
classes
of
facts
*punct* ,
which
i
have
selected
as
presenting
the
greatest
amount
of
difficulty
on
the
theory
of
single
centres
of
creation
*punct* ,
i
must
say
a
few
words
on
the
means
of
dispersal
*punct* .
*break*
lyell
and
other
authors
have
ably
treated
this
subject
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
give
here
only
the
briefest
abstract
of
the
more
important
facts
*punct* .
*break*
change
of
climate
must
have
had
a
powerful
influence
on
migration
*punct* :
a
region
when
its
climate
was
different
may
have
been
a
high
road
for
migration
*punct* ,
but
now
be
impassable
*punct* ;
i
shall
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
presently
have
to
discuss
this
branch
of
the
subject
in
some
detail
*punct* .
*break*
changes
of
level
in
the
land
must
also
have
been
highly
influential
*punct* :
a
narrow
isthmus
now
separates
two
marine
faunas
*punct* ;
submerge
it
*punct* ,
or
let
it
formerly
have
been
submerged
*punct* ,
and
the
two
faunas
will
now
blend
or
may
formerly
have
blended
*punct* :
where
the
sea
now
extends
*punct* ,
land
may
at
a
former
period
have
connected
islands
or
possibly
even
continents
together
*punct* ,
and
thus
have
allowed
terrestrial
productions
to
pass
from
one
to
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
no
geologist
will
dispute
that
great
mutations
of
level
have
occurred
within
the
period
of
existing
organisms
*punct* .
*break*
edward
forbes
insisted
that
all
the
islands
in
the
atlantic
must
recently
have
been
connected
with
europe
or
africa
*punct* ,
and
europe
likewise
with
america
*punct* .
*break*
other
authors
have
thus
hypothetically
bridged
over
every
ocean
*punct* ,
and
have
united
almost
every
island
to
some
mainland
*punct* .
*break*
if
indeed
the
arguments
used
by
forbes
are
to
be
trusted
*punct* ,
it
must
be
admitted
that
scarcely
a
single
island
exists
which
has
not
recently
been
united
to
some
continent
*punct* .
*break*
this
view
cuts
the
gordian
knot
of
the
dispersal
of
the
same
species
to
the
most
distant
points
*punct* ,
and
removes
many
a
difficulty
*punct* :
but
to
the
best
of
any
judgment
we
are
not
authorized
in
admitting
such
enormous
geographical
changes
within
the
period
of
existing
species
*punct* .
*break*
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
abundant
evidence
of
great
oscillations
of
level
in
our
continents
*punct* ;
but
not
of
such
vast
changes
in
their
position
and
extension
*punct* ,
as
to
have
united
them
within
the
recent
period
to
each
other
and
to
the
several
intervening
oceanic
islands
*punct* .
*break*
i
freely
admit
the
former
existence
of
many
islands
*punct* ,
now
buried
beneath
the
sea
*punct* ,
which
may
have
served
as
halting
places
for
plants
and
for
many
animals
during
their
migration
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
coral-producing
oceans
such
sunken
islands
are
now
marked
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
by
rings
of
coral
or
atolls
standing
over
them
*punct* .
*break*
whenever
it
is
fully
admitted
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
it
will
some
day
be
*punct* ,
that
each
species
has
proceeded
from
a
single
birthplace
*punct* ,
and
when
in
the
course
of
time
we
know
something
definite
about
the
means
of
distribution
*punct* ,
we
shall
be
enabled
to
speculate
with
security
on
the
former
extension
of
the
land
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
will
ever
be
proved
that
within
the
recent
period
continents
which
are
now
quite
separate
*punct* ,
have
been
continuously
*punct* ,
or
almost
continuously
*punct* ,
united
with
each
other
*punct* ,
and
with
the
many
existing
oceanic
islands
*punct* .
*break*
several
facts
in
distribution,
*punct* ,
such
as
the
great
difference
in
the
marine
faunas
on
the
opposite
sides
of
almost
every
continent,
*punct* ,
the
close
relation
of
the
tertiary
inhabitants
of
several
lands
and
even
seas
to
their
present
inhabitants,
*punct* ,
a
certain
degree
of
relation
*punct* ,
as
we
shall
hereafter
see
*punct* ,
between
the
distribution
of
mammals
and
the
depth
of
the
sea,
*punct* ,
these
and
other
such
facts
seem
to
me
opposed
to
the
admission
of
such
prodigious
geographical
revolutions
within
the
recent
period
*punct* ,
as
are
necessitated
on
the
view
advanced
by
forbes
and
admitted
by
his
many
followers
*punct* .
*break*
the
nature
and
relative
proportions
of
the
inhabitants
of
oceanic
islands
likewise
seem
to
me
opposed
to
the
belief
of
their
former
continuity
with
continents
*punct* .
*break*
nor
does
their
almost
universally
volcanic
composition
favour
the
admission
that
they
are
the
wrecks
of
sunken
continents;
*punct* ,
if
they
had
originally
existed
as
mountain-ranges
on
the
land
*punct* ,
some
at
least
of
the
islands
would
have
been
formed
*punct* ,
like
other
mountain-summits
*punct* ,
of
granite
*punct* ,
metamorphic
schists
*punct* ,
old
fossiliferous
or
other
such
rocks
*punct* ,
instead
of
consisting
of
mere
piles
of
volcanic
matter
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
now
say
a
few
words
on
what
are
called
accidental
means
*punct* ,
but
which
more
properly
might
be
called
occasional
means
of
distribution
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
here
confine
myself
to
plants
*punct* .
*break*
in
botanical
works
*punct* ,
this
or
that
plant
is
stated
to
be
ill
adapted
for
wide
dissemination
*punct* ;
but
for
transport
across
the
sea
*punct* ,
the
greater
or
less
facilities
may
be
said
to
be
almost
wholly
unknown
*punct* .
*break*
until
i
tried
*punct* ,
with
mr.
berkeley's
aid
*punct* ,
a
few
experiments
*punct* ,
it
was
not
even
known
how
far
seeds
could
resist
the
injurious
action
of
sea-water
*punct* .
*break*
to
my
surprise
i
found
that
out
of
87
kinds
*punct* ,
64
germinated
after
an
immersion
of
28
days
*punct* ,
and
a
few
survived
an
immersion
of
137
days
*punct* .
*break*
for
convenience
sake
i
chiefly
tried
small
seeds
*punct* ,
without
the
capsule
or
fruit
*punct* ;
and
as
all
of
these
sank
in
a
few
days
*punct* ,
they
could
not
be
floated
across
wide
spaces
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
whether
or
not
they
were
injured
by
the
salt-water
*punct* .
*break*
afterwards
i
tried
some
larger
fruits
*punct* ,
capsules
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
and
some
of
these
floated
for
a
long
time
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
well
known
what
a
difference
there
is
in
the
buoyancy
of
green
and
seasoned
timber
*punct* ;
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
floods
might
wash
down
plants
or
branches
*punct* ,
and
that
these
might
be
dried
on
the
banks
*punct* ,
and
then
by
a
fresh
rise
in
the
stream
be
washed
into
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
hence
i
was
led
to
dry
stems
and
branches
of
94
plants
with
ripe
fruit
*punct* ,
and
to
place
them
on
sea
water
*punct* .
*break*
the
majority
sank
quickly
*punct* ,
but
some
which
whilst
green
floated
for
a
very
short
time
*punct* ,
when
dried
floated
much
longer
*punct* ;
for
instance
*punct* ,
ripe
hazel-nuts
sank
immediately
*punct* ,
but
when
dried
*punct* ,
they
floated
for
90
days
and
afterwards
when
planted
they
germinated
*punct* ;
an
asparagus
plant
with
ripe
berries
floated
for
23
days
*punct* ,
when
dried
it
floated
for
85
days
*punct* ,
and
the
seeds
afterwards
germinated
*punct* :
the
ripe
seeds
of
helosciadium
sank
in
two
days
*punct* ,
when
dried
they
floated
for
above
90
days
*punct* ,
and
afterwards
germinated
*punct* .
*break*
altogether
out
of
the
94
dried
plants
*punct* ,
18
floated
for
above
28
days
*punct* ,
and
some
of
the
18
floated
for
a
very
much
longer
period
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
as
64/87
seeds
germinated
after
an
immersion
of
28
days
*punct* ;
and
as
18/94
plants
with
ripe
fruit
*punct* ,
but
not
all
the
same
species
as
in
the
foregoing
experiment
*punct* ,
floated
*punct* ,
after
being
dried
*punct* ,
for
above
28
days
*punct* ,
as
far
as
we
may
infer
anything
from
these
scanty
facts
*punct* ,
we
may
conclude
that
the
seeds
of
14/100
plants
of
any
country
might
be
floated
by
sea-currents
during
28
days
*punct* ,
and
would
retain
their
power
of
germination
*punct* .
*break*
subsequently
to
my
experiments
*punct* ,
m.
martens
tried
similar
ones
*punct* ,
but
in
a
much
better
manner
*punct* ,
for
he
placed
the
seeds
in
a
box
in
the
actual
sea
*punct* ,
so
that
they
were
alternately
wet
and
exposed
to
the
air
like
really
floating
plants
*punct* .
*break*
he
tried
98
seeds
*punct* ,
mostly
different
from
mine
*punct* ;
but
he
chose
many
large
fruits
and
likewise
seeds
from
plants
which
live
near
the
sea
*punct* ;
and
this
would
have
favoured
the
average
length
of
their
flotation
and
of
their
resistance
to
the
injurious
action
of
the
salt-water
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
he
did
not
previously
dry
the
plants
or
branches
with
the
fruit
*punct* ;
and
this
*punct* ,
as
we
have
seen
*punct* ,
would
have
caused
some
of
them
to
have
floated
much
longer
*punct* .
*break*
the
result
was
that
18/98
of
his
seeds
floated
for
42
days
*punct* ,
and
were
then
capable
of
germination
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
do
not
doubt
that
plants
exposed
to
the
waves
would
float
for
a
less
time
than
those
protected
from
violent
movement
as
in
our
experiments
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
it
would
perhaps
be
safer
to
assume
that
the
seeds
of
about
10/100
plants
of
a
flora
*punct* ,
after
having
been
dried
*punct* ,
could
be
floated
across
a
space
of
sea
900
miles
in
width
*punct* ,
and
would
then
germinate
*punct* .
*break*
the
fact
of
the
larger
fruits
often
floating
longer
than
the
small
*punct* ,
is
interesting
*punct* ;
as
plants
with
large
seeds
or
fruit
could
hardly
be
transported
by
any
other
means
*punct* ;
and
alph
*punct* .
*break*
de
candolle
has
shown
that
such
plants
generally
have
restricted
ranges
*punct* .
*break*
but
seeds
may
be
occasionally
transported
in
another
manner
*punct* .
*break*
drift
timber
is
thrown
up
on
most
islands
*punct* ,
even
on
those
in
the
midst
of
the
widest
oceans
*punct* ;
and
the
natives
of
the
coral-islands
in
the
pacific
*punct* ,
procure
stones
for
their
tools
*punct* ,
solely
from
the
roots
of
drifted
trees
*punct* ,
these
stones
being
a
valuable
royal
tax
*punct* .
*break*
i
find
on
examination
*punct* ,
that
when
irregularly
shaped
stones
are
embedded
in
the
roots
of
trees
*punct* ,
small
parcels
of
earth
are
very
frequently
enclosed
in
their
interstices
and
behind
them,
*punct* ,
so
perfectly
that
not
a
particle
could
be
washed
away
in
the
longest
transport
*punct* :
out
of
one
small
portion
of
earth
thus
completely
enclosed
by
wood
in
an
oak
about
50
years
old
*punct* ,
three
dicotyledonous
plants
germinated
*punct* :
i
am
certain
of
the
accuracy
of
this
observation
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
i
can
show
that
the
carcasses
of
birds
*punct* ,
when
floating
on
the
sea
*punct* ,
sometimes
escape
being
immediately
devoured
*punct* ;
and
seeds
of
many
kinds
in
the
crops
of
floating
birds
long
retain
their
vitality
*punct* :
peas
and
vetches
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
are
killed
by
even
a
few
days
immersion
in
sea-water
*punct* ;
but
some
taken
out
of
the
crop
of
a
pigeon
*punct* ,
which
had
floated
on
artificial
salt-water
for
30
days
*punct* ,
to
my
surprise
nearly
all
germinated
*punct* .
*break*
living
birds
can
hardly
fail
to
be
highly
effective
agents
in
the
transportation
of
seeds
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
give
many
facts
showing
how
frequently
birds
of
many
kinds
are
blown
by
gales
to
vast
distances
across
the
ocean
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
i
think
safely
assume
that
under
such
circumstances
their
rate
of
flight
would
often
be
35
miles
an
hour
*punct* ;
and
some
authors
have
given
a
far
higher
estimate
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
never
seen
an
instance
of
nutritious
seeds
passing
through
the
intestines
of
a
bird
*punct* ;
but
hard
seeds
of
fruit
will
pass
uninjured
through
even
the
digestive
organs
of
a
turkey
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
course
of
two
months
*punct* ,
i
picked
up
in
my
garden
12
kinds
of
seeds
*punct* ,
out
of
the
excrement
of
small
birds
*punct* ,
and
these
seemed
perfect
*punct* ,
and
some
of
them
*punct* ,
which
i
tried
*punct* ,
germinated
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
following
fact
is
more
important
*punct* :
the
crops
of
birds
do
not
secrete
gastric
juice
*punct* ,
and
do
not
in
the
least
injure
*punct* ,
as
i
know
by
trial
*punct* ,
the
germination
of
seeds
*punct* ;
now
after
a
bird
has
found
and
devoured
a
large
supply
of
food
*punct* ,
it
is
positively
asserted
that
all
the
grains
do
not
pass
into
the
gizzard
for
12
or
even
18
hours
*punct* .
*break*
a
bird
in
this
interval
might
easily
be
blown
to
the
distance
of
500
miles
*punct* ,
and
hawks
are
known
to
look
out
for
tired
birds
*punct* ,
and
the
contents
of
their
torn
crops
might
thus
readily
get
scattered
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
brent
informs
me
that
a
friend
of
his
had
to
give
up
flying
carrier-pigeons
from
france
to
england
*punct* ,
as
the
hawks
on
the
english
coast
destroyed
so
many
on
their
arrival
*punct* .
*break*
some
hawks
and
owls
bolt
their
prey
whole
*punct* ,
and
after
an
interval
of
from
twelve
to
twenty
hours
*punct* ,
disgorge
pellets
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
as
i
know
from
experiments
made
in
the
zoological
gardens
*punct* ,
include
seeds
capable
of
germination
*punct* .
*break*
some
seeds
of
the
oat
*punct* ,
wheat
*punct* ,
millet
*punct* ,
canary
*punct* ,
hemp
*punct* ,
clover
*punct* ,
and
beet
germinated
after
having
been
from
twelve
to
twenty-one
hours
in
the
stomachs
of
different
birds
of
prey
*punct* ;
and
two
seeds
of
beet
grew
after
having
been
thus
retained
for
two
days
and
fourteen
hours
*punct* .
*break*
freshwater
fish
*punct* ,
i
find
*punct* ,
eat
seeds
of
many
land
and
water
plants
*punct* :
fish
are
frequently
devoured
by
birds
*punct* ,
and
thus
the
seeds
might
be
transported
from
place
to
place
*punct* .
*break*
i
forced
many
kinds
of
seeds
into
the
stomachs
of
dead
fish
*punct* ,
and
then
gave
their
bodies
to
fishing-eagles
*punct* ,
storks
*punct* ,
and
pelicans
*punct* ;
these
birds
after
an
interval
of
many
hours
*punct* ,
either
rejected
the
seeds
in
pellets
or
passed
them
in
their
excrement
*punct* ;
and
several
of
these
seeds
retained
their
power
of
germination
*punct* .
*break*
certain
seeds
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
were
always
killed
by
this
process
*punct* .
*break*
although
the
beaks
and
feet
of
birds
are
generally
quite
clean
*punct* ,
i
can
show
that
earth
sometimes
adheres
to
them
*punct* :
in
one
instance
i
removed
twenty-two
grains
of
dry
argillaceous
earth
from
one
foot
of
a
partridge
*punct* ,
and
in
this
earth
there
was
a
pebble
quite
as
large
as
the
seed
of
a
vetch
*punct* .
*break*
thus
seeds
might
occasionally
be
transported
to
great
distances
*punct* ;
for
many
facts
could
be
given
showing
that
soil
almost
everywhere
is
charged
with
seeds
*punct* .
*break*
reflect
for
a
moment
on
the
millions
of
quails
which
annually
cross
the
mediterranean
*punct* ;
and
can
we
doubt
that
the
earth
adhering
to
their
feet
would
sometimes
include
a
few
minute
seeds
*punct* ?
*break*
but
i
shall
presently
have
to
recur
to
this
subject
*punct* .
*break*
as
icebergs
are
known
to
be
sometimes
loaded
with
earth
and
stones
*punct* ,
and
have
even
carried
brushwood
*punct* ,
bones
*punct* ,
and
the
nest
of
a
land-bird
*punct* ,
i
can
hardly
doubt
that
they
must
occasionally
have
transported
seeds
from
one
part
to
another
of
the
arctic
and
antarctic
regions
*punct* ,
as
suggested
by
lyell
*punct* ;
and
during
the
glacial
period
from
one
part
of
the
now
temperate
regions
to
another
*punct* .
*break*
watson
*punct* ,
from
the
somewhat
northern
character
of
the
flora
in
comparison
with
the
latitude
*punct* ,
i
suspected
that
these
islands
had
been
partly
stocked
by
ice-borne
seeds
*punct* ,
during
the
glacial
epoch
*punct* .
*break*
lyell
wrote
to
m.
hartung
to
inquire
whether
he
had
observed
erratic
boulders
on
these
islands
*punct* ,
and
he
answered
that
he
had
found
large
fragments
of
granite
and
other
rocks
*punct* ,
which
do
not
occur
in
the
archipelago
*punct* .
*break*
hence
we
may
safely
infer
that
icebergs
formerly
landed
their
rocky
burthens
on
the
shores
of
these
mid-ocean
islands
*punct* ,
and
it
is
at
least
possible
that
they
may
have
brought
thither
the
seeds
of
northern
plants
*punct* .
*break*
considering
that
the
several
above
means
of
transport
*punct* ,
and
that
several
other
means
*punct* ,
which
without
doubt
remain
to
be
discovered
*punct* ,
have
been
in
action
year
after
year
*punct* ,
for
centuries
and
tens
of
thousands
of
years
*punct* ,
it
would
i
think
be
a
marvellous
fact
if
many
plants
had
not
thus
become
widely
transported
*punct* .
*break*
these
means
of
transport
are
sometimes
called
accidental
*punct* ,
but
this
is
not
strictly
correct
*punct* :
the
currents
of
the
sea
are
not
accidental
*punct* ,
nor
is
the
direction
of
prevalent
gales
of
wind
*punct* .
*break*
it
should
be
observed
that
scarcely
any
means
of
transport
would
carry
seeds
for
very
great
distances
*punct* ;
for
seeds
do
not
retain
their
vitality
when
exposed
for
a
great
length
of
time
to
the
action
of
seawater
*punct* ;
nor
could
they
be
long
carried
in
the
crops
or
intestines
of
birds
*punct* .
*break*
these
means
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
would
suffice
for
occasional
transport
across
tracts
of
sea
some
hundred
miles
in
breadth
*punct* ,
or
from
island
to
island
*punct* ,
or
from
a
continent
to
a
neighbouring
island
*punct* ,
but
not
from
one
distant
continent
to
another
*punct* .
*break*
the
floras
of
distant
continents
would
not
by
such
means
become
mingled
in
any
great
degree
*punct* ;
but
would
remain
as
distinct
as
we
now
see
them
to
be
*punct* .
*break*
the
currents
*punct* ,
from
their
course
*punct* ,
would
never
bring
seeds
from
north
america
to
britain
*punct* ,
though
they
might
and
do
bring
seeds
from
the
west
indies
to
our
western
shores
*punct* ,
where
*punct* ,
if
not
killed
by
so
long
an
immersion
in
salt-water
*punct* ,
they
could
not
endure
our
climate
*punct* .
*break*
almost
every
year
*punct* ,
one
or
two
land-birds
are
blown
across
the
whole
atlantic
ocean
*punct* ,
from
north
america
to
the
western
shores
of
ireland
and
england
*punct* ;
but
seeds
could
be
transported
by
these
wanderers
only
by
one
means
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
in
dirt
sticking
to
their
feet
*punct* ,
which
is
in
itself
a
rare
accident
*punct* .
*break*
even
in
this
case
*punct* ,
how
small
would
the
chance
be
of
a
seed
falling
on
favourable
soil
*punct* ,
and
coming
to
maturity
*punct* !
*break*
but
it
would
be
a
great
error
to
argue
that
because
a
well-stocked
island
*punct* ,
like
great
britain
*punct* ,
has
not
*punct* ,
as
far
as
is
known
*punct* ,
and
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
prove
this
*punct* ,
received
within
the
last
few
centuries
*punct* ,
through
occasional
means
of
transport
*punct* ,
immigrants
from
europe
or
any
other
continent
*punct* ,
that
a
poorly-stocked
island
*punct* ,
though
standing
more
remote
from
the
mainland
*punct* ,
would
not
receive
colonists
by
similar
means
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
doubt
that
out
of
twenty
seeds
or
animals
transported
to
an
island
*punct* ,
even
if
far
less
well-stocked
than
britain
*punct* ,
scarcely
more
than
one
would
be
so
well
fitted
to
its
new
home
*punct* ,
as
to
become
naturalised
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
*punct* ,
as
it
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
is
no
valid
argument
against
what
would
be
effected
by
occasional
means
of
transport
*punct* ,
during
the
long
lapse
of
geological
time
*punct* ,
whilst
an
island
was
being
upheaved
and
formed
*punct* ,
and
before
it
had
become
fully
stocked
with
inhabitants
*punct* .
*break*
on
almost
bare
land
*punct* ,
with
few
or
no
destructive
insects
or
birds
living
there
*punct* ,
nearly
every
seed
*punct* ,
which
chanced
to
arrive
*punct* ,
would
be
sure
to
germinate
and
survive
*punct* .
*break*
dispersal
during
the
glacial
period.
*punct* ,
the
identity
of
many
plants
and
animals
*punct* ,
on
mountain-summits
*punct* ,
separated
from
each
other
by
hundreds
of
miles
of
lowlands
*punct* ,
where
the
alpine
species
could
not
possibly
exist
*punct* ,
is
one
of
the
most
striking
cases
known
of
the
same
species
living
at
distant
points
*punct* ,
without
the
apparent
possibility
of
their
having
migrated
from
one
to
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
indeed
a
remarkable
fact
to
see
so
many
of
the
same
plants
living
on
the
snowy
regions
of
the
alps
or
pyrenees
*punct* ,
and
in
the
extreme
northern
parts
of
europe
*punct* ;
but
it
is
far
more
remarkable
*punct* ,
that
the
plants
on
the
white
mountains
*punct* ,
in
the
united
states
of
america
*punct* ,
are
all
the
same
with
those
of
labrador
*punct* ,
and
nearly
all
the
same
*punct* ,
as
we
hear
from
asa
gray
*punct* ,
with
those
on
the
loftiest
mountains
of
europe
*punct* .
*break*
even
as
long
ago
as
1747
*punct* ,
such
facts
led
gmelin
to
conclude
that
the
same
species
must
have
been
independently
created
at
several
distinct
points
*punct* ;
and
we
might
have
remained
in
this
same
belief
*punct* ,
had
not
agassiz
and
others
called
vivid
attention
to
the
glacial
period
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
as
we
shall
immediately
see
*punct* ,
affords
a
simple
explanation
of
these
facts
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
evidence
of
almost
every
conceivable
kind
*punct* ,
organic
and
inorganic
*punct* ,
that
within
a
very
recent
geological
period
*punct* ,
central
europe
and
north
america
suffered
under
an
arctic
climate
*punct* .
*break*
the
ruins
of
a
house
burnt
by
fire
do
not
tell
their
tale
more
plainly
*punct* ,
than
do
the
mountains
of
scotland
and
wales
*punct* ,
with
their
scored
flanks
*punct* ,
polished
surfaces
*punct* ,
and
perched
boulders
*punct* ,
of
the
icy
streams
with
which
their
valleys
were
lately
filled
*punct* .
*break*
so
greatly
has
the
climate
of
europe
changed
*punct* ,
that
in
northern
italy
*punct* ,
gigantic
moraines
*punct* ,
left
by
old
glaciers
*punct* ,
are
now
clothed
by
the
vine
and
maize
*punct* .
*break*
throughout
a
large
part
of
the
united
states
*punct* ,
erratic
boulders
*punct* ,
and
rocks
scored
by
drifted
icebergs
and
coast-ice
*punct* ,
plainly
reveal
a
former
cold
period
*punct* .
*break*
the
former
influence
of
the
glacial
climate
on
the
distribution
of
the
inhabitants
of
europe
*punct* ,
as
explained
with
remarkable
clearness
by
edward
forbes
*punct* ,
is
substantially
as
follows
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
shall
follow
the
changes
more
readily
*punct* ,
by
supposing
a
new
glacial
period
to
come
slowly
on
*punct* ,
and
then
pass
away
*punct* ,
as
formerly
occurred
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
cold
came
on
*punct* ,
and
as
each
more
southern
zone
became
fitted
for
arctic
beings
and
ill-fitted
for
their
former
more
temperate
inhabitants
*punct* ,
the
latter
would
be
supplanted
and
arctic
productions
would
take
their
places
*punct* .
*break*
the
inhabitants
of
the
more
temperate
regions
would
at
the
same
time
travel
southward
*punct* ,
unless
they
were
stopped
by
barriers
*punct* ,
in
which
case
they
would
perish
*punct* .
*break*
the
mountains
would
become
covered
with
snow
and
ice
*punct* ,
and
their
former
alpine
inhabitants
would
descend
to
the
plains
*punct* .
*break*
by
the
time
that
the
cold
had
reached
its
maximum
*punct* ,
we
should
have
a
uniform
arctic
fauna
and
flora
*punct* ,
covering
the
central
parts
of
europe
*punct* ,
as
far
south
as
the
alps

pyrenees
*punct* ,
and
even
stretching
into
spain
*punct* .
*break*
the
now
temperate
regions
of
the
united
states
would
likewise
be
covered
by
arctic
plants
and
animals
*punct* ,
and
these
would
be
nearly
the
same
with
those
of
europe
*punct* ;
for
the
present
circumpolar
inhabitants
*punct* ,
which
we
suppose
to
have
everywhere
travelled
southward
*punct* ,
are
remarkably
uniform
round
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
suppose
that
the
glacial
period
came
on
a
little
earlier
or
later
in
north
america
than
in
europe
*punct* ,
so
will
the
southern
migration
there
have
been
a
little
earlier
or
later
*punct* ;
but
this
will
make
no
difference
in
the
final
result
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
warmth
returned
*punct* ,
the
arctic
forms
would
retreat
northward
*punct* ,
closely
followed
up
in
their
retreat
by
the
productions
of
the
more
temperate
regions
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
the
snow
melted
from
the
bases
of
the
mountains
*punct* ,
the
arctic
forms
would
seize
on
the
cleared
and
thawed
ground
*punct* ,
always
ascending
higher
and
higher
*punct* ,
as
the
warmth
increased
*punct* ,
whilst
their
brethren
were
pursuing
their
northern
journey
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
when
the
warmth
had
fully
returned
*punct* ,
the
same
arctic
species
*punct* ,
which
had
lately
lived
in
a
body
together
on
the
lowlands
of
the
old
and
new
worlds
*punct* ,
would
be
left
isolated
on
distant
mountain-summits
*punct* ,
having
been
exterminated
on
all
lesser
heights
*punct* ,
and
in
the
arctic
regions
of
both
hemispheres
*punct* .
*break*
thus
we
can
understand
the
identity
of
many
plants
at
points
so
immensely
remote
as
on
the
mountains
of
the
united
states
and
of
europe
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
thus
also
understand
the
fact
that
the
alpine
plants
of
each
mountain-range
are
more
especially
related
to
the
arctic
forms
living
due
north
or
nearly
due
north
of
them
*punct* :
for
the
migration
as
the
cold
came
on
*punct* ,
and
the
re-migration
on
the
returning
warmth
*punct* ,
will
generally
have
been
due
south
and
north
*punct* .
*break*
watson
*punct* ,
and
those
of
the
pyrenees
*punct* ,
as
remarked
by
ramond
*punct* ,
are
more
especially
allied
to
the
plants
of
northern
scandinavia
*punct* ;
those
of
the
united
states
to
labrador
*punct* ;
those
of
the
mountains
of
siberia
to
the
arctic
regions
of
that
country
*punct* .
*break*
these
views
*punct* ,
grounded
as
they
are
on
the
perfectly
well-ascertained
occurrence
of
a
former
glacial
period
*punct* ,
seem
to
me
to
explain
in
so
satisfactory
a
manner
the
present
distribution
of
the
alpine
and
arctic
productions
of
europe
and
america
*punct* ,
that
when
in
other
regions
we
find
the
same
species
on
distant
mountain-summits
*punct* ,
we
may
almost
conclude
without
other
evidence
*punct* ,
that
a
colder
climate
permitted
their
former
migration
across
the
low
intervening
tracts
*punct* ,
since
become
too
warm
for
their
existence
*punct* .
*break*
if
the
climate
*punct* ,
since
the
glacial
period
*punct* ,
has
ever
been
in
any
degree
warmer
than
at
present
*punct* ,
as
some
geologists
in
the
united
states
believe
to
have
been
the
case
*punct* ,
chiefly
from
the
distribution
of
the
fossil
gnathodon
*punct* ,
then
the
arctic
and
temperate
productions
will
at
a
very
late
period
have
marched
a
little
further
north
*punct* ,
and
subsequently
have
retreated
to
their
present
homes
*punct* ;
but
i
have
met
with
no
satisfactory
evidence
with
respect
to
this
intercalated
slightly
warmer
period
*punct* ,
since
the
glacial
period
*punct* .
*break*
the
arctic
forms
*punct* ,
during
their
long
southern
migration
and
re-migration
northward
*punct* ,
will
have
been
exposed
to
nearly
the
same
climate
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
is
especially
to
be
noticed
*punct* ,
they
will
have
kept
in
a
body
together
*punct* ;
consequently
their
mutual
relations
will
not
have
been
much
disturbed
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
accordance
with
the
principles
inculcated
in
this
volume
*punct* ,
they
will
not
have
been
liable
to
much
modification
*punct* .
*break*
but
with
our
alpine
productions
*punct* ,
left
isolated
from
the
moment
of
the
returning
warmth
*punct* ,
first
at
the
bases
and
ultimately
on
the
summits
of
the
mountains
*punct* ,
the
case
will
have
been
somewhat
different
*punct* ;
for
it
is
not
likely
that
all
the
same
arctic
species
will
have
been
left
on
mountain
ranges
distant
from
each
other
*punct* ,
and
have
survived
there
ever
since
*punct* ;
they
will
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
in
all
probability
have
become
mingled
with
ancient
alpine
species
*punct* ,
which
must
have
existed
on
the
mountains
before
the
commencement
of
the
glacial
epoch
*punct* ,
and
which
during
its
coldest
period
will
have
been
temporarily
driven
down
to
the
plains
*punct* ;
they
will
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
have
been
exposed
to
somewhat
different
climatal
influences
*punct* .
*break*
their
mutual
relations
will
thus
have
been
in
some
degree
disturbed
*punct* ;
consequently
they
will
have
been
liable
to
modification
*punct* ;
and
this
we
find
has
been
the
case
*punct* ;
for
if
we
compare
the
present
alpine
plants
and
animals
of
the
several
great
european
mountain-ranges
*punct* ,
though
very
many
of
the
species
are
identically
the
same
*punct* ,
some
present
varieties
*punct* ,
some
are
ranked
as
doubtful
forms
*punct* ,
and
some
few
are
distinct
yet
closely
allied
or
representative
species
*punct* .
*break*
in
illustrating
what
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
actually
took
place
during
the
glacial
period
*punct* ,
i
assumed
that
at
its
commencement
the
arctic
productions
were
as
uniform
round
the
polar
regions
as
they
are
at
the
present
day
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
foregoing
remarks
on
distribution
apply
not
only
to
strictly
arctic
forms
*punct* ,
but
also
to
many
sub-arctic
and
to
some
few
northern
temperate
forms
*punct* ,
for
some
of
these
are
the
same
on
the
lower
mountains
and
on
the
plains
of
north
america
and
europe
*punct* ;
and
it
may
be
reasonably
asked
how
i
account
for
the
necessary
degree
of
uniformity
of
the
sub-arctic
and
northern
temperate
forms
round
the
world
*punct* ,
at
the
commencement
of
the
glacial
period
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
present
day
*punct* ,
the
sub-arctic
and
northern
temperate
productions
of
the
old
and
new
worlds
are
separated
from
each
other
by
the
atlantic
ocean
and
by
the
extreme
northern
part
of
the
pacific
*punct* .
*break*
during
the
glacial
period
*punct* ,
when
the
inhabitants
of
the
old
and
new
worlds
lived
further
southwards
than
at
present
*punct* ,
they
must
have
been
still
more
completely
separated
by
wider
spaces
of
ocean
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
the
above
difficulty
may
be
surmounted
by
looking
to
still
earlier
changes
of
climate
of
an
opposite
nature
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
that
during
the
newer
pliocene
period
*punct* ,
before
the
glacial
epoch
*punct* ,
and
whilst
the
majority
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
world
were
specifically
the
same
as
now
*punct* ,
the
climate
was
warmer
than
at
the
present
day
*punct* .
*break*
hence
we
may
suppose
that
the
organisms
now
living
under
the
climate
of
latitude
60
deg
*punct* ,
during
the
pliocene
period
lived
further
north
under
the
polar
circle
*punct* ,
in
latitude
66
deg-67
deg
*punct* ;
and
that
the
strictly
arctic
productions
then
lived
on
the
broken
land
still
nearer
to
the
pole
*punct* .
*break*
now
if
we
look
at
a
globe
*punct* ,
we
shall
see
that
under
the
polar
circle
there
is
almost
continuous
land
from
western
europe
*punct* ,
through
siberia
*punct* ,
to
eastern
america
*punct* .
*break*
believing
*punct* ,
from
reasons
before
alluded
to
*punct* ,
that
our
continents
have
long
remained
in
nearly
the
same
relative
position
*punct* ,
though
subjected
to
large
*punct* ,
but
partial
oscillations
of
level
*punct* ,
i
am
strongly
inclined
to
extend
the
above
view
*punct* ,
and
to
infer
that
during
some
earlier
and
still
warmer
period
*punct* ,
such
as
the
older
pliocene
period
*punct* ,
a
large
number
of
the
same
plants
and
animals
inhabited
the
almost
continuous
circumpolar
land
*punct* ;
and
that
these
plants
and
animals
*punct* ,
both
in
the
old
and
new
worlds
*punct* ,
began
slowly
to
migrate
southwards
as
the
climate
became
less
warm
*punct* ,
long
before
the
commencement
of
the
glacial
period
*punct* .
*break*
we
now
see
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
their
descendants
*punct* ,
mostly
in
a
modified
condition
*punct* ,
in
the
central
parts
of
europe
and
the
united
states
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
view
we
can
understand
the
relationship
*punct* ,
with
very
little
identity
*punct* ,
between
the
productions
of
north
america
and
europe,
*punct* ,
a
relationship
which
is
most
remarkable
*punct* ,
considering
the
distance
of
the
two
areas
*punct* ,
and
their
separation
by
the
atlantic
ocean
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
further
understand
the
singular
fact
remarked
on
by
several
observers
*punct* ,
that
the
productions
of
europe
and
america
during
the
later
tertiary
stages
were
more
closely
related
to
each
other
than
they
are
at
the
present
time
*punct* ;
for
during
these
warmer
periods
the
northern
parts
of
the
old
and
new
worlds
will
have
been
almost
continuously
united
by
land
*punct* ,
serving
as
a
bridge
*punct* ,
since
rendered
impassable
by
cold
*punct* ,
for
the
inter-migration
of
their
inhabitants
*punct* .
*break*
during
the
slowly
decreasing
warmth
of
the
pliocene
period
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
the
species
in
common
*punct* ,
which
inhabited
the
new
and
old
worlds
*punct* ,
migrated
south
of
the
polar
circle
*punct* ,
they
must
have
been
completely
cut
off
from
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
this
separation
*punct* ,
as
far
as
the
more
temperate
productions
are
concerned
*punct* ,
took
place
long
ages
ago
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
the
plants
and
animals
migrated
southward
*punct* ,
they
will
have
become
mingled
in
the
one
great
region
with
the
native
american
productions
*punct* ,
and
have
had
to
compete
with
them
*punct* ;
and
in
the
other
great
region
*punct* ,
with
those
of
the
old
world
*punct* .
*break*
consequently
we
have
here
everything
favourable
for
much
modification,
*punct* ,
for
far
more
modification
than
with
the
alpine
productions
*punct* ,
left
isolated
*punct* ,
within
a
much
more
recent
period
*punct* ,
on
the
several
mountain-ranges
and
on
the
arctic
lands
of
the
two
worlds
*punct* .
*break*
hence
it
has
come
*punct* ,
that
when
we
compare
the
now
living
productions
of
the
temperate
regions
of
the
new
and
old
worlds
*punct* ,
we
find
very
few
identical
species
*punct* ,
though
asa
gray
has
lately
shown
that
more
plants
are
identical
than
was
formerly
supposed
*punct* ,
but
we
find
in
every
great
class
many
forms
*punct* ,
which
some
naturalists
rank
as
geographical
races
*punct* ,
and
others
as
distinct
species
*punct* ;
and
a
host
of
closely
allied
or
representative
forms
which
are
ranked
by
all
naturalists
as
specifically
distinct
*punct* .
*break*
as
on
the
land
*punct* ,
so
in
the
waters
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
a
slow
southern
migration
of
a
marine
fauna
*punct* ,
which
during
the
pliocene
or
even
a
somewhat
earlier
period
*punct* ,
was
nearly
uniform
along
the
continuous
shores
of
the
polar
circle
*punct* ,
will
account
*punct* ,
on
the
theory
of
modification
*punct* ,
for
many
closely
allied
forms
now
living
in
areas
completely
sundered
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
we
can
understand
the
presence
of
many
existing
and
tertiary
representative
forms
on
the
eastern
and
western
shores
of
temperate
north
america
*punct* ;
and
the
still
more
striking
case
of
many
closely
allied
crustaceans
*punct* ,
as
described
in
dana's
admirable
work
*punct* ,
of
some
fish
and
other
marine
animals
*punct* ,
in
the
mediterranean
and
in
the
seas
of
japan,
*punct* ,
areas
now
separated
by
a
continent
and
by
nearly
a
hemisphere
of
equatorial
ocean
*punct* .
*break*
these
cases
of
relationship
*punct* ,
without
identity
*punct* ,
of
the
inhabitants
of
seas
now
disjoined
*punct* ,
and
likewise
of
the
past
and
present
inhabitants
of
the
temperate
lands
of
north
america
and
europe
*punct* ,
are
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
creation
*punct* .
*break*
we
cannot
say
that
they
have
been
created
alike
*punct* ,
in
correspondence
with
the
nearly
similar
physical
conditions
of
the
areas
*punct* ;
for
if
we
compare
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
certain
parts
of
south
america
with
the
southern
continents
of
the
old
world
*punct* ,
we
see
countries
closely
corresponding
in
all
their
physical
conditions
*punct* ,
but
with
their
inhabitants
utterly
dissimilar
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
must
return
to
our
more
immediate
subject
*punct* ,
the
glacial
period
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
convinced
that
forbes's
view
may
be
largely
extended
*punct* .
*break*
in
europe
we
have
the
plainest
evidence
of
the
cold
period
*punct* ,
from
the
western
shores
of
britain
to
the
oural
range
*punct* ,
and
southward
to
the
pyrenees
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
infer
*punct* ,
from
the
frozen
mammals
and
nature
of
the
mountain
vegetation
*punct* ,
that
siberia
was
similarly
affected
*punct* .
*break*
along
the
himalaya

at
points
900
miles

left
the
marks
of
their
former
low

south

*punct* ;
and
the

on

tell
the

story
*punct* .
*break*
if
one
account
which

excellent

it

analogous

striking

the
temperate

but
they

specifically
distinct

related

a
most
remarkable
manner

*break*
this
brief

applies

some
strictly
analogous
facts
could
be
given

the
distribution

*punct* .
*break*
in
marine
productions
*punct* ,
similar
cases
occur

as
an
example
*punct* ,
i
may
quote
a
remark
by
the
highest
authority
*punct* ,
prof
*punct* .
*break*
dana
*punct* ,
that
it
is
certainly
a
wonderful
fact
that
new
zealand
should
have
a
closer
resemblance
in
its
crustacea
to
great
britain
*punct* ,
its
antipode
*punct* ,
than
to
any
other
part
of
the

*punct* .
*break*
richardson
*punct* ,

the
reappearance
on

tasmania

c.
*punct* ,
of
northern

dr.

that
twenty-five
species

common

europe
*punct* ,
but
have
not
been
found
in
the

*punct* .
*break*
it
should
be
observed
that
the
northern
species
and
forms
found
in
the
southern
parts
of
the
southern
hemisphere
*punct* ,
and
on
the
mountain-ranges
of
the
intertropical
regions
*punct* ,
are
not
arctic
*punct* ,
but
belong
to
the
northern
temperate
zones
*punct* .
*break*
watson
has
recently
remarked
*punct* ,
in
receding
from
polar
towards
equatorial
latitudes
*punct* ,
the
alpine
or
mountain
floras
really
become
less
and
less
arctic
*punct* .
*break*
many
of
the
forms
living
on
the
mountains
of
the
warmer
regions
of
the
earth
and
in
the
southern
hemisphere
are
of
doubtful
value
*punct* ,
being
ranked
by
some
naturalists
as
specifically
distinct
*punct* ,
by
others
as
varieties
*punct* ;
but
some
are
certainly
identical
*punct* ,
and
many
*punct* ,
though
closely
related
to
northern
forms
*punct* ,
must
be
ranked
as
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
now
let
us
see
what
light
can
be
thrown
on
the
foregoing
facts
*punct* ,
on
the
belief
*punct* ,
supported
as
it
is
by
a
large
body
of
geological
evidence
*punct* ,
that
the
whole
world
*punct* ,
or
a
large
part
of
it
*punct* ,
was
during
the
glacial
period
simultaneously
much
colder
than
at
present
*punct* .
*break*
the
glacial
period
*punct* ,
as
measured
by
years
*punct* ,
must
have
been
very
long
*punct* ;
and
when
we
remember
over
what
vast
spaces
some
naturalised
plants
and
animals
have
spread
within
a
few
centuries
*punct* ,
this
period
will
have
been
ample
for
any
amount
of
migration
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
cold
came
slowly
on
*punct* ,
all
the
tropical
plants
and
other
productions
will
have
retreated
from
both
sides
towards
the
equator
*punct* ,
followed
in
the
rear
by
the
temperate
productions
*punct* ,
and
these
by
the
arctic
*punct* ;
but
with
the
latter
we
are
not
now
concerned
*punct* .
*break*
the
tropical
plants
probably
suffered
much
extinction
*punct* ;
how
much
no
one
can
say
*punct* ;
perhaps
formerly
the
tropics
supported
as
many
species
as
we
see
at
the
present
day
crowded
together
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
*punct* ,
and
in
parts
of
temperate
australia
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
know
that
many
tropical
plants
and
animals
can
withstand
a
considerable
amount
of
cold
*punct* ,
many
might
have
escaped
extermination
during
a
moderate
fall
of
temperature
*punct* ,
more
especially
by
escaping
into
the
warmest
spots
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
great
fact
to
bear
in
mind
is
*punct* ,
that
all
tropical
productions
will
have
suffered
to
a
certain
extent
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
the
temperate
productions
*punct* ,
after
migrating
nearer
to
the
equator
*punct* ,
though
they
will
have
been
placed
under
somewhat
new
conditions
*punct* ,
will
have
suffered
less
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
is
certain
that
many
temperate
plants
*punct* ,
if
protected
from
the
inroads
of
competitors
*punct* ,
can
withstand
a
much
warmer
climate
than
their
own
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
it
seems
to
me
possible
*punct* ,
bearing
in
mind
that
the
tropical
productions
were
in
a
suffering
state
and
could
not
have
presented
a
firm
front
against
intruders
*punct* ,
that
a
certain
number
of
the
more
vigorous
and
dominant
temperate
forms
might
have
penetrated
the
native
ranks
and
have
reached
or
even
crossed
the
equator
*punct* .
*break*
the
invasion
would
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
have
been
greatly
favoured
by
high
land
*punct* ,
and
perhaps
by
a
dry
climate
*punct* ;
for
dr.
falconer
informs
me
that
it
is
the
damp
with
the
heat
of
the
tropics
which
is
so
destructive
to
perennial
plants
from
a
temperate
climate
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
the
most
humid
and
hottest
districts
will
have
afforded
an
asylum
to
the
tropical
natives
*punct* .
*break*
the
mountain-ranges
north-west
of
the
himalaya
*punct* ,
and
the
long
line
of
the
cordillera
*punct* ,
seem
to
have
afforded
two
great
lines
of
invasion
*punct* :
and
it
is
a
striking
fact
*punct* ,
lately
communicated
to
me
by
dr.
hooker
*punct* ,
that
all
the
flowering
plants
*punct* ,
about
forty-six
in
number
*punct* ,
common
to
tierra
del
fuego
and
to
europe
still
exist
in
north
america
*punct* ,
which
must
have
lain
on
the
line
of
march
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
do
not
doubt
that
some
temperate
productions
entered
and
crossed
even
the
lowlands
of
the
tropics
at
the
period
when
the
cold
was
most
intense,
*punct* ,
when
arctic
forms
had
migrated
some
twenty-five
degrees
of
latitude
from
their
native
country
and
covered
the
land
at
the
foot
of
the
pyrenees
*punct* .
*break*
at
this
period
of
extreme
cold
*punct* ,
i
believe
that
the
climate
under
the
equator
at
the
level
of
the
sea
was
about
the
same
with
that
now
felt
there
at
the
height
of
six
or
seven
thousand
feet
*punct* .
*break*
during
this
the
coldest
period
*punct* ,
i
suppose
that
large
spaces
of
the
tropical
lowlands
were
clothed
with
a
mingled
tropical
and
temperate
vegetation
*punct* ,
like
that
now
growing
with
strange
luxuriance
at
the
base
of
the
himalaya
*punct* ,
as
graphically
described
by
hooker
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
a
considerable
number
of
plants
*punct* ,
a
few
terrestrial
animals
*punct* ,
and
some
marine
productions
*punct* ,
migrated
during
the
glacial
period
from
the
northern
and
southern
temperate
zones
into
the
intertropical
regions
*punct* ,
and
some
even
crossed
the
equator
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
warmth
returned
*punct* ,
these
temperate
forms
would
naturally
ascend
the
higher
mountains
*punct* ,
being
exterminated
on
the
lowlands
*punct* ;
those
which
had
not
reached
the
equator
*punct* ,
would
re-migrate
northward
or
southward
towards
their
former
homes
*punct* ;
but
the
forms
*punct* ,
chiefly
northern
*punct* ,
which
had
crossed
the
equator
*punct* ,
would
travel
still
further
from
their
homes
into
the
more
temperate
latitudes
of
the
opposite
hemisphere
*punct* .
*break*
although
we
have
reason
to
believe
from
geological
evidence
that
the
whole
body
of
arctic
shells
underwent
scarcely
any
modification
during
their
long
southern
migration
and
re-migration
northward
*punct* ,
the
case
may
have
been
wholly
different
with
those
intruding
forms
which
settled
themselves
on
the
intertropical
mountains
*punct* ,
and
in
the
southern
hemisphere
*punct* .
*break*
these
being
surrounded
by
strangers
will
have
had
to
compete
with
many
new
forms
of
life
*punct* ;
and
it
is
probable
that
selected
modifications
in
their
structure
*punct* ,
habits
*punct* ,
and
constitutions
will
have
profited
them
*punct* .
*break*
thus
many
of
these
wanderers
*punct* ,
though
still
plainly
related
by
inheritance
to
their
brethren
of
the
northern
or
southern
hemispheres
*punct* ,
now
exist
in
their
new
homes
as
well-marked
varieties
or
as
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
*punct* ,
strongly
insisted
on
by
hooker
in
regard
to
america
*punct* ,
and
by
alph
*punct* .
*break*
de
candolle
in
regard
to
australia
*punct* ,
that
many
more
identical
plants
and
allied
forms
have
apparently
migrated
from
the
north
to
the
south
*punct* ,
than
in
a
reversed
direction
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
a
few
southern
vegetable
forms
on
the
mountains
of
borneo
and
abyssinia
*punct* .
*break*
i
suspect
that
this
preponderant
migration
from
north
to
south
is
due
to
the
greater
extent
of
land
in
the
north
*punct* ,
and
to
the
northern
forms
having
existed
in
their
own
homes
in
greater
numbers
*punct* ,
and
having
consequently
been
advanced
through
natural
selection
and
competition
to
a
higher
stage
of
perfection
or
dominating
power
*punct* ,
than
the
southern
forms
*punct* .
*break*
and
thus
*punct* ,
when
they
became
commingled
during
the
glacial
period
*punct* ,
the
northern
forms
were
enabled
to
beat
the
less
powerful
southern
forms
*punct* .
*break*
just
in
the
same
manner
as
we
see
at
the
present
day
*punct* ,
that
very
many
european
productions
cover
the
ground
in
la
plata
*punct* ,
and
in
a
lesser
degree
in
australia
*punct* ,
and
have
to
a
certain
extent
beaten
the
natives
*punct* ;
whereas
extremely
few
southern
forms
have
become
naturalised
in
any
part
of
europe
*punct* ,
though
hides
*punct* ,
wool
*punct* ,
and
other
objects
likely
to
carry
seeds
have
been
largely
imported
into
europe
during
the
last
two
or
three
centuries
from
la
plata
*punct* ,
and
during
the
last
thirty
or
forty
years
from
australia
*punct* .
*break*
something
of
the
same
kind
must
have
occurred
on
the
intertropical
mountains
*punct* :
no
doubt
before
the
glacial
period
they
were
stocked
with
endemic
alpine
forms
*punct* ;
but
these
have
almost
everywhere
largely
yielded
to
the
more
dominant
forms
*punct* ,
generated
in
the
larger
areas
and
more
efficient
workshops
of
the
north
*punct* .
*break*
in
many
islands
the
native
productions
are
nearly
equalled
or
even
outnumbered
by
the
naturalised
*punct* ;
and
if
the
natives
have
not
been
actually
exterminated
*punct* ,
their
numbers
have
been
greatly
reduced
*punct* ,
and
this
is
the
first
stage
towards
extinction
*punct* .
*break*
a
mountain
is
an
island
on
the
land
*punct* ;
and
the
intertropical
mountains
before
the
glacial
period
must
have
been
completely
isolated
*punct* ;
and
i
believe
that
the
productions
of
these
islands
on
the
land
yielded
to
those
produced
within
the
larger
areas
of
the
north
*punct* ,
just
in
the
same
way
as
the
productions
of
real
islands
have
everywhere
lately
yielded
to
continental
forms
*punct* ,
naturalised
by
man's
agency
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
far
from
supposing
that
all
difficulties
are
removed
on
the
view
here
given
in
regard
to
the
range
and
affinities
of
the
allied
species
which
live
in
the
northern
and
southern
temperate
zones
and
on
the
mountains
of
the
intertropical
regions
*punct* .
*break*
very
many
difficulties
remain
to
be
solved
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
pretend
to
indicate
the
exact
lines
and
means
of
migration
*punct* ,
or
the
reason
why
certain
species
and
not
others
have
migrated
*punct* ;
why
certain
species
have
been
modified
and
have
given
rise
to
new
groups
of
forms
*punct* ,
and
others
have
remained
unaltered
*punct* .
*break*
we
cannot
hope
to
explain
such
facts
*punct* ,
until
we
can
say
why
one
species
and
not
another
becomes
naturalised
by
man's
agency
in
a
foreign
land
*punct* ;
why
one
ranges
twice
or
thrice
as
far
*punct* ,
and
is
twice
or
thrice
as
common
*punct* ,
as
another
species
within
their
own
homes

i
have
said

difficulties
remain

be
solved

most

in
his
botanical
works
on
the
antarctic
regions
*punct* .
*break*
these
cannot
be
here
discussed
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
only
say
that
as
far
as
regards
the
occurrence
of
identical
species
at
points
so
enormously
remote
as
kerguelen
land
*punct* ,
new
zealand
*punct* ,
and
fuegia
*punct* ,
i
believe
that
towards
the
close
of
the
glacial
period
*punct* ,
icebergs
*punct* ,
as
suggested
by
lyell
*punct* ,
have
been
largely
concerned
in
their
dispersal
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
existence
of
several
quite
distinct
species
*punct* ,
belonging
to
genera
exclusively
confined
to
the
south
*punct* ,
at
these
and
other
distant
points
of
the
southern
hemisphere
*punct* ,
is
*punct* ,
on
my
theory
of
descent
with
modification
*punct* ,
a
far
more
remarkable
case
of
difficulty
*punct* .
*break*
for
some
of
these
species
are
so
distinct
*punct* ,
that
we
cannot
suppose
that
there
has
been
time
since
the
commencement
of
the
glacial
period
for
their
migration
*punct* ,
and
for
their
subsequent
modification
to
the
necessary
degree
*punct* .
*break*
the
facts
seem
to
me
to
indicate
that
peculiar
and
very
distinct
species
have
migrated
in
radiating
lines
from
some
common
centre
*punct* ;
and
i
am
inclined
to
look
in
the
southern
*punct* ,
as
in
the
northern
hemisphere
*punct* ,
to
a
former
and
warmer
period
*punct* ,
before
the
commencement
of
the
glacial
period
*punct* ,
when
the
antarctic
lands
*punct* ,
now
covered
with
ice
*punct* ,
supported
a
highly
peculiar
and
isolated
flora
*punct* .
*break*
i
suspect
that
before
this
flora
was
exterminated
by
the
glacial
epoch
*punct* ,
a
few
forms
were
widely
dispersed
to
various
points
of
the
southern
hemisphere
by
occasional
means
of
transport
*punct* ,
and
by
the
aid
*punct* ,
as
halting-places
*punct* ,
of
existing
and
now
sunken
islands
*punct* ,
and
perhaps
at
the
commencement
of
the
glacial
period
*punct* ,
by
icebergs
*punct* .
*break*
by
these
means
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
the
southern
shores
of
america
*punct* ,
australia
*punct* ,
new
zealand
have
become
slightly
tinted
by
the
same
peculiar
forms
of
vegetable
life
*punct* .
*break*
lyell
in
a
striking
passage
has
speculated
*punct* ,
in
language
almost
identical
with
mine
*punct* ,
on
the
effects
of
great
alternations
of
climate
on
geographical
distribution
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
that
the
world
has
recently
felt
one
of
his
great
cycles
of
change
*punct* ;
and
that
on
this
view
*punct* ,
combined
with
modification
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
a
multitude
of
facts
in
the
present
distribution
both
of
the
same
and
of
allied
forms
of
life
can
be
explained
*punct* .
*break*
the
living
waters
may
be
said
to
have
flowed
during
one
short
period
from
the
north
and
from
the
south
*punct* ,
and
to
have
crossed
at
the
equator
*punct* ;
but
to
have
flowed
with
greater
force
from
the
north
so
as
to
have
freely
inundated
the
south
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
tide
leaves
its
drift
in
horizontal
lines
*punct* ,
though
rising
higher
on
the
shores
where
the
tide
rises
highest
*punct* ,
so
have
the
living
waters
left
their
living
drift
on
our
mountain-summits
*punct* ,
in
a
line
gently
rising
from
the
arctic
lowlands
to
a
great
height
under
the
equator
*punct* .
*break*
the
various
beings
thus
left
stranded
may
be
compared
with
savage
races
of
man
*punct* ,
driven
up
and
surviving
in
the
mountain-fastnesses
of
almost
every
land
*punct* ,
which
serve
as
a
record
*punct* ,
full
of
interest
to
us
*punct* ,
of
the
former
inhabitants
of
the
surrounding
lowlands
*punct* .
*break*
as
lakes
and
river-systems
are
separated
from
each
other
by
barriers
of
land
*punct* ,
it
might
have
been
thought
that
fresh-water
productions
would
not
have
ranged
widely
within
the
same
country
*punct* ,
and
as
the
sea
is
apparently
a
still
more
impassable
barrier
*punct* ,
that
they
never
would
have
extended
to
distant
countries
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
case
is
exactly
the
reverse
*punct* .
*break*
not
only
have
many
fresh-water
species
*punct* ,
belonging
to
quite
different
classes
*punct* ,
an
enormous
range
*punct* ,
but
allied
species
prevail
in
a
remarkable
manner
throughout
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
i
well
remember
*punct* ,
when
first
collecting
in
the
fresh
waters
of
brazil
*punct* ,
feeling
much
surprise
at
the
similarity
of
the
fresh-water
insects
*punct* ,
shells
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
and
at
the
dissimilarity
of
the
surrounding
terrestrial
beings
*punct* ,
compared
with
those
of
britain
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
power
in
fresh-water
productions
of
ranging
widely
*punct* ,
though
so
unexpected
*punct* ,
can
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
in
most
cases
be
explained
by
their
having
become
fitted
*punct* ,
in
a
manner
highly
useful
to
them
*punct* ,
for
short
and
frequent
migrations
from
pond
to
pond
*punct* ,
or
from
stream
to
stream
*punct* ;
and
liability
to
wide
dispersal
would
follow
from
this
capacity
as
an
almost
necessary
consequence
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
here
consider
only
a
few
cases
*punct* .
*break*
in
regard
to
fish
*punct* ,
i
believe
that
the
same
species
never
occur
in
the
fresh
waters
of
distant
continents
*punct* .
*break*
but
on
the
same
continent
the
species
often
range
widely
and
almost
capriciously
*punct* ;
for
two
river-systems
will
have
some
fish
in
common
and
some
different
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
facts
seem
to
favour
the
possibility
of
their
occasional
transport
by
accidental
means
*punct* ;
like
that
of
the
live
fish
not
rarely
dropped
by
whirlwinds
in
india
*punct* ,
and
the
vitality
of
their
ova
when
removed
from
the
water
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
am
inclined
to
attribute
the
dispersal
of
fresh-water
fish
mainly
to
slight
changes
within
the
recent
period
in
the
level
of
the
land
*punct* ,
having
caused
rivers
to
flow
into
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
instances
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
could
be
given
of
this
having
occurred
during
floods
*punct* ,
without
any
change
of
level
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
evidence
in
the
loess
of
the
rhine
of
considerable
changes
of
level
in
the
land
within
a
very
recent
geological
period
*punct* ,
and
when
the
surface
was
peopled
by
existing
land
and
fresh-water
shells
*punct* .
*break*
the
wide
difference
of
the
fish
on
opposite
sides
of
continuous
mountain-ranges
*punct* ,
which
from
an
early
period
must
have
parted
river-systems
and
completely
prevented
their
inosculation
*punct* ,
seems
to
lead
to
this
same
conclusion
*punct* .
*break*
with
respect
to
allied
fresh-water
fish
occurring
at
very
distant
points
of
the
world
*punct* ,
no
doubt
there
are
many
cases
which
cannot
at
present
be
explained
*punct* :
but
some
fresh-water
fish
belong
to
very
ancient
forms
*punct* ,
and
in
such
cases
there
will
have
been
ample
time
for
great
geographical
changes
*punct* ,
and
consequently
time
and
means
for
much
migration
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
second
place
*punct* ,
salt-water
fish
can
with
care
be
slowly
accustomed
to
live
in
fresh
water
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
according
to
valenciennes
*punct* ,
there
is
hardly
a
single
group
of
fishes
confined
exclusively
to
fresh
water
*punct* ,
so
that
we
may
imagine
that
a
marine
member
of
a
fresh-water
group
might
travel
far
along
the
shores
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
and
subsequently
become
modified
and
adapted
to
the
fresh
waters
of
a
distant
land
*punct* .
*break*
some
species
of
fresh-water
shells
have
a
very
wide
range
*punct* ,
and
allied
species
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
on
my
theory
*punct* ,
are
descended
from
a
common
parent
and
must
have
proceeded
from
a
single
source
*punct* ,
prevail
throughout
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
their
distribution
at
first
perplexed
me
much
*punct* ,
as
their
ova
are
not
likely
to
be
transported
by
birds
*punct* ,
and
they
are
immediately
killed
by
sea
water
*punct* ,
as
are
the
adults
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
even
understand
how
some
naturalised
species
have
rapidly
spread
throughout
the
same
country
*punct* .
*break*
but
two
facts
*punct* ,
which
i
have
observed
*punct* ,
and
no
doubt
many
others
remain
to
be
observed
*punct* ,
throw
some
light
on
this
subject
*punct* .
*break*
when
a
duck
suddenly
emerges
from
a
pond
covered
with
duck-weed
*punct* ,
i
have
twice
seen
these
little
plants
adhering
to
its
back
*punct* ;
and
it
has
happened
to
me
*punct* ,
in
removing
a
little
duck-weed
from
one
aquarium
to
another
*punct* ,
that
i
have
quite
unintentionally
stocked
the
one
with
fresh-water
shells
from
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
but
another
agency
is
perhaps
more
effectual
*punct* :
i
suspended
a
duck's
feet
*punct* ,
which
might
represent
those
of
a
bird
sleeping
in
a
natural
pond
*punct* ,
in
an
aquarium
*punct* ,
where
many
ova
of
fresh-water
shells
were
hatching
*punct* ;
and
i
found
that
numbers
of
the
extremely
minute
and
just
hatched
shells
crawled
on
the
feet
*punct* ,
and
clung
to
them
so
firmly
that
when
taken
out
of
the
water
they
could
not
be
jarred
off
*punct* ,
though
at
a
somewhat
more
advanced
age
they
would
voluntarily
drop
off
*punct* .
*break*
these
just
hatched
molluscs
*punct* ,
though
aquatic
in
their
nature
*punct* ,
survived
on
the
duck's
feet
*punct* ,
in
damp
air
*punct* ,
from
twelve
to
twenty
hours
*punct* ;
and
in
this
length
of
time
a
duck
or
heron
might
fly
at
least
six
or
seven
hundred
miles
*punct* ,
and
would
be
sure
to
alight
on
a
pool
or
rivulet
*punct* ,
if
blown
across
sea
to
an
oceanic
island
or
to
any
other
distant
point
*punct* .
*break*
sir
charles
lyell
also
informs
me
that
a
dyticus
has
been
caught
with
an
ancylus
*punct* ,
a
fresh-water
shell
like
a
limpet
*punct* ,
firmly
adhering
to
it
*punct* ;
and
a
water-beetle
of
the
same
family
*punct* ,
a
colymbetes
*punct* ,
once
flew
on
board
the
beagle
*punct* ,
when
forty-five
miles
distant
from
the
nearest
land
*punct* :
how
much
farther
it
might
have
flown
with
a
favouring
gale
no
one
can
tell
*punct* .
*break*
with
respect
to
plants
*punct* ,
it
has
long
been
known
what
enormous
ranges
many
fresh-water
and
even
marsh-species
have
*punct* ,
both
over
continents
and
to
the
most
remote
oceanic
islands
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
strikingly
shown
*punct* ,
as
remarked
by
alph
*punct* .
*break*
de
candolle
*punct* ,
in
large
groups
of
terrestrial
plants
*punct* ,
which
have
only
a
very
few
aquatic
members
*punct* ;
for
these
latter
seem
immediately
to
acquire
*punct* ,
as
if
in
consequence
*punct* ,
a
very
wide
range
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
favourable
means
of
dispersal
explain
this
fact
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
before
mentioned
that
earth
occasionally
*punct* ,
though
rarely
*punct* ,
adheres
in
some
quantity
to
the
feet
and
beaks
of
birds
*punct* .
*break*
wading
birds
*punct* ,
which
frequent
the
muddy
edges
of
ponds
*punct* ,
if
suddenly
flushed
*punct* ,
would
be
the
most
likely
to
have
muddy
feet
*punct* .
*break*
birds
of
this
order
i
can
show
are
the
greatest
wanderers
*punct* ,
and
are
occasionally
found
on
the
most
remote
and
barren
islands
in
the
open
ocean
*punct* ;
they
would
not
be
likely
to
alight
on
the
surface
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
so
that
the
dirt
would
not
be
washed
off
their
feet
*punct* ;
when
making
land
*punct* ,
they
would
be
sure
to
fly
to
their
natural
fresh-water
haunts
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
believe
that
botanists
are
aware
how
charged
the
mud
of
ponds
is
with
seeds
*punct* :
i
have
tried
several
little
experiments
*punct* ,
but
will
here
give
only
the
most
striking
case
*punct* :
i
took
in
february
three
table-spoonfuls
of
mud
from
three
different
points
*punct* ,
beneath
water
*punct* ,
on
the
edge
of
a
little
pond
*punct* ;
this
mud
when
dry
weighed
only
6
3/4
ounces
*punct* ;
i
kept
it
covered
up
in
my
study
for
six
months
*punct* ,
pulling
up
and
counting
each
plant
as
it
grew
*punct* ;
the
plants
were
of
many
kinds
*punct* ,
and
were
altogether
537
in
number
*punct* ;
and
yet
the
viscid
mud
was
all
contained
in
a
breakfast
cup
*punct* !
*break*
considering
these
facts
*punct* ,
i
think
it
would
be
an
inexplicable
circumstance
if
water-birds
did
not
transport
the
seeds
of
fresh-water
plants
to
vast
distances
*punct* ,
and
if
consequently
the
range
of
these
plants
was
not
very
great
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
agency
may
have
come
into
play
with
the
eggs
of
some
of
the
smaller
fresh-water
animals
*punct* .
*break*
other
and
unknown
agencies
probably
have
also
played
a
part
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
stated
that
fresh-water
fish
eat
some
kinds
of
seeds
*punct* ,
though
they
reject
many
other
kinds
after
having
swallowed
them
*punct* ;
even
small
fish
swallow
seeds
of
moderate
size
*punct* ,
as
of
the
yellow
water-lily
and
potamogeton
*punct* .
*break*
herons
and
other
birds
*punct* ,
century
after
century
*punct* ,
have
gone
on
daily
devouring
fish
*punct* ;
they
then
take
flight
and
go
to
other
waters
*punct* ,
or
are
blown
across
the
sea
*punct* ;
and
we
have
seen
that
seeds
retain
their
power
of
germination
*punct* ,
when
rejected
in
pellets
or
in
excrement
*punct* ,
many
hours
afterwards
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
saw
the
great
size
of
the
seeds
of
that
fine
water-lily
*punct* ,
the
nelumbium
*punct* ,
and
remembered
alph
*punct* .
*break*
de
candolle's
remarks
on
this
plant
*punct* ,
i
thought
that
its
distribution
must
remain
quite
inexplicable
*punct* ;
but
audubon
states
that
he
found
the
seeds
of
the
great
southern
water-lily
*punct* ,
probably
*punct* ,
according
to
dr.
hooker
*punct* ,
the
nelumbium
luteum
*punct* ,
in
a
heron's
stomach
*punct* ;
although
i
do
not
know
the
fact
*punct* ,
yet
analogy
makes
me
believe
that
a
heron
flying
to
another
pond
and
getting
a
hearty
meal
of
fish
*punct* ,
would
probably
reject
from
its
stomach
a
pellet
containing
the
seeds
of
the
nelumbium
undigested
*punct* ;
or
the
seeds
might
be
dropped
by
the
bird
whilst
feeding
its
young
*punct* ,
in
the
same
way
as
fish
are
known
sometimes
to
be
dropped
*punct* .
*break*
in
considering
these
several
means
of
distribution
*punct* ,
it
should
be
remembered
that
when
a
pond
or
stream
is
first
formed
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
on
a
rising
islet
*punct* ,
it
will
be
unoccupied
*punct* ;
and
a
single
seed
or
egg
will
have
a
good
chance
of
succeeding
*punct* .
*break*
although
there
will
always
be
a
struggle
for
life
between
the
individuals
of
the
species
*punct* ,
however
few
*punct* ,
already
occupying
any
pond
*punct* ,
yet
as
the
number
of
kinds
is
small
*punct* ,
compared
with
those
on
the
land
*punct* ,
the
competition
will
probably
be
less
severe
between
aquatic
than
between
terrestrial
species
*punct* ;
consequently
an
intruder
from
the
waters
of
a
foreign
country
*punct* ,
would
have
a
better
chance
of
seizing
on
a
place
*punct* ,
than
in
the
case
of
terrestrial
colonists
*punct* .
*break*
we
should
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
remember
that
some
*punct* ,
perhaps
many
*punct* ,
fresh-water
productions
are
low
in
the
scale
of
nature
*punct* ,
and
that
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
such
low
beings
change
or
become
modified
less
quickly
than
the
high
*punct* ;
and
this
will
give

of
many
species
having
formerly
ranged
as
continuously
as
fresh-water
productions
ever
can
range

over
immense
areas

depends
on
the
wide
dispersal
of
their

by
animals

more
especially
by
fresh-water

the
inhabitants
of
oceanic

*punct* ,
we
now
come
to
the
last
of
the
three
classes
of
facts
*punct* ,
which
i
have
selected
as
presenting
the
greatest
amount
of
difficulty
*punct* ,
on
the
view
that
all
the
individuals
both
of
the
same
and
of
allied
species
have
descended
from
a
single
parent
*punct* ;
and
therefore
have
all
proceeded
from
a
common
birthplace
*punct* ,
notwithstanding
that
in
the
course
of
time
they
have
come
to
inhabit
distant
points
of
the
globe
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
already
stated
that
i
cannot
honestly
admit
forbes's
view
on
continental
extensions
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
if
legitimately
followed
out
*punct* ,
would
lead
to
the
belief
that
within
the
recent
period
all
existing
islands
have
been
nearly
or
quite
joined
to
some
continent
*punct* .
*break*
this
view
would
remove
many
difficulties
*punct* ,
but
it
would
not
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
explain
all
the
facts
in
regard
to
insular
productions
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
following
remarks
i
shall
not
confine
myself
to
the
mere
question
of
dispersal
*punct* ;
but
shall
consider
some
other
facts
*punct* ,
which
bear
on
the
truth
of
the
two
theories
of
independent
creation
and
of
descent
with
modification
*punct* .
*break*
the
species
of
all
kinds
which
inhabit
oceanic
islands
are
few
in
number
compared
with
those
on
equal
continental
areas
*punct* :
alph
*punct* .
*break*
de
candolle
admits
this
for
plants
*punct* ,
and
wollaston
for
insects
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
look
to
the
large
size
and
varied
stations
of
new
zealand
*punct* ,
extending
over
780
miles
of
latitude
*punct* ,
and
compare
its
flowering
plants
*punct* ,
only
750
in
number
*punct* ,
with
those
on
an
equal
area
at
the
cape
of
good
hope
or
in
australia
*punct* ,
we
must
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
admit
that
something
quite
independently
of
any
difference
in
physical
conditions
has
caused
so
great
a
difference
in
number
*punct* .
*break*
even
the
uniform
county
of
cambridge
has
847
plants
*punct* ,
and
the
little
island
of
anglesea
764
*punct* ,
but
a
few
ferns
and
a
few
introduced
plants
are
included
in
these
numbers
*punct* ,
and
the
comparison
in
some
other
respects
is
not
quite
fair
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
evidence
that
the
barren
island
of
ascension
aboriginally
possessed
under
half-a-dozen
flowering
plants
*punct* ;
yet
many
have
become
naturalised
on
it
*punct* ,
as
they
have
on
new
zealand
and
on
every
other
oceanic
island
which
can
be
named
*punct* .
*break*
helena
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
naturalised
plants
and
animals
have
nearly
or
quite
exterminated
many
native
productions
*punct* .
*break*
he
who
admits
the
doctrine
of
the
creation
of
each
separate
species
*punct* ,
will
have
to
admit
*punct* ,
that
a
sufficient
number
of
the
best
adapted
plants
and
animals
have
not
been
created
on
oceanic
islands
*punct* ;
for
man
has
unintentionally
stocked
them
from
various
sources
far
more
fully
and
perfectly
than
has
nature
*punct* .
*break*
although
in
oceanic
islands
the
number
of
kinds
of
inhabitants
is
scanty
*punct* ,
the
proportion
of
endemic
species
*punct* ,
i.e
*punct* .
*break*
those
found
nowhere
else
in
the
world
*punct* ,
is
often
extremely
large
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
compare
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
number
of
the
endemic
land-shells
in
madeira
*punct* ,
or
of
the
endemic
birds
in
the
galapagos
archipelago
*punct* ,
with
the
number
found
on
any
continent
*punct* ,
and
then
compare
the
area
of
the
islands
with
that
of
the
continent
*punct* ,
we
shall
see
that
this
is
true
*punct* .
*break*
this
fact
might
have
been
expected
on
my
theory
*punct* ,
for
*punct* ,
as
already
explained
*punct* ,
species
occasionally
arriving
after
long
intervals
in
a
new
and
isolated
district
*punct* ,
and
having
to
compete
with
new
associates
*punct* ,
will
be
eminently
liable
to
modification
*punct* ,
and
will
often
produce
groups
of
modified
descendants
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
by
no
means
follows
*punct* ,
that
*punct* ,
because
in
an
island
nearly
all
the
species
of
one
class
are
peculiar
*punct* ,
those
of
another
class
*punct* ,
or
of
another
section
of
the
same
class
*punct* ,
are
peculiar
*punct* ;
and
this
difference
seems
to
depend
on
the
species
which
do
not
become
modified
having
immigrated
with
facility
and
in
a
body
*punct* ,
so
that
their
mutual
relations
have
not
been
much
disturbed
*punct* .
*break*
thus
in
the
galapagos
islands
nearly
every
land-bird
*punct* ,
but
only
two
out
of
the
eleven
marine
birds
*punct* ,
are
peculiar
*punct* ;
and
it
is
obvious
that
marine
birds
could
arrive
at
these
islands
more
easily
than
land-birds
*punct* .
*break*
m.
jones's
admirable
account
of
bermuda
*punct* ,
that
very
many
north
american
birds
*punct* ,
during
their
great
annual
migrations
*punct* ,
visit
either
periodically
or
occasionally
this
island
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
these
two
islands
of
bermuda
and
madeira
have
been
stocked
by
birds
*punct* ,
which
for
long
ages
have
struggled
together
in
their
former
homes
*punct* ,
and
have
become
mutually
adapted
to
each
other
*punct* ;
and
when
settled
in
their
new
homes
*punct* ,
each
kind
will
have
been
kept
by
the
others
to
their
proper
places
and
habits
*punct* ,
and
will
consequently
have
been
little
liable
to
modification
*punct* .
*break*
madeira
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
is
inhabited
by
a
wonderful
number
of
peculiar
land-shells
*punct* ,
whereas
not
one
species
of
sea-shell
is
confined
to
its
shores
*punct* :
now
*punct* ,
though
we
do
not
know
how
seashells
are
dispersed
*punct* ,
yet
we
can
see
that
their
eggs
or
larvae
*punct* ,
perhaps
attached
to
seaweed
or
floating
timber
*punct* ,
or
to
the
feet
of
wading-birds
*punct* ,
might
be
transported
far
more
easily
than
land-shells
*punct* ,
across
three
or
four
hundred
miles
of
open
sea
*punct* .
*break*
the
different
orders
of
insects
in
madeira
apparently
present
analogous
facts
*punct* .
*break*
oceanic
islands
are
sometimes
deficient
in
certain
classes
*punct* ,
and
their
places
are
apparently
occupied
by
the
other
inhabitants
*punct* ;
in
the
galapagos
islands
reptiles
*punct* ,
and
in
new
zealand
gigantic
wingless
birds
*punct* ,
take
the
place
of
mammals
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
plants
of
the
galapagos
islands
*punct* ,
dr.
hooker
has
shown
that
the
proportional
numbers
of
the
different
orders
are
very
different
from
what
they
are
elsewhere
*punct* .
*break*
such
cases
are
generally
accounted
for
by
the
physical
conditions
of
the
islands
*punct* ;
but
this
explanation
seems
to
me
not
a
little
doubtful
*punct* .
*break*
facility
of
immigration
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
has
been
at
least
as
important
as
the
nature
of
the
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
many
remarkable
little
facts
could
be
given
with
respect
to
the
inhabitants
of
remote
islands
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
in
certain
islands
not
tenanted
by
mammals
*punct* ,
some
of
the
endemic
plants
have
beautifully
hooked
seeds
*punct* ;
yet
few
relations
are
more
striking
than
the
adaptation
of
hooked
seeds
for
transportal
by
the
wool
and
fur
of
quadrupeds
*punct* .
*break*
this
case
presents
no
difficulty
on
my
view
*punct* ,
for
a
hooked
seed
might
be
transported
to
an
island
by
some
other
means
*punct* ;
and
the
plant
then
becoming
slightly
modified
*punct* ,
but
still
retaining
its
hooked
seeds
*punct* ,
would
form
an
endemic
species
*punct* ,
having
as
useless
an
appendage
as
any
rudimentary
organ,
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
as
the
shrivelled
wings
under
the
soldered
elytra
of
many
insular
beetles
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
islands
often
possess
trees
or
bushes
belonging
to
orders
which
elsewhere
include
only
herbaceous
species
*punct* ;
now
trees
*punct* ,
as
alph

*break*
de
candolle
has
shown
*punct* ,
generally
have
*punct* ,
whatever
the
cause
may
be
*punct* ,
confined
ranges
*punct* .
*break*
hence
trees
would
be
little
likely
to
reach
distant
oceanic
islands
*punct* ;
and
an
herbaceous
plant
*punct* ,
though
it
would
have
no
chance
of
successfully
competing
in
stature
with
a
fully
developed
tree
*punct* ,
when
established
on
an
island
and
having
to
compete
with
herbaceous
plants
alone
*punct* ,
might
readily
gain
an
advantage
by
growing
taller
and
taller
and
overtopping
the
other
plants
*punct* .
*break*
if
so
*punct* ,
natural
selection
would
often
tend
to
add
to
the
stature
of
herbaceous
plants
when
growing
on
an
island
*punct* ,
to
whatever
order
they
belonged
*punct* ,
and
thus
convert
them
first
into
bushes
and
ultimately
into
trees
*punct* .

respect
to
the
absence
of
whole
orders

oceanic

vincent
long
ago
remarked
that
batrachians
*punct* ,
frogs
*punct* ,
toads
*punct* ,
newts
*punct* ,
have
never
been
found
on
any
of
the
many
islands
with
which
the
great
oceans
are
studded
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
taken
pains
to
verify
this
assertion
*punct* ,
and
i
have
found
it
strictly
true
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
been
assured
that
a
frog
exists
on
the
mountains
of
the
great
island
of
new
zealand
*punct* ;
but
i
suspect
that
this
exception
*punct* ,
if
the
information
be
correct
*punct* ,
may
be
explained
through
glacial
agency
*punct* .
*break*
this
general
absence
of
frogs
*punct* ,
toads
*punct* ,
and
newts
on
so
many
oceanic
islands
cannot
be
accounted
for
by
their
physical
conditions
*punct* ;
indeed
it
seems
that
islands
are
peculiarly
well
fitted
for
these
animals
*punct* ;
for
frogs
have
been
introduced
into
madeira
*punct* ,
the
azores
*punct* ,
and
mauritius
*punct* ,
and
have
multiplied
so
as
to
become
a
nuisance
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
these
animals
and
their
spawn
are
known
to
be
immediately
killed
by
sea-water
*punct* ,
on
my
view
we
can
see
that
there
would
be
great
difficulty
in
their
transportal
across
the
sea
*punct* ,
and
therefore
why
they
do
not
exist
on
any
oceanic
island
*punct* .
*break*
but
why
*punct* ,
on
the
theory
of
creation
*punct* ,
they
should
not
have
been
created
there
*punct* ,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
explain
*punct* .
*break*
mammals
offer
another
and
similar
case
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
carefully
searched
the
oldest
voyages
*punct* ,
but
have
not
finished
my
search
*punct* ;
as
yet
i
have
not
found
a
single
instance
*punct* ,
free
from
doubt
*punct* ,
of
a
terrestrial
mammal
*punct* ,
excluding
domesticated
animals
kept
by
the
natives
*punct* ,
inhabiting
an
island
situated
above
300
miles
from
a
continent
or
great
continental
island
*punct* ;
and
many
islands
situated
at
a
much
less
distance
are
equally
barren
*punct* .
*break*
the
falkland
islands
*punct* ,
which
are
inhabited
by
a
wolf-like
fox
*punct* ,
come
nearest
to
an
exception
*punct* ;
but
this
group
cannot
be
considered
as
oceanic
*punct* ,
as
it
lies
on
a
bank
connected
with
the
mainland
*punct* ;
moreover
*punct* ,
icebergs
formerly
brought
boulders
to
its
western
shores
*punct* ,
and
they
may
have
formerly
transported
foxes
*punct* ,
as
so
frequently
now
happens
in
the
arctic
regions
*punct* .
*break*
yet
it
cannot
be
said
that
small
islands
will
not
support
small
mammals
*punct* ,
for
they
occur
in
many
parts
of
the
world
on
very
small
islands
*punct* ,
if
close
to
a
continent
*punct* ;
and
hardly
an
island
can
be
named
on
which
our
smaller
quadrupeds
have
not
become
naturalised
and
greatly
multiplied
*punct* .
*break*
it
cannot
be
said
*punct* ,
on
the
ordinary
view
of
creation
*punct* ,
that
there
has
not
been
time
for
the
creation
of
mammals
*punct* ;
many
volcanic
islands
are
sufficiently
ancient
*punct* ,
as
shown
by
the
stupendous
degradation
which
they
have
suffered
and
by
their
tertiary
strata
*punct* :
there
has
also
been
time
for
the
production
of
endemic
species
belonging
to
other
classes
*punct* ;
and
on
continents
it
is
thought
that
mammals
appear
and
disappear
at
a
quicker
rate
than
other
and
lower
animals
*punct* .
*break*
though
terrestrial
mammals
do
not
occur
on
oceanic
islands
*punct* ,
aerial
mammals
do
occur
on
almost
every
island
*punct* .
*break*
new
zealand
possesses
two
bats
found
nowhere

*punct* :
norfolk

the
viti

*punct* ,
the
bonin
islands
*punct* ,
the
caroline
and
marianne
archipelagoes
*punct* ,
and
mauritius
*punct* ,
all
possess
their
peculiar
bats
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
it
may
be
asked
*punct* ,
has
the
supposed
creative
force
produced
bats
and
no
other
mammals
on
remote
islands
*punct* ?
*break*
on
my
view
this
question
can
easily
be
answered
*punct* ;
for
no
terrestrial
mammal
can
be
transported
across
a
wide
space
of
sea
*punct* ,
but
bats
can
fly
across
*punct* .
*break*
bats
have
been
seen
wandering
by
day
far
over
the
atlantic
ocean
*punct* ;
and
two
north
american
species
either
regularly
or
occasionally
visit
bermuda
*punct* ,
at
the
distance
of
600
miles
from
the
mainland
*punct* .
*break*
i
hear
from
mr.
tomes
*punct* ,
who
has
specially
studied
this
family
*punct* ,
that
many
of
the
same
species
have
enormous
ranges
*punct* ,
and
are
found
on
continents
and
on
far
distant
islands
*punct* .
*break*
hence
we
have
only
to
suppose
that
such
wandering
species
have
been
modified
through
natural
selection
in
their
new
homes
in
relation
to
their
new
position
*punct* ,
and
we
can
understand
the
presence
of
endemic
bats
on
islands
*punct* ,
with
the
absence
of
all
terrestrial
mammals
*punct* .
*break*
besides
the
absence
of
terrestrial
mammals
in
relation
to
the
remoteness
of
islands
from
continents
*punct* ,
there
is
also
a
relation
*punct* ,
to
a
certain
extent
independent
of
distance
*punct* ,
between
the
depth
of
the
sea
separating
an
island
from
the
neighbouring
mainland
*punct* ,
and
the
presence
in
both
of
the
same
mammiferous
species
or
of
allied
species
in
a
more
or
less
modified
condition

mr.

made
some
striking
observations
on

regard
to
the
great
malay
archipelago
*punct* ,
which
is
traversed
near
celebes
by
a
space
of
deep

this

separates
two
widely
distinct
mammalian
faunas

*break*
on

the

are
situated

moderately
deep
submarine
banks

identical
quadrupeds

*break*
no
doubt
some
few
anomalies
occur
in
this
great
archipelago
*punct* ,
and
there
is
much
difficulty
in
forming
a
judgment
in
some
cases
owing
to
the
probable
naturalisation
of
certain
mammals
through
man's
agency
*punct* ;
but
we
shall
soon
have
much
light
thrown
on
the
natural
history
of
this
archipelago
by
the
admirable
zeal
and
researches
of
mr.
wallace
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
not
as
yet
had
time
to
follow
up
this
subject
in
all
other
quarters
of
the
world
*punct* ;
but
as
far
as
i
have
gone
*punct* ,
the
relation
generally
holds
good
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
britain
separated
by
a
shallow
channel
from
europe
*punct* ,
and
the
mammals
are
the
same
on
both
sides
*punct* ;
we
meet
with
analogous
facts
on
many
islands
separated
by
similar
channels
from
australia
*punct* .
*break*
the
west
indian
islands
stand
on
a
deeply
submerged
bank
*punct* ,
nearly
1000
fathoms
in
depth
*punct* ,
and
here
we
find
american
forms
*punct* ,
but
the
species
and
even
the
genera
are
distinct
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
amount
of
modification
in
all
cases
depends
to
a
certain
degree
on
the
lapse
of
time
*punct* ,
and
as
during
changes
of
level
it
is
obvious
that
islands
separated
by
shallow
channels
are
more
likely
to
have
been
continuously
united
within
a
recent
period
to
the
mainland
than
islands
separated
by
deeper
channels
*punct* ,
we
can
understand
the
frequent
relation
between
the
depth
of
the
sea
and
the
degree
of
affinity
of
the
mammalian
inhabitants
of
islands
with
those
of
a
neighbouring
continent,
*punct* ,
an
inexplicable
relation
on
the
view
of
independent
acts
of
creation
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
foregoing
remarks
on
the
inhabitants
of
oceanic
islands,
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
the
scarcity
of
kinds
*punct* ,
the
richness
in
endemic
forms
in
particular
classes
or
sections
of
classes,
*punct* ,
the
absence
of
whole
groups
*punct* ,
as
of
batrachians
*punct* ,
and
of
terrestrial
mammals
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
aerial
bats,
*punct* ,
the
singular
proportions
of
certain
orders
of
plants,
*punct* ,
herbaceous
forms
having
been
developed
into
trees
*punct* ,
&
c.,
*punct* ,
seem
to
me
to
accord
better
with
the
view
of
occasional
means
of
transport
having
been
largely
efficient
in
the
long
course
of
time
*punct* ,
than
with
the
view
of
all
our
oceanic
islands
having
been
formerly
connected
by
continuous
land
with
the
nearest
continent
*punct* ;
for
on
this
latter
view
the
migration
would
probably
have
been
more
complete
*punct* ;
and
if
modification
be
admitted
*punct* ,
all
the
forms
of
life
would
have
been
more
equally
modified
*punct* ,
in
accordance
with
the
paramount
importance
of
the
relation
of
organism
to
organism
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
deny
that
there
are
many
and
grave
difficulties
in
understanding
how
several
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
more
remote
islands
*punct* ,
whether
still
retaining
the
same
specific
form
or
modified
since
their
arrival
*punct* ,
could
have
reached
their
present
homes
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
probability
of
many
islands
having
existed
as
halting-places
*punct* ,
of
which
not
a
wreck
now
remains
*punct* ,
must
not
be
overlooked
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
here
give
a
single
instance
of
one
of
the
cases
of
difficulty
*punct* .
*break*
almost
all
oceanic
islands
*punct* ,
even
the
most
isolated
and
smallest
*punct* ,
are
inhabited
by
land-shells
*punct* ,
generally
by
endemic
species
*punct* ,
but
sometimes
by
species
found
elsewhere
*punct* .
*break*
gould
has
given
several
interesting
cases
in
regard
to
the
land-shells
of
the
islands
of
the
pacific
*punct* .
*break*
now
it
is
notorious
that
land-shells
are
very
easily
killed
by
salt
*punct* ;
their
eggs
*punct* ,
at
least
such
as
i
have
tried
*punct* ,
sink
in
sea-water
and
are
killed
by
it
*punct* .
*break*
yet
there
must
be
*punct* ,
on
my
view
*punct* ,
some
unknown
*punct* ,
but
highly
efficient
means
for
their
transportal
*punct* .
*break*
would
the
just-hatched
young
occasionally
crawl
on
and
adhere
to
the
feet
of
birds
roosting
on
the
ground
*punct* ,
and
thus
get
transported
*punct* ?
*break*
it
occurred
to
me
that
land-shells
*punct* ,
when
hybernating
and
having
a
membranous
diaphragm
over
the
mouth
of
the
shell
*punct* ,
might
be
floated
in
chinks
of
drifted
timber
across
moderately
wide
arms
of
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
found
that
several
species
did
in
this
state
withstand
uninjured
an
immersion
in
sea-water
during
seven
days
*punct* :
one
of
these
shells
was
the
helix
pomatia
*punct* ,
and
after
it
had
again
hybernated
i
put
it
in
sea-water
for
twenty
days
*punct* ,
and
it
perfectly
recovered
*punct* .
*break*
as
this
species
has
a
thick
calcareous
operculum
*punct* ,
i
removed
it
*punct* ,
and
when
it
had
formed
a
new
membranous
one
*punct* ,
i
immersed
it
for
fourteen
days
in
sea-water
*punct* ,
and
it
recovered
and
crawled
away
*punct* :
but
more
experiments
are
wanted
on
this
head
*punct* .
*break*
the
most
striking
and
important
fact
for
us
in
regard
to
the
inhabitants
of
islands
*punct* ,
is
their
affinity
to
those
of
the
nearest
mainland
*punct* ,
without
being
actually
the
same
species
*punct* .
*break*
numerous
instances
could
be
given
of
this
fact
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
give
only
one
*punct* ,
that
of
the
galapagos
archipelago
*punct* ,
situated
under
the
equator
*punct* ,
between
500
and
600
miles
from
the
shores
of
south
america
*punct* .
*break*
here
almost
every
product
of
the
land
and
water
bears
the
unmistakeable
stamp
of
the
american
continent
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
twenty-six
land
birds
*punct* ,
and
twenty-five
of
these
are
ranked
by
mr.
gould
as
distinct
species
*punct* ,
supposed
to
have
been
created
here
*punct* ;
yet
the
close
affinity
of
most
of
these
birds
to
american
species
in
every
character
*punct* ,
in
their
habits
*punct* ,
gestures
*punct* ,
and
tones
of
voice
*punct* ,
was
manifest
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
is
with
the
other
animals
*punct* ,
and
with
nearly
all
the
plants
*punct* ,
as
shown
by
dr.
hooker
in
his
admirable
memoir
on
the
flora
of
this
archipelago
*punct* .
*break*
the
naturalist
*punct* ,
looking
at
the
inhabitants
of
these
volcanic
islands
in
the
pacific
*punct* ,
distant
several
hundred
miles
from
the
continent
*punct* ,
yet
feels
that
he
is
standing
on
american
land
*punct* .
*break*
why
should
this
be
so
*punct* ?
*break*
why
should
the
species
which
are
supposed
to
have
been
created
in
the
galapagos
archipelago
*punct* ,
and
nowhere
else
*punct* ,
bear
so
plain
a
stamp
of
affinity
to
those
created
in
america
*punct* ?
*break*
there
is
nothing
in
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
in
the
geological
nature
of
the
islands
*punct* ,
in
their
height
or
climate
*punct* ,
or
in
the
proportions
in
which
the
several
classes
are
associated
together
*punct* ,
which
resembles
closely
the
conditions
of
the
south
american
coast
*punct* :
in
fact
there
is
a
considerable
dissimilarity
in
all
these
respects
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
there
is
a
considerable
degree
of
resemblance
in
the
volcanic
nature
of
the
soil
*punct* ,
in
climate
*punct* ,
height
*punct* ,
and
size
of
the
islands
*punct* ,
between
the
galapagos
and
cape
de
verde
archipelagos
*punct* :
but
what
an
entire
and
absolute
difference
in
their
inhabitants
*punct* !
*break*
the
inhabitants
of
the
cape
de
verde
islands
are
related
to
those
of
africa
*punct* ,
like
those
of
the
galapagos
to
america
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
this
grand
fact
can
receive
no
sort
of
explanation
on
the
ordinary
view
of
independent
creation
*punct* ;
whereas
on
the
view
here
maintained
*punct* ,
it
is
obvious
that
the
galapagos
islands
would
be
likely
to
receive
colonists
*punct* ,
whether
by
occasional
means
of
transport
or
by
formerly
continuous
land
*punct* ,
from
america
*punct* ;
and
the
cape
de
verde
islands
from
africa
*punct* ;
and
that
such
colonists
would
be
liable
to
modification;
*punct* ,
the
principle
of
inheritance
still
betraying
their
original
birthplace
*punct* .
*break*
many
analogous
facts
could
be
given
*punct* :
indeed
it
is
an
almost
universal
rule
that
the
endemic
productions
of
islands
are
related
to
those
of
the
nearest
continent
*punct* ,
or
of
other
near
islands
*punct* .
*break*
the
exceptions
are
few
*punct* ,
and
most
of
them
can
be
explained
*punct* .
*break*
thus
the
plants
of
kerguelen
land
*punct* ,
though
standing
nearer
to
africa
than
to
america
*punct* ,
are
related
*punct* ,
and
that
very
closely
*punct* ,
as
we
know
from
dr.
hooker's
account
*punct* ,
to
those
of
america
*punct* :
but
on
the
view
that
this
island
has
been
mainly
stocked
by
seeds
brought
with
earth
and
stones
on
icebergs
*punct* ,
drifted
by
the
prevailing
currents
*punct* ,
this
anomaly
disappears
*punct* .
*break*
new
zealand
in
its
endemic
plants
is
much
more
closely
related
to
australia
*punct* ,
the
nearest
mainland
*punct* ,
than
to
any
other
region
*punct* :
and
this
is
what
might
have
been
expected
*punct* ;
but
it
is
also
plainly
related
to
south
america
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
although
the
next
nearest
continent
*punct* ,
is
so
enormously
remote
*punct* ,
that
the
fact
becomes
an
anomaly
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
difficulty
almost
disappears
on
the
view
that
both
new
zealand
*punct* ,
south
america
*punct* ,
and
other
southern
lands
were
long
ago
partially
stocked
from
a
nearly
intermediate
though
distant
point
*punct* ,
namely
from
the
antarctic
islands
*punct* ,
when
they
were
clothed
with
vegetation
*punct* ,
before
the
commencement
of
the
glacial
period
*punct* .
*break*
the
affinity
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
though
feeble
*punct* ,
i
am
assured
by
dr.
hooker
is
real
*punct* ,
between
the
flora
of
the
south-western
corner
of
australia
and
of
the
cape
of
good
hope
*punct* ,
is
a
far
more
remarkable
case
*punct* ,
and
is
at
present
inexplicable
*punct* :
but
this
affinity
is
confined
to
the
plants
*punct* ,
and
will
*punct* ,
i
do
not
doubt
*punct* ,
be
some
day
explained
*punct* .
*break*
the
law
which
causes
the
inhabitants
of
an
archipelago
*punct* ,
though
specifically
distinct
*punct* ,
to
be
closely
allied
to
those
of
the
nearest
continent
*punct* ,
we
sometimes
see
displayed
on
a
small
scale
*punct* ,
yet
in
a
most
interesting
manner
*punct* ,
within
the
limits
of
the
same
archipelago
*punct* .
*break*
thus
the
several
islands
of
the
galapagos
archipelago
are
tenanted
*punct* ,
as
i
have
elsewhere
shown
*punct* ,
in
a
quite
marvellous
manner
*punct* ,
by
very
closely
related
species
*punct* ;
so
that
the
inhabitants
of
each
separate
island
*punct* ,
though
mostly
distinct
*punct* ,
are
related
in
an
incomparably
closer
degree
to
each
other
than
to
the
inhabitants
of
any
other
part
of
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
is
just
what
might
have
been
expected
on
my
view
*punct* ,
for
the
islands
are
situated
so
near
each
other
that
they
would
almost
certainly
receive
immigrants
from
the
same
original
source
*punct* ,
or
from
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
dissimilarity
between
the
endemic
inhabitants
of
the
islands
may
be
used
as
an
argument
against
my
views
*punct* ;
for
it
may
be
asked
*punct* ,
how
has
it
happened
in
the
several
islands
situated
within
sight
of
each
other
*punct* ,
having
the
same
geological
nature
*punct* ,
the
same
height
*punct* ,
climate
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
that
many
of
the
immigrants
should
have
been
differently
modified
*punct* ,
though
only
in
a
small
degree
*punct* .
*break*
this
long
appeared
to
me
a
great
difficulty
*punct* :
but
it
arises
in
chief
part
from
the
deeply-seated
error
of
considering
the
physical
conditions
of
a
country
as
the
most
important
for
its
inhabitants
*punct* ;
whereas
it
cannot
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
be
disputed
that
the
nature
of
the
other
inhabitants
*punct* ,
with
which
each
has
to
compete
*punct* ,
is
at
least
as
important
*punct* ,
and
generally
a
far
more
important
element
of
success
*punct* .
*break*
now
if
we
look
to
those
inhabitants
of
the
galapagos
archipelago
which
are
found
in
other
parts
of
the
world
*punct* ,
laying
on
one
side
for
the
moment
the
endemic
species
*punct* ,
which
cannot
be
here
fairly
included
*punct* ,
as
we
are
considering
how
they
have
come
to
be
modified
since
their
arrival
*punct* ,
we
find
a
considerable
amount
of
difference
in
the
several
islands
*punct* .
*break*
this
difference
might
indeed
have
been
expected
on
the
view
of
the
islands
having
been
stocked
by
occasional
means
of
transport
*punct* ,
a
seed
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
of
one
plant
having
been
brought
to
one
island
*punct* ,
and
that
of
another
plant
to
another
island
*punct* .
*break*
hence
when
in
former
times
an
immigrant
settled
on
any
one
or
more
of
the
islands
*punct* ,
or
when
it
subsequently
spread
from
one
island
to
another
*punct* ,
it
would
undoubtedly
be
exposed
to
different
conditions
of
life
in
the
different
islands
*punct* ,
for
it
would
have
to
compete
with
different
sets
of
organisms
*punct* :
a
plant
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
would
find
the
best-fitted
ground
more
perfectly
occupied
by
distinct
plants
in
one
island
than
in
another
*punct* ,
and
it
would
be
exposed
to
the
attacks
of
somewhat
different
enemies
*punct* .
*break*
if
then
it
varied
*punct* ,
natural
selection
would
probably
favour
different
varieties
in
the
different
islands
*punct* .
*break*
some
species
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
might
spread
and
yet
retain
the
same
character
throughout
the
group
*punct* ,
just
as
we
see
on
continents
some
species
spreading
widely
and
remaining
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
the
really
surprising
fact
in
this
case
of
the
galapagos
archipelago
*punct* ,
and
in
a
lesser
degree
in
some
analogous
instances
*punct* ,
is
that
the
new
species
formed
in
the
separate
islands
have
not
quickly
spread
to
the
other
islands
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
islands
*punct* ,
though
in
sight
of
each
other
*punct* ,
are
separated
by
deep
arms
of
the
sea
*punct* ,
in
most
cases
wider
than
the
british
channel
*punct* ,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
they
have
at
any
former
period
been
continuously
united
*punct* .
*break*
the
currents
of
the
sea
are
rapid
and
sweep
across
the
archipelago
*punct* ,
and
gales
of
wind
are
extraordinarily
rare
*punct* ;
so
that
the
islands
are
far
more
effectually
separated
from
each
other
than
they
appear
to
be
on
a
map
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
a
good
many
species
*punct* ,
both
those
found
in
other
parts
of
the
world
and
those
confined
to
the
archipelago
*punct* ,
are
common
to
the
several
islands
*punct* ,
and
we
may
infer
from
certain
facts
that
these
have
probably
spread
from
some
one
island
to
the
others
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
often
take
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
an
erroneous
view
of
the
probability
of
closely
allied
species
invading
each
other's
territory
*punct* ,
when
put
into
free
intercommunication
*punct* .
*break*
undoubtedly
if
one
species
has
any
advantage
whatever
over
another
*punct* ,
it
will
in
a
very
brief
time
wholly
or
in
part
supplant
it
*punct* ;
but
if
both
are
equally
well
fitted
for
their
own
places
in
nature
*punct* ,
both
probably
will
hold
their
own
places
and
keep
separate
for
almost
any
length
of
time
*punct* .
*break*
being
familiar
with
the
fact
that
many
species
*punct* ,
naturalised
through
man's
agency
*punct* ,
have
spread
with
astonishing
rapidity
over
new
countries
*punct* ,
we
are
apt
to
infer
that
most
species
would
thus
spread
*punct* ;
but
we
should
remember
that
the
forms
which
become
naturalised
in
new
countries
are
not
generally
closely
allied
to
the
aboriginal
inhabitants
*punct* ,
but
are
very
distinct
species
*punct* ,
belonging
in
a
large
proportion
of
cases
*punct* ,
as
shown
by
alph
*punct* .
*break*
de
candolle
*punct* ,
to
distinct
genera
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
galapagos
archipelago
*punct* ,
many
even
of
the
birds
*punct* ,
though
so
well
adapted
for
flying
from
island
to
island
*punct* ,
are
distinct
on
each
*punct* ;
thus
there
are
three
closely-allied
species
of
mocking-thrush
*punct* ,
each
confined
to
its
own
island
*punct* .
*break*
now
let
us
suppose
the
mocking-thrush
of
chatham
island
to
be
blown
to
charles
island
*punct* ,
which
has
its
own
mocking-thrush
*punct* :
why
should
it
succeed
in
establishing
itself
there
*punct* ?
*break*
we
may
safely
infer
that
charles
island
is
well
stocked
with
its
own
species
*punct* ,
for
annually
more
eggs
are
laid
there
than
can
possibly
be
reared
*punct* ;
and
we
may
infer
that
the
mocking-thrush
peculiar
to
charles
island
is
at
least
as
well
fitted
for
its
home
as
is
the
species
peculiar
to
chatham
island
*punct* .
*break*
lyell
and
mr.
wollaston
have
communicated
to
me
a
remarkable
fact
bearing
on
this
subject
*punct* ;
namely
*punct* ,
that
madeira
and
the
adjoining
islet
of
porto
santo
possess
many
distinct
but
representative
land-shells
*punct* ,
some
of
which
live
in
crevices
of
stone
*punct* ;
and
although
large
quantities
of
stone
are
annually
transported
from
porto
santo
to
madeira
*punct* ,
yet
this
latter
island
has
not
become
colonised
by
the
porto
santo
species
*punct* :
nevertheless
both
islands
have
been
colonised
by
some
european
land-shells
*punct* ,
which
no
doubt
had
some
advantage
over
the
indigenous
species
*punct* .
*break*
from
these
considerations
i
think
we
need
not
greatly
marvel
at
the
endemic
and
representative
species
*punct* ,
which
inhabit
the
several
islands
of
the
galapagos
archipelago
*punct* ,
not
having
universally
spread
from
island
to
island
*punct* .
*break*
in
many
other
instances
*punct* ,
as
in
the
several
districts
of
the
same
continent
*punct* ,
pre-occupation
has
probably
played
an
important
part
in
checking
the
commingling
of
species
under
the
same
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
the
south-east
and
south-west
corners
of
australia
have
nearly
the
same
physical
conditions
*punct* ,
and
are
united
by
continuous
land
*punct* ,
yet
they
are
inhabited
by
a
vast
number
of
distinct
mammals
*punct* ,
birds
*punct* ,
and
plants
*punct* .
*break*
the
principle
which
determines
the
general
character
of
the
fauna
and
flora
of
oceanic
islands
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
the
inhabitants
*punct* ,
when
not
identically
the
same
*punct* ,
yet
are
plainly
related
to
the
inhabitants
of
that
region
whence
colonists
could
most
readily
have
been
derived,
*punct* ,
the
colonists
having
been
subsequently
modified
and
better
fitted
to
their
new
homes,
*punct* ,
is
of
the
widest
application
throughout
nature
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
this
on
every
mountain
*punct* ,
in
every
lake
and
marsh
*punct* .
*break*
for
alpine
species
*punct* ,
excepting
in
so
far
as
the
same
forms
*punct* ,
chiefly
of
plants
*punct* ,
have
spread
widely
throughout
the
world
during
the
recent
glacial
epoch
*punct* ,
are
related
to
those
of
the
surrounding
lowlands;
*punct* ,
thus
we
have
in
south
america
*punct* ,
alpine
humming-birds
*punct* ,
alpine
rodents
*punct* ,
alpine
plants
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
all
of
strictly
american
forms
*punct* ,
and
it
is
obvious
that
a
mountain
*punct* ,
as
it
became
slowly
upheaved
*punct* ,
would
naturally
be
colonised
from
the
surrounding
lowlands
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
is
with
the
inhabitants
of
lakes
and
marshes
*punct* ,
excepting
in
so
far
as
great
facility
of
transport
has
given
the
same
general
forms
to
the
whole
world
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
this
same
principle
in
the
blind
animals
inhabiting
the
caves
of
america
and
of
europe
*punct* .
*break*
other
analogous
facts
could
be
given
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
will
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
be
universally
found
to
be
true
*punct* ,
that
wherever
in
two
regions
*punct* ,
let
them
be
ever
so
distant
*punct* ,
many
closely
allied
or
representative
species
occur
*punct* ,
there
will
likewise
be
found
some
identical
species
*punct* ,
showing
*punct* ,
in
accordance
with
the
foregoing
view
*punct* ,
that
at
some
former
period
there
has
been
intercommunication
or
migration
between
the
two
regions
*punct* .
*break*
and
wherever
many
closely-allied
species
occur
*punct* ,
there
will
be
found
many
forms
which
some
naturalists
rank
as
distinct
species
*punct* ,
and
some
as
varieties
*punct* ;
these
doubtful
forms
showing
us
the
steps
in
the
process
of
modification
*punct* .
*break*
this
relation
between
the
power
and
extent
of
migration
of
a
species
*punct* ,
either
at
the
present
time
or
at
some
former
period
under
different
physical
conditions
*punct* ,
and
the
existence
at
remote
points
of
the
world
of
other
species
allied
to
it
*punct* ,
is
shown
in
another
and
more
general
way
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
gould
remarked
to
me
long
ago
*punct* ,
that
in
those
genera
of
birds
which
range
over
the
world
*punct* ,
many
of
the
species
have
very
wide
ranges
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
hardly
doubt
that
this
rule
is
generally
true
*punct* ,
though
it
would
be
difficult
to
prove
it
*punct* .
*break*
amongst
mammals
*punct* ,
we
see
it
strikingly
displayed
in
bats
*punct* ,
and
in
a
lesser
degree
in
the
felidae
and
canidae
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
it
*punct* ,
if
we
compare
the
distribution
of
butterflies
and
beetles
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
is
with
most
fresh-water
productions
*punct* ,
in
which
so
many
genera
range
over
the
world
*punct* ,
and
many
individual
species
have
enormous
ranges
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
not
meant
that
in
world-ranging
genera
all
the
species
have
a
wide
range
*punct* ,
or
even
that
they
have
on
an
average
a
wide
range
*punct* ;
but
only
that
some
of
the
species
range
very
widely
*punct* ;
for
the
facility
with
which
widely-ranging
species
vary
and
give
rise
to
new
forms
will
largely
determine
their
average
range
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
two
varieties
of
the
same
species
inhabit
america
and
europe
*punct* ,
and
the
species
thus
has
an
immense
range
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
if
the
variation
had
been
a
little
greater
*punct* ,
the
two
varieties
would
have
been
ranked
as
distinct
species
*punct* ,
and
the
common
range
would
have
been
greatly
reduced
*punct* .
*break*
still
less
is
it
meant
*punct* ,
that
a
species
which
apparently
has
the
capacity
of
crossing
barriers
and
ranging
widely
*punct* ,
as
in
the
case
of
certain
powerfully-winged
birds
*punct* ,
will
necessarily
range
widely
*punct* ;
for
we
should
never
forget
that
to
range
widely
implies
not
only
the
power
of
crossing
barriers
*punct* ,
but
the
more
important
power
of
being
victorious
in
distant
lands
in
the
struggle
for
life
with
foreign
associates
*punct* .
*break*
but
on
the
view
of
all
the
species
of
a
genus
having
descended
from
a
single
parent
*punct* ,
though
now
distributed
to
the
most
remote
points
of
the
world
*punct* ,
we
ought
to
find
*punct* ,
and
i
believe
as
a
general
rule
we
do
find
*punct* ,
that
some
at
least
of
the
species
range
very
widely
*punct* ;
for
it
is
necessary
that
the
unmodified
parent
should
range
widely
*punct* ,
undergoing
modification
during
its
diffusion
*punct* ,
and
should
place
itself
under
diverse
conditions
favourable
for
the
conversion
of
its
offspring
*punct* ,
firstly
into
new
varieties
and
ultimately
into
new
species
*punct* .
*break*
in
considering
the
wide
distribution
of
certain
genera
*punct* ,
we
should
bear
in
mind
that
some
are
extremely
ancient
*punct* ,
and
must
have
branched
off
from
a
common
parent
at
a
remote
epoch
*punct* ;
so
that
in
such
cases
there
will
have
been
ample
time
for
great
climatal
and
geographical
changes
and
for
accidents
of
transport
*punct* ;
and
consequently
for
the
migration
of
some
of
the
species
into
all
quarters
of
the
world
*punct* ,
where
they
may
have
become
slightly
modified
in
relation
to
their
new
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
some
reason
to
believe
from
geological
evidence
that
organisms
low
in
the
scale
within
each
great
class
*punct* ,
generally
change
at
a
slower
rate
than
the
higher
forms
*punct* ;
and
consequently
the
lower
forms
will
have
had
a
better
chance
of
ranging
widely
and
of
still
retaining
the
same
specific
character
*punct* .
*break*
this
fact
*punct* ,
together
with
the
seeds
and
eggs
of
many
low
forms
being
very
minute
and
better
fitted
for
distant
transportation
*punct* ,
probably
accounts
for
a
law
which
has
long
been
observed
*punct* ,
and
which
has
lately
been
admirably
discussed
by
alph
*punct* .

to

the

more
widely
it
is
apt
to
range

profoundly
ignorant
we

the
difficulties

believing
that
all
the
individuals
of
the

*punct* ,
wherever
located
*punct* ,
have
descended
from
the

are
not
insuperable

*break*
and
we
are
led
to
this
conclusion
*punct* ,
which
has
been
arrived
at
by
many
naturalists
under
the
designation
of
single
centres
of
creation
*punct* ,
by
some
general
considerations

on
my
theory
must
have
spread
from
one
parent-source
*punct* ;
if
we
make
the
same
allowances
as
before
for
our
ignorance
*punct* ,
and
remember
that
some
forms
of
life
change
most
slowly
*punct* ,
enormous
periods

being
thus
granted

i
do
not

that
the
difficulties
are

though
they

i
have
attempted

show
how
important
has
been
the
influence

the
modern
glacial

i
am
fully

the
theory

generally
of

we

thus
understand
the
high

separate
our

it

the
inhabitants
of
the
plains

in
so

bearing
in
mind
that
the
mutual

see
why
two

to
come
in
more

according

the

were
capable

there
would

there
would
be
an

we
should
find

as
we
do
find

some
groups

greatly
*punct* ,

some
only
slightly
modified,

some
developed

some
existing

*break*
on
these

we
can

as
i
have
endeavoured
to
show
*punct* ,
why
oceanic
islands
should
have
few
inhabitants

but
of
these
a
great
number
should
be
endemic

migration
*punct* ,
one

we
can
see
why
whole
groups
of
organisms
*punct* ,

batrachians

terrestrial
mammals
*punct* ,
should
be
absent
from
oceanic
islands
*punct* ,
whilst
the
most
isolated
islands
possess
their
own
peculiar
species
of
aerial
mammals
or
bats
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
see
why
there
should
be
some
relation
between
the
presence
of
mammals
*punct* ,
in
a
more
or
less
modified
condition
*punct* ,
and
the
depth
of
the
sea
between
an
island
and
the
mainland
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
clearly
see
why
all
the
inhabitants
of
an
archipelago
*punct* ,
though
specifically
distinct
on
the
several
islets
*punct* ,
should
be
closely
related
to
each
other
*punct* ,
and
likewise
be
related
*punct* ,
but
less
closely
*punct* ,
to
those
of
the
nearest
continent
or
other
source
whence
immigrants
were
probably
derived
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
see
why
in
two
areas
*punct* ,
however
distant
from
each
other
*punct* ,
there
should
be
a
correlation
*punct* ,
in
the
presence
of
identical
species
*punct* ,
of
varieties
*punct* ,
of
doubtful
species
*punct* ,
and
of
distinct
but
representative
species
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
late
edward
forbes
often
insisted
*punct* ,
there
is
a
striking
parallelism
in
the
laws
of
life
throughout
time
and
space
*punct* :
the
laws
governing
the
succession
of
forms
in
past
times
being
nearly
the
same
with
those
governing
at
the
present
time
the
differences
in
different
areas
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
this
in
many
facts
*punct* .
*break*
the
endurance
of
each
species
and
group
of
species
is
continuous
in
time
*punct* ;
for
the
exceptions
to
the
rule
are
so
few
*punct* ,
that
they
may
fairly
be
attributed
to
our
not
having
as
yet
discovered
in
an
intermediate
deposit
the
forms
which
are
therein
absent
*punct* ,
but
which
occur
above
and
below
*punct* :
so
in
space
*punct* ,
it
certainly
is
the
general
rule
that
the
area
inhabited
by
a
single
species
*punct* ,
or
by
a
group
of
species
*punct* ,
is
continuous
*punct* ;
and
the
exceptions
*punct* ,
which
are
not
rare
*punct* ,
may
*punct* ,
as
i
have
attempted
to
show
*punct* ,
be
accounted
for
by
migration
at
some
former
period
under
different
conditions
or
by
occasional
means
of
transport
*punct* ,
and
by
the
species
having
become
extinct
in
the
intermediate
tracts
*punct* .
*break*
both
in
time
and
space
*punct* ,
species
and
groups
of
species
have
their
points
of
maximum
development
*punct* .
*break*
groups
of
species
*punct* ,
belonging
either
to
a
certain
period
of
time
*punct* ,
or
to
a
certain
area
*punct* ,
are
often
characterised
by
trifling
characters
in
common
*punct* ,
as
of
sculpture
or
colour
*punct* .
*break*
in
looking
to
the
long
succession
of
ages
*punct* ,
as
in
now
looking
to
distant
provinces
throughout
the
world
*punct* ,
we
find
that
some
organisms
differ
little
*punct* ,
whilst
others
belonging
to
a
different
class
*punct* ,
or
to
a
different
order
*punct* ,
or
even
only
to
a
different
family
of
the
same
order
*punct* ,
differ
greatly
*punct* .
*break*
in
both
time
and
space
the
lower
members
of
each
class
generally
change
less
than
the
higher
*punct* ;
but
there
are
in
both
cases
marked
exceptions
to
the
rule
*punct* .
*break*
on
my
theory
these
several
relations
throughout
time
and
space
are
intelligible
*punct* ;
for
whether
we
look
to
the
forms
of
life
which
have
changed
during
successive
ages
within
the
same
quarter
of
the
world
*punct* ,
or
to
those
which
have
changed
after
having
migrated
into
distant
quarters
*punct* ,
in
both
cases
the
forms
within
each
class
have
been
connected
by
the
same
bond
of
ordinary
generation
*punct* ;
and
the
more
nearly
any
two
forms
are
related
in
blood
*punct* ,
the
nearer
they
will
generally
stand
to
each
other
in
time
and
space
*punct* ;
in
both
cases
the
laws
of
variation
have
been
the
same
*punct* ,
and
modifications
have
been
accumulated
by
the
same
power
of
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
first
dawn
of
life
*punct* ,
all
organic
beings
are
found
to
resemble
each
other
in
descending
degrees
*punct* ,
so
that
they
can
be
classed
in
groups
under
groups
*punct* .
*break*
this
classification
is
evidently
not
arbitrary
like
the
grouping
of
the
stars
in
constellations
*punct* .
*break*
the
existence
of
groups
would
have
been
of
simple
signification
*punct* ,
if
one
group
had
been
exclusively
fitted
to
inhabit
the
land
*punct* ,
and
another
the
water
*punct* ;
one
to
feed
on
flesh
*punct* ,
another
on
vegetable
matter
*punct* ,
and
so
on
*punct* ;
but
the
case
is
widely
different
in
nature
*punct* ;
for
it
is
notorious
how
commonly
members
of
even
the
same
subgroup
have
different
habits
*punct* .
*break*
in
our
second
and
fourth
chapters
*punct* ,
on
variation
and
on
natural
selection
*punct* ,
i
have
attempted
to
show
that
it
is
the
widely
ranging
*punct* ,
the
much
diffused
and
common
*punct* ,
that
is
the
dominant
species
belonging
to
the
larger
genera
*punct* ,
which
vary
most
*punct* .
*break*
the
varieties
*punct* ,
or
incipient
species
*punct* ,
thus
produced
ultimately
become
converted
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
*punct* ,
into
new
and
distinct
species
*punct* ;
and
these
*punct* ,
on
the
principle
of
inheritance
*punct* ,
tend
to
produce
other
new
and
dominant
species
*punct* .
*break*
consequently
the
groups
which
are
now
large
*punct* ,
and
which
generally
include
many
dominant
species
*punct* ,
tend
to
go
on
increasing
indefinitely
in
size
*punct* .
*break*
i
further
attempted
to
show
that
from
the
varying
descendants
of
each
species
trying
to
occupy
as
many
and
as
different
places
as
possible
in
the
economy
of
nature
*punct* ,
there
is
a
constant
tendency
in
their
characters
to
diverge
*punct* .
*break*
this
conclusion
was
supported
by
looking
at
the
great
diversity
of
the
forms
of
life
which
*punct* ,
in
any
small
area
*punct* ,
come
into
the
closest
competition
*punct* ,
and
by
looking
to
certain
facts
in
naturalisation
*punct* .
*break*
i
attempted
also
to
show
that
there
is
a
constant
tendency
in
the
forms
which
are
increasing
in
number
and
diverging
in
character
*punct* ,
to
supplant
and
exterminate
the
less
divergent
*punct* ,
the
less
improved
*punct* ,
and
preceding
forms
*punct* .
*break*
i
request
the
reader
to
turn
to
the
diagram
illustrating
the
action
*punct* ,
as
formerly
explained
*punct* ,
of
these
several
principles
*punct* ;
and
he
will
see
that
the
inevitable
result
is
that
the
modified
descendants
proceeding
from
one
progenitor
become
broken
up
into
groups
subordinate
to
groups
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
diagram
each
letter
on
the
uppermost
line
may
represent
a
genus
including
several
species
*punct* ;
and
all
the
genera
on
this
line
form
together
one
class
*punct* ,
for
all
have
descended
from
one
ancient
but
unseen
parent
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
consequently
*punct* ,
have
inherited
something
in
common
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
three
genera
on
the
left
hand
have
*punct* ,
on
this
same
principle
*punct* ,
much
in
common
*punct* ,
and
form
a
sub-family
*punct* ,
distinct
from
that
including
the
next
two
genera
on
the
right
hand
*punct* ,
which
diverged
from
a
common
parent
at
the
fifth
stage
of
descent
*punct* .
*break*
these
five
genera
have
also
much
*punct* ,
though
less
*punct* ,
in
common
*punct* ;
and
they
form
a
family
distinct
from
that
including
the
three
genera
still
further
to
the
right
hand
*punct* ,
which
diverged
at
a
still
earlier
period
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
we
here
have
many
species
descended
from
a
single
progenitor
grouped
into
genera
*punct* ;
and
the
genera
are
included
in
*punct* ,
or
subordinate
to
*punct* ,
sub-families
*punct* ,
families
*punct* ,
and
orders
*punct* ,
all
united
into
one
class
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
the
grand
fact
in
natural
history
of
the
subordination
of
group
under
group
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
from
its
familiarity
*punct* ,
does
not
always
sufficiently
strike
us
*punct* ,
is
in
my
judgment
fully
explained
*punct* .
*break*
naturalists
try
to
arrange
the
species
*punct* ,
genera
*punct* ,
and
families
in
each
class
*punct* ,
on
what
is
called
the
natural
system
*punct* .
*break*
but
what
is
meant
by
this
system
*punct* ?
*break*
some
authors
look
at
it
merely
as
a
scheme
for
arranging
together
those
living
objects
which
are
most
alike
*punct* ,
and
for
separating
those
which
are
most
unlike
*punct* ;
or
as
an
artificial
means
for
enunciating
*punct* ,
as
briefly
as
possible
*punct* ,
general
propositions,
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
by
one
sentence
to
give
the
characters
common
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
to
all
mammals
*punct* ,
by
another
those
common
to
all
carnivora
*punct* ,
by
another
those
common
to
the
dog-genus
*punct* ,
and
then
by
adding
a
single
sentence
*punct* ,
a
full
description
is
given
of
each
kind
of
dog
*punct* .
*break*
the
ingenuity
and
utility
of
this
system
are
indisputable
*punct* .
*break*
but
many
naturalists
think
that
something
more
is
meant
by
the
natural
system
*punct* ;
they
believe
that
it
reveals
the
plan
of
the
creator
*punct* ;
but
unless
it
be
specified
whether
order
in
time
or
space
*punct* ,
or
what
else
is
meant
by
the
plan
of
the
creator
*punct* ,
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
is
thus
added
to
our
knowledge
*punct* .
*break*
such
expressions
as
that
famous
one
of
linnaeus
*punct* ,
and
which
we
often
meet
with
in
a
more
or
less
concealed
form
*punct* ,
that
the
characters
do
not
make
the
genus
*punct* ,
but
that
the
genus
gives
the
characters
*punct* ,
seem
to
imply
that
something
more
is
included
in
our
classification
*punct* ,
than
mere
resemblance
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
that
something
more
is
included
*punct* ;
and
that
propinquity
of
descent,
*punct* ,
the
only
known
cause
of
the
similarity
of
organic
beings,
*punct* ,
is
the
bond
*punct* ,
hidden
as
it
is
by
various
degrees
of
modification
*punct* ,
which
is
partially
revealed
to
us
by
our
classifications
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
now
consider
the
rules
followed
in
classification
*punct* ,
and
the
difficulties
which
are
encountered
on
the
view
that
classification
either
gives
some
unknown
plan
of
creation
*punct* ,
or
is
simply
a
scheme
for
enunciating
general
propositions
and
of
placing
together
the
forms
most
like
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
it
might
have
been
thought
*punct* ,
and
was
in
ancient
times
thought
*punct* ,
that
those
parts
of
the
structure
which
determined
the
habits
of
life
*punct* ,
and
the
general
place
of
each
being
in
the
economy
of
nature
*punct* ,
would
be
of
very
high
importance
in
classification
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
can
be
more
false
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
regards
the
external
similarity
of
a
mouse
to
a
shrew
*punct* ,
of
a
dugong
to
a
whale
*punct* ,
of
a
whale
to
a
fish
*punct* ,
as
of
any
importance
*punct* .
*break*
these
resemblances
*punct* ,
though
so
intimately
connected
with
the
whole
life
of
the
being
*punct* ,
are
ranked
as
merely
adaptive
or
analogical
characters
*punct* ;
but
to
the
consideration
of
these
resemblances
we
shall
have
to
recur
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
even
be
given
as
a
general
rule
*punct* ,
that
the
less
any
part
of
the
organisation
is
concerned
with
special
habits
*punct* ,
the
more
important
it
becomes
for
classification
*punct* .
*break*
as
an
instance
*punct* :
owen
*punct* ,
in
speaking
of
the
dugong
*punct* ,
says
*punct* ,
the
generative
organs
being
those
which
are
most
remotely
related
to
the
habits
and
food
of
an
animal
*punct* ,
i
have
always
regarded
as
affording
very
clear
indications
of
its
true
affinities
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
least
likely
in
the
modifications
of
these
organs
to
mistake
a
merely
adaptive
for
an
essential
character
*punct* .
*break*
so
with
plants
*punct* ,
how
remarkable
it
is
that
the
organs
of
vegetation
*punct* ,
on
which
their
whole
life
depends
*punct* ,
are
of
little
signification
*punct* ,
excepting
in
the
first
main
divisions
*punct* ;
whereas
the
organs
of
reproduction
*punct* ,
with
their
product
the
seed
*punct* ,
are
of
paramount
importance
*punct* !
*break*
we
must
not
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
in
classifying
*punct* ,
trust
to
resemblances
in
parts
of
the
organisation
*punct* ,
however
important
they
may
be
for
the
welfare
of
the
being
in
relation
to
the
outer
world
*punct* .
*break*
perhaps
from
this
cause
it
has
partly
arisen
*punct* ,
that
almost
all
naturalists
lay
the
greatest
stress
on
resemblances
in
organs
of
high
vital
or
physiological
importance
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
this
view
of
the
classificatory
importance
of
organs
which
are
important
is
generally
*punct* ,
but
by
no
means
always
*punct* ,
true
*punct* .
*break*
but
their
importance
for
classification
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
depends
on
their
greater
constancy
throughout
large
groups
of
species
*punct* ;
and
this
constancy
depends
on
such
organs
having
generally
been
subjected
to
less
change
in
the
adaptation
of
the
species
to
their
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
that
the
mere
physiological
importance
of
an
organ
does
not
determine
its
classificatory
value
*punct* ,
is
almost
shown
by
the
one
fact
*punct* ,
that
in
allied
groups
*punct* ,
in
which
the
same
organ
*punct* ,
as
we
have
every
reason
to
suppose
*punct* ,
has
nearly
the
same
physiological
value
*punct* ,
its
classificatory
value
is
widely
different
*punct* .
*break*
no
naturalist
can
have
worked
at
any
group
without
being
struck
with
this
fact
*punct* ;
and
it
has
been
most
fully
acknowledged
in
the
writings
of
almost
every
author
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
suffice
to
quote
the
highest
authority
*punct* ,
robert
brown
*punct* ,
who
in
speaking
of
certain
organs
in
the
proteaceae
*punct* ,
says
their
generic
importance
*punct* ,
like
that
of
all
their
parts
*punct* ,
not
only
in
this
but
*punct* ,
as
i
apprehend
*punct* ,
in
every
natural
family
*punct* ,
is
very
unequal
*punct* ,
and
in
some
cases
seems
to
be
entirely
lost
*punct* .
*break*
again
in
another
work
he
says
*punct* ,
the
genera
of
the
connaraceae
differ
in
having
one
or
more
ovaria
*punct* ,
in
the
existence
or
absence
of
albumen
*punct* ,
in
the
imbricate
or
valvular
aestivation
*punct* .
*break*
any
one
of
these
characters
singly
is
frequently
of
more
than
generic
importance
*punct* ,
though
here
even
when
all
taken
together
they
appear
insufficient
to
separate
cnestis
from
connarus
*punct* .
*break*
to
give
an
example
amongst
insects
*punct* ,
in
one
great
division
of
the
hymenoptera
*punct* ,
the
antennae
*punct* ,
as
westwood
has
remarked
*punct* ,
are
most
constant
in
structure
*punct* ;
in
another
division
they
differ
much
*punct* ,
and
the
differences
are
of
quite
subordinate
value
in
classification
*punct* ;
yet
no
one
probably
will
say
that
the
antennae
in
these
two
divisions
of
the
same
order
are
of
unequal
physiological
importance
*punct* .
*break*
any
number
of
instances
could
be
given
of
the
varying
importance
for
classification
of
the
same
important
organ
within
the
same
group
of
beings
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
no
one
will
say
that
rudimentary
or
atrophied
organs
are
of
high
physiological
or
vital
importance
*punct* ;
yet
*punct* ,
undoubtedly
*punct* ,
organs
in
this
condition
are
often
of
high
value
in
classification
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
will
dispute
that
the
rudimentary
teeth
in
the
upper
jaws
of
young
ruminants
*punct* ,
and
certain
rudimentary
bones
of
the
leg
*punct* ,
are
highly
serviceable
in
exhibiting
the
close
affinity
between
ruminants
and
pachyderms
*punct* .
*break*
robert
brown
has
strongly
insisted
on
the
fact

numerous
instances
could
be
given
of
characters
derived
from
parts
which
must
be
considered
of
very
trifling
physiological
importance
*punct* ,
but
which
are
universally
admitted
as
highly
serviceable
in
the
definition
of
whole
groups
*punct* .
*break*

instance
*punct* ,
whether
or
not
there
is
an
open

the
nostrils
to
the
mouth
*punct* ,
the
only

*punct* ,
according

which
absolutely
distinguishes
fishes
and
reptiles

the
nature
of
the

as
hair

in
the
vertebrata

*break*
if
the
ornithorhynchus
had
been
covered
with
feathers
instead
of
hair
*punct* ,
this
external
and
trifling
character
would
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
have
been
considered
by
naturalists
as
important
an
aid
in
determining
the
degree
of
affinity
of
this
strange
creature
to
birds
and
reptiles
*punct* ,
as
an
approach
in
structure
in
any
one
internal
and
important
organ
*punct* .
*break*
the
importance
*punct* ,
for
classification
*punct* ,
of
trifling
characters
*punct* ,
mainly
depends
on
their
being
correlated
with
several
other
characters
of
more
or
less
importance
*punct* .
*break*
the
value
indeed
of
an
aggregate
of
characters
is
very
evident
in
natural
history
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
as
has
often
been
remarked
*punct* ,
a
species
may
depart
from
its
allies
in
several
characters
*punct* ,
both
of
high
physiological
importance
and
of
almost
universal
prevalence
*punct* ,
and
yet
leave
us
in
no
doubt
where
it
should
be
ranked
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
it
has
been
found
*punct* ,
that
a
classification
founded
on
any
single
character
*punct* ,
however
important
that
may
be
*punct* ,
has
always
failed
*punct* ;
for
no
part
of
the
organisation
is
universally
constant
*punct* .
*break*
the
importance
of
an
aggregate
of
characters
*punct* ,
even
when
none
are
important
*punct* ,
alone
explains
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
that
saying
of
linnaeus
*punct* ,
that
the
characters
do
not
give
the
genus
*punct* ,
but
the
genus
gives
the
characters
*punct* ;
for
this
saying
seems
founded
on
an
appreciation
of
many
trifling
points
of
resemblance
*punct* ,
too
slight
to
be
defined
*punct* .
*break*
certain
plants
*punct* ,
belonging
to
the
malpighiaceae
*punct* ,
bear
perfect
and
degraded
flowers
*punct* ;
in
the
latter
*punct* ,
as
a
*punct* .
*break*
de
jussieu
has
remarked
*punct* ,
the
greater
number
of
the
characters
proper
to
the
species
*punct* ,
to
the
genus
*punct* ,
to
the
family
*punct* ,
to
the
class
*punct* ,
disappear
*punct* ,
and
thus
laugh
at
our
classification
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
aspicarpa
produced
in
france
*punct* ,
during
several
years
*punct* ,
only
degraded
flowers
*punct* ,
departing
so
wonderfully
in
a
number
of
the
most
important
points
of
structure
from
the
proper
type
of
the
order
*punct* ,
yet
m.
richard
sagaciously
saw
*punct* ,
as
jussieu
observes
*punct* ,
that
this
genus
should
still
be
retained
amongst
the
malpighiaceae
*punct* .
*break*
this
case
seems
to
me
well
to
illustrate
the
spirit
with
which
our
classifications
are
sometimes
necessarily
founded
*punct* .
*break*
practically
when
naturalists
are
at
work
*punct* ,
they
do
not
trouble
themselves
about
the
physiological
value
of
the
characters
which
they
use
in
defining
a
group
*punct* ,
or
in
allocating
any
particular
species
*punct* .
*break*
if
they
find
a
character
nearly
uniform
*punct* ,
and
common
to
a
great
number
of
forms
*punct* ,
and
not
common
to
others
*punct* ,
they
use
it
as
one
of
high
value
*punct* ;
if
common
to
some
lesser
number
*punct* ,
they
use
it
as
of
subordinate
value
*punct* .
*break*
this
principle
has
been
broadly
confessed
by
some
naturalists
to
be
the
true
one
*punct* ;
and
by
none
more
clearly
than
by
that
excellent
botanist
*punct* ,
aug
*punct* .
*break*
if
certain
characters
are
always
found
correlated
with
others
*punct* ,
though
no
apparent
bond
of
connexion
can
be
discovered
between
them
*punct* ,
especial
value
is
set
on
them
*punct* .
*break*
as
in
most
groups
of
animals
*punct* ,
important
organs
*punct* ,
such
as
those
for
propelling
the
blood
*punct* ,
or
for
aerating
it
*punct* ,
or
those
for
propagating
the
race
*punct* ,
are
found
nearly
uniform
*punct* ,
they
are
considered
as
highly
serviceable
in
classification
*punct* ;
but
in
some
groups
of
animals
all
these
*punct* ,
the
most
important
vital
organs
*punct* ,
are
found
to
offer
characters
of
quite
subordinate
value
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
see
why
characters
derived
from
the
embryo
should
be
of
equal
importance
with
those
derived
from
the
adult
*punct* ,
for
our
classifications
of
course
include
all
ages
of
each
species
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
is
by
no
means
obvious
*punct* ,
on
the
ordinary
view
*punct* ,
why
the
structure
of
the
embryo
should
be
more
important
for
this
purpose
than
that
of
the
adult
*punct* ,
which
alone
plays
its
full
part
in
the
economy
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
yet
it
has
been
strongly
urged
by
those
great
naturalists
*punct* ,
milne
edwards
and
agassiz
*punct* ,
that
embryonic
characters
are
the
most
important
of
any
in
the
classification
of
animals
*punct* ;
and
this
doctrine
has
very
generally
been
admitted
as
true
*punct* .
*break*
the
same
fact
holds
good
with
flowering
plants
*punct* ,
of
which
the
two
main
divisions
have
been
founded
on
characters
derived
from
the
embryo,
*punct* ,
on
the
number
and
position
of
the
embryonic
leaves
or
cotyledons
*punct* ,
and
on
the
mode
of
development
of
the
plumule
and
radicle
*punct* .
*break*
in
our
discussion
on
embryology
*punct* ,
we
shall
see
why
such
characters
are
so
valuable
*punct* ,
on
the
view
of
classification
tacitly
including
the
idea
of
descent
*punct* .
*break*
our
classifications
are
often
plainly
influenced
by
chains
of
affinities
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
can
be
easier
than
to
define
a
number
of
characters
common
to
all
birds
*punct* ;
but
in
the
case
of
crustaceans
*punct* ,
such
definition
has
hitherto
been
found
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
crustaceans
at
the
opposite
ends
of
the
series
*punct* ,
which
have
hardly
a
character
in
common
*punct* ;
yet
the
species
at
both
ends
*punct* ,
from
being
plainly
allied
to
others
*punct* ,
and
these
to
others
*punct* ,
and
so
onwards
*punct* ,
can
be
recognised
as
unequivocally
belonging
to
this
*punct* ,
and
to
no
other
class
of
the
articulata
*punct* .
*break*
geographical
distribution
has
often
been
used
*punct* ,
though
perhaps
not
quite
logically
*punct* ,
in
classification
*punct* ,
more
especially
in
very
large
groups
of
closely
allied
forms
*punct* .
*break*
temminck
insists
on
the
utility
or
even
necessity
of
this
practice
in
certain
groups
of
birds
*punct* ;
and
it
has
been
followed
by
several
entomologists
and
botanists
*punct* .
*break*
finally
*punct* ,
with
respect
to
the
comparative
value
of
the
various
groups
of
species
*punct* ,
such
as
orders
*punct* ,
sub-orders
*punct* ,
families
*punct* ,
sub-families
*punct* ,
and
genera
*punct* ,
they
seem
to
be
*punct* ,
at
least
at
present
*punct* ,
almost
arbitrary
*punct* .
*break*
several
of
the
best
botanists
*punct* ,
such
as
mr.
bentham
and
others
*punct* ,
have
strongly
insisted
on
their
arbitrary
value
*punct* .
*break*
instances
could
be
given
amongst
plants
and
insects
*punct* ,
of
a
group
of
forms
*punct* ,
first
ranked
by
practised
naturalists
as
only
a
genus
*punct* ,
and
then
raised
to
the
rank
of
a
sub-family
or
family
*punct* ;
and
this
has
been
done
*punct* ,
not
because
further
research
has
detected
important
structural
differences
*punct* ,
at
first
overlooked
*punct* ,
but
because
numerous
allied
species
*punct* ,
with
slightly
different
grades
of
difference
*punct* ,
have
been
subsequently
discovered
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
foregoing
rules
and
aids
and
difficulties
in
classification
are
explained
*punct* ,
if
i
do
not
greatly
deceive
myself
*punct* ,
on
the
view
that
the
natural
system
is
founded
on
descent
with
modification
*punct* ;
that
the
characters
which
naturalists
consider
as
showing
true
affinity
between
any
two
or
more
species
*punct* ,
are
those
which
have
been
inherited
from
a
common
parent
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
so
far
*punct* ,
all
true
classification
is
genealogical
*punct* ;
that
community
of
descent
is
the
hidden
bond
which
naturalists
have
been
unconsciously
seeking
*punct* ,
and
not
some
unknown
plan
of
creation
*punct* ,
or
the
enunciation
of
general
propositions
*punct* ,
and
the
mere
putting
together
and
separating
objects
more
or
less
alike
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
must
explain
my
meaning
more
fully
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
that
the
arrangement
of
the
groups
within
each
class
*punct* ,
in
due
subordination
and
relation
to
the
other
groups
*punct* ,
must
be
strictly
genealogical
in
order
to
be
natural
*punct* ;
but
that
the
amount
of
difference
in
the
several
branches
or
groups
*punct* ,
though
allied
in
the
same
degree
in
blood
to
their
common
progenitor
*punct* ,
may
differ
greatly
*punct* ,
being
due
to
the
different
degrees
of
modification
which
they
have
undergone
*punct* ;
and
this
is
expressed
by
the
forms
being
ranked
under
different
genera
*punct* ,
families
*punct* ,
sections
*punct* ,
or
orders
*punct* .
*break*
the
reader
will
best
understand
what
is
meant
*punct* ,
if
he
will
take
the
trouble
of
referring
to
the
diagram
in
the
fourth
chapter
*punct* .
*break*
now
all
these
modified
descendants
from
a
single
species
*punct* ,
are
represented
as
related
in
blood
or
descent
to
the
same
degree
*punct* ;
they
may
metaphorically
be
called
cousins
to
the
same
millionth
degree
*punct* ;
yet
they
differ
widely
and
in
different
degrees
from
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
the
forms
descended
from
a
*punct* ,
now
broken
up
into
two
or
three
families
*punct* ,
constitute
a
distinct
order
from
those
descended
from
i
*punct* ,
also
broken
up
into
two
families
*punct* .
*break*
nor
can
the
existing
species
*punct* ,
descended
from
a
*punct* ,
be
ranked
in
the
same
genus
with
the
parent
a
*punct* ;
or
those
from
i
*punct* ,
with
the
parent
i
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
the
amount
or
value
of
the
differences
between
organic
beings
all
related
to
each
other
in
the
same
degree
in
blood
*punct* ,
has
come
to
be
widely
different
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
their
genealogical
arrangement
remains
strictly
true
*punct* ,
not
only
at
the
present
time
*punct* ,
but
at
each
successive
period
of
descent
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
modified
descendants
from
a

have
inherited
something
in
common
from
their
common
parent
*punct* ,
as
will
all
the
descendants
from
i
*punct* ;
so
will
it
be
with
each
subordinate
branch
of
descendants
*punct* ,
at
each
successive
period
*punct* .
*break*
if
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
we
choose
to
suppose
that
any
of
the
descendants
of
a
or
of
i
have
been
so
much
modified
as
to
have
more
or
less
completely
lost
traces
of
their
parentage
*punct* ,
in
this
case
*punct* ,
their
places
in
a
natural
classification
will
have
been
more
or
less
completely
lost,
*punct* ,
as
sometimes
seems
to
have
occurred
with
existing
organisms
*punct* .
*break*
this
natural
arrangement
is
shown
*punct* ,
as
far
as
is
possible
on
paper
*punct* ,
in
the
diagram
*punct* ,
but
in
much
too
simple
a
manner
*punct* .
*break*
if
a
branching
diagram
had
not
been
used
*punct* ,
and
only
the
names
of
the
groups
had
been
written
in
a
linear
series
*punct* ,
it
would
have
been
still
less
possible
to
have
given
a
natural
arrangement
*punct* ;
and
it
is
notoriously
not
possible
to
represent
in
a
series
*punct* ,
on
a
flat
surface
*punct* ,
the
affinities
which
we
discover
in
nature
amongst
the
beings
of
the
same
group
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
on
the
view
which
i
hold
*punct* ,
the
natural
system
is
genealogical
in
its
arrangement
*punct* ,
like
a
pedigree
*punct* ;
but
the
degrees
of
modification
which
the
different
groups
have
undergone
*punct* ,
have
to
be
expressed
by
ranking
them
under
different
so-called
genera
*punct* ,
sub-families
*punct* ,
families
*punct* ,
sections
*punct* ,
orders
*punct* ,
and
classes
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
be
worth
while
to
illustrate
this
view
of
classification
*punct* ,
by
taking
the
case
of
languages
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
possessed
a
perfect
pedigree
of
mankind
*punct* ,
a
genealogical
arrangement
of
the
races
of
man
would
afford
the
best
classification
of
the
various
languages
now
spoken
throughout
the
world
*punct* ;
and
if
all
extinct
languages
*punct* ,
and
all
intermediate
and
slowly
changing
dialects
*punct* ,
had
to
be
included
*punct* ,
such
an
arrangement
would
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
be
the
only
possible
one
*punct* .
*break*
yet
it
might
be
that
some
very
ancient
language
had
altered
little
*punct* ,
and
had
given
rise
to
few
new
languages
*punct* ,
whilst
others
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
spreading
and
subsequent
isolation
and
states
of
civilisation
of
the
several
races
*punct* ,
descended
from
a
common
race
*punct* ,
had
altered
much
*punct* ,
and
had
given
rise
to
many
new
languages
and
dialects
*punct* .
*break*
the
various
degrees
of
difference
in
the
languages
from
the
same
stock
*punct* ,
would
have
to
be
expressed
by
groups
subordinate
to
groups
*punct* ;
but
the
proper
or
even
only
possible
arrangement
would
still
be
genealogical
*punct* ;
and
this
would
be
strictly
natural
*punct* ,
as
it
would
connect
together
all
languages
*punct* ,
extinct
and
modern
*punct* ,
by
the
closest
affinities
*punct* ,
and
would
give
the
filiation
and
origin
of
each
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
in
confirmation
of
this
view
*punct* ,
let
us
glance
at
the
classification
of
varieties
*punct* ,
which
are
believed
or
known
to
have
descended
from
one
species
*punct* .
*break*
these
are
grouped
under
species
*punct* ,
with
sub-varieties
under
varieties
*punct* ;
and
with
our
domestic
productions
*punct* ,
several
other
grades
of
difference
are
requisite
*punct* ,
as
we
have
seen
with
pigeons
*punct* .
*break*
the
origin
of
the
existence
of
groups
subordinate
to
groups
*punct* ,
is
the
same
with
varieties
as
with
species
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
closeness
of
descent
with
various
degrees
of
modification
*punct* .
*break*
nearly
the
same
rules
are
followed
in
classifying
varieties
*punct* ,
as
with
species
*punct* .
*break*
authors
have
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
classing
varieties
on
a
natural
instead
of
an
artificial
system
*punct* ;
we
are
cautioned
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
not
to
class
two
varieties
of
the
pine-apple
together
*punct* ,
merely
because
their
fruit
*punct* ,
though
the
most
important
part
*punct* ,
happens
to
be
nearly
identical
*punct* ;
no
one
puts
the
swedish
and
common
turnips
together
*punct* ,
though
the
esculent
and
thickened
stems
are
so
similar
*punct* .
*break*
whatever
part
is
found
to
be
most
constant
*punct* ,
is
used
in
classing
varieties
*punct* :
thus
the
great
agriculturist
marshall
says
the
horns
are
very
useful
for
this
purpose
with
cattle
*punct* ,
because
they
are
less
variable
than
the
shape
or
colour
of
the
body
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ;
whereas
with
sheep
the
horns
are
much

preferred

it

*break*
for
we
might
feel

whether
there

been
more

the

all
are
kept

the

nearly

*break*
if
it

every

brought

for
he
includes
in
his
lowest
grade
*punct* ,
or
that

*punct* ,
the
two

*punct* ;
and
how
enormously
these
sometimes
differ
in
the
most
important
characters
*punct* ,
is
known
to
every
naturalist
*punct* :
scarcely
a
single
fact
can
be
predicated
in
common
of
the
males
and
hermaphrodites
of
certain
cirripedes
*punct* ,
when
adult
*punct* ,
and
yet
no
one
dreams
of
separating
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
naturalist
includes
as
one
species
the
several
larval
stages
of
the
same
individual
*punct* ,
however
much
they
may
differ
from
each
other
and
from
the
adult
*punct* ;
as
he
likewise
includes
the
so-called
alternate
generations
of
steenstrup
*punct* ,
which
can
only
in
a
technical
sense
be
considered
as
the
same
individual
*punct* .
*break*
he
includes
monsters
*punct* ;
he
includes
varieties
*punct* ,
not
solely
because
they
closely
resemble
the
parent-form
*punct* ,
but
because
they
are
descended
from
it
*punct* .
*break*
he
who
believes
that
the
cowslip
is
descended
from
the
primrose
*punct* ,
or
conversely
*punct* ,
ranks
them
together
as
a
single
species
*punct* ,
and
gives
a
single
definition
*punct* .
*break*
as
soon
as
three
orchidean
forms
*punct* ,
monochanthus
*punct* ,
myanthus
*punct* ,
and
catasetum
*punct* ,
which
had
previously
been
ranked
as
three
distinct
genera

were
known
to
be
sometimes
produced
on
the

spike
*punct* ,
they
were
immediately
included
as
a
single
species
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
may
be
asked
*punct* ,
what
ought
we
to
do
*punct* ,
if
it
could
be
proved
that
one
species
of
kangaroo
had
been
produced
*punct* ,
by
a
long
course
of
modification
*punct* ,
from
a
bear
*punct* ?
*break*
ought
we
to
rank
this
one
species
with
bears
*punct* ,
and
what
should
we
do
with
the
other
species
*punct* ?
*break*
the
supposition
is
of
course
preposterous
*punct* ;
and
i
might
answer
by
the
argumentum
ad
hominem
*punct* ,
and
ask
what
should
be
done
if
a
perfect
kangaroo
were
seen
to
come
out
of
the
womb
of
a
bear
*punct* ?
*break*
according
to
all
analogy
*punct* ,
it
would
be
ranked
with
bears
*punct* ;
but
then
assuredly
all
the
other
species
of
the
kangaroo
family
would
have
to
be
classed
under
the
bear
genus
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
case
is
preposterous
*punct* ;
for
where
there
has
been
close
descent
in
common
*punct* ,
there
will
certainly
be
close
resemblance
or
affinity
*punct* .
*break*
as
descent
has
universally
been
used
in
classing
together
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
though
the
males
and
females
and
larvae
are
sometimes
extremely
different
*punct* ;
and
as
it
has
been
used
in
classing
varieties
which
have
undergone
a
certain
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
a
considerable
amount
of
modification
*punct* ,
may
not
this
same
element
of
descent
have
been
unconsciously
used
in
grouping
species
under
genera
*punct* ,
and
genera
under
higher
groups
*punct* ,
though
in
these
cases
the
modification
has
been
greater
in
degree
*punct* ,
and
has
taken
a
longer
time
to
complete
*punct* ?
*break*
i
believe
it
has
thus
been
unconsciously
used
*punct* ;
and
only
thus
can
i
understand
the
several
rules
and
guides
which
have
been
followed
by
our
best
systematists
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
no
written
pedigrees
*punct* ;
we
have
to
make
out
community
of
descent
by
resemblances
of
any
kind
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
we
choose
those
characters
which
*punct* ,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
*punct* ,
are
the
least
likely
to
have
been
modified
in
relation
to
the
conditions
of
life
to
which
each
species
has
been
recently
exposed
*punct* .
*break*
rudimentary
structures
on
this
view
are
as
good
as
*punct* ,
or
even
sometimes
better
than
*punct* ,
other
parts
of
the
organisation
*punct* .
*break*
we
care
not
how
trifling
a
character
may
be
*punct* ,
let
it
be
the
mere
inflection
of
the
angle
of
the
jaw
*punct* ,
the
manner
in
which
an
insect's
wing
is
folded
*punct* ,
whether
the
skin
be
covered
by
hair
or
feathers
*punct* ,
if
it
prevail
throughout
many
and
different
species
*punct* ,
especially
those
having
very
different
habits
of
life
*punct* ,
it
assumes
high
value
*punct* ;
for
we
can
account
for
its
presence
in
so
many
forms
with
such
different
habits
*punct* ,
only
by
its
inheritance
from
a
common
parent
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
err
in
this
respect
in
regard
to
single
points
of
structure
*punct* ,
but
when
several
characters
*punct* ,
let
them
be
ever
so
trifling
*punct* ,
occur
together
throughout
a
large
group
of
beings
having
different
habits
*punct* ,
we
may
feel
almost
sure
*punct* ,
on
the
theory
of
descent
*punct* ,
that
these
characters
have
been
inherited
from
a
common
ancestor
*punct* .
*break*
and
we
know
that
such
correlated
or
aggregated
characters
have
especial
value
in
classification
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
understand
why
a
species
or
a
group
of
species
may
depart
*punct* ,
in
several
of
its
most
important
characteristics
*punct* ,
from
its
allies
*punct* ,
and
yet
be
safely
classed
with
them
*punct* .
*break*
this
may
be
safely
done
*punct* ,
and
is
often
done
*punct* ,
as
long
as
a
sufficient
number
of
characters
*punct* ,
let
them
be
ever
so
unimportant
*punct* ,
betrays
the
hidden
bond
of
community
of
descent
*punct* .
*break*
let
two
forms
have
not
a
single
character
in
common
*punct* ,
yet
if
these
extreme
forms
are
connected
together
by
a
chain
of
intermediate
groups
*punct* ,
we
may
at
once
infer
their
community
of
descent
*punct* ,
and
we
put
them
all
into
the
same
class
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
find
organs
of
high
physiological
importance
*punct* ,
those
which
serve
to
preserve
life
under
the
most
diverse
conditions
of
existence
*punct* ,
are
generally
the
most
constant
*punct* ,
we
attach
especial
value
to
them
*punct* ;
but
if
these
same
organs
*punct* ,
in
another
group
or
section
of
a
group
*punct* ,
are
found
to
differ
much
*punct* ,
we
at
once
value
them
less
in
our
classification
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
hereafter
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
clearly
see
why
embryological
characters
are
of
such
high
classificatory
importance
*punct* .
*break*
geographical
distribution
may
sometimes
be
brought
usefully
into
play
in
classing
large
and
widely-distributed
genera
*punct* ,
because
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
inhabiting
any
distinct
and
isolated
region
*punct* ,
have
in
all
probability
descended
from
the
same
parents
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
understand
*punct* ,
on
these
views
*punct* ,
the
very
important
distinction
between
real
affinities
and
analogical
or
adaptive
resemblances
*punct* .
*break*
lamarck
first
called
attention
to
this
distinction
*punct* ,
and
he
has
been
ably
followed
by
macleay
and
others
*punct* .
*break*
the
resemblance
*punct* ,
in
the
shape
of
the
body
and
in
the
fin-like
anterior
limbs
*punct* ,
between
the
dugong
*punct* ,
which
is
a
pachydermatous
animal
*punct* ,
and
the
whale
*punct* ,
and
between
both
these
mammals
and
fishes
*punct* ,
is
analogical
*punct* .
*break*
amongst
insects
there
are
innumerable
instances
*punct* :
thus
linnaeus
*punct* ,
misled
by
external
appearances
*punct* ,
actually
classed
an
homopterous
insect
as
a
moth
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
something
of
the
same
kind
even
in
our
domestic
varieties
*punct* ,
as
in
the
thickened
stems
of
the
common
and
swedish
turnip
*punct* .
*break*
the
resemblance
of
the
greyhound
and
racehorse
is
hardly
more
fanciful
than
the
analogies
which
have
been
drawn
by
some
authors
between
very
distinct
animals
*punct* .
*break*
on
my
view
of
characters
being
of
real
importance
for
classification
*punct* ,
only
in
so
far
as
they
reveal
descent
*punct* ,
we
can
clearly
understand
why
analogical
or
adaptive
character
*punct* ,
although
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
welfare
of
the
being
*punct* ,
are
almost
valueless
to
the
systematist
*punct* .
*break*
for
animals
*punct* ,
belonging
to
two
most
distinct
lines
of
descent
*punct* ,
may
readily
become
adapted
to
similar
conditions
*punct* ,
and
thus
assume
a
close
external
resemblance
*punct* ;
but
such
resemblances
will
not
reveal
*punct* ,
will
rather
tend
to
conceal
their
blood-relationship
to
their
proper
lines
of
descent
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
also
understand
the
apparent
paradox
*punct* ,
that
the
very
same
characters
are
analogical
when
one
class
or
order
is
compared
with
another
*punct* ,
but
give
true
affinities
when
the
members
of
the
same
class
or
order
are
compared
one
with
another
*punct* :
thus
the
shape
of
the
body
and
fin-like
limbs
are
only
analogical
when
whales
are
compared
with
fishes
*punct* ,
being
adaptations
in
both
classes
for
swimming
through
the
water
*punct* ;
but
the
shape
of
the
body
and
fin-like
limbs
serve
as
characters
exhibiting
true
affinity
between
the
several
members
of
the
whale
family
*punct* ;
for
these
cetaceans
agree
in
so
many
characters
*punct* ,
great
and
small
*punct* ,
that
we
cannot
doubt
that
they
have
inherited
their
general
shape
of
body
and
structure
of
limbs
from
a
common
ancestor
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
is
with
fishes
*punct* .
*break*
as
members
of
distinct
classes
have
often
been
adapted
by
successive
slight
modifications
to
live
under
nearly
similar
circumstances,
*punct* ,
to
inhabit
for
instance
the
three
elements
of
land
*punct* ,
air
*punct* ,
and
water,
*punct* ,
we
can
perhaps
understand
how
it
is
that
a
numerical
parallelism
has
sometimes
been
observed
between
the
sub-groups
in
distinct
classes
*punct* .
*break*
a
naturalist
*punct* ,
struck
by
a
parallelism
of
this
nature
in
any
one
class
*punct* ,
by
arbitrarily
raising
or
sinking
the
value
of
the
groups
in
other
classes
*punct* ,
and
all
our
experience
shows
that
this
valuation
has
hitherto
been
arbitrary
*punct* ,
could
easily
extend
the
parallelism
over
a
wide
range
*punct* ;
and
thus
the
septenary
*punct* ,
quinary
*punct* ,
quaternary
*punct* ,
and
ternary
classifications
have
probably
arisen
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
modified
descendants
of
dominant
species
*punct* ,
belonging
to
the
larger
genera
*punct* ,
tend
to
inherit
the
advantages
*punct* ,
which
made
the
groups
to
which
they
belong
large
and
their
parents
dominant
*punct* ,
they
are
almost
sure
to
spread
widely
*punct* ,
and
to
seize
on
more
and
more
places
in
the
economy
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
the
larger
and
more
dominant
groups
thus
tend
to
go
on
increasing
in
size
*punct* ;
and
they
consequently
supplant
many
smaller
and
feebler
groups
*punct* .
*break*
thus
we
can
account
for
the
fact
that
all
organisms
*punct* ,
recent
and
extinct
*punct* ,
are
included
under
a
few
great
orders
*punct* ,
under
still
fewer
classes
*punct* ,
and
all
in
one
great
natural
system
*punct* .
*break*
as
showing
how
few
the
higher
groups
are
in
number
*punct* ,
and
how
widely
spread
they
are
throughout
the
world
*punct* ,
the
fact
is
striking
*punct* ,
that
the
discovery
of
australia
has
not
added
a
single
insect
belonging
to
a
new
order
*punct* ;
and
that
in
the
vegetable
kingdom
*punct* ,
as
i
learn
from
dr.
hooker
*punct* ,
it
has
added
only
two
or
three
orders
of
small
size
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
chapter
on
geological
succession
i
attempted
to
show
*punct* ,
on
the
principle
of
each
group
having
generally
diverged
much
in
character
during
the
long-continued
process
of
modification
*punct* ,
how
it
is
that
the
more
ancient
forms
of
life
often
present
characters
in
some
slight
degree
intermediate
between
existing
groups
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
old
and
intermediate
parent-forms
having
occasionally
transmitted
to
the
present
day
descendants
but
little
modified
*punct* ,
will
give
to
us
our
so-called
osculant
or
aberrant
groups
*punct* .
*break*
the
more
aberrant
any
form
is
*punct* ,
the
greater
must
be
the
number
of
connecting
forms
which
on
my
theory
have
been
exterminated
and
utterly
lost
*punct* .
*break*
and
we
have
some
evidence
of
aberrant
forms
having
suffered
severely
from
extinction
*punct* ,
for
they
are
generally
represented
by
extremely
few
species
*punct* ;
and
such
species
as
do
occur
are
generally
very
distinct
from
each
other
*punct* ,
which
again
implies
extinction
*punct* .
*break*
the
genera
ornithorhynchus
and
lepidosiren
*punct* ,
for
example
*punct* ,
would
not
have
been
less
aberrant
had
each
been
represented
by
a
dozen
species
instead
of
by
a
single
one
*punct* ;
but
such
richness
in
species
*punct* ,
as
i
find
after
some
investigation
*punct* ,
does
not
commonly
fall
to
the
lot
of
aberrant
genera
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
account
for
this
fact
only
by
looking
at
aberrant
forms
as
failing
groups
conquered
by
more
successful
competitors
*punct* ,
with
a
few
members
preserved
by
some
unusual
coincidence
of
favourable
circumstances
*punct* .
*break*
mr.
waterhouse
has
remarked
that
*punct* ,
when
a
member
belonging
to
one
group
of
animals
exhibits
an
affinity
to
a
quite
distinct
group
*punct* ,
this
affinity
in
most
cases
is
general
and
not
special
*punct* :
thus
*punct* ,
according
to
mr.
waterhouse
*punct* ,
of
all
rodents
*punct* ,
the
bizcacha
is
most
nearly
related
to
marsupials
*punct* ;
but
in
the
points
in
which
it
approaches
this
order
*punct* ,
its
relations
are
general
*punct* ,
and
not
to
any
one
marsupial
species
more
than
to
another
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
points
of
affinity
of
the
bizcacha
to
marsupials
are
believed
to
be
real
and
not
merely
adaptive
*punct* ,
they
are
due
on
my
theory
to
inheritance
in
common
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
we
must
suppose
either
that
all
rodents
*punct* ,
including
the
bizcacha
*punct* ,
branched
off
from
some
very
ancient
marsupial
*punct* ,
which
will
have
had
a
character
in
some
degree
intermediate
with
respect
to
all
existing
marsupials
*punct* ;
or
that
both
rodents
and
marsupials
branched
off
from
a
common
progenitor
*punct* ,
and
that
both
groups
have
since
undergone
much
modification
in
divergent
directions
*punct* .
*break*
on
either
view
we
may
suppose
that
the
bizcacha
has
retained
*punct* ,
by
inheritance
*punct* ,
more
of
the
character
of
its
ancient
progenitor
than
have
other
rodents
*punct* ;
and
therefore
it
will

marsupials

having
partially
retained
the
character
of
their
common
progenitor
*punct* ,
or
of
an
early
member
of
the

*break*
on
the

*punct* ,
of
all
marsupials
*punct* ,
as
mr.
waterhouse
has
remarked
*punct* ,
the
phascolomys
resembles
most
nearly
*punct* ,
not
any
one
species
*punct* ,
but
the
general
order
of
rodents
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
case
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
it
may
be
strongly
suspected
that
the
resemblance
is
only
analogical
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
phascolomys
having
become
adapted
to
habits
like
those
of
a
rodent
*punct* .
*break*
the
elder
de
candolle
has
made
nearly
similar
observations
on
the
general
nature
of
the
affinities
of
distinct
orders
of
plants
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
principle
of
the
multiplication
and
gradual
divergence
in
character
of
the
species
descended
from
a
common
parent
*punct* ,
together
with
their
retention
by
inheritance
of
some
characters
in
common
*punct* ,
we
can
understand
the
excessively
complex
and
radiating
affinities
by
which
all
the
members
of
the
same
family
or
higher
group
are
connected
together
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
common
parent
of
a
whole
family
of
species
*punct* ,
now
broken
up
by
extinction
into
distinct
groups
and
sub-groups
*punct* ,
will
have
transmitted
some
of
its
characters
*punct* ,
modified
in
various
ways
and
degrees
*punct* ,
to
all
*punct* ;
and
the
several
species
will
consequently
be
related
to
each
other
by
circuitous
lines
of
affinity
of
various
lengths
*punct* ,
as
may
be
seen
in
the
diagram
so
often
referred
to
*punct* ,
mounting
up
through
many
predecessors
*punct* .
*break*
as
it
is
difficult
to
show
the
blood-relationship
between
the
numerous
kindred
of
any
ancient
and
noble
family
*punct* ,
even
by
the
aid
of
a
genealogical
tree
*punct* ,
and
almost
impossible
to
do
this
without
this
aid
*punct* ,
we
can
understand
the
extraordinary
difficulty
which
naturalists
have
experienced
in
describing
*punct* ,
without
the
aid
of
a
diagram
*punct* ,
the
various
affinities
which
they
perceive
between
the
many
living
and
extinct
members
of
the
same
great
natural
class
*punct* .
*break*
extinction
*punct* ,
as
we
have
seen
in
the
fourth
chapter
*punct* ,
has
played
an
important
part
in
defining
and
widening
the
intervals
between
the
several
groups
in
each
class
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
thus
account
even
for
the
distinctness
of
whole
classes
from
each
other
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
of
birds
from
all
other
vertebrate
animals
*punct* ,
by
the
belief
that
many
ancient
forms
of
life
have
been
utterly
lost
*punct* ,
through
which
the
early
progenitors
of
birds
were
formerly
connected
with
the
early
progenitors
of
the
other
vertebrate
classes
*punct* .
*break*
there
has
been
less
entire
extinction
of
the
forms
of
life
which
once
connected
fishes
with
batrachians
*punct* .
*break*
there
has
been
still
less
in
some
other
classes
*punct* ,
as
in
that
of
the
crustacea
*punct* ,
for
here
the
most
wonderfully
diverse
forms
are
still
tied
together
by
a
long
*punct* ,
but
broken
*punct* ,
chain
of
affinities
*punct* .
*break*
extinction
has
only
separated
groups
*punct* :
it
has
by
no
means
made
them
*punct* ;
for
if
every
form
which
has
ever
lived
on
this
earth
were
suddenly
to
reappear
*punct* ,
though
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
give
definitions
by
which
each
group
could
be
distinguished
from
other
groups
*punct* ,
as
all
would
blend
together
by
steps
as
fine
as
those
between
the
finest
existing
varieties
*punct* ,
nevertheless
a
natural
classification
*punct* ,
or
at
least
a
natural
arrangement
*punct* ,
would
be
possible
*punct* .
*break*
every
intermediate
link
between
these
eleven
genera
and
their
primordial
parent
*punct* ,
and
every
intermediate
link
in
each
branch
and
sub-branch
of
their
descendants
*punct* ,
may
be
supposed
to
be
still
alive
*punct* ;
and
the
links
to
be
as
fine
as
those
between
the
finest
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
case
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
give
any
definition
by
which
the
several
members
of
the
several
groups
could
be
distinguished
from
their
more
immediate
parents
*punct* ;
or
these
parents
from
their
ancient
and
unknown
progenitor
*punct* .
*break*
yet
the
natural
arrangement
in
the
diagram
would
still
hold
good
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
on
the
principle
of
inheritance
*punct* ,
all
the
forms
descended
from
a
*punct* ,
or
from
i
*punct* ,
would
have
something
in
common
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
tree
we
can
specify
this
or
that
branch
*punct* ,
though
at
the
actual
fork
the
two
unite
and
blend
together
*punct* .
*break*
we
could
not
*punct* ,
as
i
have
said
*punct* ,
define
the
several
groups
*punct* ;
but
we
could
pick
out
types
*punct* ,
or
forms
*punct* ,
representing
most
of
the
characters
of
each
group
*punct* ,
whether
large
or
small
*punct* ,
and
thus
give
a
general
idea
of
the
value
of
the
differences
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
what
we
should
be
driven
to
*punct* ,
if
we
were
ever
to
succeed
in
collecting
all
the
forms
in
any
class
which
have
lived
throughout
all
time
and
space
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
certainly
never
succeed
in
making
so
perfect
a
collection
*punct* :
nevertheless
*punct* ,
in
certain
classes
*punct* ,
we
are
tending
in
this
direction
*punct* ;
and
milne
edwards
has
lately
insisted
*punct* ,
in
an
able
paper
*punct* ,
on
the
high
importance
of
looking
to
types
*punct* ,
whether
or
not
we
can
separate
and
define
the
groups
to
which
such
types
belong
*punct* .
*break*
finally
*punct* ,
we
have
seen
that
natural
selection
*punct* ,
which
results
from
the
struggle
for
existence
*punct* ,
and
which
almost
inevitably
induces
extinction
and
divergence
of
character
in
the
many
descendants
from
one
dominant
parent-species
*punct* ,
explains
that
great
and
universal
feature
in
the
affinities
of
all
organic
beings
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
their
subordination
in
group
under
group
*punct* .
*break*
we
use
the
element
of
descent
in
classing
the
individuals
of
both
sexes
and
of
all
ages
*punct* ,
although
having
few
characters
in
common
*punct* ,
under
one
species
*punct* ;
we
use
descent
in
classing
acknowledged
varieties
*punct* ,
however
different
they
may
be
from
their
parent
*punct* ;
and
i
believe
this
element
of
descent
is
the
hidden
bond
of
connexion
which
naturalists
have
sought
under
the
term
of
the
natural
system
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
idea
of
the
natural
system
being
*punct* ,
in
so
far
as
it
has
been
perfected

genealogical
in
its
arrangement
*punct* ,
with
the
grades
of
difference
between
the
descendants
from
a
common
parent
*punct* ,
expressed
by
the
terms
genera
*punct* ,
families

&
c.
*punct* ,
we
can
understand
the
rules
which
we
are
compelled
to
follow
in
our
classification
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
understand
why
we
value
certain
resemblances
far
more
than
others
*punct* ;
why
we
are
permitted
to
use
rudimentary
and
useless
organs
*punct* ,
or
others
of
trifling
physiological
importance
*punct* ;
why
*punct* ,
in
comparing
one
group
with
a
distinct
group
*punct* ,
we
summarily
reject
analogical
or
adaptive
characters
*punct* ,
and
yet
use
these
same
characters
within
the
limits
of
the
same
group
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
clearly
see
how
it
is
that
all
living
and
extinct
forms
can
be
grouped
together
in
one
great
system
*punct* ;
and
how
the
several
members
of
each
class
are
connected
together
by
the
most
complex
and
radiating
lines
of
affinities
*punct* .
*break*
we
shall
never
*punct* ,
probably
*punct* ,
disentangle
the
inextricable
web
of
affinities
between
the
members
of
any
one
class
*punct* ;
but
when
we
have
a
distinct
object
in
view
*punct* ,
and
do
not
look
to
some
unknown
plan
of
creation
*punct* ,
we
may
hope
to
make
sure
but
slow
progress
*punct* .
*break*
morphology.
*punct* ,
we
have
seen
that
the
members
of
the
same
class
*punct* ,
independently
of
their
habits
of
life
*punct* ,
resemble
each
other
in
the
general
plan
of
their
organisation
*punct* .
*break*
this
resemblance
is
often
expressed
by
the
term
unity
of
type
*punct* ;
or
by
saying
that
the
several
parts
and
organs
in
the
different
species
of
the
class
are
homologous
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
subject
is
included
under
the
general
name
of
morphology
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
the
most
interesting
department
of
natural
history
*punct* ,
and
may
be
said
to
be
its
very
soul
*punct* .
*break*
what
can
be
more
curious
than
that
the
hand
of
a
man
*punct* ,
formed
for
grasping
*punct* ,
that
of
a
mole
for
digging
*punct* ,
the
leg
of
the
horse
*punct* ,
the
paddle
of
the
porpoise
*punct* ,
and
the
wing
of
the
bat
*punct* ,
should
all
be
constructed
on
the
same
pattern
*punct* ,
and
should
include
the
same
bones
*punct* ,
in
the
same
relative
positions
*punct* ?
*break*
hilaire
has
insisted
strongly
on
the
high
importance
of
relative
connexion
in
homologous
organs
*punct* :
the
parts
may
change
to
almost
any
extent
in
form
and
size
*punct* ,
and
yet
they
always
remain
connected
together
in
the
same
order
*punct* .
*break*
we
never
find
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
bones
of
the
arm
and
forearm
*punct* ,
or
of
the
thigh
and
leg
*punct* ,
transposed
*punct* .
*break*
hence
the
same
names
can
be
given
to
the
homologous
bones
in
widely
different
animals
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
the
same
great
law
in
the
construction
of
the
mouths
of
insects
*punct* :
what
can
be
more
different
than
the
immensely
long
spiral
proboscis
of
a
sphinx-moth
*punct* ,
the
curious
folded
one
of
a
bee
or
bug
*punct* ,
and
the
great
jaws
of
a
beetle?
*punct* ,
yet
all
these
organs
*punct* ,
serving
for
such
different
purposes
*punct* ,
are
formed
by
infinitely
numerous
modifications
of
an
upper
lip
*punct* ,
mandibles
*punct* ,
and
two
pairs
of
maxillae
*punct* .
*break*
analogous
laws
govern
the
construction
of
the
mouths
and
limbs
of
crustaceans
*punct* .
*break*
so
it
is
with
the
flowers
of
plants
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
can
be
more
hopeless
than
to
attempt
to
explain
this
similarity
of
pattern
in
members
of
the
same
class
*punct* ,
by
utility
or
by
the
doctrine
of
final
causes
*punct* .
*break*
the
hopelessness
of
the
attempt
has
been
expressly
admitted
by
owen
in
his
most
interesting
work
on
the
nature
of
limbs
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
ordinary
view
of
the
independent
creation
of
each
being
*punct* ,
we
can
only
say
that
so
it
is;
*punct* ,
that
it
has
so
pleased
the
creator
to
construct
each
animal
and
plant
*punct* .
*break*
the
explanation
is
manifest
on
the
theory
of
the
natural
selection
of
successive
slight
modifications,
*punct* ,
each
modification
being
profitable
in
some
way
to
the
modified
form
*punct* ,
but
often
affecting
by
correlation
of
growth
other
parts
of
the
organisation
*punct* .
*break*
in
changes
of
this
nature
*punct* ,
there
will
be
little
or
no
tendency
to
modify
the
original
pattern
*punct* ,
or
to
transpose
parts
*punct* .
*break*
the
bones
of
a
limb
might
be
shortened
and
widened
to
any
extent
*punct* ,
and
become
gradually
enveloped
in
thick
membrane
*punct* ,
so
as
to
serve
as
a
fin
*punct* ;
or
a
webbed
foot
might
have
all
its
bones
*punct* ,
or
certain
bones
*punct* ,
lengthened
to
any
extent
*punct* ,
and
the
membrane
connecting
them
increased
to
any
extent
*punct* ,
so
as
to
serve
as
a
wing
*punct* :
yet
in
all
this
great
amount
of
modification
there
will
be
no
tendency
to
alter
the
framework
of
bones
or
the
relative
connexion
of
the
several
parts
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
suppose
that
the
ancient
progenitor
*punct* ,
the
archetype
as
it
may
be
called
*punct* ,
of
all
mammals
*punct* ,
had
its
limbs
constructed
on
the
existing
general
pattern
*punct* ,
for
whatever
purpose
they
served
*punct* ,
we
can
at
once
perceive
the
plain
signification
of
the
homologous
construction
of
the
limbs
throughout
the
whole
class
*punct* .
*break*
so
with
the
mouths
of
insects
*punct* ,
we
have
only
to
suppose
that
their
common
progenitor
had
an
upper
lip
*punct* ,
mandibles
*punct* ,
and
two
pair
of
maxillae
*punct* ,
these
parts
being
perhaps
very
simple
in
form
*punct* ;
and
then
natural
selection
will
account
for
the
infinite
diversity
in
structure
and
function
of
the
mouths
of
insects
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
it
is
conceivable
that
the
general
pattern
of
an
organ
might
become
so
much
obscured
as
to
be
finally
lost
*punct* ,
by
the
atrophy
and
ultimately
by
the
complete
abortion
of
certain
parts
*punct* ,
by
the
soldering
together
of
other
parts
*punct* ,
and
by
the
doubling
or
multiplication
of
others,
*punct* ,
variations
which
we
know
to
be
within
the
limits
of
possibility
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
paddles
of
the
extinct
gigantic
sea-lizards
*punct* ,
and
in
the
mouths
of
certain
suctorial
crustaceans
*punct* ,
the
general
pattern
seems
to
have
been
thus
to
a
certain
extent
obscured
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
another
and
equally
curious
branch
of
the
present
subject
*punct* ;
namely
*punct* ,
the
comparison
not
of
the
same
part
in
different
members
of
a
class
*punct* ,
but
of
the
different
parts
or
organs
in
the
same
individual
*punct* .
*break*
most
physiologists
believe
that
the
bones
of
the
skull
are
homologous
with
*punct* ,
that
is
correspond
in
number
and
in
relative
connexion
with
*punct* ,
the
elemental
parts
of
a
certain
number
of
vertebrae
*punct* .
*break*
the
anterior
and
posterior
limbs
in
each
member
of
the
vertebrate
and
articulate
classes
are
plainly
homologous
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
the
same
law
in
comparing
the
wonderfully
complex
jaws
and
legs
in
crustaceans
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
familiar
to
almost
every
one
*punct* ,
that
in
a
flower
the
relative
position
of
the
sepals
*punct* ,
petals
*punct* ,
stamens
*punct* ,
and
pistils
*punct* ,
as
well
as
their
intimate
structure
*punct* ,
are
intelligible
on
the
view
that
they
consist
of
metamorphosed
leaves
*punct* ,
arranged
in
a
spire
*punct* .
*break*
in
monstrous
plants
*punct* ,
we
often
get
direct
evidence
of
the
possibility
of
one
organ
being
transformed
into
another
*punct* ;
and
we
can
actually
see
in
embryonic
crustaceans
and
in
many
other
animals
*punct* ,
and
in
flowers
*punct* ,
that
organs
*punct* ,
which
when
mature
become
extremely
different
*punct* ,
are
at
an
early
stage
of
growth
exactly
alike
*punct* .
*break*
how
inexplicable
are
these
facts
on
the
ordinary
view
of
creation
*punct* !
*break*
why
should
the
brain
be
enclosed
in
a
box
composed
of
such
numerous
and
such
extraordinarily
shaped
pieces
of
bone
*punct* ?
*break*
as
owen
has
remarked
*punct* ,
the
benefit
derived
from
the
yielding
of
the
separate
pieces
in
the
act
of
parturition
of
mammals
*punct* ,
will
by
no
means
explain
the
same
construction
in
the
skulls
of
birds
*punct* .
*break*
why
should
similar
bones
have
been
created
in
the
formation
of
the
wing
and
leg
of
a
bat
*punct* ,
used
as
they
are
for
such
totally
different
purposes
*punct* ?
*break*
why
should
one
crustacean
*punct* ,
which
has
an
extremely
complex
mouth
formed
of
many
parts
*punct* ,
consequently
always
have
fewer
legs
*punct* ;
or
conversely
*punct* ,
those
with
many
legs
have
simpler
mouths
*punct* ?
*break*
why
should
the
sepals
*punct* ,
petals
*punct* ,
stamens
*punct* ,
and
pistils
in
any
individual
flower
*punct* ,
though
fitted
for
such
widely
different
purposes
*punct* ,
be
all
constructed
on
the
same
pattern
*punct* ?
*break*
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
we
can
satisfactorily
answer
these
questions
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
vertebrata
*punct* ,
we
see
a
series
of
internal
vertebrae
bearing
certain
processes
and
appendages
*punct* ;
in
the
articulata
*punct* ,
we
see
the
body
divided
into
a
series
of
segments
*punct* ,
bearing
external
appendages
*punct* ;
and
in
flowering
plants
*punct* ,
we
see
a
series
of
successive
spiral
whorls
of
leaves
*punct* .
*break*
an
indefinite
repetition
of
the
same
part
or
organ
is
the
common
characteristic
*punct* ,
as
owen
has
observed
*punct* ,
of
all
low
or
little-modified
forms
*punct* ;
therefore
we
may
readily
believe
that
the
unknown
progenitor
of
the
vertebrata
possessed
many
vertebrae
*punct* ;
the
unknown
progenitor
of
the
articulata
*punct* ,
many
segments
*punct* ;
and
the
unknown
progenitor
of
flowering
plants
*punct* ,
many
spiral
whorls
of
leaves
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
formerly
seen
that
parts
many
times
repeated
are
eminently
liable
to
vary
in
number
and
structure
*punct* ;
consequently
it
is
quite
probable
that
natural
selection
*punct* ,
during
a
long-continued
course
of
modification
*punct* ,
should
have
seized
on
a
certain
number
of
the
primordially
similar
elements
*punct* ,
many
times
repeated
*punct* ,
and
have
adapted
them
to
the
most
diverse
purposes
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
the
whole
amount
of
modification
will
have
been
effected
by
slight
successive
steps
*punct* ,
we
need
not
wonder
at
discovering
in
such
parts
or
organs
*punct* ,
a
certain
degree
of
fundamental
resemblance
*punct* ,
retained
by
the
strong
principle
of
inheritance
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
great
class
of
molluscs
*punct* ,
though
we
can
homologise
the
parts
of
one
species
with
those
of
another
and
distinct
species
*punct* ,
we
can
indicate
but
few
serial
homologies
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
we
are
seldom
enabled
to
say
that
one
part
or
organ
is
homologous
with
another
in
the
same
individual
*punct* .
*break*
and
we
can
understand
this
fact
*punct* ;
for
in
molluscs
*punct* ,
even
in
the
lowest
members
of
the
class
*punct* ,
we
do
not
find
nearly
so
much
indefinite
repetition
of
any
one
part
*punct* ,
as
we
find
in
the
other
great
classes
of
the
animal
and
vegetable
kingdoms
*punct* .
*break*
naturalists
frequently
speak
of
the
skull
as
formed
of
metamorphosed
vertebrae
*punct* :
the
jaws
of
crabs
as
metamorphosed
legs
*punct* ;
the
stamens
and
pistils
of
flowers
as
metamorphosed
leaves
*punct* ;
but
it
would
in
these
cases
probably
be
more
correct
*punct* ,
as
professor
huxley
has
remarked
*punct* ,
to
speak
of
both
skull
and
vertebrae
*punct* ,
both
jaws
and
legs
*punct* ,
&
c.,
*punct* ,
as
having
been
metamorphosed
*punct* ,
not
one
from
the
other
*punct* ,
but
from
some
common
element
*punct* .
*break*
naturalists
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
use
such
language
only
in
a
metaphorical
sense
*punct* :
they
are
far
from
meaning
that
during
a
long
course
of
descent
*punct* ,
primordial
organs
of
any
kind
*punct* ,
vertebrae
in
the
one
case
and
legs
in
the
other
*punct* ,
have
actually
been
modified
into
skulls
or
jaws
*punct* .
*break*
yet
so
strong
is
the
appearance
of
a
modification
of
this
nature
having
occurred
*punct* ,
that
naturalists
can
hardly
avoid
employing
language
having
this
plain
signification
*punct* .
*break*
on
my
view
these
terms
may
be
used
literally
*punct* ;
and
the
wonderful
fact
of
the
jaws
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
of
a
crab
retaining
numerous
characters
*punct* ,
which
they
would
probably
have
retained
through
inheritance
*punct* ,
if
they
had
really
been
metamorphosed
during
a
long
course
of
descent
from
true
legs
*punct* ,
or
from
some
simple
appendage
*punct* ,
is
explained
*punct* .
*break*
embryology.
*punct* ,
it
has
already
been
casually
remarked
that
certain
organs
in
the
individual
*punct* ,
which
when
mature
become
widely
different
and
serve
for
different
purposes
*punct* ,
are
in
the
embryo
exactly
alike
*punct* .
*break*
the
embryos
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
of
distinct
animals
within
the
same
class
are
often
strikingly
similar
*punct* :
a
better
proof
of
this
cannot
be
given
*punct* ,
than
a
circumstance
mentioned
by
agassiz
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
that
having
forgotten
to
ticket
the
embryo
of
some
vertebrate
animal
*punct* ,
he
cannot
now
tell
whether
it
be
that
of
a
mammal
*punct* ,
bird
*punct* ,
or
reptile
*punct* .
*break*
the
vermiform
larvae
of
moths
*punct* ,
flies
*punct* ,
beetles
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
resemble
each
other
much
more
closely
than
do
the
mature
insects
*punct* ;
but
in
the
case
of
larvae
*punct* ,
the
embryos
are
active
*punct* ,
and
have
been
adapted
for
special
lines
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
cat
tribe
*punct* ,
most
of
the
species
are
striped
or
spotted
in
lines
*punct* ;
and
stripes
can
be
plainly
distinguished
in
the
whelp
of
the
lion
*punct* .
*break*
we
occasionally
though
rarely
see
something
of
this
kind
in
plants
*punct* :
thus
the
embryonic
leaves
of
the
ulex
or
furze
*punct* ,
and
the
first
leaves
of
the
phyllodineous
acaceas
*punct* ,
are
pinnate
or
divided
like
the
ordinary
leaves
of
the
leguminosae
*punct* .
*break*
the
points
of
structure
*punct* ,
in
which
the
embryos
of
widely
different
animals
of
the
same
class
resemble
each
other
*punct* ,
often
have
no
direct
relation
to
their
conditions
of
existence
*punct* .
*break*
we
cannot
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
suppose
that
in
the
embryos
of
the
vertebrata
the
peculiar
loop-like
course
of
the
arteries
near
the
branchial
slits
are
related
to
similar
conditions,
*punct* ,
in
the
young
mammal
which
is
nourished
in
the
womb
of
its
mother
*punct* ,
in
the
egg
of
the
bird
which
is
hatched
in
a
nest
*punct* ,
and
in
the
spawn
of
a
frog
under
water
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
no
more
reason
to
believe
in
such
a
relation
*punct* ,
than
we
have
to
believe
that
the
same
bones
in
the
hand
of
a
man
*punct* ,
wing
of
a
bat
*punct* ,
and
fin
of
a
porpoise
*punct* ,
are
related
to
similar
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
will
suppose
that
the
stripes
on
the
whelp
of
a
lion
*punct* ,
or
the
spots
on
the
young
blackbird
*punct* ,
are
of
any
use
to
these
animals
*punct* ,
or
are
related
to
the
conditions
to
which
they
are
exposed
*punct* .
*break*
the
case
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
is
different
when
an
animal
during
any
part
of
its
embryonic
career
is
active
*punct* ,
and
has
to
provide
for
itself
*punct* .
*break*
the
period
of
activity
may
come
on
earlier
or
later
in
life
*punct* ;
but
whenever
it
comes
on
*punct* ,
the
adaptation
of
the
larva
to
its
conditions
of
life
is
just
as
perfect
and
as
beautiful
as
in
the
adult
animal
*punct* .
*break*
from
such
special
adaptations
*punct* ,
the
similarity
of
the
larvae
or
active
embryos
of
allied
animals
is
sometimes
much
obscured
*punct* ;
and
cases
could
be
given
of
the
larvae
of
two
species
*punct* ,
or
of
two
groups
of
species
*punct* ,
differing
quite
as
much
*punct* ,
or
even
more
*punct* ,
from
each
other
than
do
their
adult
parents
*punct* .
*break*
in
most
cases
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
the
larvae
*punct* ,
though
active
*punct* ,
still
obey
more
or
less
closely
the
law
of
common
embryonic
resemblance
*punct* .
*break*
cirripedes
afford
a
good
instance
of
this
*punct* :
even
the
illustrious
cuvier
did
not
perceive
that
a
barnacle
was
*punct* ,
as
it
certainly
is
*punct* ,
a
crustacean
*punct* ;
but
a
glance
at
the
larva
shows
this
to
be
the
case
in
an
unmistakeable
manner
*punct* .
*break*
so
again
the
two
main
divisions
of
cirripedes
*punct* ,
the
pedunculated
and
sessile
*punct* ,
which
differ
widely
in
external
appearance
*punct* ,
have
larvae
in
all
their
several
stages
barely
distinguishable
*punct* .
*break*
the
embryo
in
the
course
of
development
generally
rises
in
organisation
*punct* :
i
use
this
expression
*punct* ,
though
i
am
aware
that
it
is
hardly
possible
to
define
clearly
what
is
meant
by
the
organisation
being
higher
or
lower
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
one
probably
will
dispute
that
the
butterfly
is
higher
than
the
caterpillar
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
cases
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
the
mature
animal
is
generally
considered
as
lower
in
the
scale
than
the
larva
*punct* ,
as
with
certain
parasitic
crustaceans
*punct* .
*break*
to
refer
once
again
to
cirripedes
*punct* :
the
larvae
in
the
first
stage
have
three
pairs
of
legs
*punct* ,
a
very
simple
single
eye
*punct* ,
and
a
probosciformed
mouth
*punct* ,
with
which
they
feed
largely
*punct* ,
for
they
increase
much
in
size
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
second
stage
*punct* ,
answering
to
the
chrysalis
stage
of
butterflies
*punct* ,
they
have
six
pairs
of
beautifully
constructed
natatory
legs
*punct* ,
a
pair
of
magnificent
compound
eyes
*punct* ,
and
extremely
complex
antennae
*punct* ;
but
they
have
a
closed
and
imperfect
mouth
*punct* ,
and
cannot
feed
*punct* :
their
function
at
this
stage
is
*punct* ,
to
search
by
their
well-developed
organs
of
sense
*punct* ,
and
to
reach
by
their
active
powers
of
swimming
*punct* ,
a
proper
place
on
which
to
become
attached
and
to
undergo
their
final
metamorphosis
*punct* .
*break*
when
this
is
completed
they
are
fixed
for
life
*punct* :
their
legs
are
now
converted
into
prehensile
organs
*punct* ;
they
again
obtain
a
well-constructed
mouth
*punct* ;
but
they
have
no
antennae
*punct* ,
and
their
two
eyes
are
now
reconverted
into
a
minute
*punct* ,
single
*punct* ,
and
very
simple
eye-spot
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
last
and
complete
state
*punct* ,
cirripedes
may
be
considered
as
either
more
highly
or
more
lowly
organised
than
they
were
in
the
larval
condition
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
some
genera
the
larvae
become
developed
either
into
hermaphrodites
having
the
ordinary
structure
*punct* ,
or
into
what
i
have
called
complemental
males
*punct* :
and
in
the
latter
*punct* ,
the
development
has
assuredly
been
retrograde
*punct* ;
for
the
male
is
a
mere
sack
*punct* ,
which
lives
for
a
short
time
*punct* ,
and
is
destitute
of
mouth
*punct* ,
stomach
*punct* ,
or
other
organ
of
importance
*punct* ,
excepting
for
reproduction
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
so
much
accustomed
to
see
differences
in
structure
between
the
embryo
and
the
adult
*punct* ,
and
likewise
a
close
similarity
in
the
embryos
of
widely
different
animals
within
the
same
class
*punct* ,
that
we
might
be
led
to
look
at
these
facts
as
necessarily
contingent
in
some
manner
on
growth
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
is
no
obvious
reason
why
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
wing
of
a
bat
*punct* ,
or
the
fin
of
a
porpoise
*punct* ,
should
not
have
been
sketched
out
with
all
the
parts
in
proper
proportion
*punct* ,
as
soon
as
any
structure
became
visible
in
the
embryo
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
some
whole
groups
of
animals
and
in
certain
members
of
other
groups
*punct* ,
the
embryo
does
not
at
any
period
differ
widely
from
the
adult
*punct* :
thus
owen
has
remarked
in
regard
to
cuttle-fish
*punct* ,
there
is
no
metamorphosis
*punct* ;
the
cephalopodic
character
is
manifested
long
before
the
parts
of
the
embryo
are
completed
*punct* ;
and
again
in
spiders
*punct* ,
there
is
nothing
worthy
to
be
called
a
metamorphosis
*punct* .
*break*
the
larvae
of
insects
*punct* ,
whether
adapted
to
the
most
diverse
and
active
habits
*punct* ,
or
quite
inactive
*punct* ,
being
fed
by
their
parents
or
placed
in
the
midst
of
proper
nutriment
*punct* ,
yet
nearly
all
pass
through
a
similar
worm-like
stage
of
development
*punct* ;
but
in
some
few
cases
*punct* ,
as
in
that
of
aphis
*punct* ,
if
we
look
to
the
admirable
drawings
by
professor
huxley
of
the
development
of
this
insect
*punct* ,
we
see
no
trace
of
the
vermiform
stage
*punct* .
*break*
how
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
can
we
explain
these
several
facts
in
embryology,
*punct* ,
namely
the
very
general
*punct* ,
but
not
universal
difference
in
structure
between
the
embryo
and
the
adult;
*punct* ,
of
parts
in
the
same
individual
embryo
*punct* ,
which
ultimately
become
very
unlike
and
serve
for
diverse
purposes
*punct* ,
being
at
this
early
period
of
growth
alike;
*punct* ,
of
embryos
of
different
species
within
the
same
class
*punct* ,
generally
*punct* ,
but
not
universally
*punct* ,
resembling
each
other;
*punct* ,
of
the
structure
of
the
embryo
not
being
closely
related
to
its
conditions
of
existence
*punct* ,
except
when
the
embryo
becomes
at
any
period
of
life
active
and
has
to
provide
for
itself;
*punct* ,
of
the
embryo
apparently
having
sometimes
a
higher
organisation
than
the
mature
animal
*punct* ,
into
which
it
is
developed
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
that
all
these
facts
can
be
explained
*punct* ,
as
follows
*punct* ,
on
the
view
of
descent
with
modification
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
commonly
assumed
*punct* ,
perhaps
from
monstrosities
often
affecting
the
embryo
at
a
very
early
period
*punct* ,
that
slight
variations
necessarily
appear
at
an
equally
early
period
*punct* .
*break*
but
we
have
little
evidence
on
this
head
*punct* ,
indeed
the
evidence
rather
points
the
other
way
*punct* ;
for
it
is
notorious
that
breeders
of
cattle
*punct* ,
horses
*punct* ,
and
various
fancy
animals
*punct* ,
cannot
positively
tell
*punct* ,
until
some
time
after
the
animal
has
been
born
*punct* ,
what
its
merits
or
form
will
ultimately
turn
out
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
this
plainly
in
our
own
children
*punct* ;
we
cannot
always
tell
whether
the
child
will
be
tall
or
short
*punct* ,
or
what
its
precise
features
will
be
*punct* .
*break*
the
question
is
not
*punct* ,
at
what
period
of
life
any
variation
has
been
caused
*punct* ,
but
at
what
period
it
is
fully
displayed
*punct* .
*break*
the
cause
may
have
acted
*punct* ,
and
i
believe
generally
has
acted
*punct* ,
even
before
the
embryo
is
formed
*punct* ;
and
the
variation
may
be
due
to
the
male
and
female
sexual
elements
having
been
affected
by
the
conditions
to
which
either
parent
*punct* ,
or
their
ancestors
*punct* ,
have
been
exposed
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
an
effect
thus
caused
at
a
very
early
period
*punct* ,
even
before
the
formation
of
the
embryo
*punct* ,
may
appear
late
in
life
*punct* ;
as
when
an
hereditary
disease
*punct* ,
which
appears
in
old
age
alone
*punct* ,
has
been
communicated
to
the
offspring
from
the
reproductive
element
of
one
parent
*punct* .
*break*
or
again
*punct* ,
as
when
the
horns
of
cross-bred
cattle
have
been
affected
by
the
shape
of
the
horns
of
either
parent
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
welfare
of
a
very
young
animal
*punct* ,
as
long
as
it
remains
in
its
mother's
womb
*punct* ,
or
in
the
egg
*punct* ,
or
as
long
as
it
is
nourished
and
protected
by
its
parent
*punct* ,
it
must
be
quite
unimportant
whether
most
of
its
characters
are
fully
acquired
a
little
earlier
or
later
in
life
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
not
signify
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
to
a
bird
which
obtained
its
food
best
by
having
a
long
beak
*punct* ,
whether
or
not
it
assumed
a
beak
of
this
particular
length
*punct* ,
as
long
as
it
was
fed
by
its
parents
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
i
conclude
*punct* ,
that
it
is
quite
possible
*punct* ,
that
each
of
the
many
successive
modifications
*punct* ,
by
which
each
species
has
acquired
its
present
structure
*punct* ,
may
have
supervened
at
a
not
very
early
period
of
life
*punct* ;
and
some
direct
evidence
from
our
domestic
animals
supports
this
view
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
other
cases
it
is
quite
possible
that
each
successive
modification
*punct* ,
or
most
of
them
*punct* ,
may
have
appeared
at
an
extremely
early
period
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
stated
in
the
first
chapter
*punct* ,
that
there
is
some
evidence
to
render
it
probable
*punct* ,
that
at
whatever
age
any
variation
first
appears
in
the
parent
*punct* ,
it
tends
to
reappear
at
a
corresponding
age
in
the
offspring
*punct* .
*break*
certain
variations
can
only
appear
at
corresponding
ages
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
peculiarities
in
the
caterpillar
*punct* ,
cocoon
*punct* ,
or
imago
states
of
the
silk-moth
*punct* ;
or
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
in
the
horns
of
almost
full-grown
cattle
*punct* .
*break*
but
further
than
this
*punct* ,
variations
which
*punct* ,
for
all
that
we
can
see
*punct* ,
might
have
appeared
earlier
or
later
in
life
*punct* ,
tend
to
appear
at
a
corresponding
age
in
the
offspring
and
parent
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
far
from
meaning
that
this
is
invariably
the
case
*punct* ;
and
i
could
give
a
good
many
cases
of
variations
*punct* ,
taking
the
word
in
the
largest
sense
*punct* ,
which
have
supervened
at
an
earlier
age
in
the
child
than
in
the
parent
*punct* .
*break*
these
two
principles
*punct* ,
if
their
truth
be
admitted
*punct* ,
will
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
explain
all
the
above
specified
leading
facts
in
embryology
*punct* .
*break*
but
first
let
us
look
at
a
few
analogous
cases
in
domestic
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
some
authors
who
have
written
on
dogs
*punct* ,
maintain
that
the
greyhound
and
bulldog
*punct* ,
though
appearing
so
different
*punct* ,
are
really
varieties
most
closely
allied
*punct* ,
and
have
probably
descended
from
the
same
wild
stock
*punct* ;
hence
i
was
curious
to
see
how
far
their
puppies
differed
from
each
other
*punct* :
i
was
told
by
breeders
that
they
differed
just
as
much
as
their
parents
*punct* ,
and
this
*punct* ,
judging
by
the
eye
*punct* ,
seemed
almost
to
be
the
case
*punct* ;
but
on
actually
measuring
the
old
dogs
and
their
six-days
old
puppies
*punct* ,
i
found
that
the
puppies
had
not
nearly
acquired
their
full
amount
of
proportional
difference
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
i
was
told
that
the
foals
of
cart
and
race-horses
differed
as
much
as
the
full-grown
animals
*punct* ;
and
this
surprised
me
greatly
*punct* ,
as
i
think
it
probable
that
the
difference
between
these
two
breeds
has
been
wholly
caused
by
selection
under
domestication
*punct* ;
but
having
had
careful
measurements
made
of
the
dam
and
of
a
three-days
old
colt
of
a
race
and
heavy
cart-horse
*punct* ,
i
find
that
the
colts
have
by
no
means
acquired
their
full
amount
of
proportional
difference
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
evidence
appears
to
me
conclusive
*punct* ,
that
the
several
domestic
breeds
of
pigeon
have
descended
from
one
wild
species
*punct* ,
i
compared
young
pigeons
of
various
breeds
*punct* ,
within
twelve
hours
after
being
hatched
*punct* ;
i
carefully
measured
the
proportions
*punct* ,
but
will
not
here
give
details
*punct* ,
of
the
beak
*punct* ,
width
of
mouth
*punct* ,
length
of
nostril
and
of
eyelid
*punct* ,
size
of
feet
and
length
of
leg
*punct* ,
in
the
wild
stock
*punct* ,
in
pouters
*punct* ,
fantails
*punct* ,
runts
*punct* ,
barbs
*punct* ,
dragons
*punct* ,
carriers
*punct* ,
and
tumblers
*punct* .
*break*
now
some
of
these
birds
*punct* ,
when
mature
*punct* ,
differ
so
extraordinarily
in
length
and
form
of
beak
*punct* ,
that
they
would
*punct* ,
i
cannot
doubt
*punct* ,
be
ranked
in
distinct
genera
*punct* ,
had
they
been
natural
productions
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
the
nestling
birds
of
these
several
breeds
were
placed
in
a
row
*punct* ,
though
most
of
them
could
be
distinguished
from
each
other
*punct* ,
yet
their
proportional
differences
in
the
above
specified
several
points
were
incomparably
less
than
in
the
full-grown
birds
*punct* .
*break*
some
characteristic
points
of
difference
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
that
of
the
width
of
mouth
*punct* ,
could
hardly
be
detected
in
the
young
*punct* .
*break*
but
there
was
one
remarkable
exception
to
this
rule
*punct* ,
for
the
young
of
the
short-faced
tumbler
differed
from
the
young
of
the
wild
rock-pigeon
and
of
the
other
breeds
*punct* ,
in
all
its
proportions
*punct* ,
almost
exactly
as
much
as
in
the
adult
state
*punct* .
*break*
the
two
principles
above
given
seem
to
me
to
explain
these
facts
in
regard
to
the
later
embryonic
stages
of
our
domestic
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
fanciers
select
their
horses
*punct* ,
dogs
*punct* ,
and
pigeons
*punct* ,
for
breeding
*punct* ,
when
they
are
nearly
grown
up
*punct* :
they
are
indifferent
whether
the
desired
qualities
and
structures
have
been
acquired
earlier
or
later
in
life
*punct* ,
if
the
full-grown
animal
possesses
them
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
cases
just
given
*punct* ,
more
especially
that
of
pigeons
*punct* ,
seem
to
show
that
the
characteristic
differences
which
give
value
to
each
breed
*punct* ,
and
which
have
been
accumulated
by
man's
selection
*punct* ,
have
not
generally
first
appeared
at
an
early
period
of
life
*punct* ,
and
have
been
inherited
by
the
offspring
at
a
corresponding
not
early
period
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
case
of
the
short-faced
tumbler
*punct* ,
which
when
twelve
hours
old
had
acquired
its
proper
proportions
*punct* ,
proves
that
this
is
not
the
universal
rule
*punct* ;
for
here
the
characteristic
differences
must
either
have
appeared
at
an
earlier
period
than
usual
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
if
not
so
*punct* ,
the
differences
must
have
been
inherited
*punct* ,
not
at
the
corresponding
*punct* ,
but
at
an
earlier
age
*punct* .
*break*
now
let
us
apply
these
facts
and
the
above
two
principles
*punct* ,
which
latter
*punct* ,
though
not
proved
true
*punct* ,
can
be
shown
to
be
in
some
degree
probable
*punct* ,
to
species
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
let
us
take
a
genus
of
birds
*punct* ,
descended
on
my
theory
from
some
one
parent-species
*punct* ,
and
of
which
the
several
new
species
have
become
modified
through
natural
selection
in
accordance
with
their
diverse
habits
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
from
the
many
slight
successive
steps
of
variation
having
supervened
at
a
rather
late
age
*punct* ,
and
having
been
inherited
at
a
corresponding
age
*punct* ,
the
young
of
the
new
species
of
our
supposed
genus
will
manifestly
tend
to
resemble
each
other
much
more
closely
than
do
the
adults
*punct* ,
just
as
we
have
seen
in
the
case
of
pigeons
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
extend
this
view
to
whole
families
or
even
classes
*punct* .
*break*
the
fore-limbs
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
which
served
as
legs
in
the
parent-species
*punct* ,
may
become
*punct* ,
by
a
long
course
of
modification
*punct* ,
adapted
in
one
descendant
to
act
as
hands
*punct* ,
in
another
as
paddles
*punct* ,
in
another
as
wings
*punct* ;
and
on
the
above
two
principles
*punct* ,
namely
of
each
successive
modification
supervening
at
a
rather
late
age
*punct* ,
and
being
inherited
at
a
corresponding
late
age
*punct* ,
the
fore-limbs
in
the
embryos
of
the
several
descendants
of
the
parent-species
will
still
resemble
each
other
closely
*punct* ,
for
they
will
not
have
been
modified
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
each
individual
new
species
*punct* ,
the
embryonic
fore-limbs
will
differ
greatly
from
the
fore-limbs
in
the
mature
animal
*punct* ;
the
limbs
in
the
latter
having
undergone
much
modification
at
a
rather
late
period
of
life
*punct* ,
and
having
thus
been
converted
into
hands
*punct* ,
or
paddles
*punct* ,
or
wings
*punct* .
*break*
whatever
influence
long-continued
exercise
or
use
on
the
one
hand
*punct* ,
and
disuse
on
the
other
*punct* ,
may
have
in
modifying
an
organ
*punct* ,
such
influence
will
mainly
affect
the
mature
animal
*punct* ,
which
has
come
to
its
full
powers
of
activity
and
has
to
gain
its
own
living
*punct* ;
and
the
effects
thus
produced
will
be
inherited
at
a
corresponding
mature
age
*punct* .
*break*
whereas
the
young
will
remain
unmodified
*punct* ,
or
be
modified
in
a
lesser
degree
*punct* ,
by
the
effects
of
use
and
disuse
*punct* .
*break*
in
certain
cases
the
successive
steps
of
variation
might
supervene
*punct* ,
from
causes
of
which
we
are
wholly
ignorant
*punct* ,
at
a
very
early
period
of
life
*punct* ,
or
each
step
might
be
inherited
at
an
earlier
period
than
that
at
which
it
first
appeared
*punct* .
*break*
in
either
case
*punct* ,
as
with
the
short-faced
tumbler
*punct* ,
the
young
or
embryo
would
closely
resemble
the
mature
parent-form
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
seen
that
this
is
the
rule
of
development
in
certain
whole
groups
of
animals
*punct* ,
as
with
cuttle-fish
and
spiders
*punct* ,
and
with
a
few
members
of
the
great
class
of
insects
*punct* ,
as
with
aphis
*punct* .
*break*
with
respect
to
the
final
cause
of
the
young
in
these
cases
not
undergoing
any
metamorphosis
*punct* ,
or
closely
resembling
their
parents
from
their
earliest
age
*punct* ,
we
can
see
that
this
would
result
from
the
two
following
contingencies
*punct* ;
firstly
*punct* ,
from
the
young
*punct* ,
during
a
course
of
modification
carried
on
for
many
generations
*punct* ,
having
to
provide
for
their
own
wants
at
a
very
early
stage
of
development
*punct* ,
and
secondly
*punct* ,
from
their
following
exactly
the
same
habits
of
life
with
their
parents
*punct* ;
for
in
this
case
*punct* ,
it
would
be
indispensable
for
the
existence
of
the
species
*punct* ,
that
the
child
should
be
modified
at
a
very
early
age
in
the
same
manner
with
its
parents
*punct* ,
in
accordance
with
their
similar
habits
*punct* .
*break*
some
further
explanation
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
of
the
embryo
not
undergoing
any
metamorphosis
is
perhaps
requisite
*punct* .
*break*
if
*punct* ,
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
it
profited
the
young
to
follow
habits
of
life
in
any
degree
different
from
those
of
their
parent
*punct* ,
and
consequently
to
be
constructed
in
a
slightly
different
manner
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
on
the
principle
of
inheritance
at
corresponding
ages
*punct* ,
the
active
young
or
larvae
might
easily
be
rendered
by
natural
selection
different
to
any
conceivable
extent
from
their
parents
*punct* .
*break*
such
differences
might
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
become
correlated
with
successive
stages
of
development
*punct* ;
so
that
the
larvae
*punct* ,
in
the
first
stage
*punct* ,
might
differ
greatly
from
the
larvae
in
the
second
stage
*punct* ,
as
we
have
seen
to
be
the
case
with
cirripedes
*punct* .
*break*
the
adult
might
become
fitted
for
sites
or
habits
*punct* ,
in
which
organs
of
locomotion
or
of
the
senses
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
would
be
useless
*punct* ;
and
in
this
case
the
final
metamorphosis
would
be
said
to
be
retrograde
*punct* .
*break*
as
all
the
organic
beings
*punct* ,
extinct
and
recent
*punct* ,
which
have
ever
lived
on
this
earth
have
to
be
classed
together
*punct* ,
and
as
all
have
been
connected
by
the
finest
gradations
*punct* ,
the
best
*punct* ,
or
indeed
*punct* ,
if
our
collections
were
nearly
perfect
*punct* ,
the
only
possible
arrangement
*punct* ,
would
be
genealogical
*punct* .
*break*
descent
being
on
my
view
the
hidden
bond
of
connexion
which
naturalists
have
been
seeking
under
the
term
of
the
natural
system
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
view
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
*punct* ,
in
the
eyes
of
most
naturalists
*punct* ,
the
structure
of
the
embryo
is
even
more
important
for
classification
than
that
of
the
adult
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
embryo
is
the
animal
in
its
less
modified
state
*punct* ;
and
in
so
far
it
reveals
the
structure
of
its
progenitor
*punct* .
*break*
in
two
groups
of
animal
*punct* ,
however
much
they
may
at
present
differ
from
each
other
in
structure
and
habits
*punct* ,
if
they
pass
through
the
same
or
similar
embryonic
stages
*punct* ,
we
may
feel
assured
that
they
have
both
descended
from
the
same
or
nearly
similar
parents
*punct* ,
and
are
therefore
in
that
degree
closely
related
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
community
in
embryonic
structure
reveals
community
of
descent
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
reveal
this
community
of
descent
*punct* ,
however
much
the
structure
of
the
adult
may
have
been
modified
and
obscured
*punct* ;
we
have
seen
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
that
cirripedes
can
at
once
be
recognised
by
their
larvae
as
belonging
to
the
great
class
of
crustaceans
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
embryonic
state
of
each
species
and
group
of
species
partially
shows
us
the
structure
of
their
less
modified
ancient
progenitors
*punct* ,
we
can
clearly
see
why
ancient
and
extinct
forms
of
life
should
resemble
the
embryos
of
their
descendants,
*punct* ,
our
existing
species
*punct* .
*break*
agassiz
believes
this
to
be
a
law
of
nature
*punct* ;
but
i
am
bound
to
confess
that
i
only
hope
to
see
the
law
hereafter
proved
true
*punct* .
*break*
it
can
be
proved
true
in
those
cases
alone
in
which
the
ancient
state
*punct* ,
now
supposed
to
be
represented
in
many
embryos
*punct* ,
has
not
been
obliterated
*punct* ,
either
by
the
successive
variations
in
a
long
course
of
modification
having
supervened
at
a
very
early
age
*punct* ,
or
by
the
variations
having
been
inherited
at
an
earlier
period
than
that
at
which
they
first
appeared
*punct* .
*break*
it
should
also
be
borne
in
mind
*punct* ,
that
the
supposed
law
of
resemblance
of
ancient
forms
of
life
to
the
embryonic
stages
of
recent
forms
*punct* ,
may
be
true
*punct* ,
but
yet
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
geological
record
not
extending
far
enough
back
in
time
*punct* ,
may
remain
for
a
long
period
*punct* ,
or
for
ever
*punct* ,
incapable
of
demonstration
*punct* .
*break*
thus
*punct* ,
as
it
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
the
leading
facts
in
embryology
*punct* ,
which
are
second
in
importance
to
none
in
natural
history

are
explained
on
the
principle
of
slight
modifications
not
appearing

in
the

descendants
from
some

ancient

embryology
rises
greatly

extremely
common
throughout
nature
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
rudimentary
mammae
are
very
general
in
the
males
of
mammals
*punct* :
i
presume
that
the
bastard-wing
in
birds
may
be
safely
considered
as
a
digit
in
a
rudimentary
state
*punct* :
in
very
many
snakes
one
lobe
of
the
lungs
is
rudimentary
*punct* ;
in
other
snakes
there
are
rudiments
of
the
pelvis
and
hind
limbs
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
the
cases
of
rudimentary
organs
are
extremely
curious
*punct* ;
for
instance
*punct* ,
the
presence
of
teeth
in
foetal
whales
*punct* ,
which
when
grown
up
have
not
a
tooth
in
their
heads
*punct* ;
and
the
presence
of
teeth
*punct* ,
which
never
cut
through
the
gums
*punct* ,
in
the
upper
jaws
of
our
unborn
calves
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
even
been
stated
on
good
authority
that
rudiments
of
teeth
can
be
detected
in
the
beaks
of
certain
embryonic
birds
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
can
be
plainer
than
that
wings
are
formed
for
flight
*punct* ,
yet
in
how
many
insects
do
we
see
wings
so
reduced
in
size
as
to
be
utterly
incapable
of
flight
*punct* ,
and
not
rarely
lying
under
wing-cases
*punct* ,
firmly
soldered
together
*punct* !
*break*
the
meaning
of
rudimentary
organs
is
often
quite
unmistakeable
*punct* :
for
instance
there
are
beetles
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
and
even
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
resembling
each
other
most
closely
in
all
respects
*punct* ,
one
of
which
will
have
full-sized
wings
*punct* ,
and
another
mere
rudiments
of
membrane
*punct* ;
and
here
it
is
impossible
to
doubt
*punct* ,
that
the
rudiments
represent
wings
*punct* .
*break*
rudimentary
organs
sometimes
retain
their
potentiality
*punct* ,
and
are
merely
not
developed
*punct* :
this
seems
to
be
the
case
with
the
mammae
of
male
mammals
*punct* ,
for
many
instances
are
on
record
of
these
organs
having
become
well
developed
in
full-grown
males
*punct* ,
and
having
secreted
milk
*punct* .
*break*
so
again
there
are
normally
four
developed
and
two
rudimentary
teats
in
the
udders
of
the
genus
bos
*punct* ,
but
in
our
domestic
cows
the
two
sometimes
become
developed
and
give
milk
*punct* .
*break*
in
individual
plants
of
the
same
species
the
petals
sometimes
occur
as
mere
rudiments
*punct* ,
and
sometimes
in
a
well-developed
state
*punct* .
*break*
in
plants
with
separated
sexes
*punct* ,
the
male
flowers
often
have
a
rudiment
of
a
pistil
*punct* ;
and
kolreuter
found
that
by
crossing
such
male
plants
with
an
hermaphrodite
species
*punct* ,
the
rudiment
of
the
pistil
in
the
hybrid
offspring
was
much
increased
in
size
*punct* ;
and
this
shows
that
the
rudiment
and
the
perfect
pistil
are
essentially
alike
in
nature
*punct* .
*break*
an
organ
serving
for
two
purposes
*punct* ,
may
become
rudimentary
or
utterly
aborted
for
one
*punct* ,
even
the
more
important
purpose
*punct* ;
and
remain
perfectly
efficient
for
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
thus
in
plants
*punct* ,
the
office
of
the
pistil
is
to
allow
the
pollen-tubes
to
reach
the
ovules
protected
in
the
ovarium
at
its
base
*punct* .
*break*
the
pistil
consists
of
a
stigma
supported
on
the
style
*punct* ;
but
in
some
compositae
*punct* ,
the
male
florets
*punct* ,
which
of
course
cannot
be
fecundated
*punct* ,
have
a
pistil
*punct* ,
which
is
in
a
rudimentary
state
*punct* ,
for
it
is
not
crowned
with
a
stigma
*punct* ;
but
the
style
remains
well
developed
*punct* ,
and
is
clothed
with
hairs
as
in
other
compositae
*punct* ,
for
the
purpose
of
brushing
the
pollen
out
of
the
surrounding
anthers
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
an
organ
may
become
rudimentary
for
its
proper
purpose
*punct* ,
and
be
used
for
a
distinct
object
*punct* :
in
certain
fish
the
swim-bladder
seems
to
be
rudimentary
for
its
proper
function
of
giving
buoyancy
*punct* ,
but
has
become
converted
into
a
nascent
breathing
organ
or
lung
*punct* .
*break*
other
similar
instances
could
be
given
*punct* .
*break*
rudimentary
organs
in
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
are
very
liable
to
vary
in
degree
of
development
and
in
other
respects
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
in
closely
allied
species
*punct* ,
the
degree
to
which
the
same
organ
has
been
rendered
rudimentary
occasionally
differs
much
*punct* .
*break*
this
latter
fact
is
well
exemplified
in
the
state
of
the
wings
of
the
female
moths
in
certain
groups
*punct* .
*break*
rudimentary
organs
may
be
utterly
aborted
*punct* ;
and
this
implies
*punct* ,
that
we
find
in
an
animal
or
plant
no
trace
of
an
organ
*punct* ,
which
analogy
would
lead
us
to
expect
to
find
*punct* ,
and
which
is
occasionally
found
in
monstrous
individuals
of
the
species
*punct* .
*break*
thus
in
the
snapdragon
*punct* ,
antirrhinum
*punct* ,
we
generally
do
not
find
a
rudiment
of
a
fifth
stamen
*punct* ;
but
this
may
sometimes
be
seen
*punct* .
*break*
in
tracing
the
homologies
of
the
same
part
in
different
members
of
a
class
*punct* ,
nothing
is
more
common
*punct* ,
or
more
necessary
*punct* ,
than
the
use
and
discovery
of
rudiments
*punct* .
*break*
this
is
well
shown
in
the
drawings
given
by
owen
of
the
bones
of
the
leg
of
the
horse
*punct* ,
ox
*punct* ,
and
rhinoceros
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
an
important
fact
that
rudimentary
organs
*punct* ,
such
as
teeth
in
the
upper
jaws
of
whales
and
ruminants
*punct* ,
can
often
be
detected
in
the
embryo
*punct* ,
but
afterwards
wholly
disappear
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
also
*punct* ,
i
believe
*punct* ,
a
universal
rule
*punct* ,
that
a
rudimentary
part
or
organ
is
of
greater
size
relatively
to
the
adjoining
parts
in
the
embryo
*punct* ,
than
in
the
adult
*punct* ;
so
that
the
organ
at
this
early
age
is
less
rudimentary
*punct* ,
or
even
cannot
be
said
to
be
in
any
degree
rudimentary
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
a
rudimentary
organ
in
the
adult
*punct* ,
is
often
said
to
have
retained
its
embryonic
condition
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
now
given
the
leading
facts
with
respect
to
rudimentary
organs
*punct* .
*break*
in
reflecting
on
them
*punct* ,
every
one
must
be
struck
with
astonishment
*punct* :
for
the
same
reasoning
power
which
tells
us
plainly
that
most
parts
and
organs
are
exquisitely
adapted
for
certain
purposes
*punct* ,
tells
us
with
equal
plainness
that
these
rudimentary
or
atrophied
organs
*punct* ,
are
imperfect
and
useless
*punct* .
*break*
in
works
on
natural
history
rudimentary
organs
are
generally
said
to
have
been
created
for
the
sake
of
symmetry
*punct* ,
or
in
order
to
complete
the
scheme
of
nature
*punct* ;
but
this
seems
to
me
no
explanation
*punct* ,
merely
a
restatement
of
the
fact
*punct* .
*break*
would
it
be
thought
sufficient
to
say
that
because
planets
revolve
in
elliptic
courses
round
the
sun
*punct* ,
satellites
follow
the
same
course
round
the
planets
*punct* ,
for
the
sake
of
symmetry
*punct* ,
and
to
complete
the
scheme
of
nature
*punct* ?
*break*
an
eminent
physiologist
accounts
for
the
presence
of
rudimentary
organs
*punct* ,
by
supposing
that
they
serve
to
excrete
matter
in
excess
*punct* ,
or
injurious
to
the
system
*punct* ;
but
can
we
suppose
that
the
minute
papilla
*punct* ,
which
often
represents
the
pistil
in
male
flowers
*punct* ,
and
which
is
formed
merely
of
cellular
tissue
*punct* ,
can
thus
act
*punct* ?
*break*
can
we
suppose
that
the
formation
of
rudimentary
teeth
which
are
subsequently
absorbed
*punct* ,
can
be
of
any
service
to
the
rapidly
growing
embryonic
calf
by
the
excretion
of
precious
phosphate
of
lime
*punct* ?
*break*
when
a
man's
fingers
have
been
amputated
*punct* ,
imperfect
nails
sometimes
appear
on
the
stumps
*punct* :
i
could
as
soon
believe
that
these
vestiges
of
nails
have
appeared
*punct* ,
not
from
unknown
laws
of
growth
*punct* ,
but
in
order
to
excrete
horny
matter
*punct* ,
as
that
the
rudimentary
nails
on
the
fin
of
the
manatee
were
formed
for
this
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
on
my
view
of
descent
with
modification
*punct* ,
the
origin
of
rudimentary
organs
is
simple
*punct* .
*break*
we
have
plenty
of
cases
of
rudimentary
organs
in
our
domestic
productions,
*punct* ,
as
the
stump
of
a
tail
in
tailless
breeds,
*punct* ,
the
vestige
of
an
ear
in
earless
breeds,
*punct* ,
the
reappearance
of
minute
dangling
horns
in
hornless
breeds
of
cattle
*punct* ,
more
especially
*punct* ,
according
to
youatt
*punct* ,
in
young
animals,
*punct* ,
and
the
state
of
the
whole
flower
in
the
cauliflower
*punct* .
*break*
we
often
see
rudiments
of
various
parts
in
monsters
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
doubt
whether
any
of
these
cases
throw
light
on
the
origin
of
rudimentary
organs
in
a
state
of
nature
*punct* ,
further
than
by
showing
that
rudiments
can
be
produced
*punct* ;
for
i
doubt
whether
species
under
nature
ever
undergo
abrupt
changes
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
that
disuse
has
been
the
main
agency
*punct* ;
that
it
has
led
in
successive
generations
to
the
gradual
reduction
of
various
organs
*punct* ,
until
they
have
become
rudimentary,
*punct* ,
as
in
the
case
of
the
eyes
of
animals
inhabiting
dark
caverns
*punct* ,
and
of
the
wings
of
birds
inhabiting
oceanic
islands
*punct* ,
which
have
seldom
been
forced
to
take
flight
*punct* ,
and
have
ultimately
lost
the
power
of
flying
*punct* .
*break*
again
*punct* ,
an
organ
useful
under
certain
conditions
*punct* ,
might
become
injurious
under
others
*punct* ,
as
with
the
wings
of
beetles
living
on
small
and
exposed
islands
*punct* ;
and
in
this
case
natural
selection
would
continue
slowly
to
reduce
the
organ
*punct* ,
until
it
was
rendered
harmless
and
rudimentary
*punct* .
*break*
any
change
in
function
*punct* ,
which
can
be
effected
by
insensibly
small
steps
*punct* ,
is
within
the
power
of
natural
selection
*punct* ;
so
that
an
organ
rendered
*punct* ,
during
changed
habits
of
life
*punct* ,
useless
or
injurious
for
one
purpose
*punct* ,
might
easily
be
modified
and
used
for
another
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
or
an
organ
might
be
retained
for
one
alone
of
its
former
functions
*punct* .
*break*
an
organ
*punct* ,
when
rendered
useless
*punct* ,
may
well
be
variable
*punct* ,
for
its
variations
cannot
be
checked
by
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
at
whatever
period
of
life
disuse
or
selection
reduces
an
organ
*punct* ,
and
this
will
generally
be
when
the
being
has
come
to
maturity
and
to
its
full
powers
of
action
*punct* ,
the
principle
of
inheritance
at
corresponding
ages
will
reproduce
the
organ
in
its
reduced
state
at
the
same
age
*punct* ,
and
consequently
will
seldom
affect
or
reduce
it
in
the
embryo
*punct* .
*break*
thus
we
can
understand
the
greater
relative
size
of
rudimentary
organs
in
the
embryo
*punct* ,
and
their
lesser
relative
size
in
the
adult
*punct* .
*break*
but
if
each
step
of
the
process
of
reduction
were
to
be
inherited
*punct* ,
not
at
the
corresponding
age
*punct* ,
but
at
an
extremely
early
period
of
life
*punct* ,
as
we
have
good
reason
to
believe
to
be
possible
*punct* ,
the
rudimentary
part
would
tend
to
be
wholly
lost
*punct* ,
and
we
should
have
a
case
of
complete
abortion
*punct* .
*break*
the
principle
*punct* ,
also
*punct* ,
of
economy
*punct* ,
explained
in
a
former
chapter
*punct* ,
by
which
the
materials
forming
any
part
or
structure
*punct* ,
if
not
useful
to
the
possessor
*punct* ,
will
be
saved
as
far
as
is
possible
*punct* ,
will
probably
often
come
into
play
*punct* ;
and
this
will
tend
to
cause
the
entire
obliteration
of
a
rudimentary
organ
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
presence
of
rudimentary
organs
is
thus
due
to
the
tendency
in
every
part
of
the
organisation
*punct* ,
which
has
long
existed
*punct* ,
to
be
inherited
*punct* ,
we
can
understand
*punct* ,
on
the
genealogical
view
of
classification
*punct* ,
how
it
is
that
systematists
have
found
rudimentary
parts
as
useful
as
*punct* ,
or
even
sometimes
more
useful
than
*punct* ,
parts
of
high
physiological
importance
*punct* .
*break*
rudimentary
organs
may
be
compared
with
the
letters
in
a
word
*punct* ,
still
retained
in
the
spelling
*punct* ,
but
become
useless
in
the
pronunciation
*punct* ,
but
which
serve
as
a
clue
in
seeking
for
its
derivation
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
view
of
descent
with
modification
*punct* ,
we
may
conclude
that
the
existence
of
organs
in
a
rudimentary
*punct* ,
imperfect
*punct* ,
and
useless
condition
*punct* ,
or
quite
aborted
*punct* ,
far
from
presenting
a
strange
difficulty
*punct* ,
as
they
assuredly
do
on
the
ordinary
doctrine
of
creation
*punct* ,
might
even
have
been
anticipated
*punct* ,
and
can
be
accounted
for
by
the
laws

summary.

the

all
living

united
by
complex
*punct* ,
radiating

into
one
grand

on
the

the
common
parentage

are
considered
by
naturalists
as
allied
*punct* ,
together
with
their
modification
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
with
its
contingencies
of
extinction
and
divergence

character
*punct* .
*break*
in
considering
this
view
of
classification
*punct* ,
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
element
of
descent
has
been
universally
used
in
ranking
together
the
sexes
*punct* ,
ages
*punct* ,
and
acknowledged
varieties
of
the

however
different
they

if
we
extend
the
use
of
this
element
of
descent,
*punct* ,
the
only
certainly
known
cause
of
similarity
in
organic
beings,
*punct* ,
we
shall
understand
what
is
meant

the
natural

it

genealogical
in

varieties

and
being
inherited
at
a
corresponding
period
*punct* ,
we
can
understand
the
great
leading
facts
in
embryology
*punct* ;

*punct* ,
the
resemblance
in

being

*break*
on
this

principle
*punct* ,
and

in

that
when

from

it

finally
*punct* ,
the
several
classes

facts

have
been
considered
in
this
chapter

seem
to
me
to
proclaim
so
plainly
*punct* ,
that
the
innumerable
species
*punct* ,
genera
*punct* ,
and
families
of
organic
beings
*punct* ,
with
which
this
world
is
peopled
*punct* ,
have
all
descended
*punct* ,
each
within
its
own
class
or
group
*punct* ,
from
common
parents
*punct* ,
and
have
all
been
modified
in
the
course
of
descent
*punct* ,
that
i
should
without
hesitation
adopt
this
view
*punct* ,
even
if
it
were
unsupported
by
other
facts
or
arguments
*punct* .
*break*
as
this
whole
volume
is
one
long
argument
*punct* ,
it
may
be
convenient
to
the
reader
to
have
the
leading
facts
and
inferences
briefly
recapitulated
*punct* .
*break*
that
many
and
grave
objections
may
be
advanced
against
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
through
natural
selection
*punct* ,
i
do
not
deny
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
endeavoured
to
give
to
them
their
full
force
*punct* .
*break*
nothing
at
first
can
appear
more
difficult
to
believe
than
that
the
more
complex
organs
and
instincts
should
have
been
perfected
*punct* ,
not
by
means
superior
to
*punct* ,
though
analogous
with
*punct* ,
human
reason
*punct* ,
but
by
the
accumulation
of
innumerable
slight
variations
*punct* ,
each
good
for
the
individual
possessor
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
this
difficulty
*punct* ,
though
appearing
to
our
imagination
insuperably
great
*punct* ,
cannot
be
considered
real
if
we
admit
the
following
propositions
*punct* ,
namely,
*punct* ,
that
gradations
in
the
perfection
of
any
organ
or
instinct
*punct* ,
which
we
may
consider
*punct* ,
either
do
now
exist
or
could
have
existed
*punct* ,
each
good
of
its
kind,
*punct* ,
that
all
organs
and
instincts
are
*punct* ,
in
ever
so
slight
a
degree
*punct* ,
variable,
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
lastly
*punct* ,
that
there
is
a
struggle
for
existence
leading
to
the
preservation
of
each
profitable
deviation
of
structure
or
instinct
*punct* .
*break*
the
truth
of
these
propositions
cannot
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
be
disputed
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* ,
extremely
difficult
even
to
conjecture
by
what
gradations
many
structures
have
been
perfected
*punct* ,
more
especially
amongst
broken
and
failing
groups
of
organic
beings
*punct* ;
but
we
see
so
many
strange
gradations
in
nature
*punct* ,
as
is
proclaimed
by
the
canon
*punct* ,
natura
non
facit
saltum
*punct* ,
that
we
ought
to
be
extremely
cautious
in
saying
that
any
organ
or
instinct
*punct* ,
or
any
whole
being
*punct* ,
could
not
have
arrived
at
its
present
state
by
many
graduated
steps
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
*punct* ,
it
must
be
admitted
*punct* ,
cases
of
special
difficulty
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
*punct* ;
and
one
of
the
most
curious
of
these
is
the
existence
of
two
or
three
defined
castes
of
workers
or
sterile
females
in
the
same
community
of
ants
*punct* ;
but
i
have
attempted
to
show
how
this
difficulty
can
be
mastered
*punct* .
*break*
with
respect
to
the
almost
universal
sterility
of
species
when
first
crossed
*punct* ,
which
forms
so
remarkable
a
contrast
with
the
almost
universal
fertility
of
varieties
when
crossed
*punct* ,
i
must
refer
the
reader
to
the
recapitulation
of
the
facts
given
at
the
end
of
the
eighth
chapter
*punct* ,
which
seem
to
me
conclusively
to
show
that
this
sterility
is
no
more
a
special
endowment
than
is
the
incapacity
of
two
trees
to
be
grafted
together
*punct* ,
but
that
it
is
incidental
on
constitutional
differences
in
the
reproductive
systems
of
the
intercrossed
species
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
the
truth
of
this
conclusion
in
the
vast
difference
in
the
result
*punct* ,
when
the
same
two
species
are
crossed
reciprocally
*punct* ;
that
is
*punct* ,
when
one
species
is
first
used
as
the
father
and
then
as
the
mother
*punct* .
*break*
the
fertility
of
varieties
when
intercrossed
and
of
their
mongrel
offspring
cannot
be
considered
as
universal
*punct* ;
nor
is
their
very
general
fertility
surprising
when
we
remember
that
it
is
not
likely
that
either
their
constitutions
or
their
reproductive
systems
should
have
been
profoundly
modified
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
most
of
the
varieties
which
have
been
experimentised
on
have
been
produced
under
domestication
*punct* ;
and
as
domestication
apparently
tends
to
eliminate
sterility
*punct* ,
we
ought
not
to
expect
it
also
to
produce
sterility
*punct* .
*break*
the
sterility
of
hybrids
is
a
very
different
case
from
that
of
first
crosses
*punct* ,
for
their
reproductive
organs
are
more
or
less
functionally
impotent
*punct* ;
whereas
in
first
crosses
the
organs
on
both
sides
are
in
a
perfect
condition
*punct* .
*break*
as
we
continually
see
that
organisms
of
all
kinds
are
rendered
in
some
degree
sterile
from
their
constitutions
having
been
disturbed
by
slightly
different
and
new
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
we
need
not
feel
surprise
at
hybrids
being
in
some
degree
sterile
*punct* ,
for
their
constitutions
can
hardly
fail
to
have
been
disturbed
from
being
compounded
of
two
distinct
organisations
*punct* .
*break*
this
parallelism
is
supported
by
another
parallel
*punct* ,
but
directly
opposite
*punct* ,
class
of
facts
*punct* ;
namely
*punct* ,
that
the
vigour
and
fertility
of
all
organic
beings
are
increased
by
slight
changes
in
their
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
and
that
the
offspring
of
slightly
modified
forms
or
varieties
acquire
from
being
crossed
increased
vigour
and
fertility
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
*punct* ,
on
the
one
hand
*punct* ,
considerable
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
and
crosses
between
greatly
modified
forms
*punct* ,
lessen
fertility
*punct* ;
and
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
lesser
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
and
crosses
between
less
modified
forms
*punct* ,
increase
fertility
*punct* .
*break*
turning
to
geographical
distribution
*punct* ,
the
difficulties
encountered
on
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
are
grave
enough
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
and
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* ,
or
even
higher
group
*punct* ,
must
have
descended
from
common
parents
*punct* ;
and
therefore
*punct* ,
in
however
distant
and
isolated
parts
of
the
world
they
are
now
found
*punct* ,
they
must
in
the
course
of
successive
generations
have
passed
from
some
one
part
to
the
others
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
often
wholly
unable
even
to
conjecture
how
this
could
have
been
effected
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
as
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
some
species
have
retained
the
same
specific
form
for
very
long
periods
*punct* ,
enormously
long
as
measured
by
years
*punct* ,
too
much
stress
ought
not
to
be
laid
on
the
occasional
wide
diffusion
of
the
same
species
*punct* ;
for
during
very
long
periods
of
time
there
will
always
be
a
good
chance
for
wide
migration
by
many
means
*punct* .
*break*
a
broken
or
interrupted
range
may
often
be
accounted
for
by
the
extinction
of
the
species
in
the
intermediate
regions
*punct* .
*break*
it
cannot
be
denied
that
we
are
as
yet
very
ignorant
of
the
full
extent
of
the
various
climatal
and
geographical
changes
which
have
affected
the
earth
during
modern
periods
*punct* ;
and
such
changes
will
obviously
have
greatly
facilitated
migration
*punct* .
*break*
as
an
example
*punct* ,
i
have
attempted
to
show
how
potent
has
been
the
influence
of
the
glacial
period
on
the
distribution
both
of
the
same
and
of
representative
species
throughout
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
as
yet
profoundly
ignorant
of
the
many
occasional
means
of
transport
*punct* .
*break*
with
respect
to
distinct
species
of
the
same
genus
inhabiting
very
distant
and
isolated
regions
*punct* ,
as
the
process
of
modification
has
necessarily
been
slow
*punct* ,
all
the
means
of
migration
will
have
been
possible
during
a
very
long
period
*punct* ;
and
consequently
the
difficulty
of
the
wide
diffusion
of
species
of
the
same
genus
is
in
some
degree
lessened
*punct* .
*break*
as
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
an
interminable
number
of
intermediate
forms
must
have
existed
*punct* ,
linking
together
all
the
species
in
each
group
by
gradations
as
fine
as
our
present
varieties
*punct* ,
it
may
be
asked
*punct* ,
why
do
we
not
see
these
linking
forms
all
around
us
*punct* ?
*break*
why
are
not
all
organic
beings
blended
together
in
an
inextricable
chaos
*punct* ?
*break*
with
respect
to
existing
forms
*punct* ,
we
should
remember
that
we
have
no
right
to
expect
*punct* ,
excepting
in
rare
cases
*punct* ,
to
discover
directly
connecting
links
between
them
*punct* ,
but
only
between
each
and
some
extinct
and
supplanted
form
*punct* .
*break*
even
on
a
wide
area
*punct* ,
which
has
during
a
long
period
remained
continuous
*punct* ,
and
of
which
the
climate
and
other
conditions
of
life
change
insensibly
in
going
from
a
district
occupied
by
one
species
into
another
district
occupied
by
a
closely
allied
species
*punct* ,
we
have
no
just
right
to
expect
often
to
find
intermediate
varieties
in
the
intermediate
zone
*punct* .
*break*
for
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
only
a
few
species
are
undergoing
change
at
any
one
period
*punct* ;
and
all
changes
are
slowly
effected
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
also
shown
that
the
intermediate
varieties
which
will
at
first
probably
exist
in
the
intermediate
zones
*punct* ,
will
be
liable
to
be
supplanted
by
the
allied
forms
on
either
hand
*punct* ;
and
the
latter
*punct* ,
from
existing
in
greater
numbers
*punct* ,
will
generally
be
modified
and
improved
at
a
quicker
rate
than
the
intermediate
varieties
*punct* ,
which
exist
in
lesser
numbers
*punct* ;
so
that
the
intermediate
varieties
will
*punct* ,
in
the
long
run
*punct* ,
be
supplanted
and
exterminated
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
doctrine
of
the
extermination
of
an
infinitude
of
connecting
links
*punct* ,
between
the
living
and
extinct
inhabitants
of
the
world
*punct* ,
and
at
each
successive
period
between
the
extinct
and
still
older
species
*punct* ,
why
is
not
every
geological
formation
charged
with
such
links
*punct* ?
*break*
why
does
not
every
collection
of
fossil
remains
afford
plain
evidence
of
the
gradation
and
mutation
of
the
forms
of
life
*punct* ?
*break*
we
meet
with
no
such
evidence
*punct* ,
and
this
is
the
most
obvious
and
forcible
of
the
many
objections
which
may
be
urged
against
my
theory
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
do
whole
groups
of
allied
species
appear
*punct* ,
though
certainly
they
often
falsely
appear
*punct* ,
to
have
come
in
suddenly
on
the
several
geological
stages
*punct* ?
*break*
why
do
we
not
find
great
piles
of
strata
beneath
the
silurian
system
*punct* ,
stored
with
the
remains
of
the
progenitors
of
the
silurian
groups
of
fossils
*punct* ?
*break*
for
certainly
on
my
theory
such
strata
must
somewhere
have
been
deposited
at
these
ancient
and
utterly
unknown
epochs
in
the
world's
history
*punct* .
*break*
i
can
answer
these
questions
and
grave
objections
only
on
the
supposition
that
the
geological
record
is
far
more
imperfect
than
most
geologists
believe
*punct* .
*break*
it
cannot
be
objected
that
there
has
not
been
time
sufficient
for
any
amount
of
organic
change
*punct* ;
for
the
lapse
of
time
has
been
so
great
as
to
be
utterly
inappreciable
by
the
human
intellect
*punct* .
*break*
the
number
of
specimens
in
all
our
museums
is
absolutely
as
nothing
compared
with
the
countless
generations
of
countless
species
which
certainly
have
existed
*punct* .
*break*
we
should
not
be
able
to
recognise
a
species
as
the
parent
of
any
one
or
more
species
if
we
were
to
examine
them
ever
so
closely
*punct* ,
unless
we
likewise
possessed
many
of
the
intermediate
links
between
their
past
or
parent
and
present
states
*punct* ;
and
these
many
links
we
could
hardly
ever
expect
to
discover
*punct* ,
owing
to
the
imperfection
of
the
geological
record
*punct* .
*break*
numerous
existing
doubtful
forms
could
be
named
which
are
probably
varieties
*punct* ;
but
who
will
pretend
that
in
future
ages
so
many
fossil
links
will
be
discovered
*punct* ,
that
naturalists
will
be
able
to
decide
*punct* ,
on
the
common
view
*punct* ,
whether
or
not
these
doubtful
forms
are
varieties
*punct* ?
*break*
as
long
as
most
of
the
links
between
any
two
species
are
unknown
*punct* ,
if
any
one
link
or
intermediate
variety
be
discovered
*punct* ,
it
will
simply
be
classed
as
another
and
distinct
species
*punct* .
*break*
only
a
small
portion
of
the
world
has
been
geologically
explored
*punct* .
*break*
only
organic
beings
of
certain
classes
can
be
preserved
in
a
fossil
condition
*punct* ,
at
least
in
any
great
number
*punct* .
*break*
widely
ranging
species
vary
most
*punct* ,
and
varieties
are
often
at
first
local,
*punct* ,
both
causes
rendering
the
discovery
of
intermediate
links
less
likely
*punct* .
*break*
local
varieties
will
not
spread
into
other
and
distant
regions
until
they
are
considerably
modified
and
improved
*punct* ;
and
when
they
do
spread
*punct* ,
if
discovered
in
a
geological
formation
*punct* ,
they
will
appear
as
if
suddenly
created
there
*punct* ,
and
will
be
simply
classed
as
new
species
*punct* .
*break*
most
formations
have
been
intermittent
in
their
accumulation
*punct* ;
and
their
duration
*punct* ,
i
am
inclined
to
believe
*punct* ,
has
been
shorter
than
the
average
duration
of
specific
forms
*punct* .
*break*
successive
formations
are
separated
from
each
other
by
enormous
blank
intervals
of
time
*punct* ;
for
fossiliferous
formations
*punct* ,
thick
enough
to
resist
future
degradation
*punct* ,
can
be
accumulated
only
where
much
sediment
is
deposited
on
the
subsiding
bed
of
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
during
the
alternate
periods
of
elevation
and
of
stationary
level
the
record
will
be
blank
*punct* .
*break*
during
these
latter
periods
there
will
probably
be
more
variability
in
the
forms
of
life
*punct* ;
during
periods
of
subsidence
*punct* ,
more
extinction
*punct* .
*break*
with
respect
to
the
absence
of
fossiliferous
formations
beneath
the
lowest
silurian
strata
*punct* ,
i
can
only
recur
to
the
hypothesis
given
in
the
ninth
chapter
*punct* .
*break*
that
the
geological
record
is
imperfect
all
will
admit
*punct* ;
but
that
it
is
imperfect
to
the
degree
which
i
require
*punct* ,
few
will
be
inclined
to
admit
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
look
to
long
enough
intervals
of
time
*punct* ,
geology
plainly
declares
that
all
species
have
changed
*punct* ;
and
they
have
changed
in
the
manner
which
my
theory
requires
*punct* ,
for
they
have
changed
slowly
and
in
a
graduated
manner
*punct* .
*break*
we
clearly
see
this
in
the
fossil
remains
from
consecutive
formations
invariably
being
much
more
closely
related
to
each
other
*punct* ,
than
are
the
fossils
from
formations
distant
from
each
other
in
time
*punct* .
*break*
such
is
the
sum
of
the
several
chief
objections
and
difficulties
which
may
justly
be
urged
against
my
theory
*punct* ;
and
i
have
now
briefly
recapitulated
the
answers
and
explanations
which
can
be
given
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
felt
these
difficulties
far
too
heavily
during
many
years
to
doubt
their
weight
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
deserves
especial
notice
that
the
more
important
objections
relate
to
questions
on
which
we
are
confessedly
ignorant
*punct* ;
nor
do
we
know
how
ignorant
we
are
*punct* .
*break*
we
do
not
know
all
the
possible
transitional
gradations
between
the
simplest
and
the
most
perfect
organs
*punct* ;
it
cannot
be
pretended
that
we
know
all
the
varied
means
of
distribution
during
the
long
lapse
of
years
*punct* ,
or
that
we
know
how
imperfect
the
geological
record
is
*punct* .
*break*
grave
as
these
several
difficulties
are
*punct* ,
in
my
judgment
they
do
not
overthrow
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
*punct* .
*break*
now
let
us
turn
to
the
other
side
of
the
argument
*punct* .
*break*
under
domestication
we
see
much
variability
*punct* .
*break*
this
seems
to
be
mainly
due
to
the
reproductive
system
being
eminently
susceptible
to
changes
in
the
conditions
of
life
*punct* ;
so
that
this
system
*punct* ,
when
not
rendered
impotent
*punct* ,
fails
to
reproduce
offspring
exactly
like
the
parent-form
*punct* .
*break*
variability
is
governed
by
many
complex
laws,
*punct* ,
by
correlation
of
growth
*punct* ,
by
use
and
disuse
*punct* ,
and
by
the
direct
action
of
the
physical
conditions
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
much
difficulty
in
ascertaining
how
much
modification
our
domestic
productions
have
undergone
*punct* ;
but
we
may
safely
infer
that
the
amount
has
been
large
*punct* ,
and
that
modifications
can
be
inherited
for
long
periods
*punct* .
*break*
as
long
as
the
conditions
of
life
remain
the
same
*punct* ,
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
a
modification
*punct* ,
which
has
already
been
inherited
for
many
generations
*punct* ,
may
continue
to
be
inherited
for
an
almost
infinite
number
of
generations
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
we
have
evidence
that
variability
*punct* ,
when
it
has
once
come
into
play
*punct* ,
does
not
wholly
cease
*punct* ;
for
new
varieties
are
still
occasionally
produced
by
our
most
anciently
domesticated
productions
*punct* .
*break*
man
does
not
actually
produce
variability
*punct* ;
he
only
unintentionally
exposes
organic
beings
to
new
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
and
then
nature
acts
on
the
organisation
*punct* ,
and
causes
variability
*punct* .
*break*
but
man
can
and
does
select
the
variations
given
to
him
by
nature
*punct* ,
and
thus
accumulate
them
in
any
desired
manner
*punct* .
*break*
he
thus
adapts
animals
and
plants
for
his
own
benefit
or
pleasure
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
do
this
methodically
*punct* ,
or
he
may
do
it
unconsciously
by
preserving
the
individuals
most
useful
to
him
at
the
time
*punct* ,
without
any
thought
of
altering
the
breed
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
certain
that
he
can
largely
influence
the
character
of
a
breed
by
selecting
*punct* ,
in
each
successive
generation
*punct* ,
individual
differences
so
slight
as
to
be
quite
inappreciable
by
an
uneducated
eye
*punct* .
*break*
this
process
of
selection
has
been
the
great
agency
in
the
production
of
the
most
distinct
and
useful
domestic
breeds
*punct* .
*break*
that
many
of
the
breeds
produced
by
man
have
to
a
large
extent
the
character
of
natural
species
*punct* ,
is
shown
by
the
inextricable
doubts
whether
very
many
of
them
are
varieties
or
aboriginal
species
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
obvious
reason
why
the
principles
which
have
acted
so
efficiently
under
domestication
should
not
have
acted
under
nature
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
preservation
of
favoured
individuals
and
races
*punct* ,
during
the
constantly-recurrent
struggle
for
existence
*punct* ,
we
see
the
most
powerful
and
ever-acting
means
of
selection
*punct* .
*break*
the
struggle
for
existence
inevitably
follows
from
the
high
geometrical
ratio
of
increase
which
is
common
to
all
organic
beings
*punct* .
*break*
this
high
rate
of
increase
is
proved
by
calculation
*punct* ,
by
the
effects
of
a
succession
of
peculiar
seasons
*punct* ,
and
by
the
results
of
naturalisation
*punct* ,
as
explained
in
the
third
chapter
*punct* .
*break*
more
individuals
are
born
than
can
possibly
survive
*punct* .
*break*
a
grain
in
the
balance
will
determine
which
individual
shall
live
and
which
shall
die,
*punct* ,
which
variety
or
species
shall
increase
in
number
*punct* ,
and
which
shall
decrease
*punct* ,
or
finally
become
extinct
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
individuals
of
the
same
species
come
in
all
respects
into
the
closest
competition
with
each
other
*punct* ,
the
struggle
will
generally
be
most
severe
between
them
*punct* ;
it
will
be
almost
equally
severe
between
the
varieties
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
and
next
in
severity
between
the
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
struggle
will
often
be
very
severe
between
beings
most
remote
in
the
scale
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
the
slightest
advantage
in
one
being
*punct* ,
at
any
age
or
during
any
season
*punct* ,
over
those
with
which
it
comes
into
competition
*punct* ,
or
better
adaptation
in
however
slight
a
degree
to
the
surrounding
physical
conditions
*punct* ,
will
turn
the
balance
*punct* .
*break*
with
animals
having
separated
sexes
there
will
in
most
cases
be
a
struggle
between
the
males
for
possession
of
the
females
*punct* .
*break*
the
most
vigorous
individuals
*punct* ,
or
those
which
have
most
successfully
struggled
with
their
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
will
generally
leave
most
progeny
*punct* .
*break*
but
success
will
often
depend
on
having
special
weapons
or
means
of
defence
*punct* ,
or
on
the
charms
of
the
males
*punct* ;
and
the
slightest
advantage
will
lead
to
victory
*punct* .
*break*
as
geology
plainly
proclaims
that
each
land
has
undergone
great
physical
changes
*punct* ,
we
might
have
expected
that
organic
beings
would
have
varied
under
nature
*punct* ,
in
the
same
way
as
they
generally
have
varied
under
the
changed
conditions
of
domestication
*punct* .
*break*
and
if
there
be
any
variability
under
nature
*punct* ,
it
would
be
an
unaccountable
fact
if
natural
selection
had
not
come
into
play
*punct* .
*break*
it
has
often
been
asserted
*punct* ,
but
the
assertion
is
quite
incapable
of
proof
*punct* ,
that
the
amount
of
variation
under
nature
is
a
strictly
limited
quantity
*punct* .
*break*
man
*punct* ,
though
acting
on
external
characters
alone
and
often
capriciously
*punct* ,
can
produce
within
a
short
period
a
great
result
by
adding
up
mere
individual
differences
in
his
domestic
productions
*punct* ;
and
every
one
admits
that
there
are
at
least
individual
differences
in
species
under
nature
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
besides
such
differences
*punct* ,
all
naturalists
have
admitted
the
existence
of
varieties
*punct* ,
which
they
think
sufficiently
distinct
to
be
worthy
of
record
in
systematic
works
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
can
draw
any
clear
distinction
between
individual
differences
and
slight
varieties
*punct* ;
or
between
more
plainly
marked
varieties
and
sub-species
*punct* ,
and
species
*punct* .
*break*
let
it
be
observed
how
naturalists
differ
in
the
rank
which
they
assign
to
the
many
representative
forms
in
europe
and
north
america
*punct* .
*break*
if
then
we
have
under
nature
variability
and
a
powerful
agent
always
ready
to
act
and
select
*punct* ,
why
should
we
doubt
that
variations
in
any
way
useful
to
beings
*punct* ,
under
their
excessively
complex
relations
of
life
*punct* ,
would
be
preserved
*punct* ,
accumulated
*punct* ,
and
inherited
*punct* ?
*break*
why
*punct* ,
if
man
can
by
patience
select
variations
most
useful
to
himself
*punct* ,
should
nature
fail
in
selecting
variations
useful
*punct* ,
under
changing
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
to
her
living
products
*punct* ?
*break*
what
limit
can
be
put
to
this
power
*punct* ,
acting
during
long
ages
and
rigidly
scrutinising
the
whole
constitution
*punct* ,
structure
*punct* ,
and
habits
of
each
creature,
*punct* ,
favouring
the
good
and
rejecting
the
bad
*punct* ?
*break*
i
can
see
no
limit
to
this
power
*punct* ,
in
slowly
and
beautifully
adapting
each
form
to
the
most
complex
relations
of
life
*punct* .
*break*
the
theory
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
even
if
we
looked
no
further
than
this
*punct* ,
seems
to
me
to
be
in
itself
probable
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
already
recapitulated
*punct* ,
as
fairly
as
i
could
*punct* ,
the
opposed
difficulties
and
objections
*punct* :
now
let
us
turn
to
the
special
facts
and
arguments
in
favour
of
the
theory
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
view
that
species
are
only
strongly
marked
and
permanent
varieties
*punct* ,
and
that
each
species
first
existed
as
a
variety
*punct* ,
we
can
see
why
it
is
that
no
line
of
demarcation
can
be
drawn
between
species
*punct* ,
commonly
supposed
to
have
been
produced
by
special
acts
of
creation
*punct* ,
and
varieties
which
are
acknowledged
to
have
been
produced
by
secondary
laws
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
same
view
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
in
each
region
where
many
species
of
a
genus
have
been
produced
*punct* ,
and
where
they
now
flourish
*punct* ,
these
same
species
should
present
many
varieties
*punct* ;
for
where
the
manufactory
of
species
has
been
active
*punct* ,
we
might
expect
*punct* ,
as
a
general
rule
*punct* ,
to
find
it
still
in
action
*punct* ;
and
this
is
the
case
if
varieties
be
incipient
species
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
the
species
of
the
large
genera
*punct* ,
which
afford
the
greater
number
of
varieties
or
incipient
species
*punct* ,
retain
to
a
certain
degree
the
character
of
varieties
*punct* ;
for
they
differ
from
each
other
by
a
less
amount
of
difference
than
do
the
species
of
smaller
genera
*punct* .
*break*
the
closely
allied
species
also
of
the
larger
genera
apparently
have
restricted
ranges
*punct* ,
and
they
are
clustered
in
little
groups
round
other
species
*punct* ,
in
which
respects
they
resemble
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
these
are
strange
relations
on
the
view
of
each
species
having
been
independently
created
*punct* ,
but
are
intelligible
if
all
species
first
existed
as
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
as
each
species
tends
by
its
geometrical
ratio
of
reproduction
to
increase
inordinately
in
number
*punct* ;
and
as
the
modified
descendants
of
each
species
will
be
enabled
to
increase
by
so
much
the
more
as
they
become
more
diversified
in
habits
and
structure
*punct* ,
so
as
to
be
enabled
to
seize
on
many
and
widely
different
places
in
the
economy
of
nature
*punct* ,
there
will
be
a
constant
tendency
in
natural
selection
to
preserve
the
most
divergent
offspring
of
any
one
species
*punct* .
*break*
hence
during
a
long-continued
course
of
modification
*punct* ,
the
slight
differences
*punct* ,
characteristic
of
varieties
of
the
same
species
*punct* ,
tend
to
be
augmented
into
the
greater
differences
characteristic
of
species
of
the
same
genus
*punct* .
*break*
new
and
improved
varieties
will
inevitably
supplant
and
exterminate
the
older
*punct* ,
less
improved
and
intermediate
varieties
*punct* ;
and
thus
species
are
rendered
to
a
large
extent
defined
and
distinct
objects
*punct* .
*break*
dominant
species
belonging
to
the
larger
groups
tend
to
give
birth
to
new
and
dominant
forms
*punct* ;
so
that
each
large
group
tends
to
become
still
larger
*punct* ,
and
at
the
same
time
more
divergent
in
character
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
all
groups
cannot
thus
succeed
in
increasing
in
size
*punct* ,
for
the
world
would
not
hold
them
*punct* ,
the
more
dominant
groups
beat
the
less
dominant
*punct* .
*break*
this
tendency
in
the
large
groups
to
go
on
increasing
in
size
and
diverging
in
character
*punct* ,
together
with
the
almost
inevitable
contingency
of
much
extinction
*punct* ,
explains
the
arrangement
of
all
the
forms
of
life
*punct* ,
in
groups
subordinate
to
groups
*punct* ,
all
within
a
few
great
classes
*punct* ,
which
we
now
see
everywhere
around
us
*punct* ,
and
which
has
prevailed
throughout
all
time
*punct* .
*break*
this
grand
fact
of
the
grouping
of
all
organic
beings
seems
to
me
utterly
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
creation
*punct* .
*break*
as
natural
selection
acts
solely
by
accumulating
slight
*punct* ,
successive
*punct* ,
favourable
variations
*punct* ,
it
can
produce
no
great
or
sudden
modification
*punct* ;
it
can
act
only
by
very
short
and
slow
steps
*punct* .
*break*
hence
the
canon
of
natura
non
facit
saltum
*punct* ,
which
every
fresh
addition
to
our
knowledge
tends
to
make
more
strictly
correct
*punct* ,
is
on
this
theory
simply
intelligible
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
plainly
see
why
nature
is
prodigal
in
variety
*punct* ,
though
niggard
in
innovation
*punct* .
*break*
but
why
this
should
be
a
law
of
nature
if
each
species
has
been
independently
created
*punct* ,
no
man
can
explain
*punct* .
*break*
many
other
facts
are
*punct* ,
as
it
seems
to
me
*punct* ,
explicable
on
this
theory
*punct* .
*break*
how
strange
it
is
that
a
bird
*punct* ,
under
the
form
of
woodpecker
*punct* ,
should
have
been
created
to
prey
on
insects
on
the
ground
*punct* ;
that
upland
geese
*punct* ,
which
never
or
rarely
swim
*punct* ,
should
have
been
created
with
webbed
feet
*punct* ;
that
a
thrush
should
have
been
created
to
dive
and
feed
on
sub-aquatic
insects
*punct* ;
and
that
a
petrel
should
have
been
created
with
habits
and
structure
fitting
it
for
the
life
of
an
auk
or
grebe
*punct* !
*break*
and
so
on
in
endless
other
cases
*punct* .
*break*
but
on
the
view
of
each
species
constantly
trying
to
increase
in
number
*punct* ,
with
natural
selection
always
ready
to
adapt
the
slowly
varying
descendants
of
each
to
any
unoccupied
or
ill-occupied
place
in
nature
*punct* ,
these
facts
cease
to
be
strange
*punct* ,
or
perhaps
might
even
have
been
anticipated
*punct* .
*break*
as
natural
selection
acts
by
competition
*punct* ,
it
adapts
the
inhabitants
of
each
country
only
in
relation
to
the
degree
of
perfection
of
their
associates
*punct* ;
so
that
we
need
feel
no
surprise
at
the
inhabitants
of
any
one
country
*punct* ,
although
on
the
ordinary
view
supposed
to
have
been
specially
created
and
adapted
for
that
country
*punct* ,
being
beaten
and
supplanted
by
the
naturalised
productions
from
another
land
*punct* .
*break*
nor
ought
we
to
marvel
if
all
the
contrivances
in
nature
be
not
*punct* ,
as
far
as
we
can
judge
*punct* ,
absolutely
perfect
*punct* ;
and
if
some
of
them
be
abhorrent
to
our
ideas
of
fitness
*punct* .
*break*
we
need
not
marvel
at
the
sting
of
the
bee
causing
the
bee's
own
death
*punct* ;
at
drones
being
produced
in
such
vast
numbers
for
one
single
act
*punct* ,
and
being
then
slaughtered
by
their
sterile
sisters
*punct* ;
at
the
astonishing
waste
of
pollen
by
our
fir-trees
*punct* ;
at
the
instinctive
hatred
of
the
queen
bee
for
her
own
fertile
daughters
*punct* ;
at
ichneumonidae
feeding
within
the
live
bodies
of
caterpillars
*punct* ;
and
at
other
such
cases
*punct* .
*break*
the
wonder
indeed
is
*punct* ,
on
the
theory
of
natural
selection
*punct* ,
that
more
cases
of
the
want
of
absolute
perfection
have
not
been
observed

the

the

governed
the

*break*
in

physical

enter

resist
this

has
wings
incapable

in
nearly
the

when
we
look

the
burrowing
tucutucu
*punct* ,

is
occasionally
blind

then
at
certain
moles
*punct* ,
which
are
habitually
blind

*break*
in

correlation

*break*
how

is
the

explained

the

*punct* !
*break*
on
the
ordinary

the

*punct* ,
or
those
by
which
the

differ
from

be

should
the

if
the
other

supposed

have

have
differently
coloured
flowers

if
all

if
species
are
only

of

the

become
in

*punct* ,
we
can
understand
this
fact
*punct* ;
for
they
have
already
varied
since
they
branched
off
from
a
common
progenitor
in
certain
characters
*punct* ,
by
which
they
have
come
to
be
specifically
distinct
from
each
other
*punct* ;
and
therefore
these
same
characters
would
be
more
likely
still
to
be
variable
than
the
generic
characters
which
have
been
inherited
without
change
for
an
enormous
period
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
creation
why
a
part
developed
in
a
very
unusual
manner
in
any
one
species
of
a
genus
*punct* ,
and
therefore
*punct* ,
as
we
may
naturally
infer
*punct* ,
of
great
importance
to
the
species
*punct* ,
should
be
eminently
liable
to
variation
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
on
my
view
*punct* ,
this
part
has
undergone
*punct* ,
since
the
several
species
branched
off
from
a
common
progenitor
*punct* ,
an
unusual
amount
of
variability
and
modification
*punct* ,
and
therefore
we
might
expect
this
part
generally
to
be
still
variable
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
part
may
be
developed
in
the
most
unusual
manner
*punct* ,
like
the
wing
of
a
bat
*punct* ,
and
yet
not
be
more
variable
than
any
other
structure
*punct* ,
if
the
part
be
common
to
many
subordinate
forms
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
if
it
has
been
inherited
for
a
very
long
period
*punct* ;
for
in
this
case
it
will
have
been
rendered
constant
by
long-continued
natural
selection
*punct* .
*break*
glancing
at
instincts
*punct* ,
marvellous
as
some
are

they
offer
no
greater

does
corporeal
structure
on
the

the
natural
selection

successive
*punct* ,
slight
*punct* ,

profitable
modifications
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
thus
understand
why
nature
moves
by
graduated
steps

endowing
different
animals
of
the
same
class

their
several
instincts
*punct* .

*punct* .
*break*
habit
no
doubt
sometimes
comes
into
play
in
modifying
instincts
*punct* ;
but
it
certainly
is
not
indispensable
*punct* ,
as
we
see
*punct* ,
in
the
case
of
neuter
insects
*punct* ,
which
leave
no
progeny
to
inherit
the
effects
of
long-continued
habit
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
view
of
all
the
species
of
the
same
genus
having
descended
from
a
common
parent
*punct* ,
and
having
inherited
much
in
common
*punct* ,
we
can
understand
how
it
is
that
allied
species
*punct* ,
when
placed
under
considerably
different
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
yet
should
follow
nearly
the
same
instincts
*punct* ;
why
the
thrush
of
south
america
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
lines
her
nest
with
mud
like
our
british
species
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
view
of
instincts
having
been
slowly
acquired
through
natural
selection
we
need
not
marvel
at
some
instincts
being
apparently
not
perfect
and
liable
to
mistakes
*punct* ,
and
at
many
instincts
causing
other
animals
to
suffer
*punct* .
*break*
if
species
be
only
well-marked
and
permanent
varieties
*punct* ,
we
can
at
once
see
why
their
crossed
offspring
should
follow
the
same
complex
laws
in
their
degrees
and
kinds
of
resemblance
to
their
parents,
*punct* ,
in
being
absorbed
into
each
other
by
successive
crosses
*punct* ,
and
in
other
such
points,
*punct* ,
as
do
the
crossed
offspring
of
acknowledged
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
other
hand
*punct* ,
these
would
be
strange
facts
if
species
have
been
independently
created
*punct* ,
and
varieties
have
been
produced
by
secondary
laws
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
admit
that
the
geological
record
is
imperfect
in
an
extreme
degree

such
facts

the
record
gives
*punct* ,
support
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
*punct* .
*break*
new
species
have
come

slowly

at
successive
intervals

is

different

groups
*punct* .

extinction
of
species

species
*punct* ,
which
has
played
so
conspicuous
a

in
the
history
of
the
organic
world
*punct* ,
almost
inevitably
follows
on
the
principle
of
natural
selection
*punct* ;
for
old
forms
will
be
supplanted
by
new
and
improved
forms
*punct* .
*break*
neither
single
species
nor
groups
of

the

*break*
the
gradual
diffusion
of
dominant
forms

their
descendants
*punct* ,
causes
the
forms
of
life

*break*
the

each
formation
being
in
some
degree
intermediate
in
character
between
the
fossils
in
the
formations
above

simply
explained
by
their
intermediate
position
in

the
grand
fact
that
all
extinct
organic

belong
to
the

follows
from

*break*
as
the
groups
which
have
descended
from
an
ancient
progenitor

generally
diverged

*punct* ,
the
progenitor
with
its
early
descendants
will
often
be
intermediate
in
character
in
comparison
with
its
later
descendants
*punct* ;
and
thus
we
can
see
why
the
more
ancient
a
fossil
is
*punct* ,
the
oftener
it
stands
in
some
degree
intermediate

existing

recent

are
generally
looked
at
as
being
*punct* ,
in
some
vague
sense

higher

ancient

extinct
forms

*punct* ,
is
intelligible

for
within
a

the

*break*
looking

geographical

there

ages
much
migration
from
one
part

former
climatal

most

the

generally
be
descendants

*break*
on
this

principle
of
former
migration

intertropical
ocean

*break*
although
two

we
need
feel
no

their
inhabitants
being
widely
different

period
completely
separated

at
various
periods

period
of
life
*punct* ,
we
can
clearly
see
why
the
embryos
of
mammals
*punct* ,
birds
*punct* ,
reptiles
*punct* ,
and
fishes
should
be
so
closely
alike
*punct* ,
and
should
be
so
unlike
the
adult
forms
*punct* .
*break*
we
may
cease
marvelling
at
the
embryo
of
an
air-breathing
mammal
or
bird
having
branchial
slits
and
arteries
running
in
loops
*punct* ,
like
those
in
a
fish
which
has
to
breathe
the
air
dissolved
in
water
*punct* ,
by
the
aid
of
well-developed
branchiae
*punct* .
*break*
disuse
*punct* ,
aided
sometimes
by
natural
selection
*punct* ,
will
often
tend
to
reduce
an
organ
*punct* ,
when
it
has
become
useless
by
changed
habits
or
under
changed
conditions
of
life
*punct* ;
and
we
can
clearly
understand
on
this
view
the
meaning
of
rudimentary
organs
*punct* .
*break*
but
disuse
and
selection
will
generally
act
on
each
creature
*punct* ,
when
it
has
come
to
maturity
and
has
to
play
its
full
part
in
the
struggle
for
existence
*punct* ,
and
will
thus
have
little
power
of
acting
on
an
organ
during
early
life
*punct* ;
hence
the
organ
will
not
be
much
reduced
or
rendered
rudimentary
at
this
early
age
*punct* .
*break*
the
calf
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
has
inherited
teeth
*punct* ,
which
never
cut
through
the
gums
of
the
upper
jaw
*punct* ,
from
an
early
progenitor
having
well-developed
teeth
*punct* ;
and
we
may
believe
*punct* ,
that
the
teeth
in
the
mature
animal
were
reduced
*punct* ,
during
successive
generations
*punct* ,
by
disuse
or
by
the
tongue
and
palate
having
been
fitted
by
natural
selection
to
browse
without
their
aid
*punct* ;
whereas
in
the
calf
*punct* ,
the
teeth
have
been
left
untouched
by
selection
or
disuse
*punct* ,
and
on
the
principle
of
inheritance
at
corresponding
ages
have
been
inherited
from
a
remote
period
to
the
present
day
*punct* .
*break*
on
the
view
of
each
organic
being
and
each
separate
organ
having
been
specially
created
*punct* ,
how
utterly
inexplicable
it
is
that
parts
*punct* ,
like
the
teeth
in
the
embryonic
calf
or
like
the
shrivelled
wings
under
the
soldered
wing-covers
of
some
beetles
*punct* ,
should
thus
so
frequently
bear
the
plain
stamp
of
inutility
*punct* !
*break*
nature
may
be
said
to
have
taken
pains
to
reveal
*punct* ,
by
rudimentary
organs
and
by
homologous
structures
*punct* ,
her
scheme
of
modification
*punct* ,
which
it
seems
that
we
wilfully
will
not
understand
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
now
recapitulated
the
chief
facts
and
considerations
which
have
thoroughly
convinced
me
that
species
have
changed
*punct* ,
and
are
still
slowly
changing
by
the
preservation
and
accumulation
of
successive
slight
favourable
variations
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
it
may
be
asked
*punct* ,
have
all
the
most
eminent
living
naturalists
and
geologists
rejected
this
view
of
the
mutability
of
species
*punct* ?
*break*
it
cannot
be
asserted
that
organic
beings
in
a
state
of
nature
are
subject
to
no
variation
*punct* ;
it
cannot
be
proved
that
the
amount
of
variation
in
the
course
of
long
ages
is
a
limited
quantity
*punct* ;
no
clear
distinction
has
been
*punct* ,
or
can
be
*punct* ,
drawn
between
species
and
well-marked
varieties
*punct* .
*break*
it
cannot
be
maintained
that
species
when
intercrossed
are
invariably
sterile
*punct* ,
and
varieties
invariably
fertile
*punct* ;
or
that
sterility
is
a
special
endowment
and
sign
of
creation
*punct* .
*break*
the
belief
that
species
were
immutable
productions
was
almost
unavoidable
as
long
as
the
history
of
the
world
was
thought
to
be
of
short
duration
*punct* ;
and
now
that
we
have
acquired
some
idea
of
the
lapse
of
time
*punct* ,
we
are
too
apt
to
assume
*punct* ,
without
proof
*punct* ,
that
the
geological
record
is
so
perfect
that
it
would
have
afforded
us
plain
evidence
of
the
mutation
of
species
*punct* ,
if
they
had
undergone
mutation
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
chief
cause
of
our
natural
unwillingness
to
admit
that
one
species
has
given
birth
to
other
and
distinct
species
*punct* ,
is
that
we
are
always
slow
in
admitting
any
great
change
of
which
we
do
not
see
the
intermediate
steps
*punct* .
*break*
the
difficulty
is
the
same
as
that
felt
by
so
many
geologists
*punct* ,
when
lyell
first
insisted
that
long
lines
of
inland
cliffs
had
been
formed
*punct* ,
and
great
valleys
excavated
*punct* ,
by
the
slow
action
of
the
coast-waves
*punct* .
*break*
the
mind
cannot
possibly
grasp
the
full
meaning
of
the
term
of
a
hundred
million
years
*punct* ;
it
cannot
add
up
and
perceive
the
full
effects
of
many
slight
variations
*punct* ,
accumulated
during
an
almost
infinite
number
of
generations
*punct* .
*break*
although
i
am
fully
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
views
given
in
this
volume
under
the
form
of
an
abstract
*punct* ,
i
by
no
means
expect
to
convince
experienced
naturalists
whose
minds
are
stocked
with
a
multitude
of
facts
all
viewed
*punct* ,
during
a
long
course
of
years
*punct* ,
from
a
point
of
view
directly
opposite
to
mine
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
so
easy
to
hide
our
ignorance
under
such
expressions
as
the
plan
of
creation
*punct* ,
unity
of
design
*punct* ,
&
c.
*punct* ,
and
to
think
that
we
give
an
explanation
when
we
only
restate
a
fact
*punct* .
*break*
any
one
whose
disposition
leads
him
to
attach
more
weight
to
unexplained
difficulties
than
to
the
explanation
of
a
certain
number
of
facts
will
certainly
reject
my
theory
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
naturalists
*punct* ,
endowed
with
much
flexibility
of
mind
*punct* ,
and
who
have
already
begun
to
doubt
on
the
immutability
of
species
*punct* ,
may
be
influenced
by
this
volume
*punct* ;
but
i
look
with
confidence
to
the
future
*punct* ,
to
young
and
rising
naturalists
*punct* ,
who
will
be
able
to
view
both
sides
of
the
question
with
impartiality
*punct* .
*break*
whoever
is
led
to
believe
that
species
are
mutable
will
do
good
service
by
conscientiously
expressing
his
conviction
*punct* ;
for
only
thus
can
the
load
of
prejudice
by
which
this
subject
is
overwhelmed
be
removed
*punct* .
*break*
several
eminent
naturalists
have
of
late
published
their
belief
that
a
multitude
of
reputed
species
in
each
genus
are
not
real
species
*punct* ;
but
that
other
species
are
real
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
have
been
independently
created
*punct* .
*break*
this
seems
to
me
a
strange
conclusion
to
arrive
at
*punct* .
*break*
they
admit
that
a
multitude
of
forms
*punct* ,
which
till
lately
they
themselves
thought
were
special
creations
*punct* ,
and
which
are
still
thus
looked
at
by
the
majority
of
naturalists
*punct* ,
and
which
consequently
have
every
external
characteristic
feature
of
true
species,
*punct* ,
they
admit
that
these
have
been
produced
by
variation
*punct* ,
but
they
refuse
to
extend
the
same
view
to
other
and
very
slightly
different
forms
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
they
do
not
pretend
that
they
can
define
*punct* ,
or
even
conjecture
*punct* ,
which
are
the
created
forms
of
life
*punct* ,
and
which
are
those
produced
by
secondary
laws
*punct* .
*break*
they
admit
variation
as
a
vera
causa
in
one
case
*punct* ,
they
arbitrarily
reject
it
in
another
*punct* ,
without
assigning
any
distinction
in
the
two
cases
*punct* .
*break*
the
day
will
come
when
this
will
be
given
as
a
curious
illustration
of
the
blindness
of
preconceived
opinion
*punct* .
*break*
these
authors
seem
no
more
startled
at
a
miraculous
act
of
creation
than
at
an
ordinary
birth
*punct* .
*break*
but
do
they
really
believe
that
at
innumerable
periods
in
the
earth's
history
certain
elemental
atoms
have
been
commanded
suddenly
to
flash
into
living
tissues
*punct* ?
*break*
do
they
believe
that
at
each
supposed
act
of
creation
one
individual
or
many
were
produced
*punct* ?
*break*
were
all
the
infinitely
numerous
kinds
of
animals
and
plants
created
as
eggs
or
seed
*punct* ,
or
as
full
grown
*punct* ?
*break*
and
in
the
case
of
mammals
*punct* ,
were
they
created
bearing
the
false
marks
of
nourishment
from
the
mother's
womb
*punct* ?
*break*
although
naturalists
very
properly
demand
a
full
explanation
of
every
difficulty
from
those
who
believe
in
the
mutability
of
species
*punct* ,
on
their
own
side
they
ignore
the
whole
subject
of
the
first
appearance
of
species
in
what
they
consider
reverent
silence
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
be
asked
how
far
i
extend
the
doctrine
of
the
modification
of
species
*punct* .
*break*
the
question
is
difficult
to
answer
*punct* ,
because
the
more
distinct
the
forms
are
which
we
may
consider
*punct* ,
by
so
much
the
arguments
fall
away
in
force
*punct* .
*break*
but
some
arguments
of
the
greatest
weight
extend
very
far
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
members
of
whole
classes
can
be
connected
together
by
chains
of
affinities
*punct* ,
and
all
can
be
classified
on
the
same
principle
*punct* ,
in
groups
subordinate
to
groups
*punct* .
*break*
fossil
remains
sometimes
tend
to
fill
up
very
wide
intervals
between
existing
orders
*punct* .
*break*
organs
in
a
rudimentary
condition
plainly
show
that
an
early
progenitor
had
the
organ
in
a
fully
developed
state
*punct* ;
and
this
in
some
instances
necessarily
implies
an
enormous
amount
of
modification
in
the
descendants
*punct* .
*break*
throughout
whole
classes
various
structures
are
formed
on
the
same
pattern
*punct* ,
and
at
an
embryonic
age
the
species
closely
resemble
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
i
cannot
doubt
that
the
theory
of
descent
with
modification
embraces
all
the
members
of
the
same
class
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
that
animals
have
descended
from
at
most
only
four
or
five
progenitors
*punct* ,
and
plants
from
an
equal
or
lesser
number
*punct* .
*break*
analogy
would
lead
me
one
step
further
*punct* ,
namely
*punct* ,
to
the
belief
that
all
animals
and
plants
have
descended
from
some
one
prototype
*punct* .
*break*
but
analogy
may
be
a
deceitful
guide
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
all
living
things
have
much
in
common
*punct* ,
in
their
chemical
composition
*punct* ,
their
germinal
vesicles
*punct* ,
their
cellular
structure
*punct* ,
and
their
laws
of
growth
and
reproduction
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
this
even
in
so
trifling
a
circumstance
as
that
the
same
poison
often
similarly
affects
plants
and
animals
*punct* ;
or
that
the
poison
secreted
by
the
gall-fly
produces
monstrous
growths
on
the
wild
rose
or
oak-tree
*punct* .
*break*
therefore
i
should
infer
from
analogy
that
probably
all
the
organic
beings
which
have
ever
lived
on
this
earth
have
descended
from
some
one
primordial
form
*punct* ,
into
which
life
was
first
breathed
*punct* .
*break*
when
the
views
entertained
in
this
volume
on
the
origin
of
species
*punct* ,
or
when
analogous
views
are
generally
admitted
*punct* ,
we
can
dimly
foresee
that
there
will
be
a
considerable
revolution
in
natural
history
*punct* .
*break*
systematists
will
be
able
to
pursue
their
labours
as
at
present
*punct* ;
but
they
will
not
be
incessantly
haunted
by
the
shadowy
doubt
whether
this
or
that
form
be
in
essence
a
species
*punct* .
*break*
this
i
feel
sure
*punct* ,
and
i
speak
after
experience
*punct* ,
will
be
no
slight
relief
*punct* .
*break*
the
endless
disputes
whether
or
not
some
fifty
species
of
british
brambles
are
true
species
will
cease
*punct* .
*break*
systematists
will
have
only
to
decide
*punct* ,
not
that
this
will
be
easy
*punct* ,
whether
any
form
be
sufficiently
constant
and
distinct
from
other
forms
*punct* ,
to
be
capable
of
definition
*punct* ;
and
if
definable
*punct* ,
whether
the
differences
be
sufficiently
important
to
deserve
a
specific
name
*punct* .
*break*
this
latter
point
will
become
a
far
more
essential
consideration
than
it
is
at
present
*punct* ;
for
differences
*punct* ,
however
slight
*punct* ,
between
any
two
forms
*punct* ,
if
not
blended
by
intermediate
gradations
*punct* ,
are
looked
at
by
most
naturalists
as
sufficient
to
raise
both
forms
to
the
rank
of
species
*punct* .
*break*
hereafter
we
shall
be
compelled
to
acknowledge
that
the
only
distinction
between
species
and
well-marked
varieties
is
*punct* ,
that
the
latter
are
known
*punct* ,
or
believed
*punct* ,
to
be
connected
at
the
present
day
by
intermediate
gradations
*punct* ,
whereas
species
were
formerly
thus
connected
*punct* .
*break*
hence
*punct* ,
without
quite
rejecting
the
consideration
of
the
present
existence
of
intermediate
gradations
between
any
two
forms
*punct* ,
we
shall
be
led
to
weigh
more
carefully
and
to
value
higher
the
actual
amount
of
difference
between
them
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
quite
possible
that
forms
now
generally
acknowledged
to
be
merely
varieties
may
hereafter
be
thought
worthy
of
specific
names
*punct* ,
as
with
the
primrose
and
cowslip
*punct* ;
and
in
this
case
scientific
and
common
language
will
come
into
accordance
*punct* .
*break*
in
short
*punct* ,
we
shall
have
to
treat
species
in
the
same
manner
as
those
naturalists
treat
genera
*punct* ,
who
admit
that
genera
are
merely
artificial
combinations
made
for
convenience
*punct* .
*break*
this
may
not
be
a
cheering
prospect
*punct* ;
but
we
shall
at
least
be
freed
from
the
vain
search
for
the
undiscovered
and
undiscoverable
essence
of
the
term
species
*punct* .
*break*
the
other
and
more
general
departments
of
natural
history
will
rise
greatly
in
interest
*punct* .
*break*
the
terms
used

morphology

will
cease
to

metaphorical
*punct* ,

have
a
plain
signification
*punct* .
*break*
when
we
no
longer
look
at
an
organic
being
as
a
savage
looks
at
a
ship
*punct* ,
as
at
something
wholly
beyond
his
comprehension
*punct* ;
when
we
regard
every
production
of
nature
as
one
which
has
had
a
history
*punct* ;
when
we
contemplate
every
complex
structure

instinct
as
the
summing
up
of
many
contrivances
*punct* ,
each
useful
to
the
possessor
*punct* ,
nearly
in
the

the

*break*
a

subject
for
study
than
one
more
species
added
to
the
infinitude

already

our
classifications

come
to

genealogies

the

classifying
will

our
natural
genealogies

by
characters

the

we

security
the

of
these

by
a
comparison

succeeding
organic

*punct* .
*break*
we
must
be
cautious
in
attempting
to
correlate
as
strictly
contemporaneous
two
formations

which
include
few
identical
species
*punct* ,
by
the
general
succession
of
their
forms

*break*
as
species
are
produced

exterminated
by
slowly
acting
and
still
existing
causes

and
not
by
miraculous
acts
of
creation
and
by
catastrophes
*punct* ;
and
as
the
most
important
of
all
causes
of
organic
change
is
one
which
is
almost
independent
of
altered
and
perhaps
suddenly
altered
physical

improvement

it
follows
*punct* ,
that
the
amount
of
organic
change
in
the
fossils
of
consecutive
formations
probably
serves
as
a
fair
measure
of
the
lapse

actual
time

*break*
a
number
of
species
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
keeping
in

might
remain
for
a
long

unchanged

whilst
within
this

period
*punct* ,
several
of
these
species
*punct* ,
by
migrating
into
new
countries
and
coming
into
competition
with
foreign
associates
*punct* ,
might
become
modified
*punct* ;
so

we
must
not
overrate
the
accuracy
of
organic
change
as
a
measure
of
time
*punct* .
*break*
during
early
periods
of
the
earth's
history
*punct* ,
when
the
forms
of
life
were
probably
fewer
and
simpler
*punct* ,
the
rate
of
change
was
probably
slower
*punct* ;
and
at
the
first
dawn
of
life
*punct* ,
when
very
few
forms
of
the
simplest
structure
existed
*punct* ,
the
rate

change
may
have
been
slow

quite
incomprehensible

will

be
recognised
as
a

fragment

with
the
ages
which
have
elapsed
since
the
first
creature

the
progenitor
of
innumerable
extinct

was

thrown
on
the
origin
of

his

*break*
authors
of
the
highest
eminence
seem
to
be
fully
satisfied
with
the
view
that
each
species
has
been
independently
created
*punct* .
*break*
to
my
mind
it
accords
better
with
what
we
know
of
the
laws
impressed
on
matter
by
the
creator
*punct* ,
that
the
production
and
extinction
of
the
past
and
present
inhabitants
of
the
world
should
have
been
due
to
secondary
causes
*punct* ,
like
those
determining
the
birth
and
death
of
the
individual
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
view
all
beings
not
as
special
creations
*punct* ,
but
as
the
lineal
descendants
of
some
few
beings
which
lived
long
before
the
first
bed
of
the
silurian
system
was
deposited
*punct* ,
they
seem
to
me
to
become
ennobled
*punct* .
*break*
judging
from
the
past
*punct* ,
we
may
safely
infer
that
not
one
living
species
will
transmit
its
unaltered
likeness
to
a
distant
futurity
*punct* .
*break*
and
of
the
species
now
living
very
few
will
transmit
progeny
of
any
kind
to
a
far
distant
futurity
*punct* ;
for
the
manner
in
which
all
organic
beings
are
grouped
*punct* ,
shows
that
the
greater
number
of
species
of
each
genus
*punct* ,
and
all
the
species
of
many
genera
*punct* ,
have
left
no
descendants
*punct* ,
but
have
become
utterly
extinct
*punct* .
*break*
we
can
so
far
take
a
prophetic
glance
into
futurity
as
to
foretel
that
it
will
be
the
common
and
widely-spread
species
*punct* ,
belonging
to
the
larger
and
dominant
groups
*punct* ,
which
will
ultimately
prevail
and
procreate
new
and
dominant
species
*punct* .
*break*
as
all
the
living
forms
of
life
are
the
lineal
descendants
of
those
which
lived
long
before
the
silurian
epoch
*punct* ,
we
may
feel
certain
that
the
ordinary
succession
by
generation
has
never
once
been
broken
*punct* ,
and
that
no
cataclysm
has
desolated
the
whole
world
*punct* .
*break*
hence
we
may
look
with
some
confidence
to
a
secure
future
of
equally
inappreciable
length
*punct* .
*break*
and
as
natural
selection
works
solely
by
and
for
the
good
of
each
being
*punct* ,
all
corporeal
and
mental
endowments
will
tend
to
progress
towards
perfection

*break*
it
is
interesting
to
contemplate
an
entangled
bank
*punct* ,
clothed
with
many
plants

kinds
*punct* ,
with
birds
singing
on

bushes
*punct* ,
with
various
insects
flitting
about
*punct* ,
and
with
worms
crawling
through
the
damp
earth
*punct* ,
and
to
reflect
that
these
elaborately
constructed
forms
*punct* ,
so
different
from
each
other
*punct* ,
and
dependent
on
each
other
in
so
complex
a
manner
*punct* ,
have
all
been
produced
by
laws
acting
around
us
*punct* .
*break*
these
laws
*punct* ,
taken
in
the
largest
sense
*punct* ,
being
growth
with
reproduction
*punct* ;
inheritance
which
is
almost
implied
by
reproduction
*punct* ;
variability
from
the
indirect
and
direct
action
of
the
external
conditions
of
life
*punct* ,
and
from
use
and
disuse
*punct* ;
a
ratio
of
increase
so
high
as
to
lead
to
a
struggle
for
life
*punct* ,
and
as
a
consequence
to
natural
selection
*punct* ,
entailing
divergence
of
character
and
the
extinction
of
less-improved
forms

*break*
thus

war

from
famine

the
