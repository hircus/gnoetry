title: The Time Machine
author: H. G. Wells
the
time
traveller
*punct* ,
for
so
it
will
be
convenient
to
speak
of
him
*punct* ,
was
expounding
a
recondite
matter
to
us
*punct* .
*break*
his
grey
eyes
shone
and
twinkled
*punct* ,
and
his
usually
pale
face
was
flushed
and
animated
*punct* .
*break*
the
fire
burned
brightly
*punct* ,
and
the
soft
radiance
of
the
incandescent
lights
in
the
lilies
of
silver
caught
the
bubbles
that
flashed
and
passed
in
our
glasses
*punct* .
*break*
our
chairs
*punct* ,
being
his
patents
*punct* ,
embraced
and
caressed
us
rather
than
submitted
to
be
sat
upon
*punct* ,
and
there
was
that
luxurious
after-dinner
atmosphere
when
thought
roams
gracefully
free
of
the
trammels
of
precision
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
put
it
to
us
in
this
way
*mdash*
marking
the
points
with
a
lean
forefinger
*mdash*
as
we
sat
and
lazily
admired
his
earnestness
over
this
new
paradox
*punct* ,
as
we
thought
it:
*punct* ,
and
his
fecundity
*punct* .
*break*
you
must
follow
me
carefully
*punct* .
*break*
i
shall
have
to
controvert
one
or
two
ideas
that
are
almost
universally
accepted
*punct* .
*break*
the
geometry
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
they
taught
you
at
school
is
founded
on
a
misconception
*punct* .
*break*
is
not
that
rather
a
large
thing
to
expect
us
to
begin
upon
*punct* ?
*break*
said
filby
*punct* ,
an
argumentative
person
with
red
hair
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
mean
to
ask
you
to
accept
anything
without
reasonable
ground
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
soon
admit
as
much
as
i
need
from
you
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
of
course
that
a
mathematical
line
*punct* ,
a
line
of
thickness
nil
*punct* ,
has
no
real
existence
*punct* .
*break*
they
taught
you
that
*punct* ?
*break*
neither
has
a
mathematical
plane
*punct* .
*break*
these
things
are
mere
abstractions
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
all
right
*punct* ,
said
the
psychologist
*punct* .
*break*
nor
*punct* ,
having
only
length
*punct* ,
breadth
*punct* ,
and
thickness
*punct* ,
can
a
cube
have
a
real
existence
*punct* .
*break*
there
i
object
*punct* ,
said
filby
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
a
solid
body
may
exist
*punct* .
*break*
all
real
things
*mdash*
so
most
people
think
*punct* .
*break*
but
wait
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
can
an
instantaneous
cube
exist
*punct* ?
*break*
don't
follow
you
*punct* ,
said
filby
*punct* .
*break*
can
a
cube
that
does
not
last
for
any
time
at
all
*punct* ,
have
a
real
existence
*punct* ?
*break*
filby
became
pensive
*punct* .
*break*
clearly
*punct* ,
the
time
traveller
proceeded
*punct* ,
any
real
body
must
have
extension
in
four
directions
*punct* :
it
must
have
length
*punct* ,
breadth
*punct* ,
thickness
*punct* ,
and
*mdash*
duration
*punct* .
*break*
but
through
a
natural
infirmity
of
the
flesh
*punct* ,
which
i
will
explain
to
you
in
a
moment
*punct* ,
we
incline
to
overlook
this
fact
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
really
four
dimensions
*punct* ,
three
which
we
call
the
three
planes
of
space
*punct* ,
and
a
fourth
*punct* ,
time
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
a
tendency
to
draw
an
unreal
distinction
between
the
former
three
dimensions
and
the
latter
*punct* ,
because
it
happens
that
our
consciousness
moves
intermittently
in
one
direction
along
the
latter
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
our
lives
*punct* .
*break*
that
*punct* ,
said
a
very
young
man
*punct* ,
making
spasmodic
efforts
to
relight
his
cigar
over
the
lamp
*punct* ;
that
*punct* ...
very
clear
indeed
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
it
is
very
remarkable
that
this
is
so
extensively
overlooked
*punct* ,
continued
the
time
traveller
*punct* ,
with
a
slight
accession
of
cheerfulness
*punct* .
*break*
really
this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
fourth
dimension
*punct* ,
though
some
people
who
talk
about
the
fourth
dimension
do
not
know
they
mean
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
only
another
way
of
looking
at
time
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
difference
between
time
and
any
of
the
three
dimensions
of
space
except
that
our
consciousness
moves
along
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
some
foolish
people
have
got
hold
of
the
wrong
side
of
that
idea
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
all
heard
what
they
have
to
say
about
this
fourth
dimension
*punct* ?
*break*
i
have
not
*punct* ,
said
the
provincial
mayor
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
simply
this
*punct* .
*break*
that
space
*punct* ,
as
our
mathematicians
have
it
*punct* ,
is
spoken
of
as
having
three
dimensions
*punct* ,
which
one
may
call
length
*punct* ,
breadth
*punct* ,
and
thickness
*punct* ,
and
is
always
definable
by
reference
to
three
planes
*punct* ,
each
at
right
angles
to
the
others
*punct* .
*break*
but
some
philosophical
people
have
been
asking
why
three
dimensions
particularly
*mdash*
why
not
another
direction
at
right
angles
to
the
other
three
*punct* ?
*break*
*mdash*
and
have
even
tried
to
construct
a
four-dimension
geometry
*punct* .
*break*
professor
simon
newcomb
was
expounding
this
to
the
new
york
mathematical
society
only
a
month
or
so
ago
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
how
on
a
flat
surface
*punct* ,
which
has
only
two
dimensions
*punct* ,
we
can
represent
a
figure
of
a
three-dimensional
solid
*punct* ,
and
similarly
they
think
that
by
models
of
thee
dimensions
they
could
represent
one
of
four
*mdash*
if
they
could
master
the
perspective
of
the
thing
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
so
*punct* ,
murmured
the
provincial
mayor
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
knitting
his
brows
*punct* ,
he
lapsed
into
an
introspective
state
*punct* ,
his
lips
moving
as
one
who
repeats
mystic
words
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
i
think
i
see
it
now
*punct* ,
he
said
after
some
time
*punct* ,
brightening
in
a
quite
transitory
manner
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
i
do
not
mind
telling
you
i
have
been
at
work
upon
this
geometry
of
four
dimensions
for
some
time
*punct* .
*break*
some
of
my
results
are
curious
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
here
is
a
portrait
of
a
man
at
eight
years
old
*punct* ,
another
at
fifteen
*punct* ,
another
at
seventeen
*punct* ,
another
at
twenty-three
*punct* ,
and
so
on
*punct* .
*break*
all
these
are
evidently
sections
*punct* ,
as
it
were
*punct* ,
three-dimensional
representations
of
his
four-dimensioned
being
*punct* ,
which
is
a
fixed
and
unalterable
thing
*punct* .
*break*
scientific
people
*punct* ,
proceeded
the
time
traveller
*punct* ,
after
the
pause
required
for
the
proper
assimilation
of
this
*punct* ,
know
very
well
that
time
is
only
a
kind
of
space
*punct* .
*break*
here
is
a
popular
scientific
diagram
*punct* ,
a
weather
record
*punct* .
*break*
this
line
i
trace
with
my
finger
shows
the
movement
of
the
barometer
*punct* .
*break*
yesterday
it
was
so
high
*punct* ,
yesterday
night
it
fell
*punct* ,
then
this
morning
it
rose
again
*punct* ,
and
so
gently
upward
to
here
*punct* .
*break*
surely
the
mercury
did
not
trace
this
line
in
any
of
the
dimensions
of
space
generally
recognized
*punct* ?
*break*
but
certainly
it
traced
such
a
line
*punct* ,
and
that
line
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
we
must
conclude
was
along
the
time-dimension
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
said
the
medical
man
*punct* ,
staring
hard
at
a
coal
in
the
fire
*punct* ,
if
time
is
really
only
a
fourth
dimension
of
space
*punct* ,
why
is
it
*punct* ,
and
why
has
it
always
been
*punct* ,
regarded
as
something
different
*punct* ?
*break*
and
why
cannot
we
move
in
time
as
we
move
about
in
the
other
dimensions
of
space
*punct* ?
*break*
the
time
traveller
smiled
*punct* .
*break*
are
you
sure
we
can
move
freely
in
space
*punct* ?
*break*
right
and
left
we
can
go
*punct* ,
backward
and
forward
freely
enough
*punct* ,
and
men
always
have
done
so
*punct* .
*break*
i
admit
we
move
freely
in
two
dimensions
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
about
up
and
down
*punct* ?
*break*
gravitation
limits
us
there
*punct* .
*break*
not
exactly
*punct* ,
said
the
medical
man
*punct* .
*break*
there
are
balloons
*punct* .
*break*
but
before
the
balloons
*punct* ,
save
for
spasmodic
jumping
and
the
inequalities
of
the
surface
*punct* ,
man
had
no
freedom
of
vertical
movement
*punct* .
*break*
still
they
could
move
a
little
up
and
down
*punct* ,
said
the
medical
man
*punct* .
*break*
easier
*punct* ,
far
easier
down
than
up
*punct* .
*break*
and
you
cannot
move
at
all
in
time
*punct* ,
you
cannot
get
away
from
the
present
moment
*punct* .
*break*
my
dear
sir
*punct* ,
that
is
just
where
you
are
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
just
where
the
whole
world
has
gone
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
always
getting
away
from
the
present
movement
*punct* .
*break*
our
mental
existences
*punct* ,
which
are
immaterial
and
have
no
dimensions
*punct* ,
are
passing
along
the
time-dimension
with
a
uniform
velocity
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
*punct* .
*break*
just
as
we
should
travel
down
if
we
began
our
existence
fifty
miles
above
the
earth's
surface
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
great
difficulty
is
this
*punct* ,
interrupted
the
psychologist
*punct* .
*break*
you
can
move
about
in
all
directions
of
space
*punct* ,
but
you
cannot
move
about
in
time
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
the
germ
of
my
great
discovery
*punct* .
*break*
but
you
are
wrong
to
say
that
we
cannot
move
about
in
time
*punct* .
*break*
for
instance
*punct* ,
if
i
am
recalling
an
incident
very
vividly
i
go
back
to
the
instant
of
its
occurrence
*punct* :
i
become
absent-minded
*punct* ,
as
you
say
*punct* .
*break*
i
jump
back
for
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
we
have
no
means
of
staying
back
for
any
length
of
time
*punct* ,
any
more
than
a
savage
or
an
animal
has
of
staying
six
feet
above
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
civilized
man
is
better
off
than
the
savage
in
this
respect
*punct* .
*break*
he
can
go
up
against
gravitation
in
a
balloon
*punct* ,
and
why
should
he
not
hope
that
ultimately
he
may
be
able
to
stop
or
accelerate
his
drift
along
the
time-dimension
*punct* ,
or
even
turn
about
and
travel
the
other
way
*punct* ?
*break*
oh
*punct* ,
this
*punct* ,
began
filby
*punct* ,
is
all
*mdash*
why
not
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
time
traveller
*punct* .
*break*
it's
against
reason
*punct* ,
said
filby
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
time
traveller
*punct* .
*break*
you
can
show
black
is
white
by
argument
*punct* ,
said
filby
*punct* ,
but
you
will
never
convince
me
*punct* .
*break*
possibly
not
*punct* ,
said
the
time
traveller
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
you
begin
to
see
the
object
of
my
investigations
into
the
geometry
of
four
dimensions
*punct* .
*break*
long
ago
i
had
a
vague
inkling
of
a
machine
*mdash*
to
travel
through
time
*punct* !
*break*
exclaimed
the
very
young
man
*punct* .
*break*
that
shall
travel
indifferently
in
any
direction
of
space
and
time
*punct* ,
as
the
driver
determines
*punct* .
*break*
filby
contented
himself
with
laughter
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
have
experimental
verification
*punct* ,
said
the
time
traveller
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
remarkably
convenient
for
the
historian
*punct* ,
the
psychologist
suggested
*punct* .
*break*
one
might
travel
back
and
verify
the
accepted
account
of
the
battle
of
hastings
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* !
*break*
don't
you
think
you
would
attract
attention
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
medical
man
*punct* .
*break*
our
ancestors
had
no
great
tolerance
for
anachronisms
*punct* .
*break*
one
might
get
one's
greek
from
the
very
lips
of
homer
and
plato
*punct* ,
the
very
young
man
thought
*punct* .
*break*
in
which
case
they
would
certainly
plough
you
for
the
little-go
*punct* .
*break*
the
german
scholars
have
improved
greek
so
much
*punct* .
*break*
then
there
is
the
future
*punct* ,
said
the
very
young
man
*punct* .
*break*
one
might
invest
all
one's
money
*punct* ,
leave
it
to
accumulate
at
interest
*punct* ,
and
hurry
on
ahead
*punct* !
*break*
to
discover
a
society
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
erected
on
a
strictly
communistic
basis
*punct* .
*break*
of
all
the
wild
extravagant
theories
*punct* !
*break*
began
the
psychologist
*punct* .
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
so
it
seemed
to
me
*punct* ,
and
so
i
never
talked
of
it
until
*mdash*
experimental
verification
*punct* !
*break*
you
are
going
to
verify
that
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
filby
*punct* ,
who
was
getting
brain-weary
*punct* .
*break*
let's
see
your
experiment
anyhow
*punct* ,
said
the
psychologist
*punct* ,
though
it's
all
humbug
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
traveller
smiled
round
at
us
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
still
smiling
faintly
*punct* ,
and
with
his
hands
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
*punct* ,
he
walked
slowly
out
of
the
room
*punct* ,
and
we
heard
his
slippers
shuffling
down
the
long
passage
to
his
laboratory
*punct* .
*break*
the
psychologist
looked
at
us
*punct* .
*break*
i
wonder
what
he's
got
*punct* ?
*break*
some
sleight-of-hand
trick
or
other
*punct* ,
said
the
medical
man
*punct* ,
and
filby
tried
to
tell
us
about
a
conjurer
he
had
seen
at
burslem
*punct* ;
but
before
he
had
finished
his
preface
the
time
traveller
came
back
*punct* ,
and
filby's
anecdote
collapsed
*punct* .
*break*
the
thing
the
time
traveller
held
in
his
hand
was
a
glittering
metallic
framework
*punct* ,
scarcely
larger
than
a
small
clock
*punct* ,
and
very
delicately
made
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
ivory
in
it
*punct* ,
and
some
transparent
crystalline
substance
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
i
must
be
explicit
*punct* ,
for
this
that
follows
*mdash*
unless
his
explanation
is
to
be
accepted
*mdash*
is
an
absolutely
unaccountable
thing
*punct* .
*break*
he
took
one
of
the
small
octagonal
tables
that
were
scattered
about
the
room
*punct* ,
and
set
it
in
front
of
the
fire
*punct* ,
with
two
legs
on
the
hearthrug
*punct* .
*break*
on
this
table
he
placed
the
mechanism
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
drew
up
a
chair
*punct* ,
and
sat
down
*punct* .
*break*
the
only
other
object
on
the
table
was
a
small
shaded
lamp
*punct* ,
the
bright
light
of
which
fell
upon
the
model
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
also
perhaps
a
dozen
candles
about
*punct* ,
two
in
brass
candlesticks
upon
the
mantel
and
several
in
sconces
*punct* ,
so
that
the
room
was
brilliantly
illuminated
*punct* .
*break*
i
sat
in
a
low
arm-chair
nearest
the
fire
*punct* ,
and
i
drew
this
forward
so
as
to
be
almost
between
the
time
traveller
and
the
fireplace
*punct* .
*break*
filby
sat
behind
him
*punct* ,
looking
over
his
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
the
medical
man
and
the
provincial
mayor
watched
him
in
profile
from
the
right
*punct* ,
the
psychologist
from
the
left
*punct* .
*break*
the
very
young
man
stood
behind
the
psychologist
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
all
on
the
alert
*punct* .
*break*
it
appears
incredible
to
me
that
any
kind
of
trick
*punct* ,
however
subtly
conceived
and
however
adroitly
done
*punct* ,
could
have
been
played
upon
us
under
these
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
traveller
looked
at
us
*punct* ,
and
then
at
the
mechanism
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
psychologist
*punct* .
*break*
this
little
affair
*punct* ,
said
the
time
traveller
*punct* ,
resting
his
elbows
upon
the
table
and
pressing
his
hands
together
above
the
apparatus
*punct* ,
is
only
a
model
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
my
plan
for
a
machine
to
travel
through
time
*punct* .
*break*
you
will
notice
that
it
looks
singularly
askew
*punct* ,
and
that
there
is
an
odd
twinkling
appearance
about
this
bar
*punct* ,
as
though
it
was
in
some
way
unreal
*punct* .
*break*
he
pointed
to
the
part
with
his
finger
*punct* .
*break*
also
*punct* ,
here
is
one
little
white
lever
*punct* ,
and
here
is
another
*punct* .
*break*
the
medical
man
got
up
out
of
his
chair
and
peered
into
the
thing
*punct* .
*break*
it's
beautifully
made
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
it
took
two
years
to
make
*punct* ,
retorted
the
time
traveller
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
when
we
had
all
imitated
the
action
of
the
medical
man
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* :
now
i
want
you
clearly
to
understand
that
this
lever
*punct* ,
being
pressed
over
*punct* ,
sends
the
machine
gliding
into
the
future
*punct* ,
and
this
other
reverses
the
motion
*punct* .
*break*
this
saddle
represents
the
seat
of
a
time
traveller
*punct* .
*break*
presently
i
am
going
to
press
the
lever
*punct* ,
and
off
the
machine
will
go
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
vanish
*punct* ,
pass
into
future
time
*punct* ,
and
disappear
*punct* .
*break*
have
a
good
look
at
the
thing
*punct* .
*break*
look
at
the
table
too
*punct* ,
and
satisfy
yourselves
there
is
no
trickery
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
want
to
waste
this
model
*punct* ,
and
then
be
told
i'm
a
quack
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
minute's
pause
perhaps
*punct* .
*break*
the
psychologist
seemed
about
to
speak
to
me
*punct* ,
but
changed
his
mind
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
time
traveller
put
forth
his
finger
towards
the
lever
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
he
said
suddenly
*punct* .
*break*
lend
me
your
hand
*punct* .
*break*
and
turning
to
the
psychologist
*punct* ,
he
took
that
individual's
hand
in
his
own
and
told
him
to
put
out
his
forefinger
*punct* .
*break*
so
that
it
was
the
psychologist
himself
who
sent
forth
the
model
time
machine
on
its
interminable
voyage
*punct* .
*break*
we
all
saw
the
lever
turn
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
absolutely
certain
there
was
no
trickery
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
breath
of
wind
*punct* ,
and
the
lamp
flame
jumped
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
the
candles
on
the
mantel
was
blown
out
*punct* ,
and
the
little
machine
suddenly
swung
round
*punct* ,
became
indistinct
*punct* ,
was
seen
as
a
ghost
for
a
second
perhaps
*punct* ,
as
an
eddy
of
faintly
glittering
brass
and
ivory
*punct* ;
and
it
was
gone
*mdash*
vanished
*punct* !
*break*
save
for
the
lamp
the
table
was
bare
*punct* .
*break*
everyone
was
silent
for
a
minute
*punct* .
*break*
then
filby
said
he
was
damned
*punct* .
*break*
the
psychologist
recovered
from
his
stupor
*punct* ,
and
suddenly
looked
under
the
table
*punct* .
*break*
at
that
the
time
traveller
laughed
cheerfully
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
*punct* ,
with
a
reminiscence
of
the
psychologist
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
getting
up
*punct* ,
he
went
to
the
tobacco
jar
on
the
mantel
*punct* ,
and
with
his
back
to
us
began
to
fill
his
pipe
*punct* .
*break*
we
stared
at
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
look
here
*punct* ,
said
the
medical
man
*punct* ,
are
you
in
earnest
about
this
*punct* ?
*break*
do
you
seriously
believe
that
that
machine
has
travelled
into
time
*punct* ?
*break*
certainly
*punct* ,
said
the
time
traveller
*punct* ,
stooping
to
light
a
spill
at
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
turned
*punct* ,
lighting
his
pipe
*punct* ,
to
look
at
the
psychologist's
face
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
the
psychologist
*punct* ,
to
show
that
he
was
not
unhinged
*punct* ,
helped
himself
to
a
cigar
and
tried
to
light
it
uncut.
*punct* ,
what
is
more
*punct* ,
i
have
a
big
machine
nearly
finished
in
there
*mdash*
he
indicated
the
laboratory
*mdash*
and
when
that
is
put
together
i
mean
to
have
a
journey
on
my
own
account
*punct* .
*break*
you
mean
to
say
that
that
machine
has
travelled
into
the
future
*punct* ?
*break*
into
the
future
or
the
past
*mdash*
i
don't
*punct* ,
for
certain
*punct* ,
know
which
*punct* .
*break*
after
an
interval
the
psychologist
had
an
inspiration
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
have
gone
into
the
past
if
it
has
gone
anywhere
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
said
the
time
traveller
*punct* .
*break*
because
i
presume
that
it
has
not
moved
in
space
*punct* ,
and
if
it
travelled
into
the
future
it
would
still
be
here
all
this
time
*punct* ,
since
it
must
have
travelled
through
this
time
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
if
it
travelled
into
the
past
it
would
have
been
visible
when
we
came
first
into
this
room
*punct* ;
and
last
thursday
when
we
were
here
*punct* ;
and
the
thursday
before
that
*punct* ;
and
so
forth
*punct* !
*break*
serious
objections
*punct* ,
remarked
the
provincial
mayor
*punct* ,
with
an
air
of
impartiality
*punct* ,
turning
towards
the
time
traveller
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
bit
*punct* ,
said
the
time
traveller
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
to
the
psychologist
*punct* :
you
think
*punct* .
*break*
you
can
explain
that
*punct* .
*break*
it's
presentation
below
the
threshold
*punct* ,
you
know
*punct* ,
diluted
presentation
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
*punct* ,
said
the
psychologist
*punct* ,
and
reassured
us
*punct* .
*break*
that's
a
simple
point
of
psychology
*punct* .
*break*
i
should
have
thought
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
it's
plain
enough
*punct* ,
and
helps
the
paradox
delightfully
*punct* .
*break*
we
cannot
see
it
*punct* ,
nor
can
we
appreciate
this
machine
*punct* ,
any
more
than
we
can
the
spoke
of
a
wheel
spinning
*punct* ,
or
a
bullet
flying
through
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
if
it
is
travelling
through
time
fifty
times
or
a
hundred
times
faster
than
we
are
*punct* ,
if
it
gets
through
a
minute
while
we
get
through
a
second
*punct* ,
the
impression
it
creates
will
of
course
be
only
one-fiftieth
or
one-hundredth
of
what
it
would
make
if
it
were
not
travelling
in
time
*punct* .
*break*
that's
plain
enough
*punct* .
*break*
he
passed
his
hand
through
the
space
in
which
the
machine
had
been
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
*punct* ,
laughing
*punct* .
*break*
we
sat
and
stared
at
the
vacant
table
for
a
minute
or
so
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
time
traveller
asked
us
what
we
thought
of
it
all
*punct* .
*break*
it
sounds
plausible
enough
to-night
*punct* ,
said
the
medical
man
*punct* ;
but
wait
until
to-morrow
*punct* .
*break*
wait
for
the
common
sense
of
the
morning
*punct* .
*break*
would
you
like
to
see
the
time
machine
itself
*punct* ?
*break*
asked
the
time
traveller
*punct* .
*break*
and
therewith
*punct* ,
taking
the
lamp
in
his
hand
*punct* ,
he
led
the
way
down
the
long
*punct* ,
draughty
corridor
to
his
laboratory
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
vividly
the
flickering
light
*punct* ,
his
queer
*punct* ,
broad
head
in
silhouette
*punct* ,
the
dance
of
the
shadows
*punct* ,
how
we
all
followed
him
*punct* ,
puzzled
but
incredulous
*punct* ,
and
how
there
in
the
laboratory
we
beheld
a
larger
edition
of
the
little
mechanism
which
we
had
seen
vanish
from
before
our
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
parts
were
of
nickel
*punct* ,
parts
of
ivory
*punct* ,
parts
had
certainly
been
filed
or
sawn
out
of
rock
crystal
*punct* .
*break*
the
thing
was
generally
complete
*punct* ,
but
the
twisted
crystalline
bars
lay
unfinished
upon
the
bench
beside
some
sheets
of
drawings
*punct* ,
and
i
took
one
up
for
a
better
look
at
it
*punct* .
*break*
quartz
it
seemed
to
be
*punct* .
*break*
look
here
*punct* ,
said
the
medical
man
*punct* ,
are
you
perfectly
serious
*punct* ?
*break*
or
is
this
a
trick
*mdash*
like
that
ghost
you
showed
us
last
christmas
*punct* ?
*break*
upon
that
machine
*punct* ,
said
the
time
traveller
*punct* ,
holding
the
lamp
aloft
*punct* ,
i
intend
to
explore
time
*punct* .
*break*
is
that
plain
*punct* ?
*break*
i
was
never
more
serious
in
my
life
*punct* .
*break*
none
of
us
quite
knew
how
to
take
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
caught
filby's
eye
over
the
shoulder
of
the
medical
man
*punct* ,
and
he
winked
at
me
solemnly
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
that
at
that
time
none
of
us
quite
believed
in
the
time
machine
*punct* .
*break*
the
fact
is
*punct* ,
the
time
traveller
was
one
of
those
men
who
are
too
clever
to
be
believed
*punct* :
you
never
felt
that
you
saw
all
round
him
*punct* ;
you
always
suspected
some
subtle
reserve
*punct* ,
some
ingenuity
in
ambush
*punct* ,
behind
his
lucid
frankness
*punct* .
*break*
had
filby
shown
the
model
and
explained
the
matter
in
the
time
traveller's
words
*punct* ,
we
should
have
shown
him
far
less
scepticism
*punct* .
*break*
for
we
should
have
perceived
his
motives
*punct* ;
a
pork
butcher
could
understand
filby
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
time
traveller
had
more
than
a
touch
of
whim
among
his
elements
*punct* ,
and
we
distrusted
him
*punct* .
*break*
things
that
would
have
made
the
frame
of
a
less
clever
man
seemed
tricks
in
his
hands
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
mistake
to
do
things
too
easily
*punct* .
*break*
the
serious
people
who
took
him
seriously
never
felt
quite
sure
of
his
deportment
*punct* ;
they
were
somehow
aware
that
trusting
their
reputations
for
judgment
with
him
was
like
furnishing
a
nursery
with
egg-shell
china
*punct* .
*break*
so
i
don't
think
any
of
us
said
very
much
about
time
travelling
in
the
interval
between
that
thursday
and
the
next
*punct* ,
though
its
odd
potentialities
ran
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* ,
in
most
of
our
minds
*punct* :
its
plausibility
*punct* ,
that
is
*punct* ,
its
practical
incredibleness
*punct* ,
the
curious
possibilities
of
anachronism
and
of
utter
confusion
it
suggested
*punct* .
*break*
for
my
own
part
*punct* ,
i
was
particularly
preoccupied
with
the
trick
of
the
model
*punct* .
*break*
that
i
remember
discussing
with
the
medical
man
*punct* ,
whom
i
met
on
friday
at
the
linnaean
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
he
had
seen
a
similar
thing
at
tubingen
*punct* ,
and
laid
considerable
stress
on
the
blowing
out
of
the
candle
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
the
trick
was
done
he
could
not
explain
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
thursday
i
went
again
to
richmond
*mdash*
i
suppose
i
was
one
of
the
time
traveller's
most
constant
guests
*mdash*
and
*punct* ,
arriving
late
*punct* ,
found
four
or
five
men
already
assembled
in
his
drawing-room
*punct* .
*break*
the
medical
man
was
standing
before
the
fire
with
a
sheet
of
paper
in
one
hand
and
his
watch
in
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
round
for
the
time
traveller
*punct* ,
and
*mdash*
it's
half-past
seven
now
*punct* ,
said
the
medical
man
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
we'd
better
have
dinner
*punct* ?
*break*
where's
*mdash*
*mdash*
*punct* ?
*break*
said
i
*punct* ,
naming
our
host
*punct* .
*break*
you've
just
come
*punct* ?
*break*
it's
rather
odd
*punct* .
*break*
he's
unavoidably
detained
*punct* .
*break*
he
asks
me
in
this
note
to
lead
off
with
dinner
at
seven
if
he's
not
back
*punct* .
*break*
says
he'll
explain
when
he
comes
*punct* .
*break*
it
seems
a
pity
to
let
the
dinner
spoil
*punct* ,
said
the
editor
of
a
well-known
daily
paper
*punct* ;
and
thereupon
the
doctor
rang
the
bell
*punct* .
*break*
the
psychologist
was
the
only
person
besides
the
doctor
and
myself
who
had
attended
the
previous
dinner
*punct* .
*break*
the
other
men
were
blank
*punct* ,
the
editor
aforementioned
*punct* ,
a
certain
journalist
*punct* ,
and
another
*mdash*
a
quiet
*punct* ,
shy
man
with
a
beard
*mdash*
whom
i
didn't
know
*punct* ,
and
who
*punct* ,
as
far
as
my
observation
went
*punct* ,
never
opened
his
mouth
all
the
evening
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
some
speculation
at
the
dinner-table
about
the
time
traveller's
absence
*punct* ,
and
i
suggested
time
travelling
*punct* ,
in
a
half-jocular
spirit
*punct* .
*break*
the
editor
wanted
that
explained
to
him
*punct* ,
and
the
psychologist
volunteered
a
wooden
account
of
the
ingenious
paradox
and
trick
we
had
witnessed
that
day
week
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
in
the
midst
of
his
exposition
when
the
door
from
the
corridor
opened
slowly
and
without
noise
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
facing
the
door
*punct* ,
and
saw
it
first
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
door
opened
wider
*punct* ,
and
the
time
traveller
stood
before
us
*punct* .
*break*
i
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
*punct* .
*break*
man
*punct* ,
what's
the
matter
*punct* ?
*break*
cried
the
medical
man
*punct* ,
who
saw
him
next
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
whole
tableful
turned
towards
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
in
an
amazing
plight
*punct* .
*break*
his
coat
was
dusty
and
dirty
*punct* ,
and
smeared
with
green
down
the
sleeves
*punct* ;
his
hair
disordered
*punct* ,
and
as
it
seemed
to
me
greyer
*mdash*
either
with
dust
and
dirt
or
because
its
colour
had
actually
faded
*punct* .
*break*
his
face
was
ghastly
pale
*punct* ;
his
chin
had
a
brown
cut
on
it
*mdash*
a
cut
half
healed
*punct* ;
his
expression
was
haggard
and
drawn
*punct* ,
as
by
intense
suffering
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
in
the
doorway
*punct* ,
as
if
he
had
been
dazzled
by
the
light
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
came
into
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
he
walked
with
just
such
a
limp
as
i
have
seen
in
footsore
tramps
*punct* .
*break*
we
stared
at
him
in
silence
*punct* ,
expecting
him
to
speak
*punct* .
*break*
he
said
not
a
word
*punct* ,
but
came
painfully
to
the
table
*punct* ,
and
made
a
motion
towards
the
wine
*punct* .
*break*
the
editor
filled
a
glass
of
champagne
*punct* ,
and
pushed
it
towards
him
*punct* .
*break*
he
drained
it
*punct* ,
and
it
seemed
to
do
him
good
*punct* :
for
he
looked
round
the
table
*punct* ,
and
the
ghost
of
his
old
smile
flickered
across
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
what
on
earth
have
you
been
up
to
*punct* ,
man
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
doctor
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
traveller
did
not
seem
to
hear
*punct* .
*break*
don't
let
me
disturb
you
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
with
a
certain
faltering
articulation
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
all
right
*punct* .
*break*
he
stopped
*punct* ,
held
out
his
glass
for
more
*punct* ,
and
took
it
off
at
a
draught
*punct* .
*break*
that's
good
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
his
eyes
grew
brighter
*punct* ,
and
a
faint
colour
came
into
his
cheeks
*punct* .
*break*
his
glance
flickered
over
our
faces
with
a
certain
dull
approval
*punct* ,
and
then
went
round
the
warm
and
comfortable
room
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
spoke
again
*punct* ,
still
as
it
were
feeling
his
way
among
his
words
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
going
to
wash
and
dress
*punct* ,
and
then
i'll
come
down
and
explain
things
*punct* ...
save
me
some
of
that
mutton
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
starving
for
a
bit
of
meat
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
across
at
the
editor
*punct* ,
who
was
a
rare
visitor
*punct* ,
and
hoped
he
was
all
right
*punct* .
*break*
the
editor
began
a
question
*punct* .
*break*
tell
you
presently
*punct* ,
said
the
time
traveller
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
*mdash*
funny
*punct* !
*break*
be
all
right
in
a
minute
*punct* .
*break*
he
put
down
his
glass
*punct* ,
and
walked
towards
the
staircase
door
*punct* .
*break*
again
i
remarked
his
lameness
and
the
soft
padding
sound
of
his
footfall
*punct* ,
and
standing
up
in
my
place
*punct* ,
i
saw
his
feet
as
he
went
out
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
nothing
on
them
but
a
pair
of
tattered
blood-stained
socks
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
door
closed
upon
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
half
a
mind
to
follow
*punct* ,
till
i
remembered
how
he
detested
any
fuss
about
himself
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
minute
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
my
mind
was
wool-gathering
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
remarkable
behaviour
of
an
eminent
scientist
*punct* ,
i
heard
the
editor
say
*punct* ,
thinking
*punct* ,
after
his
wont
*punct* ,
in
headlines
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
brought
my
attention
back
to
the
bright
dinner-table
*punct* .
*break*
what's
the
game
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
journalist
*punct* .
*break*
has
he
been
doing
the
amateur
cadger
*punct* ?
*break*
i
don't
follow
*punct* .
*break*
i
met
the
eye
of
the
psychologist
*punct* ,
and
read
my
own
interpretation
in
his
face
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
of
the
time
traveller
limping
painfully
upstairs
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
think
any
one
else
had
noticed
his
lameness
*punct* .
*break*
the
first
to
recover
completely
from
this
surprise
was
the
medical
man
*punct* ,
who
rang
the
bell
*mdash*
the
time
traveller
hated
to
have
servants
waiting
at
dinner
*mdash*
for
a
hot
plate
*punct* .
*break*
at
that
the
editor
turned
to
his
knife
and
fork
with
a
grunt
*punct* ,
and
the
silent
man
followed
suit
*punct* .
*break*
the
dinner
was
resumed
*punct* .
*break*
conversation
was
exclamatory
for
a
little
while
*punct* ,
with
gaps
of
wonderment
*punct* ;
and
then
the
editor
got
fervent
in
his
curiosity
*punct* .
*break*
does
our
friend
eke
out
his
modest
income
with
a
crossing
*punct* ?
*break*
or
has
he
his
nebuchadnezzar
phases
*punct* ?
*break*
i
feel
assured
it's
this
business
of
the
time
machine
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
and
took
up
the
psychologist's
account
of
our
previous
meeting
*punct* .
*break*
the
new
guests
were
frankly
incredulous
*punct* .
*break*
the
editor
raised
objections
*punct* .
*break*
what
was
this
time
travelling
*punct* ?
*break*
a
man
couldn't
cover
himself
with
dust
by
rolling
in
a
paradox
*punct* ,
could
he
*punct* ?
*break*
and
then
*punct* ,
as
the
idea
came
home
to
him
*punct* ,
he
resorted
to
caricature
*punct* .
*break*
hadn't
they
any
clothes-brushes
in
the
future
*punct* ?
*break*
the
journalist
too
*punct* ,
would
not
believe
at
any
price
*punct* ,
and
joined
the
editor
in
the
easy
work
of
heaping
ridicule
on
the
whole
thing
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
both
the
new
kind
of
journalist
*mdash*
very
joyous
*punct* ,
irreverent
young
men
*punct* .
*break*
our
special
correspondent
in
the
day
after
to-morrow
reports
*punct* ,
the
journalist
was
saying
*mdash*
or
rather
shouting
*mdash*
when
the
time
traveller
came
back
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
dressed
in
ordinary
evening
clothes
*punct* ,
and
nothing
save
his
haggard
look
remained
of
the
change
that
had
startled
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
say
*punct* ,
said
the
editor
hilariously
*punct* ,
these
chaps
here
say
you
have
been
travelling
into
the
middle
of
next
week
*punct* !
*break*
tell
us
all
about
little
rosebery
*punct* ,
will
you
*punct* ?
*break*
what
will
you
take
for
the
lot
*punct* ?
*break*
the
time
traveller
came
to
the
place
reserved
for
him
without
a
word
*punct* .
*break*
he
smiled
quietly
*punct* ,
in
his
old
way
*punct* .
*break*
where's
my
mutton
*punct* ?
*break*
what
a
treat
it
is
to
stick
a
fork
into
meat
again
*punct* !
*break*
cried
the
editor
*punct* .
*break*
story
be
damned
*punct* !
*break*
said
the
time
traveller
*punct* .
*break*
i
want
something
to
eat
*punct* .
*break*
i
won't
say
a
word
until
i
get
some
peptone
into
my
arteries
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
salt
*punct* .
*break*
one
word
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* .
*break*
have
you
been
time
travelling
*punct* ?
*break*
yes
*punct* ,
said
the
time
traveller
*punct* ,
with
his
mouth
full
*punct* ,
nodding
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
i'd
give
a
shilling
a
line
for
a
verbatim
note
*punct* ,
said
the
editor
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
traveller
pushed
his
glass
towards
the
silent
man
and
rang
it
with
his
fingernail
*punct* ;
at
which
the
silent
man
*punct* ,
who
had
been
staring
at
his
face
*punct* ,
started
convulsively
*punct* ,
and
poured
him
wine
*punct* .
*break*
the
rest
of
the
dinner
was
uncomfortable
*punct* .
*break*
for
my
own
part
*punct* ,
sudden
questions
kept
on
rising
to
my
lips
*punct* ,
and
i
dare
say
it
was
the
same
with
the
others
*punct* .
*break*
the
journalist
tried
to
relieve
the
tension
by
telling
anecdotes
of
hettie
potter
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
traveller
devoted
his
attention
to
his
dinner
*punct* ,
and
displayed
the
appetite
of
a
tramp
*punct* .
*break*
the
medical
man
smoked
a
cigarette
*punct* ,
and
watched
the
time
traveller
through
his
eyelashes
*punct* .
*break*
the
silent
man
seemed
even
more
clumsy
than
usual
*punct* ,
and
drank
champagne
with
regularity
and
determination
out
of
sheer
nervousness
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
the
time
traveller
pushed
his
plate
away
*punct* ,
and
looked
round
us
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
i
must
apologize
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
simply
starving
*punct* .
*break*
i've
had
a
most
amazing
time
*punct* .
*break*
he
reached
out
his
hand
for
a
cigar
*punct* ,
and
cut
the
end
*punct* .
*break*
but
come
into
the
smoking-room
*punct* .
*break*
it's
too
long
a
story
to
tell
over
greasy
plates
*punct* .
*break*
and
ringing
the
bell
in
passing
*punct* ,
he
led
the
way
into
the
adjoining
room
*punct* .
*break*
you
have
told
blank
*punct* ,
and
dash
*punct* ,
and
chose
about
the
machine
*punct* ?
*break*
he
said
to
me
*punct* ,
leaning
back
in
his
easy-chair
and
naming
the
three
new
guests
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
thing's
a
mere
paradox
*punct* ,
said
the
editor
*punct* .
*break*
i
can't
argue
to-night
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
mind
telling
you
the
story
*punct* ,
but
i
can't
argue
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
*punct* ,
he
went
on
*punct* ,
tell
you
the
story
of
what
has
happened
to
me
*punct* ,
if
you
like
*punct* ,
but
you
must
refrain
from
interruptions
*punct* .
*break*
i
want
to
tell
it
*punct* .
*break*
most
of
it
will
sound
like
lying
*punct* .
*break*
so
be
it
*punct* !
*break*
it's
true
*mdash*
every
word
of
it
*punct* ,
all
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
in
my
laboratory
at
four
o'clock
*punct* ,
and
since
then
*punct* ...
i've
lived
eight
days
*punct* ...
such
days
as
no
human
being
ever
lived
before
*punct* !
*break*
i'm
nearly
worn
out
*punct* ,
but
i
shan't
sleep
till
i've
told
this
thing
over
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
shall
go
to
bed
*punct* .
*break*
but
no
interruptions
*punct* !
*break*
is
it
agreed
*punct* ?
*break*
agreed
*punct* ,
said
the
editor
*punct* ,
and
the
rest
of
us
echoed
agreed
*punct* .
*break*
and
with
that
the
time
traveller
began
his
story
as
i
have
set
it
forth
*punct* .
*break*
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
at
first
*punct* ,
and
spoke
like
a
weary
man
*punct* .
*break*
afterwards
he
got
more
animated
*punct* .
*break*
in
writing
it
down
i
feel
with
only
too
much
keenness
the
inadequacy
of
pen
and
ink
*mdash*
and
*punct* ,
above
all
*punct* ,
my
own
inadequacy
*mdash*
to
express
its
quality
*punct* .
*break*
you
read
*punct* ,
i
will
suppose
*punct* ,
attentively
enough
*punct* ;
but
you
cannot
see
the
speaker's
white
*punct* ,
sincere
face
in
the
bright
circle
of
the
little
lamp
*punct* ,
nor
hear
the
intonation
of
his
voice
*punct* .
*break*
you
cannot
know
how
his
expression
followed
the
turns
of
his
story
*punct* !
*break*
most
of
us
hearers
were
in
shadow
*punct* ,
for
the
candles
in
the
smoking-room
had
not
been
lighted
*punct* ,
and
only
the
face
of
the
journalist
and
the
legs
of
the
silent
man
from
the
knees
downward
were
illuminated
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
we
glanced
now
and
again
at
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
time
we
ceased
to
do
that
*punct* ,
and
looked
only
at
the
time
traveller's
face
*punct* .
*break*
i
told
some
of
you
last
thursday
of
the
principles
of
the
time
machine
*punct* ,
and
showed
you
the
actual
thing
itself
*punct* ,
incomplete
in
the
workshop
*punct* .
*break*
there
it
is
now
*punct* ,
a
little
travel-worn
*punct* ,
truly
*punct* ;
and
one
of
the
ivory
bars
is
cracked
*punct* ,
and
a
brass
rail
bent
*punct* ;
but
the
rest
of
it's
sound
enough
*punct* .
*break*
i
expected
to
finish
it
on
friday
*punct* ,
but
on
friday
*punct* ,
when
the
putting
together
was
nearly
done
*punct* ,
i
found
that
one
of
the
nickel
bars
was
exactly
one
inch
too
short
*punct* ,
and
this
i
had
to
get
remade
*punct* ;
so
that
the
thing
was
not
complete
until
this
morning
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
at
ten
o'clock
to-day
that
the
first
of
all
time
machines
began
its
career
*punct* .
*break*
i
gave
it
a
last
tap
*punct* ,
tried
all
the
screws
again
*punct* ,
put
one
more
drop
of
oil
on
the
quartz
rod
*punct* ,
and
sat
myself
in
the
saddle
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
a
suicide
who
holds
a
pistol
to
his
skull
feels
much
the
same
wonder
at
what
will
come
next
as
i
felt
then
*punct* .
*break*
i
took
the
starting
lever
in
one
hand
and
the
stopping
one
in
the
other
*punct* ,
pressed
the
first
*punct* ,
and
almost
immediately
the
second
*punct* .
*break*
i
seemed
to
reel
*punct* ;
i
felt
a
nightmare
sensation
of
falling
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
looking
round
*punct* ,
i
saw
the
laboratory
exactly
as
before
*punct* .
*break*
had
anything
happened
*punct* ?
*break*
for
a
moment
i
suspected
that
my
intellect
had
tricked
me
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
noted
the
clock
*punct* .
*break*
a
moment
before
*punct* ,
as
it
seemed
*punct* ,
it
had
stood
at
a
minute
or
so
past
ten
*punct* ;
now
it
was
nearly
half-past
three
*punct* !
*break*
i
drew
a
breath
*punct* ,
set
my
teeth
*punct* ,
gripped
the
starting
lever
with
both
hands
*punct* ,
and
went
off
with
a
thud
*punct* .
*break*
the
laboratory
got
hazy
and
went
dark
*punct* .
*break*
mrs.
watchett
came
in
and
walked
*punct* ,
apparently
without
seeing
me
*punct* ,
towards
the
garden
door
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
it
took
her
a
minute
or
so
to
traverse
the
place
*punct* ,
but
to
me
she
seemed
to
shoot
across
the
room
like
a
rocket
*punct* .
*break*
i
pressed
the
lever
over
to
its
extreme
position
*punct* .
*break*
the
night
came
like
the
turning
out
of
a
lamp
*punct* ,
and
in
another
moment
came
to-morrow
*punct* .
*break*
the
laboratory
grew
faint
and
hazy
*punct* ,
then
fainter
and
ever
fainter
*punct* .
*break*
to-morrow
night
came
black
*punct* ,
then
day
again
*punct* ,
night
again
*punct* ,
day
again
*punct* ,
faster
and
faster
still
*punct* .
*break*
an
eddying
murmur
filled
my
ears
*punct* ,
and
a
strange
*punct* ,
dumb
confusedness
descended
on
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
afraid
i
cannot
convey
the
peculiar
sensations
of
time
travelling
*punct* .
*break*
they
are
excessively
unpleasant
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
a
feeling
exactly
like
that
one
has
upon
a
switchback
*mdash*
of
a
helpless
headlong
motion
*punct* !
*break*
i
felt
the
same
horrible
anticipation
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
of
an
imminent
smash
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
put
on
pace
*punct* ,
night
followed
day
like
the
flapping
of
a
black
wing
*punct* .
*break*
the
dim
suggestion
of
the
laboratory
seemed
presently
to
fall
away
from
me
*punct* ,
and
i
saw
the
sun
hopping
swiftly
across
the
sky
*punct* ,
leaping
it
every
minute
*punct* ,
and
every
minute
marking
a
day
*punct* .
*break*
i
supposed
the
laboratory
had
been
destroyed
and
i
had
come
into
the
open
air
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
a
dim
impression
of
scaffolding
*punct* ,
but
i
was
already
going
too
fast
to
be
conscious
of
any
moving
things
*punct* .
*break*
the
slowest
snail
that
ever
crawled
dashed
by
too
fast
for
me
*punct* .
*break*
the
twinkling
succession
of
darkness
and
light
was
excessively
painful
to
the
eye
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
in
the
intermittent
darknesses
*punct* ,
i
saw
the
moon
spinning
swiftly
through
her
quarters
from
new
to
full
*punct* ,
and
had
a
faint
glimpse
of
the
circling
stars
*punct* .
*break*
presently
*punct* ,
as
i
went
on
*punct* ,
still
gaining
velocity
*punct* ,
the
palpitation
of
night
and
day
merged
into
one
continuous
greyness
*punct* ;
the
sky
took
on
a
wonderful
deepness
of
blue
*punct* ,
a
splendid
luminous
color
like
that
of
early
twilight
*punct* ;
the
jerking
sun
became
a
streak
of
fire
*punct* ,
a
brilliant
arch
*punct* ,
in
space
*punct* ;
the
moon
a
fainter
fluctuating
band
*punct* ;
and
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
stars
*punct* ,
save
now
and
then
a
brighter
circle
flickering
in
the
blue
*punct* .
*break*
the
landscape
was
misty
and
vague
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
still
on
the
hill-side
upon
which
this
house
now
stands
*punct* ,
and
the
shoulder
rose
above
me
grey
and
dim
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
trees
growing
and
changing
like
puffs
of
vapour
*punct* ,
now
brown
*punct* ,
now
green
*punct* ;
they
grew
*punct* ,
spread
*punct* ,
shivered
*punct* ,
and
passed
away
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
huge
buildings
rise
up
faint
and
fair
*punct* ,
and
pass
like
dreams
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
surface
of
the
earth
seemed
changed
*mdash*
melting
and
flowing
under
my
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
the
little
hands
upon
the
dials
that
registered
my
speed
raced
round
faster
and
faster
*punct* .
*break*
presently
i
noted
that
the
sun
belt
swayed
up
and
down
*punct* ,
from
solstice
to
solstice
*punct* ,
in
a
minute
or
less
*punct* ,
and
that
consequently
my
pace
was
over
a
year
a
minute
*punct* ;
and
minute
by
minute
the
white
snow
flashed
across
the
world
*punct* ,
and
vanished
*punct* ,
and
was
followed
by
the
bright
*punct* ,
brief
green
of
spring
*punct* .
*break*
the
unpleasant
sensations
of
the
start
were
less
poignant
now
*punct* .
*break*
they
merged
at
last
into
a
kind
of
hysterical
exhilaration
*punct* .
*break*
i
remarked
indeed
a
clumsy
swaying
of
the
machine
*punct* ,
for
which
i
was
unable
to
account
*punct* .
*break*
but
my
mind
was
too
confused
to
attend
to
it
*punct* ,
so
with
a
kind
of
madness
growing
upon
me
*punct* ,
i
flung
myself
into
futurity
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
i
scarce
thought
of
stopping
*punct* ,
scarce
thought
of
anything
but
these
new
sensations
*punct* .
*break*
but
presently
a
fresh
series
of
impressions
grew
up
in
my
mind
*mdash*
a
certain
curiosity
and
therewith
a
certain
dread
*mdash*
until
at
last
they
took
complete
possession
of
me
*punct* .
*break*
what
strange
developments
of
humanity
*punct* ,
what
wonderful
advances
upon
our
rudimentary
civilization
*punct* ,
i
thought
*punct* ,
might
not
appear
when
i
came
to
look
nearly
into
the
dim
elusive
world
that
raced
and
fluctuated
before
my
eyes
*punct* !
*break*
i
saw
great
and
splendid
architecture
rising
about
me
*punct* ,
more
massive
than
any
buildings
of
our
own
time
*punct* ,
and
yet
*punct* ,
as
it
seemed
*punct* ,
built
of
glimmer
and
mist
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
a
richer
green
flow
up
the
hill-side
*punct* ,
and
remain
there
*punct* ,
without
any
wintry
intermission
*punct* .
*break*
even
through
the
veil
of
my
confusion
the
earth
seemed
very
fair
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
my
mind
came
round
to
the
business
of
stopping
*punct* ,
the
peculiar
risk
lay
in
the
possibility
of
my
finding
some
substance
in
the
space
which
i
*punct* ,
or
the
machine
*punct* ,
occupied
*punct* .
*break*
so
long
as
i
travelled
at
a
high
velocity
through
time
*punct* ,
this
scarcely
mattered
*punct* ;
i
was
*punct* ,
so
to
speak
*punct* ,
attenuated
*mdash*
was
slipping
like
a
vapour
through
the
interstices
of
intervening
substances
*punct* !
*break*
but
to
come
to
a
stop
involved
the
jamming
of
myself
*punct* ,
molecule
by
molecule
*punct* ,
into
whatever
lay
in
my
way
*punct* ;
meant
bringing
my
atoms
into
such
intimate
contact
with
those
of
the
obstacle
that
a
profound
chemical
reaction
*mdash*
possibly
a
far-reaching
explosion
*mdash*
would
result
*punct* ,
and
blow
myself
and
my
apparatus
out
of
all
possible
dimensions
*mdash*
into
the
unknown
*punct* .
*break*
this
possibility
had
occurred
to
me
again
and
again
while
i
was
making
the
machine
*punct* ;
but
then
i
had
cheerfully
accepted
it
as
an
unavoidable
risk
*mdash*
one
of
the
risks
a
man
has
got
to
take
*punct* !
*break*
now
the
risk
was
inevitable
*punct* ,
i
no
longer
saw
it
in
the
same
cheerful
light
*punct* .
*break*
the
fact
is
that
insensibly
*punct* ,
the
absolute
strangeness
of
everything
*punct* ,
the
sickly
jarring
and
swaying
of
the
machine
*punct* ,
above
all
*punct* ,
the
feeling
of
prolonged
falling
*punct* ,
had
absolutely
upset
my
nerve
*punct* .
*break*
i
told
myself
that
i
could
never
stop
*punct* ,
and
with
a
gust
of
petulance
i
resolved
to
stop
forthwith
*punct* .
*break*
like
an
impatient
fool
*punct* ,
i
lugged
over
the
lever
*punct* ,
and
incontinently
the
thing
went
reeling
over
*punct* ,
and
i
was
flung
headlong
through
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
the
sound
of
a
clap
of
thunder
in
my
ears
*punct* .
*break*
i
may
have
been
stunned
for
a
moment
*punct* .
*break*
a
pitiless
hail
was
hissing
round
me
*punct* ,
and
i
was
sitting
on
soft
turf
in
front
of
the
overset
machine
*punct* .
*break*
everything
still
seemed
grey
*punct* ,
but
presently
i
remarked
that
the
confusion
in
my
ears
was
gone
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
round
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
on
what
seemed
to
be
a
little
lawn
in
a
garden
*punct* ,
surrounded
by
rhododendron
bushes
*punct* ,
and
i
noticed
that
their
mauve
and
purple
blossoms
were
dropping
in
a
shower
under
the
beating
of
the
hail-stones
*punct* .
*break*
the
rebounding
*punct* ,
dancing
hail
hung
in
a
cloud
over
the
machine
*punct* ,
and
drove
along
the
ground
like
smoke
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
moment
i
was
wet
to
the
skin
*punct* .
*break*
fine
hospitality
*punct* ,
said
i
*punct* ,
to
a
man
who
has
travelled
innumerable
years
to
see
you
*punct* .
*break*
presently
i
thought
what
a
fool
i
was
to
get
wet
*punct* .
*break*
i
stood
up
and
looked
round
me
*punct* .
*break*
a
colossal
figure
*punct* ,
carved
apparently
in
some
white
stone
*punct* ,
loomed
indistinctly
beyond
the
rhododendrons
through
the
hazy
downpour
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
else
of
the
world
was
invisible
*punct* .
*break*
my
sensations
would
be
hard
to
describe
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
columns
of
hail
grew
thinner
*punct* ,
i
saw
the
white
figure
more
distinctly
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
very
large
*punct* ,
for
a
silver
birch-tree
touched
its
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
of
white
marble
*punct* ,
in
shape
something
like
a
winged
sphinx
*punct* ,
but
the
wings
*punct* ,
instead
of
being
carried
vertically
at
the
sides
*punct* ,
were
spread
so
that
it
seemed
to
hover
*punct* .
*break*
the
pedestal
*punct* ,
it
appeared
to
me
*punct* ,
was
of
bronze
*punct* ,
and
was
thick
with
verdigris
*punct* .
*break*
it
chanced
that
the
face
was
towards
me
*punct* ;
the
sightless
eyes
seemed
to
watch
me
*punct* ;
there
was
the
faint
shadow
of
a
smile
on
the
lips
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
greatly
weather-worn
*punct* ,
and
that
imparted
an
unpleasant
suggestion
of
disease
*punct* .
*break*
i
stood
looking
at
it
for
a
little
space
*mdash*
half
a
minute
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
or
half
an
hour
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
to
advance
and
to
recede
as
the
hail
drove
before
it
denser
or
thinner
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
i
tore
my
eyes
from
it
for
a
moment
and
saw
that
the
hail
curtain
had
worn
threadbare
*punct* ,
and
that
the
sky
was
lightening
with
the
promise
of
the
sun
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
up
again
at
the
crouching
white
shape
*punct* ,
and
the
full
temerity
of
my
voyage
came
suddenly
upon
me
*punct* .
*break*
what
might
appear
when
that
hazy
curtain
was
altogether
withdrawn
*punct* ?
*break*
what
might
not
have
happened
to
men
*punct* ?
*break*
what
if
cruelty
had
grown
into
a
common
passion
*punct* ?
*break*
what
if
in
this
interval
the
race
had
lost
its
manliness
and
had
developed
into
something
inhuman
*punct* ,
unsympathetic
*punct* ,
and
overwhelmingly
powerful
*punct* ?
*break*
i
might
seem
some
old-world
savage
animal
*punct* ,
only
the
more
dreadful
and
disgusting
for
our
common
likeness
*mdash*
a
foul
creature
to
be
incontinently
slain
*punct* .
*break*
already
i
saw
other
vast
shapes
*mdash*
huge
buildings
with
intricate
parapets
and
tall
columns
*punct* ,
with
a
wooded
hill-side
dimly
creeping
in
upon
me
through
the
lessening
storm
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
seized
with
a
panic
fear
*punct* .
*break*
i
turned
frantically
to
the
time
machine
*punct* ,
and
strove
hard
to
readjust
it
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
did
so
the
shafts
of
the
sun
smote
through
the
thunderstorm
*punct* .
*break*
the
grey
downpour
was
swept
aside
and
vanished
like
the
trailing
garments
of
a
ghost
*punct* .
*break*
above
me
*punct* ,
in
the
intense
blue
of
the
summer
sky
*punct* ,
some
faint
brown
shreds
of
cloud
whirled
into
nothingness
*punct* .
*break*
the
great
buildings
about
me
stood
out
clear
and
distinct
*punct* ,
shining
with
the
wet
of
the
thunderstorm
*punct* ,
and
picked
out
in
white
by
the
unmelted
hailstones
piled
along
their
courses
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
naked
in
a
strange
world
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
as
perhaps
a
bird
may
feel
in
the
clear
air
*punct* ,
knowing
the
hawk
wings
above
and
will
swoop
*punct* .
*break*
my
fear
grew
to
frenzy
*punct* .
*break*
i
took
a
breathing
space
*punct* ,
set
my
teeth
*punct* ,
and
again
grappled
fiercely
*punct* ,
wrist
and
knee
*punct* ,
with
the
machine
*punct* .
*break*
it
gave
under
my
desperate
onset
and
turned
over
*punct* .
*break*
it
struck
my
chin
violently
*punct* .
*break*
one
hand
on
the
saddle
*punct* ,
the
other
on
the
lever
*punct* ,
i
stood
panting
heavily
in
attitude
to
mount
again
*punct* .
*break*
but
with
this
recovery
of
a
prompt
retreat
my
courage
recovered
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
more
curiously
and
less
fearfully
at
this
world
of
the
remote
future
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
circular
opening
*punct* ,
high
up
in
the
wall
of
the
nearer
house
*punct* ,
i
saw
a
group
of
figures
clad
in
rich
soft
robes
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
seen
me
*punct* ,
and
their
faces
were
directed
towards
me
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
heard
voices
approaching
me
*punct* .
*break*
coming
through
the
bushes
by
the
white
sphinx
were
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
men
running
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
these
emerged
in
a
pathway
leading
straight
to
the
little
lawn
upon
which
i
stood
with
my
machine
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
a
slight
creature
*mdash*
perhaps
four
feet
high
*mdash*
clad
in
a
purple
tunic
*punct* ,
girdled
at
the
waist
with
a
leather
belt
*punct* .
*break*
sandals
or
buskins
*mdash*
i
could
not
clearly
distinguish
which
*mdash*
were
on
his
feet
*punct* ;
his
legs
were
bare
to
the
knees
*punct* ,
and
his
head
was
bare
*punct* .
*break*
noticing
that
*punct* ,
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
how
warm
the
air
was
*punct* .
*break*
he
struck
me
as
being
a
very
beautiful
and
graceful
creature
*punct* ,
but
indescribably
frail
*punct* .
*break*
his
flushed
face
reminded
me
of
the
more
beautiful
kind
of
consumptive
*mdash*
that
hectic
beauty
of
which
we
used
to
hear
so
much
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
sight
of
him
i
suddenly
regained
confidence
*punct* .
*break*
i
took
my
hands
from
the
machine
*punct* .
*break*
in
another
moment
we
were
standing
face
to
face
*punct* ,
i
and
this
fragile
thing
out
of
futurity
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
straight
up
to
me
and
laughed
into
my
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
the
absence
from
his
bearing
of
any
sign
of
fear
struck
me
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
turned
to
the
two
others
who
were
following
him
and
spoke
to
them
in
a
strange
and
very
sweet
and
liquid
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
others
coming
*punct* ,
and
presently
a
little
group
of
perhaps
eight
or
ten
of
these
exquisite
creatures
were
about
me
*punct* .
*break*
one
of
them
addressed
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
came
into
my
head
*punct* ,
oddly
enough
*punct* ,
that
my
voice
was
too
harsh
and
deep
for
them
*punct* .
*break*
so
i
shook
my
head
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
pointing
to
my
ears
*punct* ,
shook
it
again
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
a
step
forward
*punct* ,
hesitated
*punct* ,
and
then
touched
my
hand
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
felt
other
soft
little
tentacles
upon
my
back
and
shoulders
*punct* .
*break*
they
wanted
to
make
sure
i
was
real
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
nothing
in
this
at
all
alarming
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
there
was
something
in
these
pretty
little
people
that
inspired
confidence
*mdash*
a
graceful
gentleness
*punct* ,
a
certain
childlike
ease
*punct* .
*break*
and
besides
*punct* ,
they
looked
so
frail
that
i
could
fancy
myself
flinging
the
whole
dozen
of
them
about
like
nine-pins
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
made
a
sudden
motion
to
warn
them
when
i
saw
their
little
pink
hands
feeling
at
the
time
machine
*punct* .
*break*
happily
then
*punct* ,
when
it
was
not
too
late
*punct* ,
i
thought
of
a
danger
i
had
hitherto
forgotten
*punct* ,
and
reaching
over
the
bars
of
the
machine
i
unscrewed
the
little
levers
that
would
set
it
in
motion
*punct* ,
and
put
these
in
my
pocket
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
turned
again
to
see
what
i
could
do
in
the
way
of
communication
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
*punct* ,
looking
more
nearly
into
their
features
*punct* ,
i
saw
some
further
peculiarities
in
their
dresden-china
type
of
prettiness
*punct* .
*break*
their
hair
*punct* ,
which
was
uniformly
curly
*punct* ,
came
to
a
sharp
end
at
the
neck
and
cheek
*punct* ;
there
was
not
the
faintest
suggestion
of
it
on
the
face
*punct* ,
and
their
ears
were
singularly
minute
*punct* .
*break*
the
mouths
were
small
*punct* ,
with
bright
red
*punct* ,
rather
thin
lips
*punct* ,
and
the
little
chins
ran
to
a
point
*punct* .
*break*
the
eyes
were
large
and
mild
*punct* ;
and
*mdash*
this
may
seem
egotism
on
my
part
*mdash*
i
fancied
even
that
there
was
a
certain
lack
of
the
interest
i
might
have
expected
in
them
*punct* .
*break*
as
they
made
no
effort
to
communicate
with
me
*punct* ,
but
simply
stood
round
me
smiling
and
speaking
in
soft
cooing
notes
to
each
other
*punct* ,
i
began
the
conversation
*punct* .
*break*
i
pointed
to
the
time
machine
and
to
myself
*punct* .
*break*
then
hesitating
for
a
moment
how
to
express
time
*punct* ,
i
pointed
to
the
sun
*punct* .
*break*
at
once
a
quaintly
pretty
little
figure
in
chequered
purple
and
white
followed
my
gesture
*punct* ,
and
then
astonished
me
by
imitating
the
sound
of
thunder
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
i
was
staggered
*punct* ,
though
the
import
of
his
gesture
was
plain
enough
*punct* .
*break*
the
question
had
come
into
my
mind
abruptly
*punct* :
were
these
creatures
fools
*punct* ?
*break*
you
may
hardly
understand
how
it
took
me
*punct* .
*break*
you
see
i
had
always
anticipated
that
the
people
of
the
year
eight
hundred
and
two
thousand
odd
would
be
incredibly
in
front
of
us
in
knowledge
*punct* ,
art
*punct* ,
everything
*punct* .
*break*
then
one
of
them
suddenly
asked
me
a
question
that
showed
him
to
be
on
the
intellectual
level
of
one
of
our
five-year-old
children
*mdash*
asked
me
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
if
i
had
come
from
the
sun
in
a
thunderstorm
*punct* !
*break*
it
let
loose
the
judgment
i
had
suspended
upon
their
clothes
*punct* ,
their
frail
light
limbs
*punct* ,
and
fragile
features
*punct* .
*break*
a
flow
of
disappointment
rushed
across
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
i
felt
that
i
had
built
the
time
machine
in
vain
*punct* .
*break*
i
nodded
*punct* ,
pointed
to
the
sun
*punct* ,
and
gave
them
such
a
vivid
rendering
of
a
thunderclap
as
startled
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
all
withdrew
a
pace
or
so
and
bowed
*punct* .
*break*
then
came
one
laughing
towards
me
*punct* ,
carrying
a
chain
of
beautiful
flowers
altogether
new
to
me
*punct* ,
and
put
it
about
my
neck
*punct* .
*break*
the
idea
was
received
with
melodious
applause
*punct* ;
and
presently
they
were
all
running
to
and
fro
for
flowers
*punct* ,
and
laughingly
flinging
them
upon
me
until
i
was
almost
smothered
with
blossom
*punct* .
*break*
you
who
have
never
seen
the
like
can
scarcely
imagine
what
delicate
and
wonderful
flowers
countless
years
of
culture
had
created
*punct* .
*break*
then
someone
suggested
that
their
plaything
should
be
exhibited
in
the
nearest
building
*punct* ,
and
so
i
was
led
past
the
sphinx
of
white
marble
*punct* ,
which
had
seemed
to
watch
me
all
the
while
with
a
smile
at
my
astonishment
*punct* ,
towards
a
vast
grey
edifice
of
fretted
stone
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
went
with
them
the
memory
of
my
confident
anticipations
of
a
profoundly
grave
and
intellectual
posterity
came
*punct* ,
with
irresistible
merriment
*punct* ,
to
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
the
building
had
a
huge
entry
*punct* ,
and
was
altogether
of
colossal
dimensions
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
naturally
most
occupied
with
the
growing
crowd
of
little
people
*punct* ,
and
with
the
big
open
portals
that
yawned
before
me
shadowy
and
mysterious
*punct* .
*break*
my
general
impression
of
the
world
i
saw
over
their
heads
was
a
tangled
waste
of
beautiful
bushes
and
flowers
*punct* ,
a
long
neglected
and
yet
weedless
garden
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
a
number
of
tall
spikes
of
strange
white
flowers
*punct* ,
measuring
a
foot
perhaps
across
the
spread
of
the
waxen
petals
*punct* .
*break*
they
grew
scattered
*punct* ,
as
if
wild
*punct* ,
among
the
variegated
shrubs
*punct* ,
but
*punct* ,
as
i
say
*punct* ,
i
did
not
examine
them
closely
at
this
time
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
machine
was
left
deserted
on
the
turf
among
the
rhododendrons
*punct* .
*break*
the
arch
of
the
doorway
was
richly
carved
*punct* ,
but
naturally
i
did
not
observe
the
carving
very
narrowly
*punct* ,
though
i
fancied
i
saw
suggestions
of
old
phoenician
decorations
as
i
passed
through
*punct* ,
and
it
struck
me
that
they
were
very
badly
broken
and
weather
*punct* -
worn
*punct* .
*break*
several
more
brightly
clad
people
met
me
in
the
doorway
*punct* ,
and
so
we
entered
*punct* ,
i
*punct* ,
dressed
in
dingy
nineteenth-century
garments
*punct* ,
looking
grotesque
enough
*punct* ,
garlanded
with
flowers
*punct* ,
and
surrounded
by
an
eddying
mass
of
bright
*punct* ,
soft-colored
robes
and
shining
white
limbs
*punct* ,
in
a
melodious
whirl
of
laughter
and
laughing
speech
*punct* .
*break*
the
big
doorway
opened
into
a
proportionately
great
hall
hung
with
brown
*punct* .
*break*
the
roof
was
in
shadow
*punct* ,
and
the
windows
*punct* ,
partially
glazed
with
coloured
glass
and
partially
unglazed
*punct* ,
admitted
a
tempered
light
*punct* .
*break*
the
floor
was
made
up
of
huge
blocks
of
some
very
hard
white
metal
*punct* ,
not
plates
nor
slabs
*mdash*
blocks
*punct* ,
and
it
was
so
much
worn
*punct* ,
as
i
judged
by
the
going
to
and
fro
of
past
generations
*punct* ,
as
to
be
deeply
channelled
along
the
more
frequented
ways
*punct* .
*break*
transverse
to
the
length
were
innumerable
tables
made
of
slabs
of
polished
stone
*punct* ,
raised
perhaps
a
foot
from
the
floor
*punct* ,
and
upon
these
were
heaps
of
fruits
*punct* .
*break*
some
i
recognized
as
a
kind
of
hypertrophied
raspberry
and
orange
*punct* ,
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
strange
*punct* .
*break*
between
the
tables
was
scattered
a
great
number
of
cushions
*punct* .
*break*
upon
these
my
conductors
seated
themselves
*punct* ,
signing
for
me
to
do
likewise
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
pretty
absence
of
ceremony
they
began
to
eat
the
fruit
with
their
hands
*punct* ,
flinging
peel
and
stalks
*punct* ,
and
so
forth
*punct* ,
into
the
round
openings
in
the
sides
of
the
tables
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
not
loath
to
follow
their
example
*punct* ,
for
i
felt
thirsty
and
hungry
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
did
so
i
surveyed
the
hall
at
my
leisure
*punct* .
*break*
and
perhaps
the
thing
that
struck
me
most
was
its
dilapidated
look
*punct* .
*break*
the
stained-glass
windows
*punct* ,
which
displayed
only
a
geometrical
pattern
*punct* ,
were
broken
in
many
places
*punct* ,
and
the
curtains
that
hung
across
the
lower
end
were
thick
with
dust
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
caught
my
eye
that
the
corner
of
the
marble
table
near
me
was
fractured
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
the
general
effect
was
extremely
rich
and
picturesque
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
a
couple
of
hundred
people
dining
in
the
hall
*punct* ,
and
most
of
them
*punct* ,
seated
as
near
to
me
as
they
could
come
*punct* ,
were
watching
me
with
interest
*punct* ,
their
little
eyes
shining
over
the
fruit
they
were
eating
*punct* .
*break*
all
were
clad
in
the
same
soft
and
yet
strong
*punct* ,
silky
material
*punct* .
*break*
fruit
*punct* ,
by
the
by
*punct* ,
was
all
their
diet
*punct* .
*break*
these
people
of
the
remote
future
were
strict
vegetarians
*punct* ,
and
while
i
was
with
them
*punct* ,
in
spite
of
some
carnal
cravings
*punct* ,
i
had
to
be
frugivorous
also
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
i
found
afterwards
that
horses
*punct* ,
cattle
*punct* ,
sheep
*punct* ,
dogs
*punct* ,
had
followed
the
ichthyosaurus
into
extinction
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
fruits
were
very
delightful
*punct* ;
one
*punct* ,
in
particular
*punct* ,
that
seemed
to
be
in
season
all
the
time
i
was
there
*mdash*
a
floury
thing
in
a
three-sided
husk
*mdash*
was
especially
good
*punct* ,
and
i
made
it
my
staple
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
i
was
puzzled
by
all
these
strange
fruits
*punct* ,
and
by
the
strange
flowers
i
saw
*punct* ,
but
later
i
began
to
perceive
their
import
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
i
am
telling
you
of
my
fruit
dinner
in
the
distant
future
now
*punct* .
*break*
so
soon
as
my
appetite
was
a
little
checked
*punct* ,
i
determined
to
make
a
resolute
attempt
to
learn
the
speech
of
these
new
men
of
mine
*punct* .
*break*
clearly
that
was
the
next
thing
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
the
fruits
seemed
a
convenient
thing
to
begin
upon
*punct* ,
and
holding
one
of
these
up
i
began
a
series
of
interrogative
sounds
and
gestures
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
some
considerable
difficulty
in
conveying
my
meaning
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
my
efforts
met
with
a
stare
of
surprise
or
inextinguishable
laughter
*punct* ,
but
presently
a
fair-haired
little
creature
seemed
to
grasp
my
intention
and
repeated
a
name
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
to
chatter
and
explain
the
business
at
great
length
to
each
other
*punct* ,
and
my
first
attempts
to
make
the
exquisite
little
sounds
of
their
language
caused
an
immense
amount
of
amusement
*punct* .
*break*
however
*punct* ,
i
felt
like
a
schoolmaster
amidst
children
*punct* ,
and
persisted
*punct* ,
and
presently
i
had
a
score
of
noun
substantives
at
least
at
my
command
*punct* ;
and
then
i
got
to
demonstrative
pronouns
*punct* ,
and
even
the
verb
to
eat
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
was
slow
work
*punct* ,
and
the
little
people
soon
tired
and
wanted
to
get
away
from
my
interrogations
*punct* ,
so
i
determined
*punct* ,
rather
of
necessity
*punct* ,
to
let
them
give
their
lessons
in
little
doses
when
they
felt
inclined
*punct* .
*break*
and
very
little
doses
i
found
they
were
before
long
*punct* ,
for
i
never
met
people
more
indolent
or
more
easily
fatigued
*punct* .
*break*
a
queer
thing
i
soon
discovered
about
my
little
hosts
*punct* ,
and
that
was
their
lack
of
interest
*punct* .
*break*
they
would
come
to
me
with
eager
cries
of
astonishment
*punct* ,
like
children
*punct* ,
but
like
children
they
would
soon
stop
examining
me
and
wander
away
after
some
other
toy
*punct* .
*break*
the
dinner
and
my
conversational
beginnings
ended
*punct* ,
i
noted
for
the
first
time
that
almost
all
those
who
had
surrounded
me
at
first
were
gone
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
odd
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
how
speedily
i
came
to
disregard
these
little
people
*punct* .
*break*
i
went
out
through
the
portal
into
the
sunlit
world
again
as
soon
as
my
hunger
was
satisfied
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
continually
meeting
more
of
these
men
of
the
future
*punct* ,
who
would
follow
me
a
little
distance
*punct* ,
chatter
and
laugh
about
me
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
having
smiled
and
gesticulated
in
a
friendly
way
*punct* ,
leave
me
again
to
my
own
devices
*punct* .
*break*
the
calm
of
evening
was
upon
the
world
as
i
emerged
from
the
great
hall
*punct* ,
and
the
scene
was
lit
by
the
warm
glow
of
the
setting
sun
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
things
were
very
confusing
*punct* .
*break*
everything
was
so
entirely
different
from
the
world
i
had
known
*mdash*
even
the
flowers
*punct* .
*break*
the
big
building
i
had
left
was
situated
on
the
slope
of
a
broad
river
valley
*punct* ,
but
the
thames
had
shifted
perhaps
a
mile
from
its
present
position
*punct* .
*break*
i
resolved
to
mount
to
the
summit
of
a
crest
perhaps
a
mile
and
a
half
away
*punct* ,
from
which
i
could
get
a
wider
view
of
this
our
planet
in
the
year
eight
hundred
and
two
thousand
seven
hundred
and
one
a.d
*punct* .
*break*
for
that
*punct* ,
i
should
explain
*punct* ,
was
the
date
the
little
dials
of
my
machine
recorded
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
walked
i
was
watching
for
every
impression
that
could
possibly
help
to
explain
the
condition
of
ruinous
splendour
in
which
i
found
the
world
*mdash*
for
ruinous
it
was
*punct* .
*break*
a
little
way
up
the
hill
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
was
a
great
heap
of
granite
*punct* ,
bound
together
by
masses
of
aluminium
*punct* ,
a
vast
labyrinth
of
precipitous
walls
and
crumpled
heaps
*punct* ,
amidst
which
were
thick
heaps
of
very
beautiful
pagoda-like
plants
*mdash*
nettles
possibly
*mdash*
but
wonderfully
tinted
with
brown
about
the
leaves
*punct* ,
and
incapable
of
stinging
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
evidently
the
derelict
remains
of
some
vast
structure
*punct* ,
to
what
end
built
i
could
not
determine
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
here
that
i
was
destined
*punct* ,
at
a
later
date
*punct* ,
to
have
a
very
strange
experience
*mdash*
the
first
intimation
of
a
still
stranger
discovery
*mdash*
but
of
that
i
will
speak
in
its
proper
place
*punct* .
*break*
looking
round
with
a
sudden
thought
*punct* ,
from
a
terrace
on
which
i
rested
for
a
while
*punct* ,
i
realized
that
there
were
no
small
houses
to
be
seen
*punct* .
*break*
apparently
the
single
house
*punct* ,
and
possibly
even
the
household
*punct* ,
had
vanished
*punct* .
*break*
here
and
there
among
the
greenery
were
palace-like
buildings
*punct* ,
but
the
house
and
the
cottage
*punct* ,
which
form
such
characteristic
features
of
our
own
english
landscape
*punct* ,
had
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
communism
*punct* ,
said
i
to
myself
*punct* .
*break*
and
on
the
heels
of
that
came
another
thought
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
at
the
half-dozen
little
figures
that
were
following
me
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
in
a
flash
*punct* ,
i
perceived
that
all
had
the
same
form
of
costume
*punct* ,
the
same
soft
hairless
visage
*punct* ,
and
the
same
girlish
rotundity
of
limb
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
seem
strange
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
that
i
had
not
noticed
this
before
*punct* .
*break*
but
everything
was
so
strange
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
i
saw
the
fact
plainly
enough
*punct* .
*break*
in
costume
*punct* ,
and
in
all
the
differences
of
texture
and
bearing
that
now
mark
off
the
sexes
from
each
other
*punct* ,
these
people
of
the
future
were
alike
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
children
seemed
to
my
eyes
to
be
but
the
miniatures
of
their
parents
*punct* .
*break*
i
judged
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
that
the
children
of
that
time
were
extremely
precocious
*punct* ,
physically
at
least
*punct* ,
and
i
found
afterwards
abundant
verification
of
my
opinion
*punct* .
*break*
seeing
the
ease
and
security
in
which
these
people
were
living
*punct* ,
i
felt
that
this
close
resemblance
of
the
sexes
was
after
all
what
one
would
expect
*punct* ;
for
the
strength
of
a
man
and
the
softness
of
a
woman
*punct* ,
the
institution
of
the
family
*punct* ,
and
the
differentiation
of
occupations
are
mere
militant
necessities
of
an
age
of
physical
force
*punct* ;
where
population
is
balanced
and
abundant
*punct* ,
much
childbearing
becomes
an
evil
rather
than
a
blessing
to
the
state
*punct* ;
where
violence
comes
but
rarely
and
off-spring
are
secure
*punct* ,
there
is
less
necessity
*mdash*
indeed
there
is
no
necessity
*mdash*
for
an
efficient
family
*punct* ,
and
the
specialization
of
the
sexes
with
reference
to
their
children's
needs
disappears
*punct* .
*break*
we
see
some
beginnings
of
this
even
in
our
own
time
*punct* ,
and
in
this
future
age
it
was
complete
*punct* .
*break*
this
*punct* ,
i
must
remind
you
*punct* ,
was
my
speculation
at
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
later
*punct* ,
i
was
to
appreciate
how
far
it
fell
short
of
the
reality
*punct* .
*break*
while
i
was
musing
upon
these
things
*punct* ,
my
attention
was
attracted
by
a
pretty
little
structure
*punct* ,
like
a
well
under
a
cupola
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
in
a
transitory
way
of
the
oddness
of
wells
still
existing
*punct* ,
and
then
resumed
the
thread
of
my
speculations
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
no
large
buildings
towards
the
top
of
the
hill
*punct* ,
and
as
my
walking
powers
were
evidently
miraculous
*punct* ,
i
was
presently
left
alone
for
the
first
time
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
strange
sense
of
freedom
and
adventure
i
pushed
on
up
to
the
crest
*punct* .
*break*
there
i
found
a
seat
of
some
yellow
metal
that
i
did
not
recognize
*punct* ,
corroded
in
places
with
a
kind
of
pinkish
rust
and
half
smothered
in
soft
moss
*punct* ,
the
arm-rests
cast
and
filed
into
the
resemblance
of
griffins'heads
*punct* .
*break*
i
sat
down
on
it
*punct* ,
and
i
surveyed
the
broad
view
of
our
old
world
under
the
sunset
of
that
long
day
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
as
sweet
and
fair
a
view
as
i
have
ever
seen
*punct* .
*break*
the
sun
had
already
gone
below
the
horizon
and
the
west
was
flaming
gold
*punct* ,
touched
with
some
horizontal
bars
of
purple
and
crimson
*punct* .
*break*
below
was
the
valley
of
the
thames
*punct* ,
in
which
the
river
lay
like
a
band
of
burnished
steel
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
already
spoken
of
the
great
palaces
dotted
about
among
the
variegated
greenery
*punct* ,
some
in
ruins
and
some
still
occupied
*punct* .
*break*
here
and
there
rose
a
white
or
silvery
figure
in
the
waste
garden
of
the
earth
*punct* ,
here
and
there
came
the
sharp
vertical
line
of
some
cupola
or
obelisk
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
no
hedges
*punct* ,
no
signs
of
proprietary
rights
*punct* ,
no
evidences
of
agriculture
*punct* ;
the
whole
earth
had
become
a
garden
*punct* .
*break*
so
watching
*punct* ,
i
began
to
put
my
interpretation
upon
the
things
i
had
seen
*punct* ,
and
as
it
shaped
itself
to
me
that
evening
*punct* ,
my
interpretation
was
something
in
this
way
*punct* .
*break*
*punct* ,
afterwards
i
found
i
had
got
only
a
half-truth
*mdash*
or
only
a
glimpse
of
one
facet
of
the
truth.
*punct* ,
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
happened
upon
humanity
upon
the
wane
*punct* .
*break*
the
ruddy
sunset
set
me
thinking
of
the
sunset
of
mankind
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
first
time
i
began
to
realize
an
odd
consequence
of
the
social
effort
in
which
we
are
at
present
engaged
*punct* .
*break*
and
yet
*punct* ,
come
to
think
*punct* ,
it
is
a
logical
consequence
enough
*punct* .
*break*
strength
is
the
outcome
of
need
*punct* ;
security
sets
a
premium
on
feebleness
*punct* .
*break*
the
work
of
ameliorating
the
conditions
of
life
*mdash*
the
true
civilizing
process
that
makes
life
more
and
more
secure
*mdash*
had
gone
steadily
on
to
a
climax
*punct* .
*break*
one
triumph
of
a
united
humanity
over
nature
had
followed
another
*punct* .
*break*
things
that
are
now
mere
dreams
had
become
projects
deliberately
put
in
hand
and
carried
forward
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
harvest
was
what
i
saw
*punct* !
*break*
after
all
*punct* ,
the
sanitation
and
the
agriculture
of
to-day
are
still
in
the
rudimentary
stage
*punct* .
*break*
the
science
of
our
time
has
attacked
but
a
little
department
of
the
field
of
human
disease
*punct* ,
but
even
so
*punct* ,
it
spreads
its
operations
very
steadily
and
persistently
*punct* .
*break*
our
agriculture
and
horticulture
destroy
a
weed
just
here
and
there
and
cultivate
perhaps
a
score
or
so
of
wholesome
plants
*punct* ,
leaving
the
greater
number
to
fight
out
a
balance
as
they
can
*punct* .
*break*
we
improve
our
favourite
plants
and
animals
*mdash*
and
how
few
they
are
*mdash*
gradually
by
selective
breeding
*punct* ;
now
a
new
and
better
peach
*punct* ,
now
a
seedless
grape
*punct* ,
now
a
sweeter
and
larger
flower
*punct* ,
now
a
more
convenient
breed
of
cattle
*punct* .
*break*
we
improve
them
gradually
*punct* ,
because
our
ideals
are
vague
and
tentative
*punct* ,
and
our
knowledge
is
very
limited
*punct* ;
because
nature
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
is
shy
and
slow
in
our
clumsy
hands
*punct* .
*break*
some
day
all
this
will
be
better
organized
*punct* ,
and
still
better
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
the
drift
of
the
current
in
spite
of
the
eddies
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
world
will
be
intelligent
*punct* ,
educated
*punct* ,
and
co-operating
*punct* ;
things
will
move
faster
and
faster
towards
the
subjugation
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
end
*punct* ,
wisely
and
carefully
we
shall
readjust
the
balance
of
animal
and
vegetable
me
to
suit
our
human
needs
*punct* .
*break*
this
adjustment
*punct* ,
i
say
*punct* ,
must
have
been
done
*punct* ,
and
done
well
*punct* ;
done
indeed
for
all
time
*punct* ,
in
the
space
of
time
across
which
my
machine
had
leaped
*punct* .
*break*
the
air
was
free
from
gnats
*punct* ,
the
earth
from
weeds
or
fungi
*punct* ;
everywhere
were
fruits
and
sweet
and
delightful
flowers
*punct* ;
brilliant
butterflies
flew
hither
and
thither
*punct* .
*break*
the
ideal
of
preventive
medicine
was
attained
*punct* .
*break*
diseases
had
been
stamped
out
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
no
evidence
of
any
contagious
diseases
during
all
my
stay
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
later
that
even
the
processes
of
putrefaction
and
decay
had
been
profoundly
affected
by
these
changes
*punct* .
*break*
social
triumphs
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
had
been
effected
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
mankind
housed
in
splendid
shelters
*punct* ,
gloriously
clothed
*punct* ,
and
as
yet
i
had
found
them
engaged
in
no
toil
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
no
signs
of
struggle
*punct* ,
neither
social
nor
economical
struggle
*punct* .
*break*
the
shop
*punct* ,
the
advertisement
*punct* ,
traffic
*punct* ,
all
that
commerce
which
constitutes
the
body
of
our
world
*punct* ,
was
gone
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
natural
on
that
golden
evening
that
i
should
jump
at
the
idea
of
a
social
paradise
*punct* .
*break*
the
difficulty
of
increasing
population
had
been
met
*punct* ,
i
guessed
*punct* ,
and
population
had
ceased
to
increase
*punct* .
*break*
but
with
this
change
in
condition
comes
inevitably
adaptations
to
the
change
*punct* .
*break*
what
*punct* ,
unless
biological
science
is
a
mass
of
errors
*punct* ,
is
the
cause
of
human
intelligence
and
vigour
*punct* ?
*break*
hardship
and
freedom
*punct* :
conditions
under
which
the
active
*punct* ,
strong
*punct* ,
and
subtle
survive
and
the
weaker
go
to
the
wall
*punct* ;
conditions
that
put
a
premium
upon
the
loyal
alliance
of
capable
men
*punct* ,
upon
self-restraint
*punct* ,
patience
*punct* ,
and
decision
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
institution
of
the
family
*punct* ,
and
the
emotions
that
arise
therein
*punct* ,
the
fierce
jealousy
*punct* ,
the
tenderness
for
offspring
*punct* ,
parental
self-devotion
*punct* ,
all
found
their
justification
and
support
in
the
imminent
dangers
of
the
young
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
where
are
these
imminent
dangers
*punct* ?
*break*
there
is
a
sentiment
arising
*punct* ,
and
it
will
grow
*punct* ,
against
connubial
jealousy
*punct* ,
against
fierce
maternity
*punct* ,
against
passion
of
all
sorts
*punct* ;
unnecessary
things
now
*punct* ,
and
things
that
make
us
uncomfortable
*punct* ,
savage
survivals
*punct* ,
discords
in
a
refined
and
pleasant
life
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
of
the
physical
slightness
of
the
people
*punct* ,
their
lack
of
intelligence
*punct* ,
and
those
big
abundant
ruins
*punct* ,
and
it
strengthened
my
belief
in
a
perfect
conquest
of
nature
*punct* .
*break*
for
after
the
battle
comes
quiet
*punct* .
*break*
humanity
had
been
strong
*punct* ,
energetic
*punct* ,
and
intelligent
*punct* ,
and
had
used
all
its
abundant
vitality
to
alter
the
conditions
under
which
it
lived
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
came
the
reaction
of
the
altered
conditions
*punct* .
*break*
under
the
new
conditions
of
perfect
comfort
and
security
*punct* ,
that
restless
energy
*punct* ,
that
with
us
is
strength
*punct* ,
would
become
weakness
*punct* .
*break*
even
in
our
own
time
certain
tendencies
and
desires
*punct* ,
once
necessary
to
survival
*punct* ,
are
a
constant
source
of
failure
*punct* .
*break*
physical
courage
and
the
love
of
battle
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
are
no
great
help
*mdash*
may
even
be
hindrances
*mdash*
to
a
civilized
man
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
a
state
of
physical
balance
and
security
*punct* ,
power
*punct* ,
intellectual
as
well
as
physical
*punct* ,
would
be
out
of
place
*punct* .
*break*
for
countless
years
i
judged
there
had
been
no
danger
of
war
or
solitary
violence
*punct* ,
no
danger
from
wild
beasts
*punct* ,
no
wasting
disease
to
require
strength
of
constitution
*punct* ,
no
need
of
toil
*punct* .
*break*
for
such
a
life
*punct* ,
what
we
should
call
the
weak
are
as
well
equipped
as
the
strong
*punct* ,
are
indeed
no
longer
weak
*punct* .
*break*
better
equipped
indeed
they
are
*punct* ,
for
the
strong
would
be
fretted
by
an
energy
for
which
there
was
no
outlet
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
buildings
i
saw
was
the
outcome
of
the
last
surgings
of
the
now
purposeless
energy
of
mankind
before
it
settled
down
into
perfect
harmony
with
the
conditions
under
which
it
lived
*mdash*
the
flourish
of
that
triumph
which
began
the
last
great
peace
*punct* .
*break*
this
has
ever
been
the
fate
of
energy
in
security
*punct* ;
it
takes
to
art
and
to
eroticism
*punct* ,
and
then
come
languor
and
decay
*punct* .
*break*
even
this
artistic
impetus
would
at
last
die
away
*mdash*
had
almost
died
in
the
time
i
saw
*punct* .
*break*
to
adorn
themselves
with
flowers
*punct* ,
to
dance
*punct* ,
to
sing
in
the
sunlight
*punct* :
so
much
was
left
of
the
artistic
spirit
*punct* ,
and
no
more
*punct* .
*break*
even
that
would
fade
in
the
end
into
a
contented
inactivity
*punct* .
*break*
we
are
kept
keen
on
the
grindstone
of
pain
and
necessity
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
it
seemed
to
me
*punct* ,
that
here
was
that
hateful
grindstone
broken
at
last
*punct* !
*break*
as
i
stood
there
in
the
gathering
dark
i
thought
that
in
this
simple
explanation
i
had
mastered
the
problem
of
the
world
*mdash*
mastered
the
whole
secret
of
these
delicious
people
*punct* .
*break*
possibly
the
checks
they
had
devised
for
the
increase
of
population
had
succeeded
too
well
*punct* ,
and
their
numbers
had
rather
diminished
than
kept
stationary
*punct* .
*break*
that
would
account
for
the
abandoned
ruins
*punct* .
*break*
very
simple
was
my
explanation
*punct* ,
and
plausible
enough
*mdash*
as
most
wrong
theories
are
*punct* !
*break*
as
i
stood
there
musing
over
this
too
perfect
triumph
of
man
*punct* ,
the
full
moon
*punct* ,
yellow
and
gibbous
*punct* ,
came
up
out
of
an
overflow
of
silver
light
in
the
north-east
*punct* .
*break*
the
bright
little
figures
ceased
to
move
about
below
*punct* ,
a
noiseless
owl
flitted
by
*punct* ,
and
i
shivered
with
the
chill
of
the
night
*punct* .
*break*
i
determined
to
descend
and
find
where
i
could
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
for
the
building
i
knew
*punct* .
*break*
then
my
eye
travelled
along
to
the
figure
of
the
white
sphinx
upon
the
pedestal
of
bronze
*punct* ,
growing
distinct
as
the
light
of
the
rising
moon
grew
brighter
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
see
the
silver
birch
against
it
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
the
tangle
of
rhododendron
bushes
*punct* ,
black
in
the
pale
light
*punct* ,
and
there
was
the
little
lawn
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
at
the
lawn
again
*punct* .
*break*
a
queer
doubt
chilled
my
complacency
*punct* .
*break*
no
*punct* ,
said
i
stoutly
to
myself
*punct* ,
that
was
not
the
lawn
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
was
the
lawn
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
white
leprous
face
of
the
sphinx
was
towards
it
*punct* .
*break*
can
you
imagine
what
i
felt
as
this
conviction
came
home
to
me
*punct* ?
*break*
but
you
cannot
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
machine
was
gone
*punct* !
*break*
at
once
*punct* ,
like
a
lash
across
the
face
*punct* ,
came
the
possibility
of
losing
my
own
age
*punct* ,
of
being
left
helpless
in
this
strange
new
world
*punct* .
*break*
the
bare
thought
of
it
was
an
actual
physical
sensation
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
feel
it
grip
me
at
the
throat
and
stop
my
breathing
*punct* .
*break*
in
another
moment
i
was
in
a
passion
of
fear
and
running
with
great
leaping
strides
down
the
slope
*punct* .
*break*
once
i
fell
headlong
and
cut
my
face
*punct* ;
i
lost
no
time
in
stanching
the
blood
*punct* ,
but
jumped
up
and
ran
on
*punct* ,
with
a
warm
trickle
down
my
cheek
and
chin
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
time
i
ran
i
was
saying
to
myself
*punct* :
they
have
moved
it
a
little
*punct* ,
pushed
it
under
the
bushes
out
of
the
way
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
*punct* ,
i
ran
with
all
my
might
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
time
*punct* ,
with
the
certainty
that
sometimes
comes
with
excessive
dread
*punct* ,
i
knew
that
such
assurance
was
folly
*punct* ,
knew
instinctively
that
the
machine
was
removed
out
of
my
reach
*punct* .
*break*
my
breath
came
with
pain
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
i
covered
the
whole
distance
from
the
hill
crest
to
the
little
lawn
*punct* ,
two
miles
perhaps
*punct* ,
in
ten
minutes
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
am
not
a
young
man
*punct* .
*break*
i
cursed
aloud
*punct* ,
as
i
ran
*punct* ,
at
my
confident
folly
in
leaving
the
machine
*punct* ,
wasting
good
breath
thereby
*punct* .
*break*
i
cried
aloud
*punct* ,
and
none
answered
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
creature
seemed
to
be
stirring
in
that
moonlit
world
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
reached
the
lawn
my
worst
fears
were
realized
*punct* .
*break*
not
a
trace
of
the
thing
was
to
be
seen
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
faint
and
cold
when
i
faced
the
empty
space
among
the
black
tangle
of
bushes
*punct* .
*break*
i
ran
round
it
furiously
*punct* ,
as
if
the
thing
might
be
hidden
in
a
corner
*punct* ,
and
then
stopped
abruptly
*punct* ,
with
my
hands
clutching
my
hair
*punct* .
*break*
above
me
towered
the
sphinx
*punct* ,
upon
the
bronze
pedestal
*punct* ,
white
*punct* ,
shining
*punct* ,
leprous
*punct* ,
in
the
light
of
the
rising
moon
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
to
smile
in
mockery
of
my
dismay
*punct* .
*break*
i
might
have
consoled
myself
by
imagining
the
little
people
had
put
the
mechanism
in
some
shelter
for
me
*punct* ,
had
i
not
felt
assured
of
their
physical
and
intellectual
inadequacy
*punct* .
*break*
that
is
what
dismayed
me
*punct* :
the
sense
of
some
hitherto
unsuspected
power
*punct* ,
through
whose
intervention
my
invention
had
vanished
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
for
one
thing
i
felt
assured
*punct* :
unless
some
other
age
had
produced
its
exact
duplicate
*punct* ,
the
machine
could
not
have
moved
in
time
*punct* .
*break*
the
attachment
of
the
levers
*mdash*
i
will
show
you
the
method
later
*mdash*
prevented
any
one
from
tampering
with
it
in
that
way
when
they
were
removed
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
moved
*punct* ,
and
was
hid
*punct* ,
only
in
space
*punct* .
*break*
but
then
*punct* ,
where
could
it
be
*punct* ?
*break*
i
think
i
must
have
had
a
kind
of
frenzy
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
running
violently
in
and
out
among
the
moonlit
bushes
all
round
the
sphinx
*punct* ,
and
startling
some
white
animal
that
*punct* ,
in
the
dim
light
*punct* ,
i
took
for
a
small
deer
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
late
that
night
*punct* ,
beating
the
bushes
with
my
clenched
fist
until
my
knuckles
were
gashed
and
bleeding
from
the
broken
twigs
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
sobbing
and
raving
in
my
anguish
of
mind
*punct* ,
i
went
down
to
the
great
building
of
stone
*punct* .
*break*
the
big
hall
was
dark
*punct* ,
silent
*punct* ,
and
deserted
*punct* .
*break*
i
slipped
on
the
uneven
floor
*punct* ,
and
fell
over
one
of
the
malachite
tables
*punct* ,
almost
breaking
my
shin
*punct* .
*break*
i
lit
a
match
and
went
on
past
the
dusty
curtains
*punct* ,
of
which
i
have
told
you
*punct* .
*break*
there
i
found
a
second
great
hall
covered
with
cushions
*punct* ,
upon
which
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
a
score
or
so
of
the
little
people
were
sleeping
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
doubt
they
found
my
second
appearance
strange
enough
*punct* ,
coming
suddenly
out
of
the
quiet
darkness
with
inarticulate
noises
and
the
splutter
and
flare
of
a
match
*punct* .
*break*
for
they
had
forgotten
about
matches
*punct* .
*break*
where
is
my
time
machine
*punct* ?
*break*
i
began
*punct* ,
bawling
like
an
angry
child
*punct* ,
laying
hands
upon
them
and
shaking
them
up
together
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
have
been
very
queer
to
them
*punct* .
*break*
some
laughed
*punct* ,
most
of
them
looked
sorely
frightened
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
saw
them
standing
round
me
*punct* ,
it
came
into
my
head
that
i
was
doing
as
foolish
a
thing
as
it
was
possible
for
me
to
do
under
the
circumstances
*punct* ,
in
trying
to
revive
the
sensation
of
fear
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
reasoning
from
their
daylight
behaviour
*punct* ,
i
thought
that
fear
must
be
forgotten
*punct* .
*break*
abruptly
*punct* ,
i
dashed
down
the
match
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
knocking
one
of
the
people
over
in
my
course
*punct* ,
went
blundering
across
the
big
dining-hall
again
*punct* ,
out
under
the
moonlight
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
cries
of
terror
and
their
little
feet
running
and
stumbling
this
way
and
that
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
remember
all
i
did
as
the
moon
crept
up
the
sky
*punct* .
*break*
i
suppose
it
was
the
unexpected
nature
of
my
loss
that
maddened
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
hopelessly
cut
off
from
my
own
kind
*mdash*
a
strange
animal
in
an
unknown
world
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
have
raved
to
and
fro
*punct* ,
screaming
and
crying
upon
god
and
fate
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
a
memory
of
horrible
fatigue
*punct* ,
as
the
long
night
of
despair
wore
away
*punct* ;
of
looking
in
this
impossible
place
and
that
*punct* ;
of
groping
among
moon-lit
ruins
and
touching
strange
creatures
in
the
black
shadows
*punct* ;
at
last
*punct* ,
of
lying
on
the
ground
near
the
sphinx
and
weeping
with
absolute
wretchedness
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
nothing
left
but
misery
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
slept
*punct* ,
and
when
i
woke
again
it
was
full
day
*punct* ,
and
a
couple
of
sparrows
were
hopping
round
me
on
the
turf
within
reach
of
my
arm
*punct* .
*break*
i
sat
up
in
the
freshness
of
the
morning
*punct* ,
trying
to
remember
how
i
had
got
there
*punct* ,
and
why
i
had
such
a
profound
sense
of
desertion
and
despair
*punct* .
*break*
then
things
came
clear
in
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
plain
*punct* ,
reasonable
daylight
*punct* ,
i
could
look
my
circumstances
fairly
in
the
face
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
the
wild
folly
of
my
frenzy
overnight
*punct* ,
and
i
could
reason
with
myself
*punct* .
*break*
suppose
the
worst
*punct* ?
*break*
suppose
the
machine
altogether
lost
*mdash*
perhaps
destroyed
*punct* ?
*break*
it
behooves
me
to
be
calm
and
patient
*punct* ,
to
learn
the
way
of
the
people
*punct* ,
to
get
a
clear
idea
of
the
method
of
my
loss
*punct* ,
and
the
means
of
getting
materials
and
tools
*punct* ;
so
that
in
the
end
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
i
may
make
another
*punct* .
*break*
that
would
be
my
only
hope
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
but
better
than
despair
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
after
all
*punct* ,
it
was
a
beautiful
and
curious
world
*punct* .
*break*
but
probably
*punct* ,
the
machine
had
only
been
taken
away
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
i
must
be
calm
and
patient
*punct* ,
find
its
hiding-place
*punct* ,
and
recover
it
by
force
or
cunning
*punct* .
*break*
and
with
that
i
scrambled
to
my
feet
and
looked
about
me
*punct* ,
wondering
where
i
could
bathe
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
weary
*punct* ,
stiff
*punct* ,
and
travel-soiled
*punct* .
*break*
the
freshness
of
the
morning
made
me
desire
an
equal
freshness
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
exhausted
my
emotion
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
as
i
went
about
my
business
*punct* ,
i
found
myself
wondering
at
my
intense
excitement
overnight
*punct* .
*break*
i
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
ground
about
the
little
lawn
*punct* .
*break*
i
wasted
some
time
in
futile
questionings
*punct* ,
conveyed
*punct* ,
as
well
as
i
was
able
*punct* ,
to
such
of
the
little
people
as
came
by
*punct* .
*break*
they
all
failed
to
understand
my
gestures
*punct* ;
some
were
simply
stolid
*punct* ,
some
thought
it
was
a
jest
and
laughed
at
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
the
hardest
task
in
the
world
to
keep
my
hands
off
their
pretty
laughing
faces
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
foolish
impulse
*punct* ,
but
the
devil
begotten
of
fear
and
blind
anger
was
ill
curbed
and
still
eager
to
take
advantage
of
my
perplexity
*punct* .
*break*
the
turf
gave
better
counsel
*punct* .
*break*
i
found
a
groove
ripped
in
it
*punct* ,
about
midway
between
the
pedestal
of
the
sphinx
and
the
marks
of
my
feet
where
*punct* ,
on
arrival
*punct* ,
i
had
struggled
with
the
overturned
machine
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
other
signs
of
removal
about
*punct* ,
with
queer
narrow
footprints
like
those
i
could
imagine
made
by
a
sloth
*punct* .
*break*
this
directed
my
closer
attention
to
the
pedestal
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
*punct* ,
as
i
think
i
have
said
*punct* ,
of
bronze
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
a
mere
block
*punct* ,
but
highly
decorated
with
deep
framed
panels
on
either
side
*punct* .
*break*
i
went
and
rapped
at
these
*punct* .
*break*
the
pedestal
was
hollow
*punct* .
*break*
examining
the
panels
with
care
i
found
them
discontinuous
with
the
frames
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
no
handles
or
keyholes
*punct* ,
but
possibly
the
panels
*punct* ,
if
they
were
doors
*punct* ,
as
i
supposed
*punct* ,
opened
from
within
*punct* .
*break*
one
thing
was
clear
enough
to
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
it
took
no
very
great
mental
effort
to
infer
that
my
time
machine
was
inside
that
pedestal
*punct* .
*break*
but
how
it
got
there
was
a
different
problem
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
the
heads
of
two
orange-clad
people
coming
through
the
bushes
and
under
some
blossom-covered
apple-trees
towards
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
turned
smiling
to
them
and
beckoned
them
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
they
came
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
pointing
to
the
bronze
pedestal
*punct* ,
i
tried
to
intimate
my
wish
to
open
it
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
my
first
gesture
towards
this
they
behaved
very
oddly
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
how
to
convey
their
expression
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
suppose
you
were
to
use
a
grossly
improper
gesture
to
a
delicate-minded
woman
*mdash*
it
is
how
she
would
look
*punct* .
*break*
they
went
off
as
if
they
had
received
the
last
possible
insult
*punct* .
*break*
i
tried
a
sweet-looking
little
chap
in
white
next
*punct* ,
with
exactly
the
same
result
*punct* .
*break*
somehow
*punct* ,
his
manner
made
me
feel
ashamed
of
myself
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
you
know
*punct* ,
i
wanted
the
time
machine
*punct* ,
and
i
tried
him
once
more
*punct* .
*break*
as
he
turned
off
*punct* ,
like
the
others
*punct* ,
my
temper
got
the
better
of
me
*punct* .
*break*
in
three
strides
i
was
after
him
*punct* ,
had
him
by
the
loose
part
of
his
robe
round
the
neck
*punct* ,
and
began
dragging
him
towards
the
sphinx
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
saw
the
horror
and
repugnance
of
his
face
*punct* ,
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
let
him
go
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
was
not
beaten
yet
*punct* .
*break*
i
banged
with
my
fist
at
the
bronze
panels
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
i
heard
something
stir
inside
*mdash*
to
be
explicit
*punct* ,
i
thought
i
heard
a
sound
like
a
chuckle
*mdash*
but
i
must
have
been
mistaken
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
got
a
big
pebble
from
the
river
*punct* ,
and
came
and
hammered
till
i
had
flattened
a
coil
in
the
decorations
*punct* ,
and
the
verdigris
came
off
in
powdery
flakes
*punct* .
*break*
the
delicate
little
people
must
have
heard
me
hammering
in
gusty
outbreaks
a
mile
away
on
either
hand
*punct* ,
but
nothing
came
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
a
crowd
of
them
upon
the
slopes
*punct* ,
looking
furtively
at
me
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
hot
and
tired
*punct* ,
i
sat
down
to
watch
the
place
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
was
too
restless
to
watch
long
*punct* ;
i
am
too
occidental
for
a
long
vigil
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
work
at
a
problem
for
years
*punct* ,
but
to
wait
inactive
for
twenty-four
hours
*mdash*
that
is
another
matter
*punct* .
*break*
i
got
up
after
a
time
*punct* ,
and
began
walking
aimlessly
through
the
bushes
towards
the
hill
again
*punct* .
*break*
patience
*punct* ,
said
i
to
myself
*punct* .
*break*
if
you
want
your
machine
again
you
must
leave
that
sphinx
alone
*punct* .
*break*
if
they
mean
to
take
your
machine
away
*punct* ,
it's
little
good
your
wrecking
their
bronze
panels
*punct* ,
and
if
they
don't
*punct* ,
you
will
get
it
back
as
soon
as
you
can
ask
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
to
sit
among
all
those
unknown
things
before
a
puzzle
like
that
is
hopeless
*punct* .
*break*
that
way
lies
monomania
*punct* .
*break*
face
this
world
*punct* .
*break*
learn
its
ways
*punct* ,
watch
it
*punct* ,
be
careful
of
too
hasty
guesses
at
its
meaning
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
end
you
will
find
clues
to
it
all
*punct* .
*break*
then
suddenly
the
humour
of
the
situation
came
into
my
mind
*punct* :
the
thought
of
the
years
i
had
spent
in
study
and
toil
to
get
into
the
future
age
*punct* ,
and
now
my
passion
of
anxiety
to
get
out
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
made
myself
the
most
complicated
and
the
most
hopeless
trap
that
ever
a
man
devised
*punct* .
*break*
although
it
was
at
my
own
expense
*punct* ,
i
could
not
help
myself
*punct* .
*break*
i
laughed
aloud
*punct* .
*break*
going
through
the
big
palace
*punct* ,
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
little
people
avoided
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
have
been
my
fancy
*punct* ,
or
it
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
my
hammering
at
the
gates
of
bronze
*punct* .
*break*
yet
i
felt
tolerably
sure
of
the
avoidance
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
careful
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
to
show
no
concern
and
to
abstain
from
any
pursuit
of
them
*punct* ,
and
in
the
course
of
a
day
or
two
things
got
back
to
the
old
footing
*punct* .
*break*
i
made
what
progress
i
could
in
the
language
*punct* ,
and
in
addition
i
pushed
my
explorations
here
and
there
*punct* .
*break*
either
i
missed
some
subtle
point
or
their
language
was
excessively
simple
*mdash*
almost
exclusively
composed
of
concrete
substantives
and
verbs
*punct* .
*break*
there
seemed
to
be
few
*punct* ,
if
any
*punct* ,
abstract
terms
*punct* ,
or
little
use
of
figurative
language
*punct* .
*break*
their
sentences
were
usually
simple
and
of
two
words
*punct* ,
and
i
failed
to
convey
or
understand
any
but
the
simplest
propositions
*punct* .
*break*
i
determined
to
put
the
thought
of
my
time
machine
and
the
mystery
of
the
bronze
doors
under
the
sphinx
as
much
as
possible
in
a
corner
of
memory
*punct* ,
until
my
growing
knowledge
would
lead
me
back
to
them
in
a
natural
way
*punct* .
*break*
yet
a
certain
feeling
*punct* ,
you
may
understand
*punct* ,
tethered
me
in
a
circle
of
a
few
miles
round
the
point
of
my
arrival
*punct* .
*break*
so
far
as
i
could
see
*punct* ,
all
the
world
displayed
the
same
exuberant
richness
as
the
thames
valley
*punct* .
*break*
from
every
hill
i
climbed
i
saw
the
same
abundance
of
splendid
buildings
*punct* ,
endlessly
varied
in
material
and
style
*punct* ,
the
same
clustering
thickets
of
evergreens
*punct* ,
the
same
blossom-laden
trees
and
tree-ferns
*punct* .
*break*
here
and
there
water
shone
like
silver
*punct* ,
and
beyond
*punct* ,
the
land
rose
into
blue
undulating
hills
*punct* ,
and
so
faded
into
the
serenity
of
the
sky
*punct* .
*break*
a
peculiar
feature
*punct* ,
which
presently
attracted
my
attention
*punct* ,
was
the
presence
of
certain
circular
wells
*punct* ,
several
*punct* ,
as
it
seemed
to
me
*punct* ,
of
a
very
great
depth
*punct* .
*break*
one
lay
by
the
path
up
the
hill
*punct* ,
which
i
had
followed
during
my
first
walk
*punct* .
*break*
like
the
others
*punct* ,
it
was
rimmed
with
bronze
*punct* ,
curiously
wrought
*punct* ,
and
protected
by
a
little
cupola
from
the
rain
*punct* .
*break*
sitting
by
the
side
of
these
wells
*punct* ,
and
peering
down
into
the
shafted
darkness
*punct* ,
i
could
see
no
gleam
of
water
*punct* ,
nor
could
i
start
any
reflection
with
a
lighted
match
*punct* .
*break*
but
in
all
of
them
i
heard
a
certain
sound
*punct* :
a
thud-thud-thud
*punct* ,
like
the
beating
of
some
big
engine
*punct* ;
and
i
discovered
*punct* ,
from
the
flaring
of
my
matches
*punct* ,
that
a
steady
current
of
air
set
down
the
shafts
*punct* .
*break*
further
*punct* ,
i
threw
a
scrap
of
paper
into
the
throat
of
one
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
instead
of
fluttering
slowly
down
*punct* ,
it
was
at
once
sucked
swiftly
out
of
sight
*punct* .
*break*
after
a
time
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
i
came
to
connect
these
wells
with
tall
towers
standing
here
and
there
upon
the
slopes
*punct* ;
for
above
them
there
was
often
just
such
a
flicker
in
the
air
as
one
sees
on
a
hot
day
above
a
sun-scorched
beach
*punct* .
*break*
putting
things
together
*punct* ,
i
reached
a
strong
suggestion
of
an
extensive
system
of
subterranean
ventilation
*punct* ,
whose
true
import
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
at
first
inclined
to
associate
it
with
the
sanitary
apparatus
of
these
people
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
an
obvious
conclusion
*punct* ,
but
it
was
absolutely
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
and
here
i
must
admit
that
i
learned
very
little
of
drains
and
bells
and
modes
of
conveyance
*punct* ,
and
the
like
conveniences
*punct* ,
during
my
time
in
this
real
future
*punct* .
*break*
in
some
of
these
visions
of
utopias
and
coming
times
which
i
have
read
*punct* ,
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
detail
about
building
*punct* ,
and
social
arrangements
*punct* ,
and
so
forth
*punct* .
*break*
but
while
such
details
are
easy
enough
to
obtain
when
the
whole
world
is
contained
in
one's
imagination
*punct* ,
they
are
altogether
inaccessible
to
a
real
traveller
amid
such
realities
as
i
found
here
*punct* .
*break*
conceive
the
tale
of
london
which
a
negro
*punct* ,
fresh
from
central
africa
*punct* ,
would
take
back
to
his
tribe
*punct* !
*break*
what
would
he
know
of
railway
companies
*punct* ,
of
social
movements
*punct* ,
of
telephone
and
telegraph
wires
*punct* ,
of
the
parcels
delivery
company
*punct* ,
and
postal
orders
and
the
like
*punct* ?
*break*
yet
we
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
should
be
willing
enough
to
explain
these
things
to
him
*punct* !
*break*
and
even
of
what
he
knew
*punct* ,
how
much
could
he
make
his
untravelled
friend
either
apprehend
or
believe
*punct* ?
*break*
then
*punct* ,
think
how
narrow
the
gap
between
a
negro
and
a
white
man
of
our
own
times
*punct* ,
and
how
wide
the
interval
between
myself
and
these
of
the
golden
age
*punct* !
*break*
i
was
sensible
of
much
which
was
unseen
*punct* ,
and
which
contributed
to
my
comfort
*punct* ;
but
save
for
a
general
impression
of
automatic
organization
*punct* ,
i
fear
i
can
convey
very
little
of
the
difference
to
your
mind
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
matter
of
sepulchre
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
i
could
see
no
signs
of
crematoria
nor
anything
suggestive
of
tombs
*punct* .
*break*
but
it
occurred
to
me
that
*punct* ,
possibly
*punct* ,
there
might
be
cemeteries
*punct* ,
or
crematoria
*punct* ,
somewhere
beyond
the
range
of
my
explorings
*punct* .
*break*
this
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
was
a
question
i
deliberately
put
to
myself
*punct* ,
and
my
curiosity
was
at
first
entirely
defeated
upon
the
point
*punct* .
*break*
the
thing
puzzled
me
*punct* ,
and
i
was
led
to
make
a
further
remark
*punct* ,
which
puzzled
me
still
more
*punct* :
that
aged
and
infirm
among
this
people
there
were
none
*punct* .
*break*
i
must
confess
that
my
satisfaction
with
my
first
theories
of
an
automatic
civilization
and
a
decadent
humanity
did
not
long
endure
*punct* .
*break*
yet
i
could
think
of
no
other
*punct* .
*break*
let
me
put
my
difficulties
*punct* .
*break*
the
several
big
palaces
i
had
explored
were
mere
living
places
*punct* ,
great
dining-halls
and
sleeping
apartments
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
find
no
machinery
*punct* ,
no
appliances
of
any
kind
*punct* .
*break*
yet
these
people
were
clothed
in
pleasant
fabrics
that
must
at
times
need
renewal
*punct* ,
and
their
sandals
*punct* ,
though
undecorated
*punct* ,
were
fairly
complex
specimens
of
metalwork
*punct* .
*break*
somehow
such
things
must
be
made
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
little
people
displayed
no
vestige
of
a
creative
tendency
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
no
shops
*punct* ,
no
workshops
*punct* ,
no
sign
of
importations
among
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
spent
all
their
time
in
playing
gently
*punct* ,
in
bathing
in
the
river
*punct* ,
in
making
love
in
a
half-playful
fashion
*punct* ,
in
eating
fruit
and
sleeping
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
see
how
things
were
kept
going
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
again
*punct* ,
about
the
time
machine
*punct* :
something
*punct* ,
i
knew
not
what
*punct* ,
had
taken
it
into
the
hollow
pedestal
of
the
white
sphinx
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
imagine
*punct* .
*break*
those
waterless
wells
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
those
flickering
pillars
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
i
lacked
a
clue
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
*mdash*
how
shall
i
put
it
*punct* ?
*break*
suppose
you
found
an
inscription
*punct* ,
with
sentences
here
and
there
in
excellent
plain
english
*punct* ,
and
interpolated
therewith
*punct* ,
others
made
up
of
words
*punct* ,
of
letters
even
*punct* ,
absolutely
unknown
to
you
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*punct* ,
on
the
third
day
of
my
visit
*punct* ,
that
was
how
the
world
of
eight
hundred
and
two
thousand
seven
hundred
and
one
presented
itself
to
me
*punct* !
*break*
that
day
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
i
made
a
friend
*mdash*
of
a
sort
*punct* .
*break*
it
happened
that
*punct* ,
as
i
was
watching
some
of
the
little
people
bathing
in
a
shallow
*punct* ,
one
of
them
was
seized
with
cramp
and
began
drifting
downstream
*punct* .
*break*
the
main
current
ran
rather
swiftly
*punct* ,
but
not
too
strongly
for
even
a
moderate
swimmer
*punct* .
*break*
it
will
give
you
an
idea
*punct* ,
therefore
*punct* ,
of
the
strange
deficiency
in
these
creatures
*punct* ,
when
i
tell
you
that
none
made
the
slightest
attempt
to
rescue
the
weakly
crying
little
thing
which
was
drowning
before
their
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
realized
this
*punct* ,
i
hurriedly
slipped
off
my
clothes
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
wading
in
at
a
point
lower
down
*punct* ,
i
caught
the
poor
mite
and
drew
her
safe
to
land
*punct* .
*break*
a
little
rubbing
of
the
limbs
soon
brought
her
round
*punct* ,
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
she
was
all
right
before
i
left
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
got
to
such
a
low
estimate
of
her
kind
that
i
did
not
expect
any
gratitude
from
her
*punct* .
*break*
in
that
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
i
was
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
this
happened
in
the
morning
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
afternoon
i
met
my
little
woman
*punct* ,
as
i
believe
it
was
*punct* ,
as
i
was
returning
towards
my
centre
from
an
exploration
*punct* ,
and
she
received
me
with
cries
of
delight
and
presented
me
with
a
big
garland
of
flowers
*mdash*
evidently
made
for
me
and
me
alone
*punct* .
*break*
the
thing
took
my
imagination
*punct* .
*break*
very
possibly
i
had
been
feeling
desolate
*punct* .
*break*
at
any
rate
i
did
my
best
to
display
my
appreciation
of
the
gift
*punct* .
*break*
we
were
soon
seated
together
in
a
little
stone
arbour
*punct* ,
engaged
in
conversation
*punct* ,
chiefly
of
smiles
*punct* .
*break*
the
creature's
friendliness
affected
me
exactly
as
a
child's
might
have
done
*punct* .
*break*
we
passed
each
other
flowers
*punct* ,
and
she
kissed
my
hands
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
the
same
to
hers
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
tried
talk
*punct* ,
and
found
that
her
name
was
weena
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
though
i
don't
know
what
it
meant
*punct* ,
somehow
seemed
appropriate
enough
*punct* .
*break*
that
was
the
beginning
of
a
queer
friendship
which
lasted
a
week
*punct* ,
and
ended
*mdash*
as
i
will
tell
you
*punct* !
*break*
she
was
exactly
like
a
child
*punct* .
*break*
she
wanted
to
be
with
me
always
*punct* .
*break*
she
tried
to
follow
me
everywhere
*punct* ,
and
on
my
next
journey
out
and
about
it
went
to
my
heart
to
tire
her
down
*punct* ,
and
leave
her
at
last
*punct* ,
exhausted
and
calling
after
me
rather
plaintively
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
problems
of
the
world
had
to
be
mastered
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
not
*punct* ,
i
said
to
myself
*punct* ,
come
into
the
future
to
carry
on
a
miniature
flirtation
*punct* .
*break*
yet
her
distress
when
i
left
her
was
very
great
*punct* ,
her
expostulations
at
the
parting
were
sometimes
frantic
*punct* ,
and
i
think
*punct* ,
altogether
*punct* ,
i
had
as
much
trouble
as
comfort
from
her
devotion
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
she
was
*punct* ,
somehow
*punct* ,
a
very
great
comfort
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
it
was
mere
childish
affection
that
made
her
cling
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
until
it
was
too
late
*punct* ,
i
did
not
clearly
know
what
i
had
inflicted
upon
her
when
i
left
her
*punct* .
*break*
nor
until
it
was
too
late
did
i
clearly
understand
what
she
was
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
for
*punct* ,
by
merely
seeming
fond
of
me
*punct* ,
and
showing
in
her
weak
*punct* ,
futile
way
that
she
cared
for
me
*punct* ,
the
little
doll
of
a
creature
presently
gave
my
return
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
white
sphinx
almost
the
feeling
of
coming
home
*punct* ;
and
i
would
watch
for
her
tiny
figure
of
white
and
gold
so
soon
as
i
came
over
the
hill
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
from
her
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
that
i
learned
that
fear
had
not
yet
left
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
fearless
enough
in
the
daylight
*punct* ,
and
she
had
the
oddest
confidence
in
me
*punct* ;
for
once
*punct* ,
in
a
foolish
moment
*punct* ,
i
made
threatening
grimaces
at
her
*punct* ,
and
she
simply
laughed
at
them
*punct* .
*break*
but
she
dreaded
the
dark
*punct* ,
dreaded
shadows
*punct* ,
dreaded
black
things
*punct* .
*break*
darkness
to
her
was
the
one
thing
dreadful
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
singularly
passionate
emotion
*punct* ,
and
it
set
me
thinking
and
observing
*punct* .
*break*
i
discovered
then
*punct* ,
among
other
things
*punct* ,
that
these
little
people
gathered
into
the
great
houses
after
dark
*punct* ,
and
slept
in
droves
*punct* .
*break*
to
enter
upon
them
without
a
light
was
to
put
them
into
a
tumult
of
apprehension
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
found
one
out
of
doors
*punct* ,
or
one
sleeping
alone
within
doors
*punct* ,
after
dark
*punct* .
*break*
yet
i
was
still
such
a
blockhead
that
i
missed
the
lesson
of
that
fear
*punct* ,
and
in
spite
of
weena's
distress
i
insisted
upon
sleeping
away
from
these
slumbering
multitudes
*punct* .
*break*
it
troubled
her
greatly
*punct* ,
but
in
the
end
her
odd
affection
for
me
triumphed
*punct* ,
and
for
five
of
the
nights
of
our
acquaintance
*punct* ,
including
the
last
night
of
all
*punct* ,
she
slept
with
her
head
pillowed
on
my
arm
*punct* .
*break*
but
my
story
slips
away
from
me
as
i
speak
of
her
*punct* .
*break*
it
must
have
been
the
night
before
her
rescue
that
i
was
awakened
about
dawn
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
been
restless
*punct* ,
dreaming
most
disagreeably
that
i
was
drowned
*punct* ,
and
that
sea
anemones
were
feeling
over
my
face
with
their
soft
palps
*punct* .
*break*
i
woke
with
a
start
*punct* ,
and
with
an
odd
fancy
that
some
greyish
animal
had
just
rushed
out
of
the
chamber
*punct* .
*break*
i
tried
to
get
to
sleep
again
*punct* ,
but
i
felt
restless
and
uncomfortable
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
that
dim
grey
hour
when
things
are
just
creeping
out
of
darkness
*punct* ,
when
everything
is
colourless
and
clear
cut
*punct* ,
and
yet
unreal
*punct* .
*break*
i
got
up
*punct* ,
and
went
down
into
the
great
hall
*punct* ,
and
so
out
upon
the
flagstones
in
front
of
the
palace
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
i
would
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
*punct* ,
and
see
the
sunrise
*punct* .
*break*
the
moon
was
setting
*punct* ,
and
the
dying
moonlight
and
the
first
pallor
of
dawn
were
mingled
in
a
ghastly
half-light
*punct* .
*break*
the
bushes
were
inky
black
*punct* ,
the
ground
a
sombre
grey
*punct* ,
the
sky
colourless
and
cheerless
*punct* .
*break*
and
up
the
hill
i
thought
i
could
see
ghosts
*punct* .
*break*
there
several
times
*punct* ,
as
i
scanned
the
slope
*punct* ,
i
saw
white
figures
*punct* .
*break*
twice
i
fancied
i
saw
a
solitary
white
*punct* ,
ape-like
creature
running
rather
quickly
up
the
hill
*punct* ,
and
once
near
the
ruins
i
saw
a
leash
of
them
carrying
some
dark
body
*punct* .
*break*
they
moved
hastily
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
not
see
what
became
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
that
they
vanished
among
the
bushes
*punct* .
*break*
the
dawn
was
still
indistinct
*punct* ,
you
must
understand
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
feeling
that
chill
*punct* ,
uncertain
*punct* ,
early-morning
feeling
you
may
have
known
*punct* .
*break*
i
doubted
my
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
eastern
sky
grew
brighter
*punct* ,
and
the
light
of
the
day
came
on
and
its
vivid
colouring
returned
upon
the
world
once
more
*punct* ,
i
scanned
the
view
keenly
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
saw
no
vestige
of
my
white
figures
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
mere
creatures
of
the
half
light
*punct* .
*break*
they
must
have
been
ghosts
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ;
i
wonder
whence
they
dated
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
queer
notion
of
grant
allen's
came
into
my
head
*punct* ,
and
amused
me
*punct* .
*break*
if
each
generation
die
and
leave
ghosts
*punct* ,
he
argued
*punct* ,
the
world
at
last
will
get
overcrowded
with
them
*punct* .
*break*
on
that
theory
they
would
have
grown
innumerable
some
eight
hundred
thousand
years
hence
*punct* ,
and
it
was
no
great
wonder
to
see
four
at
once
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
jest
was
unsatisfying
*punct* ,
and
i
was
thinking
of
these
figures
all
the
morning
*punct* ,
until
weena's
rescue
drove
them
out
of
my
head
*punct* .
*break*
i
associated
them
in
some
indefinite
way
with
the
white
animal
i
had
startled
in
my
first
passionate
search
for
the
time
machine
*punct* .
*break*
but
weena
was
a
pleasant
substitute
*punct* .
*break*
yet
all
the
same
*punct* ,
they
were
soon
destined
to
take
far
deadlier
possession
of
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
i
have
said
how
much
hotter
than
our
own
was
the
weather
of
this
golden
age
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
account
for
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
be
that
the
sun
was
hotter
*punct* ,
or
the
earth
nearer
the
sun
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
usual
to
assume
that
the
sun
will
go
on
cooling
steadily
in
the
future
*punct* .
*break*
but
people
*punct* ,
unfamiliar
with
such
speculations
as
those
of
the
younger
darwin
*punct* ,
forget
that
the
planets
must
ultimately
fall
back
one
by
one
into
the
parent
body
*punct* .
*break*
as
these
catastrophes
occur
*punct* ,
the
sun
will
blaze
with
renewed
energy
*punct* ;
and
it
may
be
that
some
inner
planet
had
suffered
this
fate
*punct* .
*break*
whatever
the
reason
*punct* ,
the
fact
remains
that
the
sun
was
very
much
hotter
than
we
know
it
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
one
very
hot
morning
*mdash*
my
fourth
*punct* ,
i
think
*mdash*
as
i
was
seeking
shelter
from
the
heat
and
glare
in
a
colossal
ruin
near
the
great
house
where
i
slept
and
fed
*punct* ,
there
happened
this
strange
thing
*punct* :
clambering
among
these
heaps
of
masonry
*punct* ,
i
found
a
narrow
gallery
*punct* ,
whose
end
and
side
windows
were
blocked
by
fallen
masses
of
stone
*punct* .
*break*
by
contrast
with
the
brilliancy
outside
*punct* ,
it
seemed
at
first
impenetrably
dark
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
entered
it
groping
*punct* ,
for
the
change
from
light
to
blackness
made
spots
of
colour
swim
before
me
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
i
halted
spellbound
*punct* .
*break*
a
pair
of
eyes
*punct* ,
luminous
by
reflection
against
the
daylight
without
*punct* ,
was
watching
me
out
of
the
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
the
old
instinctive
dread
of
wild
beasts
came
upon
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
clenched
my
hands
and
steadfastly
looked
into
the
glaring
eyeballs
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
afraid
to
turn
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
thought
of
the
absolute
security
in
which
humanity
appeared
to
be
living
came
to
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
i
remembered
that
strange
terror
of
the
dark
*punct* .
*break*
overcoming
my
fear
to
some
extent
*punct* ,
i
advanced
a
step
and
spoke
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
admit
that
my
voice
was
harsh
and
ill-controlled
*punct* .
*break*
i
put
out
my
hand
and
touched
something
soft
*punct* .
*break*
at
once
the
eyes
darted
sideways
*punct* ,
and
something
white
ran
past
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
turned
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
*punct* ,
and
saw
a
queer
little
ape-like
figure
*punct* ,
its
head
held
down
in
a
peculiar
manner
*punct* ,
running
across
the
sunlit
space
behind
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
blundered
against
a
block
of
granite
*punct* ,
staggered
aside
*punct* ,
and
in
a
moment
was
hidden
in
a
black
shadow
beneath
another
pile
of
ruined
masonry
*punct* .
*break*
my
impression
of
it
is
*punct* ,
of
course
*punct* ,
imperfect
*punct* ;
but
i
know
it
was
a
dull
white
*punct* ,
and
had
strange
large
greyish-red
eyes
*punct* ;
also
that
there
was
flaxen
hair
on
its
head
and
down
its
back
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
i
say
*punct* ,
it
went
too
fast
for
me
to
see
distinctly
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
even
say
whether
it
ran
on
all-fours
*punct* ,
or
only
with
its
forearms
held
very
low
*punct* .
*break*
after
an
instant's
pause
i
followed
it
into
the
second
heap
of
ruins
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
find
it
at
first
*punct* ;
but
*punct* ,
after
a
time
in
the
profound
obscurity
*punct* ,
i
came
upon
one
of
those
round
well-like
openings
of
which
i
have
told
you
*punct* ,
half
closed
by
a
fallen
pillar
*punct* .
*break*
a
sudden
thought
came
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
could
this
thing
have
vanished
down
the
shaft
*punct* ?
*break*
i
lit
a
match
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
looking
down
*punct* ,
i
saw
a
small
*punct* ,
white
*punct* ,
moving
creature
*punct* ,
with
large
bright
eyes
which
regarded
me
steadfastly
as
it
retreated
*punct* .
*break*
it
made
me
shudder
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
so
like
a
human
spider
*punct* !
*break*
it
was
clambering
down
the
wall
*punct* ,
and
now
i
saw
for
the
first
time
a
number
of
metal
foot
and
hand
rests
forming
a
kind
of
ladder
down
the
shaft
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
light
burned
my
fingers
and
fell
out
of
my
hand
*punct* ,
going
out
as
it
dropped
*punct* ,
and
when
i
had
lit
another
the
little
monster
had
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
sat
peering
down
that
well
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
for
some
time
that
i
could
succeed
in
persuading
myself
that
the
thing
i
had
seen
was
human
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
gradually
*punct* ,
the
truth
dawned
on
me
*punct* :
that
man
had
not
remained
one
species
*punct* ,
but
had
differentiated
into
two
distinct
animals
*punct* :
that
my
graceful
children
of
the
upper-world
were
not
the
sole
descendants
of
our
generation
*punct* ,
but
that
this
bleached
*punct* ,
obscene
*punct* ,
nocturnal
thing
*punct* ,
which
had
flashed
before
me
*punct* ,
was
also
heir
to
all
the
ages
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
of
the
flickering
pillars
and
of
my
theory
of
an
underground
ventilation
*punct* .
*break*
i
began
to
suspect
their
true
import
*punct* .
*break*
and
what
*punct* ,
i
wondered
*punct* ,
was
this
lemur
doing
in
my
scheme
of
a
perfectly
balanced
organization
*punct* ?
*break*
how
was
it
related
to
the
indolent
serenity
of
the
beautiful
upper-worlders
*punct* ?
*break*
and
what
was
hidden
down
there
*punct* ,
at
the
foot
of
that
shaft
*punct* ?
*break*
i
sat
upon
the
edge
of
the
well
telling
myself
that
*punct* ,
at
any
rate
*punct* ,
there
was
nothing
to
fear
*punct* ,
and
that
there
i
must
descend
for
the
solution
of
my
difficulties
*punct* .
*break*
and
withal
i
was
absolutely
afraid
to
go
*punct* !
*break*
as
i
hesitated
*punct* ,
two
of
the
beautiful
upper-world
people
came
running
in
their
amorous
sport
across
the
daylight
in
the
shadow
*punct* .
*break*
the
male
pursued
the
female
*punct* ,
flinging
flowers
at
her
as
he
ran
*punct* .
*break*
they
seemed
distressed
to
find
me
*punct* ,
my
arm
against
the
overturned
pillar
*punct* ,
peering
down
the
well
*punct* .
*break*
apparently
it
was
considered
bad
form
to
remark
these
apertures
*punct* ;
for
when
i
pointed
to
this
one
*punct* ,
and
tried
to
frame
a
question
about
it
in
their
tongue
*punct* ,
they
were
still
more
visibly
distressed
and
turned
away
*punct* .
*break*
but
they
were
interested
by
my
matches
*punct* ,
and
i
struck
some
to
amuse
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
tried
them
again
about
the
well
*punct* ,
and
again
i
failed
*punct* .
*break*
so
presently
i
left
them
*punct* ,
meaning
to
go
back
to
weena
*punct* ,
and
see
what
i
could
get
from
her
*punct* .
*break*
but
my
mind
was
already
in
revolution
*punct* ;
my
guesses
and
impressions
were
slipping
and
sliding
to
a
new
adjustment
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
now
a
clue
to
the
import
of
these
wells
*punct* ,
to
the
ventilating
towers
*punct* ,
to
the
mystery
of
the
ghosts
*punct* ;
to
say
nothing
of
a
hint
at
the
meaning
of
the
bronze
gates
and
the
fate
of
the
time
machine
*punct* !
*break*
and
very
vaguely
there
came
a
suggestion
towards
the
solution
of
the
economic
problem
that
had
puzzled
me
*punct* .
*break*
here
was
the
new
view
*punct* .
*break*
plainly
*punct* ,
this
second
species
of
man
was
subterranean
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
three
circumstances
in
particular
which
made
me
think
that
its
rare
emergence
above
ground
was
the
outcome
of
a
long-continued
underground
habit
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
first
place
*punct* ,
there
was
the
bleached
look
common
in
most
animals
that
live
largely
in
the
dark
*mdash*
the
white
fish
of
the
kentucky
caves
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
those
large
eyes
*punct* ,
with
that
capacity
for
reflecting
light
*punct* ,
are
common
features
of
nocturnal
things
*mdash*
witness
the
owl
and
the
cat
*punct* .
*break*
and
last
of
all
*punct* ,
that
evident
confusion
in
the
sunshine
*punct* ,
that
hasty
yet
fumbling
awkward
flight
towards
dark
shadow
*punct* ,
and
that
peculiar
carriage
of
the
head
while
in
the
light
*mdash*
all
reinforced
the
theory
of
an
extreme
sensitiveness
of
the
retina
*punct* .
*break*
beneath
my
feet
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
the
earth
must
be
tunnelled
enormously
*punct* ,
and
these
tunnellings
were
the
habitat
of
the
new
race
*punct* .
*break*
the
presence
of
ventilating
shafts
and
wells
along
the
hill
slopes
*mdash*
everywhere
*punct* ,
in
fact
except
along
the
river
valley
*mdash*
showed
how
universal
were
its
ramifications
*punct* .
*break*
what
so
natural
*punct* ,
then
*punct* ,
as
to
assume
that
it
was
in
this
artificial
underworld
that
such
work
as
was
necessary
to
the
comfort
of
the
daylight
race
was
done
*punct* ?
*break*
the
notion
was
so
plausible
that
i
at
once
accepted
it
*punct* ,
and
went
on
to
assume
the
how
of
this
splitting
of
the
human
species
*punct* .
*break*
i
dare
say
you
will
anticipate
the
shape
of
my
theory
*punct* ;
though
*punct* ,
for
myself
*punct* ,
i
very
soon
felt
that
it
fell
far
short
of
the
truth
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
*punct* ,
proceeding
from
the
problems
of
our
own
age
*punct* ,
it
seemed
clear
as
daylight
to
me
that
the
gradual
widening
of
the
present
merely
temporary
and
social
difference
between
the
capitalist
and
the
labourer
*punct* ,
was
the
key
to
the
whole
position
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
it
will
seem
grotesque
enough
to
you
*mdash*
and
wildly
incredible
*punct* !
*break*
*mdash*
and
yet
even
now
there
are
existing
circumstances
to
point
that
way
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
a
tendency
to
utilize
underground
space
for
the
less
ornamental
purposes
of
civilization
*punct* ;
there
is
the
metropolitan
railway
in
london
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
there
are
new
electric
railways
*punct* ,
there
are
subways
*punct* ,
there
are
underground
workrooms
and
restaurants
*punct* ,
and
they
increase
and
multiply
*punct* .
*break*
evidently
*punct* ,
i
thought
*punct* ,
this
tendency
had
increased
till
industry
had
gradually
lost
its
birthright
in
the
sky
*punct* .
*break*
i
mean
that
it
had
gone
deeper
and
deeper
into
larger
and
ever
larger
underground
factories
*punct* ,
spending
a
still-increasing
amount
of
its
time
therein
*punct* ,
till
*punct* ,
in
the
end
*mdash*
*punct* !
*break*
even
now
*punct* ,
does
not
an
east-end
worker
live
in
such
artificial
conditions
as
practically
to
be
cut
off
from
the
natural
surface
of
the
earth
*punct* ?
*break*
again
*punct* ,
the
exclusive
tendency
of
richer
people
*mdash*
due
*punct* ,
no
doubt
*punct* ,
to
the
increasing
refinement
of
their
education
*punct* ,
and
the
widening
gulf
between
them
and
the
rude
violence
of
the
poor
*mdash*
is
already
leading
to
the
closing
*punct* ,
in
their
interest
*punct* ,
of
considerable
portions
of
the
surface
of
the
land
*punct* .
*break*
about
london
*punct* ,
for
instance
*punct* ,
perhaps
half
the
prettier
country
is
shut
in
against
intrusion
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
same
widening
gulf
*mdash*
which
is
due
to
the
length
and
expense
of
the
higher
educational
process
and
the
increased
facilities
for
and
temptations
towards
refined
habits
on
the
part
of
the
rich
*mdash*
will
make
that
exchange
between
class
and
class
*punct* ,
that
promotion
by
intermarriage
which
at
present
retards
the
splitting
of
our
species
along
lines
of
social
stratification
*punct* ,
less
and
less
frequent
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
in
the
end
*punct* ,
above
ground
you
must
have
the
haves
*punct* ,
pursuing
pleasure
and
comfort
and
beauty
*punct* ,
and
below
ground
the
have-nots
*punct* ,
the
workers
getting
continually
adapted
to
the
conditions
of
their
labour
*punct* .
*break*
once
they
were
there
*punct* ,
they
would
no
doubt
have
to
pay
rent
*punct* ,
and
not
a
little
of
it
*punct* ,
for
the
ventilation
of
their
caverns
*punct* ;
and
if
they
refused
*punct* ,
they
would
starve
or
be
suffocated
for
arrears
*punct* .
*break*
such
of
them
as
were
so
constituted
as
to
be
miserable
and
rebellious
would
die
*punct* ;
and
*punct* ,
in
the
end
*punct* ,
the
balance
being
permanent
*punct* ,
the
survivors
would
become
as
well
adapted
to
the
conditions
of
underground
life
*punct* ,
and
as
happy
in
their
way
*punct* ,
as
the
upper-world
people
were
to
theirs
*punct* .
*break*
as
it
seemed
to
me
*punct* ,
the
refined
beauty
and
the
etiolated
pallor
followed
naturally
enough
*punct* .
*break*
the
great
triumph
of
humanity
i
had
dreamed
of
took
a
different
shape
in
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
been
no
such
triumph
of
moral
education
and
general
co-operation
as
i
had
imagined
*punct* .
*break*
instead
*punct* ,
i
saw
a
real
aristocracy
*punct* ,
armed
with
a
perfected
science
and
working
to
a
logical
conclusion
the
industrial
system
of
to-day
*punct* .
*break*
its
triumph
had
not
been
simply
a
triumph
over
nature
*punct* ,
but
a
triumph
over
nature
and
the
fellow-man
*punct* .
*break*
this
*punct* ,
i
must
warn
you
*punct* ,
was
my
theory
at
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
no
convenient
cicerone
in
the
pattern
of
the
utopian
books
*punct* .
*break*
my
explanation
may
be
absolutely
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
i
still
think
it
is
the
most
plausible
one
*punct* .
*break*
but
even
on
this
supposition
the
balanced
civilization
that
was
at
last
attained
must
have
long
since
passed
its
zenith
*punct* ,
and
was
now
far
fallen
into
decay
*punct* .
*break*
the
too-perfect
security
of
the
upper-worlders
had
led
them
to
a
slow
movement
of
degeneration
*punct* ,
to
a
general
dwindling
in
size
*punct* ,
strength
*punct* ,
and
intelligence
*punct* .
*break*
that
i
could
see
clearly
enough
already
*punct* .
*break*
what
had
happened
to
the
under-grounders
i
did
not
yet
suspect
*punct* ;
but
from
what
i
had
seen
of
the
morlocks
*mdash*
that
*punct* ,
by
the
by
*punct* ,
was
the
name
by
which
these
creatures
were
called
*mdash*
i
could
imagine
that
the
modification
of
the
human
type
was
even
far
more
profound
than
among
the
eloi
*punct* ,
the
beautiful
race
that
i
already
knew
*punct* .
*break*
then
came
troublesome
doubts
*punct* .
*break*
why
had
the
morlocks
taken
my
time
machine
*punct* ?
*break*
for
i
felt
sure
it
was
they
who
had
taken
it
*punct* .
*break*
why
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
if
the
eloi
were
masters
*punct* ,
could
they
not
restore
the
machine
to
me
*punct* ?
*break*
and
why
were
they
so
terribly
afraid
of
the
dark
*punct* ?
*break*
i
proceeded
*punct* ,
as
i
have
said
*punct* ,
to
question
weena
about
this
under-world
*punct* ,
but
here
again
i
was
disappointed
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
she
would
not
understand
my
questions
*punct* ,
and
presently
she
refused
to
answer
them
*punct* .
*break*
she
shivered
as
though
the
topic
was
unendurable
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
i
pressed
her
*punct* ,
perhaps
a
little
harshly
*punct* ,
she
burst
into
tears
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
the
only
tears
*punct* ,
except
my
own
*punct* ,
i
ever
saw
in
that
golden
age
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
saw
them
i
ceased
abruptly
to
trouble
about
the
morlocks
*punct* ,
and
was
only
concerned
in
banishing
these
signs
of
the
human
inheritance
from
weena's
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
and
very
soon
she
was
smiling
and
clapping
her
hands
*punct* ,
while
i
solemnly
burned
a
match
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
seem
odd
to
you
*punct* ,
but
it
was
two
days
before
i
could
follow
up
the
new-found
clue
in
what
was
manifestly
the
proper
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
a
peculiar
shrinking
from
those
pallid
bodies
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
just
the
half-bleached
colour
of
the
worms
and
things
one
sees
preserved
in
spirit
in
a
zoological
museum
*punct* .
*break*
and
they
were
filthily
cold
to
the
touch
*punct* .
*break*
probably
my
shrinking
was
largely
due
to
the
sympathetic
influence
of
the
eloi
*punct* ,
whose
disgust
of
the
morlocks
i
now
began
to
appreciate
*punct* .
*break*
the
next
night
i
did
not
sleep
well
*punct* .
*break*
probably
my
health
was
a
little
disordered
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
oppressed
with
perplexity
and
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
once
or
twice
i
had
a
feeling
of
intense
fear
for
which
i
could
perceive
no
definite
reason
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
creeping
noiselessly
into
the
great
hall
where
the
little
people
were
sleeping
in
the
moonlight
*mdash*
that
night
weena
was
among
them
*mdash*
and
feeling
reassured
by
their
presence
*punct* .
*break*
it
occurred
to
me
even
then
*punct* ,
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
the
moon
must
pass
through
its
last
quarter
*punct* ,
and
the
nights
grow
dark
*punct* ,
when
the
appearances
of
these
unpleasant
creatures
from
below
*punct* ,
these
whitened
lemurs
*punct* ,
this
new
vermin
that
had
replaced
the
old
*punct* ,
might
be
more
abundant
*punct* .
*break*
and
on
both
these
days
i
had
the
restless
feeling
of
one
who
shirks
an
inevitable
duty
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
assured
that
the
time
machine
was
only
to
be
recovered
by
boldly
penetrating
these
underground
mysteries
*punct* .
*break*
yet
i
could
not
face
the
mystery
*punct* .
*break*
if
only
i
had
had
a
companion
it
would
have
been
different
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
was
so
horribly
alone
*punct* ,
and
even
to
clamber
down
into
the
darkness
of
the
well
appalled
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
if
you
will
understand
my
feeling
*punct* ,
but
i
never
felt
quite
safe
at
my
back
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
this
restlessness
*punct* ,
this
insecurity
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
that
drove
me
further
and
further
afield
in
my
exploring
expeditions
*punct* .
*break*
going
to
the
south-westward
towards
the
rising
country
that
is
now
called
combe
wood
*punct* ,
i
observed
far
off
*punct* ,
in
the
direction
of
nineteenth-century
banstead
*punct* ,
a
vast
green
structure
*punct* ,
different
in
character
from
any
i
had
hitherto
seen
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
larger
than
the
largest
of
the
palaces
or
ruins
i
knew
*punct* ,
and
the
facade
had
an
oriental
look
*punct* :
the
face
of
it
having
the
lustre
*punct* ,
as
well
as
the
pale-green
tint
*punct* ,
a
kind
of
bluish-green
*punct* ,
of
a
certain
type
of
chinese
porcelain
*punct* .
*break*
this
difference
in
aspect
suggested
a
difference
in
use
*punct* ,
and
i
was
minded
to
push
on
and
explore
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
day
was
growing
late
*punct* ,
and
i
had
come
upon
the
sight
of
the
place
after
a
long
and
tiring
circuit
*punct* ;
so
i
resolved
to
hold
over
the
adventure
for
the
following
day
*punct* ,
and
i
returned
to
the
welcome
and
the
caresses
of
little
weena
*punct* .
*break*
but
next
morning
i
perceived
clearly
enough
that
my
curiosity
regarding
the
palace
of
green
porcelain
was
a
piece
of
self-deception
*punct* ,
to
enable
me
to
shirk
*punct* ,
by
another
day
*punct* ,
an
experience
i
dreaded
*punct* .
*break*
i
resolved
i
would
make
the
descent
without
further
waste
of
time
*punct* ,
and
started
out
in
the
early
morning
towards
a
well
near
the
ruins
of
granite
and
aluminium
*punct* .
*break*
little
weena
ran
with
me
*punct* .
*break*
she
danced
beside
me
to
the
well
*punct* ,
but
when
she
saw
me
lean
over
the
mouth
and
look
downward
*punct* ,
she
seemed
strangely
disconcerted
*punct* .
*break*
good-bye
*punct* ,
little
weena
*punct* ,
i
said
*punct* ,
kissing
her
*punct* ;
and
then
putting
her
down
*punct* ,
i
began
to
feel
over
the
parapet
for
the
climbing
hooks
*punct* .
*break*
rather
hastily
*punct* ,
i
may
as
well
confess
*punct* ,
for
i
feared
my
courage
might
leak
away
*punct* !
*break*
at
first
she
watched
me
in
amazement
*punct* .
*break*
then
she
gave
a
most
piteous
cry
*punct* ,
and
running
to
me
*punct* ,
she
began
to
pull
at
me
with
her
little
hands
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
her
opposition
nerved
me
rather
to
proceed
*punct* .
*break*
i
shook
her
off
*punct* ,
perhaps
a
little
roughly
*punct* ,
and
in
another
moment
i
was
in
the
throat
of
the
well
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
her
agonized
face
over
the
parapet
*punct* ,
and
smiled
to
reassure
her
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
had
to
look
down
at
the
unstable
hooks
to
which
i
clung
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
to
clamber
down
a
shaft
of
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
*punct* .
*break*
the
descent
was
effected
by
means
of
metallic
bars
projecting
from
the
sides
of
the
well
*punct* ,
and
these
being
adapted
to
the
needs
of
a
creature
much
smaller
and
lighter
than
myself
*punct* ,
i
was
speedily
cramped
and
fatigued
by
the
descent
*punct* .
*break*
and
not
simply
fatigued
*punct* !
*break*
one
of
the
bars
bent
suddenly
under
my
weight
*punct* ,
and
almost
swung
me
off
into
the
blackness
beneath
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
moment
i
hung
by
one
hand
*punct* ,
and
after
that
experience
i
did
not
dare
to
rest
again
*punct* .
*break*
though
my
arms
and
back
were
presently
acutely
painful
*punct* ,
i
went
on
clambering
down
the
sheer
descent
with
as
quick
a
motion
as
possible
*punct* .
*break*
glancing
upward
*punct* ,
i
saw
the
aperture
*punct* ,
a
small
blue
disk
*punct* ,
in
which
a
star
was
visible
*punct* ,
while
little
weena's
head
showed
as
a
round
black
projection
*punct* .
*break*
the
thudding
sound
of
a
machine
below
grew
louder
and
more
oppressive
*punct* .
*break*
everything
save
that
little
disk
above
was
profoundly
dark
*punct* ,
and
when
i
looked
up
again
weena
had
disappeared
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
in
an
agony
of
discomfort
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
some
thought
of
trying
to
go
up
the
shaft
again
*punct* ,
and
leave
the
under-world
alone
*punct* .
*break*
but
even
while
i
turned
this
over
in
my
mind
i
continued
to
descend
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
with
intense
relief
*punct* ,
i
saw
dimly
coming
up
*punct* ,
a
foot
to
the
right
of
me
*punct* ,
a
slender
loophole
in
the
wall
*punct* .
*break*
swinging
myself
in
*punct* ,
i
found
it
was
the
aperture
of
a
narrow
horizontal
tunnel
in
which
i
could
lie
down
and
rest
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
too
soon
*punct* .
*break*
my
arms
ached
*punct* ,
my
back
was
cramped
*punct* ,
and
i
was
trembling
with
the
prolonged
terror
of
a
fall
*punct* .
*break*
besides
this
*punct* ,
the
unbroken
darkness
had
had
a
distressing
effect
upon
my
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
the
air
was
full
of
the
throb
and
hum
of
machinery
pumping
air
down
the
shaft
*punct* .
*break*
i
do
not
know
how
long
i
lay
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
roused
by
a
soft
hand
touching
my
face
*punct* .
*break*
starting
up
in
the
darkness
i
snatched
at
my
matches
and
*punct* ,
hastily
striking
one
*punct* ,
i
saw
three
stooping
white
creatures
similar
to
the
one
i
had
seen
above
ground
in
the
ruin
*punct* ,
hastily
retreating
before
the
light
*punct* .
*break*
living
*punct* ,
as
they
did
*punct* ,
in
what
appeared
to
me
impenetrable
darkness
*punct* ,
their
eyes
were
abnormally
large
and
sensitive
*punct* ,
just
as
are
the
pupils
of
the
abysmal
fishes
*punct* ,
and
they
reflected
the
light
in
the
same
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
no
doubt
they
could
see
me
in
that
rayless
obscurity
*punct* ,
and
they
did
not
seem
to
have
any
fear
of
me
apart
from
the
light
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
so
soon
as
i
struck
a
match
in
order
to
see
them
*punct* ,
they
fled
incontinently
*punct* ,
vanishing
into
dark
gutters
and
tunnels
*punct* ,
from
which
their
eyes
glared
at
me
in
the
strangest
fashion
*punct* .
*break*
i
tried
to
call
to
them
*punct* ,
but
the
language
they
had
was
apparently
different
from
that
of
the
over-world
people
*punct* ;
so
that
i
was
needs
left
to
my
own
unaided
efforts
*punct* ,
and
the
thought
of
flight
before
exploration
was
even
then
in
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
said
to
myself
*punct* ,
you
are
in
for
it
now
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
feeling
my
way
along
the
tunnel
*punct* ,
i
found
the
noise
of
machinery
grow
louder
*punct* .
*break*
presently
the
walls
fell
away
from
me
*punct* ,
and
i
came
to
a
large
open
space
*punct* ,
and
striking
another
match
*punct* ,
saw
that
i
had
entered
a
vast
arched
cavern
*punct* ,
which
stretched
into
utter
darkness
beyond
the
range
of
my
light
*punct* .
*break*
the
view
i
had
of
it
was
as
much
as
one
could
see
in
the
burning
of
a
match
*punct* .
*break*
necessarily
my
memory
is
vague
*punct* .
*break*
great
shapes
like
big
machines
rose
out
of
the
dimness
*punct* ,
and
cast
grotesque
black
shadows
*punct* ,
in
which
dim
spectral
morlocks
sheltered
from
the
glare
*punct* .
*break*
the
place
*punct* ,
by
the
by
*punct* ,
was
very
stuffy
and
oppressive
*punct* ,
and
the
faint
halitus
of
freshly
shed
blood
was
in
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
some
way
down
the
central
vista
was
a
little
table
of
white
metal
*punct* ,
laid
with
what
seemed
a
meal
*punct* .
*break*
the
morlocks
at
any
rate
were
carnivorous
*punct* !
*break*
even
at
the
time
*punct* ,
i
remember
wondering
what
large
animal
could
have
survived
to
furnish
the
red
joint
i
saw
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
all
very
indistinct
*punct* :
the
heavy
smell
*punct* ,
the
big
unmeaning
shapes
*punct* ,
the
obscene
figures
lurking
in
the
shadows
*punct* ,
and
only
waiting
for
the
darkness
to
come
at
me
again
*punct* !
*break*
then
the
match
burned
down
*punct* ,
and
stung
my
fingers
*punct* ,
and
fell
*punct* ,
a
wriggling
red
spot
in
the
blackness
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
thought
since
how
particularly
ill-equipped
i
was
for
such
an
experience
*punct* .
*break*
when
i
had
started
with
the
time
machine
*punct* ,
i
had
started
with
the
absurd
assumption
that
the
men
of
the
future
would
certainly
be
infinitely
ahead
of
ourselves
in
all
their
appliances
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
come
without
arms
*punct* ,
without
medicine
*punct* ,
without
anything
to
smoke
*mdash*
at
times
i
missed
tobacco
frightfully
*mdash*
even
without
enough
matches
*punct* .
*break*
if
only
i
had
thought
of
a
kodak
*punct* !
*break*
i
could
have
flashed
that
glimpse
of
the
underworld
in
a
second
*punct* ,
and
examined
it
at
leisure
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
as
it
was
*punct* ,
i
stood
there
with
only
the
weapons
and
the
powers
that
nature
had
endowed
me
with
*mdash*
hands
*punct* ,
feet
*punct* ,
and
teeth
*punct* ;
these
*punct* ,
and
four
safety-matches
that
still
remained
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
afraid
to
push
my
way
in
among
all
this
machinery
in
the
dark
*punct* ,
and
it
was
only
with
my
last
glimpse
of
light
i
discovered
that
my
store
of
matches
had
run
low
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
until
that
moment
that
there
was
any
need
to
economize
them
*punct* ,
and
i
had
wasted
almost
half
the
box
in
astonishing
the
upper-worlders
*punct* ,
to
whom
fire
was
a
novelty
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
as
i
say
*punct* ,
i
had
four
left
*punct* ,
and
while
i
stood
in
the
dark
*punct* ,
a
hand
touched
mine
*punct* ,
lank
fingers
came
feeling
over
my
face
*punct* ,
and
i
was
sensible
of
a
peculiar
unpleasant
odour
*punct* .
*break*
i
fancied
i
heard
the
breathing
of
a
crowd
of
those
dreadful
little
beings
about
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
the
box
of
matches
in
my
hand
being
gently
disengaged
*punct* ,
and
other
hands
behind
me
plucking
at
my
clothing
*punct* .
*break*
the
sense
of
these
unseen
creatures
examining
me
was
indescribably
unpleasant
*punct* .
*break*
the
sudden
realization
of
my
ignorance
of
their
ways
of
thinking
and
doing
came
home
to
me
very
vividly
in
the
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
i
shouted
at
them
as
loudly
as
i
could
*punct* .
*break*
they
started
away
*punct* ,
and
then
i
could
feel
them
approaching
me
again
*punct* .
*break*
they
clutched
at
me
more
boldly
*punct* ,
whispering
odd
sounds
to
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
i
shivered
violently
*punct* ,
and
shouted
again
rather
discordantly
*punct* .
*break*
this
time
they
were
not
so
seriously
alarmed
*punct* ,
and
they
made
a
queer
laughing
noise
as
they
came
back
at
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
will
confess
i
was
horribly
frightened
*punct* .
*break*
i
determined
to
strike
another
match
and
escape
under
the
protection
of
its
glare
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
so
*punct* ,
and
eking
out
the
flicker
with
a
scrap
of
paper
from
my
pocket
*punct* ,
i
made
good
my
retreat
to
the
narrow
tunnel
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
had
scarce
entered
this
when
my
light
was
blown
out
and
in
the
blackness
i
could
hear
the
morlocks
rustling
like
wind
among
leaves
*punct* ,
and
pattering
like
the
rain
*punct* ,
as
they
hurried
after
me
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
moment
i
was
clutched
by
several
hands
*punct* ,
and
there
was
no
mistaking
that
they
were
trying
to
haul
me
back
*punct* .
*break*
i
struck
another
light
*punct* ,
and
waved
it
in
their
dazzled
faces
*punct* .
*break*
you
can
scarce
imagine
how
nauseatingly
inhuman
they
looked
*mdash*
those
pale
*punct* ,
chinless
faces
and
great
*punct* ,
lidless
*punct* ,
pinkish-grey
eyes
*punct* !
*break*
*mdash*
as
they
stared
in
their
blindness
and
bewilderment
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
did
not
stay
to
look
*punct* ,
i
promise
you
*punct* :
i
retreated
again
*punct* ,
and
when
my
second
match
had
ended
*punct* ,
i
struck
my
third
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
almost
burned
through
when
i
reached
the
opening
into
the
shaft
*punct* .
*break*
i
lay
down
on
the
edge
*punct* ,
for
the
throb
of
the
great
pump
below
made
me
giddy
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
felt
sideways
for
the
projecting
hooks
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
i
did
so
*punct* ,
my
feet
were
grasped
from
behind
*punct* ,
and
i
was
violently
tugged
backward
*punct* .
*break*
i
lit
my
last
match
*punct* ...
and
it
incontinently
went
out
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
had
my
hand
on
the
climbing
bars
now
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
kicking
violently
*punct* ,
i
disengaged
myself
from
the
clutches
of
the
morlocks
and
was
speedily
clambering
up
the
shaft
*punct* ,
while
they
stayed
peering
and
blinking
up
at
me
*punct* :
all
but
one
little
wretch
who
followed
me
for
some
way
*punct* ,
and
wellnigh
secured
my
boot
as
a
trophy
*punct* .
*break*
that
climb
seemed
interminable
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
with
the
last
twenty
or
thirty
feet
of
it
a
deadly
nausea
came
upon
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
keeping
my
hold
*punct* .
*break*
the
last
few
yards
was
a
frightful
struggle
against
this
faintness
*punct* .
*break*
several
times
my
head
swam
*punct* ,
and
i
felt
all
the
sensations
of
falling
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
i
got
over
the
well-mouth
somehow
*punct* ,
and
staggered
out
of
the
ruin
into
the
blinding
sunlight
*punct* .
*break*
i
fell
upon
my
face
*punct* .
*break*
even
the
soil
smelt
sweet
and
clean
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
remember
weena
kissing
my
hands
and
ears
*punct* ,
and
the
voices
of
others
among
the
eloi
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
for
a
time
*punct* ,
i
was
insensible
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
i
seemed
in
a
worse
case
than
before
*punct* .
*break*
hitherto
*punct* ,
except
during
my
night's
anguish
at
the
loss
of
the
time
machine
*punct* ,
i
had
felt
a
sustaining
hope
of
ultimate
escape
*punct* ,
but
that
hope
was
staggered
by
these
new
discoveries
*punct* .
*break*
hitherto
i
had
merely
thought
myself
impeded
by
the
childish
simplicity
of
the
little
people
*punct* ,
and
by
some
unknown
forces
which
i
had
only
to
understand
to
overcome
*punct* ;
but
there
was
an
altogether
new
element
in
the
sickening
quality
of
the
morlocks
*mdash*
a
something
inhuman
and
malign
*punct* .
*break*
instinctively
i
loathed
them
*punct* .
*break*
before
*punct* ,
i
had
felt
as
a
man
might
feel
who
had
fallen
into
a
pit
*punct* :
my
concern
was
with
the
pit
and
how
to
get
out
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
now
i
felt
like
a
beast
in
a
trap
*punct* ,
whose
enemy
would
come
upon
him
soon
*punct* .
*break*
the
enemy
i
dreaded
may
surprise
you
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
darkness
of
the
new
moon
*punct* .
*break*
weena
had
put
this
into
my
head
by
some
at
first
incomprehensible
remarks
about
the
dark
nights
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
not
now
such
a
very
difficult
problem
to
guess
what
the
coming
dark
nights
might
mean
*punct* .
*break*
the
moon
was
on
the
wane
*punct* :
each
night
there
was
a
longer
interval
of
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
now
understood
to
some
slight
degree
at
least
the
reason
of
the
fear
of
the
little
upper-world
people
for
the
dark
*punct* .
*break*
i
wondered
vaguely
what
foul
villainy
it
might
be
that
the
morlocks
did
under
the
new
moon
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
pretty
sure
now
that
my
second
hypothesis
was
all
wrong
*punct* .
*break*
the
upper-world
people
might
once
have
been
the
favoured
aristocracy
*punct* ,
and
the
morlocks
their
mechanical
servants
*punct* :
but
that
had
long
since
passed
away
*punct* .
*break*
the
two
species
that
had
resulted
from
the
evolution
of
man
were
sliding
down
towards
*punct* ,
or
had
already
arrived
at
*punct* ,
an
altogether
new
relationship
*punct* .
*break*
the
eloi
*punct* ,
like
the
carolingian
kings
*punct* ,
had
decayed
to
a
mere
beautiful
futility
*punct* .
*break*
they
still
possessed
the
earth
on
sufferance
*punct* :
since
the
morlocks
*punct* ,
subterranean
for
innumerable
generations
*punct* ,
had
come
at
last
to
find
the
daylit
surface
intolerable
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
morlocks
made
their
garments
*punct* ,
i
inferred
*punct* ,
and
maintained
them
in
their
habitual
needs
*punct* ,
perhaps
through
the
survival
of
an
old
habit
of
service
*punct* .
*break*
they
did
it
as
a
standing
horse
paws
with
his
foot
*punct* ,
or
as
a
man
enjoys
killing
animals
in
sport
*punct* :
because
ancient
and
departed
necessities
had
impressed
it
on
the
organism
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
clearly
*punct* ,
the
old
order
was
already
in
part
reversed
*punct* .
*break*
the
nemesis
of
the
delicate
ones
was
creeping
on
apace
*punct* .
*break*
ages
ago
*punct* ,
thousands
of
generations
ago
*punct* ,
man
had
thrust
his
brother
man
out
of
the
ease
and
the
sunshine
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
that
brother
was
coming
back
changed
*punct* !
*break*
already
the
eloi
had
begun
to
learn
one
old
lesson
anew
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
becoming
reacquainted
with
fear
*punct* .
*break*
and
suddenly
there
came
into
my
head
the
memory
of
the
meat
i
had
seen
in
the
under-world
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
odd
how
it
floated
into
my
mind
*punct* :
not
stirred
up
as
it
were
by
the
current
of
my
meditations
*punct* ,
but
coming
in
almost
like
a
question
from
outside
*punct* .
*break*
i
tried
to
recall
the
form
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
a
vague
sense
of
something
familiar
*punct* ,
but
i
could
not
tell
what
it
was
at
the
time
*punct* .
*break*
still
*punct* ,
however
helpless
the
little
people
in
the
presence
of
their
mysterious
fear
*punct* ,
i
was
differently
constituted
*punct* .
*break*
i
came
out
of
this
age
of
ours
*punct* ,
this
ripe
prime
of
the
human
race
*punct* ,
when
fear
does
not
paralyse
and
mystery
has
lost
its
terrors
*punct* .
*break*
i
at
least
would
defend
myself
*punct* .
*break*
without
further
delay
i
determined
to
make
myself
arms
and
a
fastness
where
i
might
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
with
that
refuge
as
a
base
*punct* ,
i
could
face
this
strange
world
with
some
of
that
confidence
i
had
lost
in
realizing
to
what
creatures
night
by
night
i
lay
exposed
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
i
could
never
sleep
again
until
my
bed
was
secure
from
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
shuddered
with
horror
to
think
how
they
must
already
have
examined
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
wandered
during
the
afternoon
along
the
valley
of
the
thames
*punct* ,
but
found
nothing
that
commended
itself
to
my
mind
as
inaccessible
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
buildings
and
trees
seemed
easily
practicable
to
such
dexterous
climbers
as
the
morlocks
*punct* ,
to
judge
by
their
wells
*punct* ,
must
be
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
tall
pinnacles
of
the
palace
of
green
porcelain
and
the
polished
gleam
of
its
walls
came
back
to
my
memory
*punct* ;
and
in
the
evening
*punct* ,
taking
weena
like
a
child
upon
my
shoulder
*punct* ,
i
went
up
the
hills
towards
the
south-west
*punct* .
*break*
the
distance
*punct* ,
i
had
reckoned
*punct* ,
was
seven
or
eight
miles
*punct* ,
but
it
must
have
been
nearer
eighteen
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
first
seen
the
place
on
a
moist
afternoon
when
distances
are
deceptively
diminished
*punct* .
*break*
in
addition
*punct* ,
the
heel
of
one
of
my
shoes
was
loose
*punct* ,
and
a
nail
was
working
through
the
sole
*mdash*
they
were
comfortable
old
shoes
i
wore
about
indoors
*mdash*
so
that
i
was
lame
*punct* .
*break*
and
it
was
already
long
past
sunset
when
i
came
in
sight
of
the
palace
*punct* ,
silhouetted
black
against
the
pale
yellow
of
the
sky
*punct* .
*break*
weena
had
been
hugely
delighted
when
i
began
to
carry
her
*punct* ,
but
after
a
while
she
desired
me
to
let
her
down
*punct* ,
and
ran
along
by
the
side
of
me
*punct* ,
occasionally
darting
off
on
either
hand
to
pick
flowers
to
stick
in
my
pockets
*punct* .
*break*
my
pockets
had
always
puzzled
weena
*punct* ,
but
at
the
last
she
had
concluded
that
they
were
an
eccentric
kind
of
vase
for
floral
decoration
*punct* .
*break*
at
least
she
utilized
them
for
that
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
and
that
reminds
me
*punct* !
*break*
in
changing
my
jacket
i
found
*punct* ...
the
time
traveller
paused
*punct* ,
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
*punct* ,
and
silently
placed
two
withered
flowers
*punct* ,
not
unlike
very
large
white
mallows
*punct* ,
upon
the
little
table
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
resumed
his
narrative
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
hush
of
evening
crept
over
the
world
and
we
proceeded
over
the
hill
crest
towards
wimbledon
*punct* ,
weena
grew
tired
and
wanted
to
return
to
the
house
of
grey
stone
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
pointed
out
the
distant
pinnacles
of
the
palace
of
green
porcelain
to
her
*punct* ,
and
contrived
to
make
her
understand
that
we
were
seeking
a
refuge
there
from
her
fear
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
that
great
pause
that
comes
upon
things
before
the
dusk
*punct* ?
*break*
even
the
breeze
stops
in
the
trees
*punct* .
*break*
to
me
there
is
always
an
air
of
expectation
about
that
evening
stillness
*punct* .
*break*
the
sky
was
clear
*punct* ,
remote
*punct* ,
and
empty
save
for
a
few
horizontal
bars
far
down
in
the
sunset
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
that
night
the
expectation
took
the
colour
of
my
fears
*punct* .
*break*
in
that
darkling
calm
my
senses
seemed
preternaturally
sharpened
*punct* .
*break*
i
fancied
i
could
even
feel
the
hollowness
of
the
ground
beneath
my
feet
*punct* :
could
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
almost
see
through
it
the
morlocks
on
their
ant-hill
going
hither
and
thither
and
waiting
for
the
dark
*punct* .
*break*
in
my
excitement
i
fancied
that
they
would
receive
my
invasion
of
their
burrows
as
a
declaration
of
war
*punct* .
*break*
and
why
had
they
taken
my
time
machine
*punct* ?
*break*
so
we
went
on
in
the
quiet
*punct* ,
and
the
twilight
deepened
into
night
*punct* .
*break*
the
clear
blue
of
the
distance
faded
*punct* ,
and
one
star
after
another
came
out
*punct* .
*break*
the
ground
grew
dim
and
the
trees
black
*punct* .
*break*
weena's
fears
and
her
fatigue
grew
upon
her
*punct* .
*break*
i
took
her
in
my
arms
and
talked
to
her
and
caressed
her
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
as
the
darkness
grew
deeper
*punct* ,
she
put
her
arms
round
my
neck
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
closing
her
eyes
*punct* ,
tightly
pressed
her
face
against
my
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
so
we
went
down
a
long
slope
into
a
valley
*punct* ,
and
there
in
the
dimness
i
almost
walked
into
a
little
river
*punct* .
*break*
this
i
waded
*punct* ,
and
went
up
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
*punct* ,
past
a
number
of
sleeping
houses
*punct* ,
and
by
a
statue
*mdash*
a
faun
*punct* ,
or
some
such
figure
*punct* ,
minus
the
head
*punct* .
*break*
here
too
were
acacias
*punct* .
*break*
so
far
i
had
seen
nothing
of
the
morlocks
*punct* ,
but
it
was
yet
early
in
the
night
*punct* ,
and
the
darker
hours
before
the
old
moon
rose
were
still
to
come
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
brow
of
the
next
hill
i
saw
a
thick
wood
spreading
wide
and
black
before
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
hesitated
at
this
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
see
no
end
to
it
*punct* ,
either
to
the
right
or
the
left
*punct* .
*break*
feeling
tired
*mdash*
my
feet
*punct* ,
in
particular
*punct* ,
were
very
sore
*mdash*
i
carefully
lowered
weena
from
my
shoulder
as
i
halted
*punct* ,
and
sat
down
upon
the
turf
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
no
longer
see
the
palace
of
green
porcelain
*punct* ,
and
i
was
in
doubt
of
my
direction
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
into
the
thickness
of
the
wood
and
thought
of
what
it
might
hide
*punct* .
*break*
under
that
dense
tangle
of
branches
one
would
be
out
of
sight
of
the
stars
*punct* .
*break*
even
were
there
no
other
lurking
danger
*mdash*
a
danger
i
did
not
care
to
let
my
imagination
loose
upon
*mdash*
there
would
still
be
all
the
roots
to
stumble
over
and
the
tree-boles
to
strike
against
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
very
tired
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
after
the
excitements
of
the
day
*punct* ;
so
i
decided
that
i
would
not
face
it
*punct* ,
but
would
pass
the
night
upon
the
open
hill
*punct* .
*break*
weena
*punct* ,
i
was
glad
to
find
*punct* ,
was
fast
asleep
*punct* .
*break*
i
carefully
wrapped
her
in
my
jacket
*punct* ,
and
sat
down
beside
her
to
wait
for
the
moonrise
*punct* .
*break*
the
hill-side
was
quiet
and
deserted
*punct* ,
but
from
the
black
of
the
wood
there
came
now
and
then
a
stir
of
living
things
*punct* .
*break*
above
me
shone
the
stars
*punct* ,
for
the
night
was
very
clear
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
a
certain
sense
of
friendly
comfort
in
their
twinkling
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
old
constellations
had
gone
from
the
sky
*punct* ,
however
*punct* :
that
slow
movement
which
is
imperceptible
in
a
hundred
human
lifetimes
*punct* ,
had
long
since
rearranged
them
in
unfamiliar
groupings
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
milky
way
*punct* ,
it
seemed
to
me
*punct* ,
was
still
the
same
tattered
streamer
of
star-dust
as
of
yore
*punct* .
*break*
southward
*punct* ,
as
i
judged
it
*punct* ,
was
a
very
bright
red
star
that
was
new
to
me
*punct* ;
it
was
even
more
splendid
than
our
own
green
sirius
*punct* .
*break*
and
amid
all
these
scintillating
points
of
light
one
bright
planet
shone
kindly
and
steadily
like
the
face
of
an
old
friend
*punct* .
*break*
looking
at
these
stars
suddenly
dwarfed
my
own
troubles
and
all
the
gravities
of
terrestrial
life
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
of
their
unfathomable
distance
*punct* ,
and
the
slow
inevitable
drift
of
their
movements
out
of
the
unknown
past
into
the
unknown
future
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
of
the
great
precessional
cycle
that
the
pole
of
the
earth
describes
*punct* .
*break*
only
forty
times
had
that
silent
revolution
occurred
during
all
the
years
that
i
had
traversed
*punct* .
*break*
and
during
these
few
revolutions
all
the
activity
*punct* ,
all
the
traditions
*punct* ,
the
complex
organizations
*punct* ,
the
nations
*punct* ,
languages
*punct* ,
literatures
*punct* ,
aspirations
*punct* ,
even
the
mere
memory
of
man
as
i
knew
him
*punct* ,
had
been
swept
out
of
existence
*punct* .
*break*
instead
were
these
frail
creatures
who
had
forgotten
their
high
ancestry
*punct* ,
and
the
white
things
of
which
i
went
in
terror
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
thought
of
the
great
fear
that
was
between
the
two
species
*punct* ,
and
for
the
first
time
*punct* ,
with
a
sudden
shiver
*punct* ,
came
the
clear
knowledge
of
what
the
meat
i
had
seen
might
be
*punct* .
*break*
yet
it
was
too
horrible
*punct* !
*break*
i
looked
at
little
weena
sleeping
beside
me
*punct* ,
her
face
white
and
starlike
under
the
stars
*punct* ,
and
forthwith
dismissed
the
thought
*punct* .
*break*
through
that
long
night
i
held
my
mind
off
the
morlocks
as
well
as
i
could
*punct* ,
and
whiled
away
the
time
by
trying
to
fancy
i
could
find
signs
of
the
old
constellations
in
the
new
confusion
*punct* .
*break*
the
sky
kept
very
clear
*punct* ,
except
for
a
hazy
cloud
or
so
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
i
dozed
at
times
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
as
my
vigil
wore
on
*punct* ,
came
a
faintness
in
the
eastward
sky
*punct* ,
like
the
reflection
of
some
colourless
fire
*punct* ,
and
the
old
moon
rose
*punct* ,
thin
and
peaked
and
white
*punct* .
*break*
and
close
behind
*punct* ,
and
overtaking
it
*punct* ,
and
overflowing
it
*punct* ,
the
dawn
came
*punct* ,
pale
at
first
*punct* ,
and
then
growing
pink
and
warm
*punct* .
*break*
no
morlocks
had
approached
us
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
i
had
seen
none
upon
the
hill
that
night
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
the
confidence
of
renewed
day
it
almost
seemed
to
me
that
my
fear
had
been
unreasonable
*punct* .
*break*
i
stood
up
and
found
my
foot
with
the
loose
heel
swollen
at
the
ankle
and
painful
under
the
heel
*punct* ;
so
i
sat
down
again
*punct* ,
took
off
my
shoes
*punct* ,
and
flung
them
away
*punct* .
*break*
i
awakened
weena
*punct* ,
and
we
went
down
into
the
wood
*punct* ,
now
green
and
pleasant
instead
of
black
and
forbidding
*punct* .
*break*
we
found
some
fruit
wherewith
to
break
our
fast
*punct* .
*break*
we
soon
met
others
of
the
dainty
ones
*punct* ,
laughing
and
dancing
in
the
sunlight
as
though
there
was
no
such
thing
in
nature
as
the
night
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
i
thought
once
more
of
the
meat
that
i
had
seen
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
assured
now
of
what
it
was
*punct* ,
and
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
pitied
this
last
feeble
rill
from
the
great
flood
of
humanity
*punct* .
*break*
clearly
*punct* ,
at
some
time
in
the
long-ago
of
human
decay
the
morlocks'food
had
run
short
*punct* .
*break*
possibly
they
had
lived
on
rats
and
such-like
vermin
*punct* .
*break*
even
now
man
is
far
less
discriminating
and
exclusive
in
his
food
than
he
was
*mdash*
far
less
than
any
monkey
*punct* .
*break*
his
prejudice
against
human
flesh
is
no
deep-seated
instinct
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
these
inhuman
sons
of
men
*mdash*
*mdash*
*punct* !
*break*
i
tried
to
look
at
the
thing
in
a
scientific
spirit
*punct* .
*break*
after
all
*punct* ,
they
were
less
human
and
more
remote
than
our
cannibal
ancestors
of
three
or
four
thousand
years
ago
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
intelligence
that
would
have
made
this
state
of
things
a
torment
had
gone
*punct* .
*break*
why
should
i
trouble
myself
*punct* ?
*break*
these
eloi
were
mere
fatted
cattle
*punct* ,
which
the
ant-like
morlocks
preserved
and
preyed
upon
*mdash*
probably
saw
to
the
breeding
of
*punct* .
*break*
and
there
was
weena
dancing
at
my
side
*punct* !
*break*
then
i
tried
to
preserve
myself
from
the
horror
that
was
coming
upon
me
*punct* ,
by
regarding
it
as
a
rigorous
punishment
of
human
selfishness
*punct* .
*break*
man
had
been
content
to
live
in
ease
and
delight
upon
the
labours
of
his
fellow-man
*punct* ,
had
taken
necessity
as
his
watchword
and
excuse
*punct* ,
and
in
the
fullness
of
time
necessity
had
come
home
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
i
even
tried
a
carlyle-like
scorn
of
this
wretched
aristocracy
in
decay
*punct* .
*break*
but
this
attitude
of
mind
was
impossible
*punct* .
*break*
however
great
their
intellectual
degradation
*punct* ,
the
eloi
had
kept
too
much
of
the
human
form
not
to
claim
my
sympathy
*punct* ,
and
to
make
me
perforce
a
sharer
in
their
degradation
and
their
fear
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
at
that
time
very
vague
ideas
as
to
the
course
i
should
pursue
*punct* .
*break*
my
first
was
to
secure
some
safe
place
of
refuge
*punct* ,
and
to
make
myself
such
arms
of
metal
or
stone
as
i
could
contrive
*punct* .
*break*
that
necessity
was
immediate
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
next
place
*punct* ,
i
hoped
to
procure
some
means
of
fire
*punct* ,
so
that
i
should
have
the
weapon
of
a
torch
at
hand
*punct* ,
for
nothing
*punct* ,
i
knew
*punct* ,
would
be
more
efficient
against
these
morlocks
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
wanted
to
arrange
some
contrivance
to
break
open
the
doors
of
bronze
under
the
white
sphinx
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
in
mind
a
battering
ram
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
a
persuasion
that
if
i
could
enter
those
doors
and
carry
a
blaze
of
light
before
me
i
should
discover
the
time
machine
and
escape
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
imagine
the
morlocks
were
strong
enough
to
move
it
far
away
*punct* .
*break*
weena
i
had
resolved
to
bring
with
me
to
our
own
time
*punct* .
*break*
and
turning
such
schemes
over
in
my
mind
i
pursued
our
way
towards
the
building
which
my
fancy
had
chosen
as
our
dwelling
*punct* .
*break*
i
found
the
palace
of
green
porcelain
*punct* ,
when
we
approached
it
about
noon
*punct* ,
deserted
and
falling
into
ruin
*punct* .
*break*
only
ragged
vestiges
of
glass
remained
in
its
windows
*punct* ,
and
great
sheets
of
the
green
facing
had
fallen
away
from
the
corroded
metallic
framework
*punct* .
*break*
it
lay
very
high
upon
a
turfy
down
*punct* ,
and
looking
north-eastward
before
i
entered
it
*punct* ,
i
was
surprised
to
see
a
large
estuary
*punct* ,
or
even
creek
*punct* ,
where
i
judged
wandsworth
and
battersea
must
once
have
been
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
then
*mdash*
though
i
never
followed
up
the
thought
*mdash*
of
what
might
have
happened
*punct* ,
or
might
be
happening
*punct* ,
to
the
living
things
in
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
the
material
of
the
palace
proved
on
examination
to
be
indeed
porcelain
*punct* ,
and
along
the
face
of
it
i
saw
an
inscription
in
some
unknown
character
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
*punct* ,
rather
foolishly
*punct* ,
that
weena
might
help
me
to
interpret
this
*punct* ,
but
i
only
learned
that
the
bare
idea
of
writing
had
never
entered
her
head
*punct* .
*break*
she
always
seemed
to
me
*punct* ,
i
fancy
*punct* ,
more
human
than
she
was
*punct* ,
perhaps
because
her
affection
was
so
human
*punct* .
*break*
within
the
big
valves
of
the
door
*mdash*
which
were
open
and
broken
*mdash*
we
found
*punct* ,
instead
of
the
customary
hall
*punct* ,
a
long
gallery
lit
by
many
side
windows
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
first
glance
i
was
reminded
of
a
museum
*punct* .
*break*
the
tiled
floor
was
thick
with
dust
*punct* ,
and
a
remarkable
array
of
miscellaneous
objects
was
shrouded
in
the
same
grey
covering
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
perceived
*punct* ,
standing
strange
and
gaunt
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
*punct* ,
what
was
clearly
the
lower
part
of
a
huge
skeleton
*punct* .
*break*
i
recognized
by
the
oblique
feet
that
it
was
some
extinct
creature
after
the
fashion
of
the
megatherium
*punct* .
*break*
the
skull
and
the
upper
bones
lay
beside
it
in
the
thick
dust
*punct* ,
and
in
one
place
*punct* ,
where
rain-water
had
dropped
through
a
leak
in
the
roof
*punct* ,
the
thing
itself
had
been
worn
away
*punct* .
*break*
further
in
the
gallery
was
the
huge
skeleton
barrel
of
a
brontosaurus
*punct* .
*break*
my
museum
hypothesis
was
confirmed
*punct* .
*break*
going
towards
the
side
i
found
what
appeared
to
be
sloping
shelves
*punct* ,
and
clearing
away
the
thick
dust
*punct* ,
i
found
the
old
familiar
glass
cases
of
our
own
time
*punct* .
*break*
but
they
must
have
been
air-tight
to
judge
from
the
fair
preservation
of
some
of
their
contents
*punct* .
*break*
clearly
we
stood
among
the
ruins
of
some
latter-day
south
kensington
*punct* !
*break*
here
*punct* ,
apparently
*punct* ,
was
the
palaeontological
section
*punct* ,
and
a
very
splendid
array
of
fossils
it
must
have
been
*punct* ,
though
the
inevitable
process
of
decay
that
had
been
staved
off
for
a
time
*punct* ,
and
had
*punct* ,
through
the
extinction
of
bacteria
and
fungi
*punct* ,
lost
ninety-nine
hundredths
of
its
force
*punct* ,
was
nevertheless
*punct* ,
with
extreme
sureness
if
with
extreme
slowness
at
work
again
upon
all
its
treasures
*punct* .
*break*
here
and
there
i
found
traces
of
the
little
people
in
the
shape
of
rare
fossils
broken
to
pieces
or
threaded
in
strings
upon
reeds
*punct* .
*break*
and
the
cases
had
in
some
instances
been
bodily
removed
*mdash*
by
the
morlocks
as
i
judged
*punct* .
*break*
the
place
was
very
silent
*punct* .
*break*
the
thick
dust
deadened
our
footsteps
*punct* .
*break*
weena
*punct* ,
who
had
been
rolling
a
sea
urchin
down
the
sloping
glass
of
a
case
*punct* ,
presently
came
*punct* ,
as
i
stared
about
me
*punct* ,
and
very
quietly
took
my
hand
and
stood
beside
me
*punct* .
*break*
and
at
first
i
was
so
much
surprised
by
this
ancient
monument
of
an
intellectual
age
*punct* ,
that
i
gave
no
thought
to
the
possibilities
it
presented
*punct* .
*break*
even
my
preoccupation
about
the
time
machine
receded
a
little
from
my
mind
*punct* .
*break*
to
judge
from
the
size
of
the
place
*punct* ,
this
palace
of
green
porcelain
had
a
great
deal
more
in
it
than
a
gallery
of
palaeontology
*punct* ;
possibly
historical
galleries
*punct* ;
it
might
be
*punct* ,
even
a
library
*punct* !
*break*
to
me
*punct* ,
at
least
in
my
present
circumstances
*punct* ,
these
would
be
vastly
more
interesting
than
this
spectacle
of
oldtime
geology
in
decay
*punct* .
*break*
exploring
*punct* ,
i
found
another
short
gallery
running
transversely
to
the
first
*punct* .
*break*
this
appeared
to
be
devoted
to
minerals
*punct* ,
and
the
sight
of
a
block
of
sulphur
set
my
mind
running
on
gunpowder
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
could
find
no
saltpeter
*punct* ;
indeed
*punct* ,
no
nitrates
of
any
kind
*punct* .
*break*
doubtless
they
had
deliquesced
ages
ago
*punct* .
*break*
yet
the
sulphur
hung
in
my
mind
*punct* ,
and
set
up
a
train
of
thinking
*punct* .
*break*
as
for
the
rest
of
the
contents
of
that
gallery
*punct* ,
though
on
the
whole
they
were
the
best
preserved
of
all
i
saw
*punct* ,
i
had
little
interest
*punct* .
*break*
i
am
no
specialist
in
mineralogy
*punct* ,
and
i
went
on
down
a
very
ruinous
aisle
running
parallel
to
the
first
hall
i
had
entered
*punct* .
*break*
apparently
this
section
had
been
devoted
to
natural
history
*punct* ,
but
everything
had
long
since
passed
out
of
recognition
*punct* .
*break*
a
few
shrivelled
and
blackened
vestiges
of
what
had
once
been
stuffed
animals
*punct* ,
desiccated
mummies
in
jars
that
had
once
held
spirit
*punct* ,
a
brown
dust
of
departed
plants
*punct* :
that
was
all
*punct* !
*break*
i
was
sorry
for
that
*punct* ,
because
i
should
have
been
glad
to
trace
the
patent
readjustments
by
which
the
conquest
of
animated
nature
had
been
attained
*punct* .
*break*
then
we
came
to
a
gallery
of
simply
colossal
proportions
*punct* ,
but
singularly
ill-lit
*punct* ,
the
floor
of
it
running
downward
at
a
slight
angle
from
the
end
at
which
i
entered
*punct* .
*break*
at
intervals
white
globes
hung
from
the
ceiling
*mdash*
many
of
them
cracked
and
smashed
*mdash*
which
suggested
that
originally
the
place
had
been
artificially
lit
*punct* .
*break*
here
i
was
more
in
my
element
*punct* ,
for
rising
on
either
side
of
me
were
the
huge
bulks
of
big
machines
*punct* ,
all
greatly
corroded
and
many
broken
down
*punct* ,
but
some
still
fairly
complete
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
i
have
a
certain
weakness
for
mechanism
*punct* ,
and
i
was
inclined
to
linger
among
these
*punct* ;
the
more
so
as
for
the
most
part
they
had
the
interest
of
puzzles
*punct* ,
and
i
could
make
only
the
vaguest
guesses
at
what
they
were
for
*punct* .
*break*
i
fancied
that
if
i
could
solve
their
puzzles
i
should
find
myself
in
possession
of
powers
that
might
be
of
use
against
the
morlocks
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
weena
came
very
close
to
my
side
*punct* .
*break*
so
suddenly
that
she
startled
me
*punct* .
*break*
had
it
not
been
for
her
i
do
not
think
i
should
have
noticed
that
the
floor
of
the
gallery
sloped
at
all
*punct* .
*break*
the
end
i
had
come
in
at
was
quite
above
ground
*punct* ,
and
was
lit
by
rare
slit-like
windows
*punct* .
*break*
as
you
went
down
the
length
*punct* ,
the
ground
came
up
against
these
windows
*punct* ,
until
at
last
there
was
a
pit
like
the
area
of
a
london
house
before
each
*punct* ,
and
only
a
narrow
line
of
daylight
at
the
top
*punct* .
*break*
i
went
slowly
along
*punct* ,
puzzling
about
the
machines
*punct* ,
and
had
been
too
intent
upon
them
to
notice
the
gradual
diminution
of
the
light
*punct* ,
until
weena's
increasing
apprehensions
drew
my
attention
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
saw
that
the
gallery
ran
down
at
last
into
a
thick
darkness
*punct* .
*break*
i
hesitated
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
as
i
looked
round
me
*punct* ,
i
saw
that
the
dust
was
less
abundant
and
its
surface
less
even
*punct* .
*break*
further
away
towards
the
dimness
*punct* ,
it
appeared
to
be
broken
by
a
number
of
small
narrow
footprints
*punct* .
*break*
my
sense
of
the
immediate
presence
of
the
morlocks
revived
at
that
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
that
i
was
wasting
my
time
in
the
academic
examination
of
machinery
*punct* .
*break*
i
called
to
mind
that
it
was
already
far
advanced
in
the
afternoon
*punct* ,
and
that
i
had
still
no
weapon
*punct* ,
no
refuge
*punct* ,
and
no
means
of
making
a
fire
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
down
in
the
remote
blackness
of
the
gallery
i
heard
a
peculiar
pattering
*punct* ,
and
the
same
odd
noises
i
had
heard
down
the
well
*punct* .
*break*
i
took
weena's
hand
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
struck
with
a
sudden
idea
*punct* ,
i
left
her
and
turned
to
a
machine
from
which
projected
a
lever
not
unlike
those
in
a
signal-box
*punct* .
*break*
clambering
upon
the
stand
*punct* ,
and
grasping
this
lever
in
my
hands
*punct* ,
i
put
all
my
weight
upon
it
sideways
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
weena
*punct* ,
deserted
in
the
central
aisle
*punct* ,
began
to
whimper
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
judged
the
strength
of
the
lever
pretty
correctly
*punct* ,
for
it
snapped
after
a
minute's
strain
*punct* ,
and
i
rejoined
her
with
a
mace
in
my
hand
more
than
sufficient
*punct* ,
i
judged
*punct* ,
for
any
morlock
skull
i
might
encounter
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
longed
very
much
to
kill
a
morlock
or
so
*punct* .
*break*
very
inhuman
*punct* ,
you
may
think
*punct* ,
to
want
to
go
killing
one's
own
descendants
*punct* !
*break*
but
it
was
impossible
*punct* ,
somehow
*punct* ,
to
feel
any
humanity
in
the
things
*punct* .
*break*
only
my
disinclination
to
leave
weena
*punct* ,
and
a
persuasion
that
if
i
began
to
slake
my
thirst
for
murder
my
time
machine
might
suffer
*punct* ,
restrained
me
from
going
straight
down
the
gallery
and
killing
the
brutes
i
heard
*punct* .
*break*
well
*punct* ,
mace
in
one
hand
and
weena
in
the
other
*punct* ,
i
went
out
of
that
gallery
and
into
another
and
still
larger
one
*punct* ,
which
at
the
first
glance
reminded
me
of
a
military
chapel
hung
with
tattered
flags
*punct* .
*break*
the
brown
and
charred
rags
that
hung
from
the
sides
of
it
*punct* ,
i
presently
recognized
as
the
decaying
vestiges
of
books
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
long
since
dropped
to
pieces
*punct* ,
and
every
semblance
of
print
had
left
them
*punct* .
*break*
but
here
and
there
were
warped
boards
and
cracked
metallic
clasps
that
told
the
tale
well
enough
*punct* .
*break*
had
i
been
a
literary
man
i
might
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
have
moralized
upon
the
futility
of
all
ambition
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
it
was
*punct* ,
the
thing
that
struck
me
with
keenest
force
was
the
enormous
waste
of
labour
to
which
this
sombre
wilderness
of
rotting
paper
testified
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
time
i
will
confess
that
i
thought
chiefly
of
the
philosophical
transactions
and
my
own
seventeen
papers
upon
physical
optics
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
going
up
a
broad
staircase
*punct* ,
we
came
to
what
may
once
have
been
a
gallery
of
technical
chemistry
*punct* .
*break*
and
here
i
had
not
a
little
hope
of
useful
discoveries
*punct* .
*break*
except
at
one
end
where
the
roof
had
collapsed
*punct* ,
this
gallery
was
well
preserved
*punct* .
*break*
i
went
eagerly
to
every
unbroken
case
*punct* .
*break*
and
at
last
*punct* ,
in
one
of
the
really
air-tight
cases
*punct* ,
i
found
a
box
of
matches
*punct* .
*break*
very
eagerly
i
tried
them
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
perfectly
good
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
not
even
damp
*punct* .
*break*
i
turned
to
weena
*punct* .
*break*
dance
*punct* ,
i
cried
to
her
in
her
own
tongue
*punct* .
*break*
for
now
i
had
a
weapon
indeed
against
the
horrible
creatures
we
feared
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
*punct* ,
in
that
derelict
museum
*punct* ,
upon
the
thick
soft
carpeting
of
dust
*punct* ,
to
weena's
huge
delight
*punct* ,
i
solemnly
performed
a
kind
of
composite
dance
*punct* ,
whistling
the
land
of
the
leal
as
cheerfully
as
i
could
*punct* .
*break*
in
part
it
was
a
modest
cancan
*punct* ,
in
part
a
step
dance
*punct* ,
in
part
a
skirt-dance
*punct* ,
so
far
as
my
tail-coat
permitted
*punct* ,
and
in
part
original
*punct* .
*break*
for
i
am
naturally
inventive
*punct* ,
as
you
know
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
i
still
think
that
for
this
box
of
matches
to
have
escaped
the
wear
of
time
for
immemorial
years
was
a
most
strange
*punct* ,
as
for
me
it
was
a
most
fortunate
thing
*punct* .
*break*
yet
*punct* ,
oddly
enough
*punct* ,
i
found
a
far
unlikelier
substance
*punct* ,
and
that
was
camphor
*punct* .
*break*
i
found
it
in
a
sealed
jar
*punct* ,
that
by
chance
*punct* ,
i
suppose
*punct* ,
had
been
really
hermetically
sealed
*punct* .
*break*
i
fancied
at
first
that
it
was
paraffin
wax
*punct* ,
and
smashed
the
glass
accordingly
*punct* .
*break*
but
the
odour
of
camphor
was
unmistakable
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
universal
decay
this
volatile
substance
had
chanced
to
survive
*punct* ,
perhaps
through
many
thousands
of
centuries
*punct* .
*break*
it
reminded
me
of
a
sepia
painting
i
had
once
seen
done
from
the
ink
of
a
fossil
belemnite
that
must
have
perished
and
become
fossilized
millions
of
years
ago
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
about
to
throw
it
away
*punct* ,
but
i
remembered
that
it
was
inflammable
and
burned
with
a
good
bright
flame
*mdash*
was
*punct* ,
in
fact
*punct* ,
an
excellent
candle
*mdash*
and
i
put
it
in
my
pocket
*punct* .
*break*
i
found
no
explosives
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
nor
any
means
of
breaking
down
the
bronze
doors
*punct* .
*break*
as
yet
my
iron
crowbar
was
the
most
helpful
thing
i
had
chanced
upon
*punct* .
*break*
nevertheless
i
left
that
gallery
greatly
elated
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
tell
you
all
the
story
of
that
long
afternoon
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
require
a
great
effort
of
memory
to
recall
my
explorations
in
at
all
the
proper
order
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
a
long
gallery
of
rusting
stands
of
arms
*punct* ,
and
how
i
hesitated
between
my
crowbar
and
a
hatchet
or
a
sword
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
carry
both
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
and
my
bar
of
iron
promised
best
against
the
bronze
gates
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
numbers
of
guns
*punct* ,
pistols
*punct* ,
and
rifles
*punct* .
*break*
the
most
were
masses
of
rust
*punct* ,
but
many
were
of
some
new
metal
*punct* ,
and
still
fairly
sound
*punct* .
*break*
but
any
cartridges
or
powder
there
may
once
have
been
had
rotted
into
dust
*punct* .
*break*
one
corner
i
saw
was
charred
and
shattered
*punct* ;
perhaps
*punct* ,
i
thought
*punct* ,
by
an
explosion
among
the
specimens
*punct* .
*break*
in
another
place
was
a
vast
array
of
idols
*mdash*
polynesian
*punct* ,
mexican
*punct* ,
grecian
*punct* ,
phoenician
*punct* ,
every
country
on
earth
i
should
think
*punct* .
*break*
and
here
*punct* ,
yielding
to
an
irresistible
impulse
*punct* ,
i
wrote
my
name
upon
the
nose
of
a
steatite
monster
from
south
america
that
particularly
took
my
fancy
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
evening
drew
on
*punct* ,
my
interest
waned
*punct* .
*break*
i
went
through
gallery
after
gallery
*punct* ,
dusty
*punct* ,
silent
*punct* ,
often
ruinous
*punct* ,
the
exhibits
sometimes
mere
heaps
of
rust
and
lignite
*punct* ,
sometimes
fresher
*punct* .
*break*
in
one
place
i
suddenly
found
myself
near
the
model
of
a
tin-mine
*punct* ,
and
then
by
the
merest
accident
i
discovered
*punct* ,
in
an
air-tight
case
*punct* ,
two
dynamite
cartridges
*punct* !
*break*
i
shouted
eureka
*punct* !
*break*
and
smashed
the
case
with
joy
*punct* .
*break*
then
came
a
doubt
*punct* .
*break*
then
*punct* ,
selecting
a
little
side
gallery
*punct* ,
i
made
my
essay
*punct* .
*break*
i
never
felt
such
a
disappointment
as
i
did
in
waiting
five
*punct* ,
ten
*punct* ,
fifteen
minutes
for
an
explosion
that
never
came
*punct* .
*break*
of
course
the
things
were
dummies
*punct* ,
as
i
might
have
guessed
from
their
presence
*punct* .
*break*
i
really
believe
that
had
they
not
been
so
*punct* ,
i
should
have
rushed
off
incontinently
and
blown
sphinx
*punct* ,
bronze
doors
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
it
proved
*punct* ,
my
chances
of
finding
the
time
machine
*punct* ,
all
together
into
nonexistence
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
after
that
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
that
we
came
to
a
little
open
court
within
the
palace
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
turfed
*punct* ,
and
had
three
fruit
*punct* -
trees
*punct* .
*break*
so
we
rested
and
refreshed
ourselves
*punct* .
*break*
towards
sunset
i
began
to
consider
our
position
*punct* .
*break*
night
was
creeping
upon
us
*punct* ,
and
my
inaccessible
hiding-place
had
still
to
be
found
*punct* .
*break*
but
that
troubled
me
very
little
now
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
in
my
possession
a
thing
that
was
*punct* ,
perhaps
*punct* ,
the
best
of
all
defences
against
the
morlocks
*mdash*
i
had
matches
*punct* !
*break*
i
had
the
camphor
in
my
pocket
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
if
a
blaze
were
needed
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
best
thing
we
could
do
would
be
to
pass
the
night
in
the
open
*punct* ,
protected
by
a
fire
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
morning
there
was
the
getting
of
the
time
machine
*punct* .
*break*
towards
that
*punct* ,
as
yet
*punct* ,
i
had
only
my
iron
mace
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
*punct* ,
with
my
growing
knowledge
*punct* ,
i
felt
very
differently
towards
those
bronze
doors
*punct* .
*break*
up
to
this
*punct* ,
i
had
refrained
from
forcing
them
*punct* ,
largely
because
of
the
mystery
on
the
other
side
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
never
impressed
me
as
being
very
strong
*punct* ,
and
i
hoped
to
find
my
bar
of
iron
not
altogether
inadequate
for
the
work
*punct* .
*break*
we
emerged
from
the
palace
while
the
sun
was
still
in
part
above
the
horizon
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
determined
to
reach
the
white
sphinx
early
the
next
morning
*punct* ,
and
ere
the
dusk
i
purposed
pushing
through
the
woods
that
had
stopped
me
on
the
previous
journey
*punct* .
*break*
my
plan
was
to
go
as
far
as
possible
that
night
*punct* ,
and
then
*punct* ,
building
a
fire
*punct* ,
to
sleep
in
the
protection
of
its
glare
*punct* .
*break*
accordingly
*punct* ,
as
we
went
along
i
gathered
any
sticks
or
dried
grass
i
saw
*punct* ,
and
presently
had
my
arms
full
of
such
litter
*punct* .
*break*
thus
loaded
*punct* ,
our
progress
was
slower
than
i
had
anticipated
*punct* ,
and
besides
weena
was
tired
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
began
to
suffer
from
sleepiness
too
*punct* ;
so
that
it
was
full
night
before
we
reached
the
wood
*punct* .
*break*
upon
the
shrubby
hill
of
its
edge
weena
would
have
stopped
*punct* ,
fearing
the
darkness
before
us
*punct* ;
but
a
singular
sense
of
impending
calamity
*punct* ,
that
should
indeed
have
served
me
as
a
warning
*punct* ,
drove
me
onward
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
been
without
sleep
for
a
night
and
two
days
*punct* ,
and
i
was
feverish
and
irritable
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
sleep
coming
upon
me
*punct* ,
and
the
morlocks
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
while
we
hesitated
*punct* ,
among
the
black
bushes
behind
us
*punct* ,
and
dim
against
their
blackness
*punct* ,
i
saw
three
crouching
figures
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
scrub
and
long
grass
all
about
us
*punct* ,
and
i
did
not
feel
safe
from
their
insidious
approach
*punct* .
*break*
the
forest
*punct* ,
i
calculated
*punct* ,
was
rather
less
than
a
mile
across
*punct* .
*break*
if
we
could
get
through
it
to
the
bare
hill-side
*punct* ,
there
*punct* ,
as
it
seemed
to
me
*punct* ,
was
an
altogether
safer
resting-place
*punct* ;
i
thought
that
with
my
matches
and
my
camphor
i
could
contrive
to
keep
my
path
illuminated
through
the
woods
*punct* .
*break*
yet
it
was
evident
that
if
i
was
to
flourish
matches
with
my
hands
i
should
have
to
abandon
my
firewood
*punct* ;
so
*punct* ,
rather
reluctantly
*punct* ,
i
put
it
down
*punct* .
*break*
and
then
it
came
into
my
head
that
i
would
amaze
our
friends
behind
by
lighting
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
to
discover
the
atrocious
folly
of
this
proceeding
*punct* ,
but
it
came
to
my
mind
as
an
ingenious
move
for
covering
our
retreat
*punct* .
*break*
i
don't
know
if
you
have
ever
thought
what
a
rare
thing
flame
must
be
in
the
absence
of
man
and
in
a
temperate
climate
*punct* .
*break*
the
sun's
heat
is
rarely
strong
enough
to
burn
*punct* ,
even
when
it
is
focused
by
dewdrops
*punct* ,
as
is
sometimes
the
case
in
more
tropical
districts
*punct* .
*break*
lightning
may
blast
and
blacken
*punct* ,
but
it
rarely
gives
rise
to
widespread
fire
*punct* .
*break*
decaying
vegetation
may
occasionally
smoulder
with
the
heat
of
its
fermentation
*punct* ,
but
this
rarely
results
in
flame
*punct* .
*break*
in
this
decadence
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
the
art
of
fire-making
had
been
forgotten
on
the
earth
*punct* .
*break*
the
red
tongues
that
went
licking
up
my
heap
of
wood
were
an
altogether
new
and
strange
thing
to
weena
*punct* .
*break*
she
wanted
to
run
to
it
and
play
with
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
believe
she
would
have
cast
herself
into
it
had
i
not
restrained
her
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
caught
her
up
*punct* ,
and
in
spite
of
her
struggles
*punct* ,
plunged
boldly
before
me
into
the
wood
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
little
way
the
glare
of
my
fire
lit
the
path
*punct* .
*break*
looking
back
presently
*punct* ,
i
could
see
*punct* ,
through
the
crowded
stems
*punct* ,
that
from
my
heap
of
sticks
the
blaze
had
spread
to
some
bushes
adjacent
*punct* ,
and
a
curved
line
of
fire
was
creeping
up
the
grass
of
the
hill
*punct* .
*break*
i
laughed
at
that
*punct* ,
and
turned
again
to
the
dark
trees
before
me
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
very
black
*punct* ,
and
weena
clung
to
me
convulsively
*punct* ,
but
there
was
still
*punct* ,
as
my
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
darkness
*punct* ,
sufficient
light
for
me
to
avoid
the
stems
*punct* .
*break*
overhead
it
was
simply
black
*punct* ,
except
where
a
gap
of
remote
blue
sky
shone
down
upon
us
here
and
there
*punct* .
*break*
i
struck
none
of
my
matches
because
i
had
no
hand
free
*punct* .
*break*
upon
my
left
arm
i
carried
my
little
one
*punct* ,
in
my
right
hand
i
had
my
iron
bar
*punct* .
*break*
for
some
way
i
heard
nothing
but
the
crackling
twigs
under
my
feet
*punct* ,
the
faint
rustle
of
the
breeze
above
*punct* ,
and
my
own
breathing
and
the
throb
of
the
blood-vessels
in
my
ears
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
seemed
to
know
of
a
pattering
about
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
pushed
on
grimly
*punct* .
*break*
the
pattering
grew
more
distinct
*punct* ,
and
then
i
caught
the
same
queer
sound
and
voices
i
had
heard
in
the
under-world
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
evidently
several
of
the
morlocks
*punct* ,
and
they
were
closing
in
upon
me
*punct* .
*break*
indeed
*punct* ,
in
another
minute
i
felt
a
tug
at
my
coat
*punct* ,
then
something
at
my
arm
*punct* .
*break*
and
weena
shivered
violently
*punct* ,
and
became
quite
still
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
time
for
a
match
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
get
one
i
must
put
her
down
*punct* .
*break*
i
did
so
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
as
i
fumbled
with
my
pocket
*punct* ,
a
struggle
began
in
the
darkness
about
my
knees
*punct* ,
perfectly
silent
on
her
part
and
with
the
same
peculiar
cooing
sounds
from
the
morlocks
*punct* .
*break*
soft
little
hands
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
were
creeping
over
my
coat
and
back
*punct* ,
touching
even
my
neck
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
match
scratched
and
fizzed
*punct* .
*break*
i
held
it
flaring
*punct* ,
and
saw
the
white
backs
of
the
morlocks
in
flight
amid
the
trees
*punct* .
*break*
i
hastily
took
a
lump
of
camphor
from
my
pocket
*punct* ,
and
prepared
to
light
is
as
soon
as
the
match
should
wane
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
looked
at
weena
*punct* .
*break*
she
was
lying
clutching
my
feet
and
quite
motionless
*punct* ,
with
her
face
to
the
ground
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
sudden
fright
i
stooped
to
her
*punct* .
*break*
she
seemed
scarcely
to
breathe
*punct* .
*break*
i
lit
the
block
of
camphor
and
flung
it
to
the
ground
*punct* ,
and
as
it
split
and
flared
up
and
drove
back
the
morlocks
and
the
shadows
*punct* ,
i
knelt
down
and
lifted
her
*punct* .
*break*
the
wood
behind
seemed
full
of
the
stir
and
murmur
of
a
great
company
*punct* !
*break*
she
seemed
to
have
fainted
*punct* .
*break*
i
put
her
carefully
upon
my
shoulder
and
rose
to
push
on
*punct* ,
and
then
there
came
a
horrible
realization
*punct* .
*break*
in
manoeuvring
with
my
matches
and
weena
*punct* ,
i
had
turned
myself
about
several
times
*punct* ,
and
now
i
had
not
the
faintest
idea
in
what
direction
lay
my
path
*punct* .
*break*
for
all
i
knew
*punct* ,
i
might
be
facing
back
towards
the
palace
of
green
porcelain
*punct* .
*break*
i
found
myself
in
a
cold
sweat
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
to
think
rapidly
what
to
do
*punct* .
*break*
i
determined
to
build
a
fire
and
encamp
where
we
were
*punct* .
*break*
i
put
weena
*punct* ,
still
motionless
*punct* ,
down
upon
a
turfy
bole
*punct* ,
and
very
hastily
*punct* ,
as
my
first
lump
of
camphor
waned
*punct* ,
i
began
collecting
sticks
and
leaves
*punct* .
*break*
here
and
there
out
of
the
darkness
round
me
the
morlocks'eyes
shone
like
carbuncles
*punct* .
*break*
the
camphor
flickered
and
went
out
*punct* .
*break*
i
lit
a
match
*punct* ,
and
as
i
did
so
*punct* ,
two
white
forms
that
had
been
approaching
weena
dashed
hastily
away
*punct* .
*break*
one
was
so
blinded
by
the
light
that
he
came
straight
for
me
*punct* ,
and
i
felt
his
bones
grind
under
the
blow
of
my
fist
*punct* .
*break*
he
gave
a
whoop
of
dismay
*punct* ,
staggered
a
little
way
*punct* ,
and
fell
down
*punct* .
*break*
i
lit
another
piece
of
camphor
*punct* ,
and
went
on
gathering
my
bonfire
*punct* .
*break*
presently
i
noticed
how
dry
was
some
of
the
foliage
above
me
*punct* ,
for
since
my
arrival
on
the
time
machine
*punct* ,
a
matter
of
a
week
*punct* ,
no
rain
had
fallen
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
instead
of
casting
about
among
the
trees
for
fallen
twigs
*punct* ,
i
began
leaping
up
and
dragging
down
branches
*punct* .
*break*
very
soon
i
had
a
choking
smoky
fire
of
green
wood
and
dry
sticks
*punct* ,
and
could
economize
my
camphor
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
turned
to
where
weena
lay
beside
my
iron
mace
*punct* .
*break*
i
tried
what
i
could
to
revive
her
*punct* ,
but
she
lay
like
one
dead
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
not
even
satisfy
myself
whether
or
not
she
breathed
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
the
smoke
of
the
fire
beat
over
towards
me
*punct* ,
and
it
must
have
made
me
heavy
of
a
sudden
*punct* .
*break*
moreover
*punct* ,
the
vapour
of
camphor
was
in
the
air
*punct* .
*break*
my
fire
would
not
need
replenishing
for
an
hour
or
so
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
very
weary
after
my
exertion
*punct* ,
and
sat
down
*punct* .
*break*
the
wood
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
was
full
of
a
slumbrous
murmur
that
i
did
not
understand
*punct* .
*break*
i
seemed
just
to
nod
and
open
my
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
but
all
was
dark
*punct* ,
and
the
morlocks
had
their
hands
upon
me
*punct* .
*break*
flinging
off
their
clinging
fingers
i
hastily
felt
in
my
pocket
for
the
match-box
*punct* ,
and
*mdash*
it
had
gone
*punct* !
*break*
then
they
gripped
and
closed
with
me
again
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
moment
i
knew
what
had
happened
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
slept
*punct* ,
and
my
fire
had
gone
out
*punct* ,
and
the
bitterness
of
death
came
over
my
soul
*punct* .
*break*
the
forest
seemed
full
of
the
smell
of
burning
wood
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
caught
by
the
neck
*punct* ,
by
the
hair
*punct* ,
by
the
arms
*punct* ,
and
pulled
down
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
indescribably
horrible
in
the
darkness
to
feel
all
these
soft
creatures
heaped
upon
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
as
if
i
was
in
a
monstrous
spider's
web
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
overpowered
*punct* ,
and
went
down
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
little
teeth
nipping
at
my
neck
*punct* .
*break*
i
rolled
over
*punct* ,
and
as
i
did
so
my
hand
came
against
my
iron
lever
*punct* .
*break*
it
gave
me
strength
*punct* .
*break*
i
struggled
up
*punct* ,
shaking
the
human
rats
from
me
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
holding
the
bar
short
*punct* ,
i
thrust
where
i
judged
their
faces
might
be
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
feel
the
succulent
giving
of
flesh
and
bone
under
my
blows
*punct* ,
and
for
a
moment
i
was
free
*punct* .
*break*
the
strange
exultation
that
so
often
seems
to
accompany
hard
fighting
came
upon
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
that
both
i
and
weena
were
lost
*punct* ,
but
i
determined
to
make
the
morlocks
pay
for
their
meat
*punct* .
*break*
i
stood
with
my
back
to
a
tree
*punct* ,
swinging
the
iron
bar
before
me
*punct* .
*break*
the
whole
wood
was
full
of
the
stir
and
cries
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
a
minute
passed
*punct* .
*break*
their
voices
seemed
to
rise
to
a
higher
pitch
of
excitement
*punct* ,
and
their
movements
grew
faster
*punct* .
*break*
yet
none
came
within
reach
*punct* .
*break*
i
stood
glaring
at
the
blackness
*punct* .
*break*
then
suddenly
came
hope
*punct* .
*break*
what
if
the
morlocks
were
afraid
*punct* ?
*break*
and
close
on
the
heels
of
that
came
a
strange
thing
*punct* .
*break*
the
darkness
seemed
to
grow
luminous
*punct* .
*break*
very
dimly
i
began
to
see
the
morlocks
about
me
*mdash*
three
battered
at
my
feet
*mdash*
and
then
i
recognized
*punct* ,
with
incredulous
surprise
*punct* ,
that
the
others
were
running
*punct* ,
in
an
incessant
stream
*punct* ,
as
it
seemed
*punct* ,
from
behind
me
*punct* ,
and
away
through
the
wood
in
front
*punct* .
*break*
and
their
backs
seemed
no
longer
white
*punct* ,
but
reddish
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
stood
agape
*punct* ,
i
saw
a
little
red
spark
go
drifting
across
a
gap
of
starlight
between
the
branches
*punct* ,
and
vanish
*punct* .
*break*
and
at
that
i
understood
the
smell
of
burning
wood
*punct* ,
the
slumbrous
murmur
that
was
growing
now
into
a
gusty
roar
*punct* ,
the
red
glow
*punct* ,
and
the
morlocks'flight
*punct* .
*break*
stepping
out
from
behind
my
tree
and
looking
back
*punct* ,
i
saw
*punct* ,
through
the
black
pillars
of
the
nearer
trees
*punct* ,
the
flames
of
the
burning
forest
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
my
first
fire
coming
after
me
*punct* .
*break*
with
that
i
looked
for
weena
*punct* ,
but
she
was
gone
*punct* .
*break*
the
hissing
and
crackling
behind
me
*punct* ,
the
explosive
thud
as
each
fresh
tree
burst
into
flame
*punct* ,
left
little
time
for
reflection
*punct* .
*break*
my
iron
bar
still
gripped
*punct* ,
i
followed
in
the
morlocks'path
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
close
race
*punct* .
*break*
once
the
flames
crept
forward
so
swiftly
on
my
right
as
i
ran
that
i
was
outflanked
and
had
to
strike
off
to
the
left
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
last
i
emerged
upon
a
small
open
space
*punct* ,
and
as
i
did
so
*punct* ,
a
morlock
came
blundering
towards
me
*punct* ,
and
past
me
*punct* ,
and
went
on
straight
into
the
fire
*punct* !
*break*
and
now
i
was
to
see
the
most
weird
and
horrible
thing
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
of
all
that
i
beheld
in
that
future
age
*punct* .
*break*
this
whole
space
was
as
bright
as
day
with
the
reflection
of
the
fire
*punct* .
*break*
in
the
centre
was
a
hillock
or
tumulus
*punct* ,
surmounted
by
a
scorched
hawthorn
*punct* .
*break*
beyond
this
was
another
arm
of
the
burning
forest
*punct* ,
with
yellow
tongues
already
writhing
from
it
*punct* ,
completely
encircling
the
space
with
a
fence
of
fire
*punct* .
*break*
upon
the
hill-side
were
some
thirty
or
forty
morlocks
*punct* ,
dazzled
by
the
light
and
heat
*punct* ,
and
blundering
hither
and
thither
against
each
other
in
their
bewilderment
*punct* .
*break*
at
first
i
did
not
realize
their
blindness
*punct* ,
and
struck
furiously
at
them
with
my
bar
*punct* ,
in
a
frenzy
of
fear
*punct* ,
as
they
approached
me
*punct* ,
killing
one
and
crippling
several
more
*punct* .
*break*
but
when
i
had
watched
the
gestures
of
one
of
them
groping
under
the
hawthorn
against
the
red
sky
*punct* ,
and
heard
their
moans
*punct* ,
i
was
assured
of
their
absolute
helplessness
and
misery
in
the
glare
*punct* ,
and
i
struck
no
more
of
them
*punct* .
*break*
yet
every
now
and
then
one
would
come
straight
towards
me
*punct* ,
setting
loose
a
quivering
horror
that
made
me
quick
to
elude
him
*punct* .
*break*
at
one
time
the
flames
died
down
somewhat
*punct* ,
and
i
feared
the
foul
creatures
would
presently
be
able
to
see
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
thinking
of
beginning
the
fight
by
killing
some
of
them
before
this
should
happen
*punct* ;
but
the
fire
burst
out
again
brightly
*punct* ,
and
i
stayed
my
hand
*punct* .
*break*
i
walked
about
the
hill
among
them
and
avoided
them
*punct* ,
looking
for
some
trace
of
weena
*punct* .
*break*
but
weena
was
gone
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
i
sat
down
on
the
summit
of
the
hillock
*punct* ,
and
watched
this
strange
incredible
company
of
blind
things
groping
to
and
fro
*punct* ,
and
making
uncanny
noises
to
each
other
*punct* ,
as
the
glare
of
the
fire
beat
on
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
coiling
uprush
of
smoke
streamed
across
the
sky
*punct* ,
and
through
the
rare
tatters
of
that
red
canopy
*punct* ,
remote
as
though
they
belonged
to
another
universe
*punct* ,
shone
the
little
stars
*punct* .
*break*
two
or
three
morlocks
came
blundering
into
me
*punct* ,
and
i
drove
them
off
with
blows
of
my
fists
*punct* ,
trembling
as
i
did
so
*punct* .
*break*
for
the
most
part
of
that
night
i
was
persuaded
it
was
a
nightmare
*punct* .
*break*
i
bit
myself
and
screamed
in
a
passionate
desire
to
awake
*punct* .
*break*
i
beat
the
ground
with
my
hands
*punct* ,
and
got
up
and
sat
down
again
*punct* ,
and
wandered
here
and
there
*punct* ,
and
again
sat
down
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
would
fall
to
rubbing
my
eyes
and
calling
upon
god
to
let
me
awake
*punct* .
*break*
thrice
i
saw
morlocks
put
their
heads
down
in
a
kind
of
agony
and
rush
into
the
flames
*punct* .
*break*
but
*punct* ,
at
last
*punct* ,
above
the
subsiding
red
of
the
fire
*punct* ,
above
the
streaming
masses
of
black
smoke
and
the
whitening
and
blackening
tree
stumps
*punct* ,
and
the
diminishing
numbers
of
these
dim
creatures
*punct* ,
came
the
white
light
of
the
day
*punct* .
*break*
i
searched
again
for
traces
of
weena
*punct* ,
but
there
were
none
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
plain
that
they
had
left
her
poor
little
body
in
the
forest
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
describe
how
it
relieved
me
to
think
that
it
had
escaped
the
awful
fate
to
which
it
seemed
destined
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
thought
of
that
*punct* ,
i
was
almost
moved
to
begin
a
massacre
of
the
helpless
abominations
about
me
*punct* ,
but
i
contained
myself
*punct* .
*break*
the
hillock
*punct* ,
as
i
have
said
*punct* ,
was
a
kind
of
island
in
the
forest
*punct* .
*break*
from
its
summit
i
could
now
make
out
through
a
haze
of
smoke
the
palace
of
green
porcelain
*punct* ,
and
from
that
i
could
get
my
bearings
for
the
white
sphinx
*punct* .
*break*
and
so
*punct* ,
leaving
the
remnant
of
these
damned
souls
still
going
hither
and
thither
and
moaning
*punct* ,
as
the
day
grew
clearer
*punct* ,
i
tied
some
grass
about
my
feet
and
limped
on
across
smoking
ashes
and
among
black
stems
*punct* ,
that
still
pulsated
internally
with
fire
*punct* ,
towards
the
hiding-place
of
the
time
machine
*punct* .
*break*
i
walked
slowly
*punct* ,
for
i
was
almost
exhausted
*punct* ,
as
well
as
lame
*punct* ,
and
i
felt
the
intensest
wretchedness
for
the
horrible
death
of
little
weena
*punct* .
*break*
it
seemed
an
overwhelming
calamity
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
in
this
old
familiar
room
*punct* ,
it
is
more
like
the
sorrow
of
a
dream
than
an
actual
loss
*punct* .
*break*
but
that
morning
it
left
me
absolutely
lonely
again
*mdash*
terribly
alone
*punct* .
*break*
i
began
to
think
of
this
house
of
mine
*punct* ,
of
this
fireside
*punct* ,
of
some
of
you
*punct* ,
and
with
such
thoughts
came
a
longing
that
was
pain
*punct* .
*break*
but
as
i
walked
over
the
smoking
ashes
under
the
bright
morning
sky
*punct* ,
i
made
a
discovery
*punct* .
*break*
in
my
trouser
pocket
were
still
some
loose
matches
*punct* .
*break*
the
box
must
have
leaked
before
it
was
lost
*punct* .
*break*
about
eight
or
nine
in
the
morning
i
came
to
the
same
seat
of
yellow
metal
from
which
i
had
viewed
the
world
upon
the
evening
of
my
arrival
*punct* .
*break*
i
thought
of
my
hasty
conclusions
upon
that
evening
and
could
not
refrain
from
laughing
bitterly
at
my
confidence
*punct* .
*break*
here
was
the
same
beautiful
scene
*punct* ,
the
same
abundant
foliage
*punct* ,
the
same
splendid
palaces
and
magnificent
ruins
*punct* ,
the
same
silver
river
running
between
its
fertile
banks
*punct* .
*break*
the
gay
robes
of
the
beautiful
people
moved
hither
and
thither
among
the
trees
*punct* .
*break*
some
were
bathing
in
exactly
the
place
where
i
had
saved
weena
*punct* ,
and
that
suddenly
gave
me
a
keen
stab
of
pain
*punct* .
*break*
and
like
blots
upon
the
landscape
rose
the
cupolas
above
the
ways
to
the
under-world
*punct* .
*break*
i
understood
now
what
all
the
beauty
of
the
over
*punct* -
world
people
covered
*punct* .
*break*
very
pleasant
was
their
day
*punct* ,
as
pleasant
as
the
day
of
the
cattle
in
the
field
*punct* .
*break*
like
the
cattle
*punct* ,
they
knew
of
no
enemies
and
provided
against
no
needs
*punct* .
*break*
and
their
end
was
the
same
*punct* .
*break*
i
grieved
to
think
how
brief
the
dream
of
the
human
intellect
had
been
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
committed
suicide
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
set
itself
steadfastly
towards
comfort
and
ease
*punct* ,
a
balanced
society
with
security
and
permanency
as
its
watchword
*punct* ,
it
had
attained
its
hopes
*mdash*
to
come
to
this
at
last
*punct* .
*break*
once
*punct* ,
life
and
property
must
have
reached
almost
absolute
safety
*punct* .
*break*
the
rich
had
been
assured
of
his
wealth
and
comfort
*punct* ,
the
toiler
assured
of
his
life
and
work
*punct* .
*break*
no
doubt
in
that
perfect
world
there
had
been
no
unemployed
problem
*punct* ,
no
social
question
left
unsolved
*punct* .
*break*
and
a
great
quiet
had
followed
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
a
law
of
nature
we
overlook
*punct* ,
that
intellectual
versatility
is
the
compensation
for
change
*punct* ,
danger
*punct* ,
and
trouble
*punct* .
*break*
an
animal
perfectly
in
harmony
with
its
environment
is
a
perfect
mechanism
*punct* .
*break*
nature
never
appeals
to
intelligence
until
habit
and
instinct
are
useless
*punct* .
*break*
there
is
no
intelligence
where
there
is
no
change
and
no
need
of
change
*punct* .
*break*
only
those
animals
partake
of
intelligence
that
have
to
meet
a
huge
variety
of
needs
and
dangers
*punct* .
*break*
so
*punct* ,
as
i
see
it
*punct* ,
the
upper-world
man
had
drifted
towards
his
feeble
prettiness
*punct* ,
and
the
under-world
to
mere
mechanical
industry
*punct* .
*break*
but
that
perfect
state
had
lacked
one
thing
even
for
mechanical
perfection
*mdash*
absolute
permanency
*punct* .
*break*
apparently
as
time
went
on
*punct* ,
the
feeding
of
the
under-world
*punct* ,
however
it
was
effected
*punct* ,
had
become
disjointed
*punct* .
*break*
mother
necessity
*punct* ,
who
had
been
staved
off
for
a
few
thousand
years
*punct* ,
came
back
again
*punct* ,
and
she
began
below
*punct* .
*break*
the
under-world
being
in
contact
with
machinery
*punct* ,
which
*punct* ,
however
perfect
*punct* ,
still
needs
some
little
thought
outside
habit
*punct* ,
had
probably
retained
perforce
rather
more
initiative
*punct* ,
if
less
of
every
other
human
character
*punct* ,
than
the
upper
*punct* .
*break*
and
when
other
meat
failed
them
*punct* ,
they
turned
to
what
old
habit
had
hitherto
forbidden
*punct* .
*break*
so
i
say
i
saw
it
in
my
last
view
of
the
world
of
eight
hundred
and
two
thousand
seven
hundred
and
one
*punct* .
*break*
it
may
be
as
wrong
an
explanation
as
mortal
wit
could
invent
*punct* .
*break*
it
is
how
the
thing
shaped
itself
to
me
*punct* ,
and
as
that
i
give
it
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
after
the
fatigues
*punct* ,
excitements
*punct* ,
and
terrors
of
the
past
days
*punct* ,
and
in
spite
of
my
grief
*punct* ,
this
seat
and
the
tranquil
view
and
the
warm
sunlight
were
very
pleasant
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
very
tired
and
sleepy
*punct* ,
and
soon
my
theorizing
passed
into
dozing
*punct* .
*break*
catching
myself
at
that
*punct* ,
i
took
my
own
hint
*punct* ,
and
spreading
myself
out
upon
the
turf
i
had
a
long
and
refreshing
sleep
*punct* .
*break*
i
awoke
a
little
before
sunsetting
*punct* .
*break*
i
now
felt
safe
against
being
caught
napping
by
the
morlocks
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
stretching
myself
*punct* ,
i
came
on
down
the
hill
towards
the
white
sphinx
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
my
crowbar
in
one
hand
*punct* ,
and
the
other
hand
played
with
the
matches
in
my
pocket
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
came
a
most
unexpected
thing
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
approached
the
pedestal
of
the
sphinx
i
found
the
bronze
valves
were
open
*punct* .
*break*
they
had
slid
down
into
grooves
*punct* .
*break*
at
that
i
stopped
short
before
them
*punct* ,
hesitating
to
enter
*punct* .
*break*
within
was
a
small
apartment
*punct* ,
and
on
a
raised
place
in
the
corner
of
this
was
the
time
machine
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
the
small
levers
in
my
pocket
*punct* .
*break*
so
here
*punct* ,
after
all
my
elaborate
preparations
for
the
siege
of
the
white
sphinx
*punct* ,
was
a
meek
surrender
*punct* .
*break*
i
threw
my
iron
bar
away
*punct* ,
almost
sorry
not
to
use
it
*punct* .
*break*
a
sudden
thought
came
into
my
head
as
i
stooped
towards
the
portal
*punct* .
*break*
for
once
*punct* ,
at
least
*punct* ,
i
grasped
the
mental
operations
of
the
morlocks
*punct* .
*break*
suppressing
a
strong
inclination
to
laugh
*punct* ,
i
stepped
through
the
bronze
frame
and
up
to
the
time
machine
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
surprised
to
find
it
had
been
carefully
oiled
and
cleaned
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
suspected
since
that
the
morlocks
had
even
partially
taken
it
to
pieces
while
trying
in
their
dim
way
to
grasp
its
purpose
*punct* .
*break*
now
as
i
stood
and
examined
it
*punct* ,
finding
a
pleasure
in
the
mere
touch
of
the
contrivance
*punct* ,
the
thing
i
had
expected
happened
*punct* .
*break*
the
bronze
panels
suddenly
slid
up
and
struck
the
frame
with
a
clang
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
in
the
dark
*mdash*
trapped
*punct* .
*break*
so
the
morlocks
thought
*punct* .
*break*
at
that
i
chuckled
gleefully
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
already
hear
their
murmuring
laughter
as
they
came
towards
me
*punct* .
*break*
very
calmly
i
tried
to
strike
the
match
*punct* .
*break*
i
had
only
to
fix
on
the
levers
and
depart
then
like
a
ghost
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
had
overlooked
one
little
thing
*punct* .
*break*
the
matches
were
of
that
abominable
kind
that
light
only
on
the
box
*punct* .
*break*
you
may
imagine
how
all
my
calm
vanished
*punct* .
*break*
the
little
brutes
were
close
upon
me
*punct* .
*break*
one
touched
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
made
a
sweeping
blow
in
the
dark
at
them
with
the
levers
*punct* ,
and
began
to
scramble
into
the
saddle
of
the
machine
*punct* .
*break*
then
came
one
hand
upon
me
and
then
another
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
had
simply
to
fight
against
their
persistent
fingers
for
my
levers
*punct* ,
and
at
the
same
time
feel
for
the
studs
over
which
these
fitted
*punct* .
*break*
one
*punct* ,
indeed
*punct* ,
they
almost
got
away
from
me
*punct* .
*break*
as
it
slipped
from
my
hand
*punct* ,
i
had
to
butt
in
the
dark
with
my
head
*mdash*
i
could
hear
the
morlock's
skull
ring
*mdash*
to
recover
it
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
nearer
thing
than
the
fight
in
the
forest
*punct* ,
i
think
*punct* ,
this
last
scramble
*punct* .
*break*
but
at
last
the
lever
was
fitted
and
pulled
over
*punct* .
*break*
the
clinging
hands
slipped
from
me
*punct* .
*break*
the
darkness
presently
fell
from
my
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
i
found
myself
in
the
same
grey
light
and
tumult
i
have
already
described
*punct* .
*break*
i
have
already
told
you
of
the
sickness
and
confusion
that
comes
with
time
travelling
*punct* .
*break*
and
this
time
i
was
not
seated
properly
in
the
saddle
*punct* ,
but
sideways
and
in
an
unstable
fashion
*punct* .
*break*
for
an
indefinite
time
i
clung
to
the
machine
as
it
swayed
and
vibrated
*punct* ,
quite
unheeding
how
i
went
*punct* ,
and
when
i
brought
myself
to
look
at
the
dials
again
i
was
amazed
to
find
where
i
had
arrived
*punct* .
*break*
one
dial
records
days
*punct* ,
and
another
thousands
of
days
*punct* ,
another
millions
of
days
*punct* ,
and
another
thousands
of
millions
*punct* .
*break*
now
*punct* ,
instead
of
reversing
the
levers
*punct* ,
i
had
pulled
them
over
so
as
to
go
forward
with
them
*punct* ,
and
when
i
came
to
look
at
these
indicators
i
found
that
the
thousands
hand
was
sweeping
round
as
fast
as
the
seconds
hand
of
a
watch
*mdash*
into
futurity
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
drove
on
*punct* ,
a
peculiar
change
crept
over
the
appearance
of
things
*punct* .
*break*
the
palpitating
greyness
grew
darker
*punct* ;
then
*mdash*
though
i
was
still
travelling
with
prodigious
velocity
*mdash*
the
blinking
succession
of
day
and
night
*punct* ,
which
was
usually
indicative
of
a
slower
pace
*punct* ,
returned
*punct* ,
and
grew
more
and
more
marked
*punct* .
*break*
this
puzzled
me
very
much
at
first
*punct* .
*break*
the
alternations
of
night
and
day
grew
slower
and
slower
*punct* ,
and
so
did
the
passage
of
the
sun
across
the
sky
*punct* ,
until
they
seemed
to
stretch
through
centuries
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
a
steady
twilight
brooded
over
the
earth
*punct* ,
a
twilight
only
broken
now
and
then
when
a
comet
glared
across
the
darkling
sky
*punct* .
*break*
the
band
of
light
that
had
indicated
the
sun
had
long
since
disappeared
*punct* ;
for
the
sun
had
ceased
to
set
*mdash*
it
simply
rose
and
fell
in
the
west
*punct* ,
and
grew
ever
broader
and
more
red
*punct* .
*break*
all
trace
of
the
moon
had
vanished
*punct* .
*break*
the
circling
of
the
stars
*punct* ,
growing
slower
and
slower
*punct* ,
had
given
place
to
creeping
points
of
light
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
some
time
before
i
stopped
*punct* ,
the
sun
*punct* ,
red
and
very
large
*punct* ,
halted
motionless
upon
the
horizon
*punct* ,
a
vast
dome
glowing
with
a
dull
heat
*punct* ,
and
now
and
then
suffering
a
momentary
extinction
*punct* .
*break*
at
one
time
it
had
for
a
little
while
glowed
more
brilliantly
again
*punct* ,
but
it
speedily
reverted
to
its
sullen
red
heat
*punct* .
*break*
i
perceived
by
this
slowing
down
of
its
rising
and
setting
that
the
work
of
the
tidal
drag
was
done
*punct* .
*break*
the
earth
had
come
to
rest
with
one
face
to
the
sun
*punct* ,
even
as
in
our
own
time
the
moon
faces
the
earth
*punct* .
*break*
very
cautiously
*punct* ,
for
i
remembered
my
former
headlong
fall
*punct* ,
i
began
to
reverse
my
motion
*punct* .
*break*
slower
and
slower
went
the
circling
hands
until
the
thousands
one
seemed
motionless
and
the
daily
one
was
no
longer
a
mere
mist
upon
its
scale
*punct* .
*break*
still
slower
*punct* ,
until
the
dim
outlines
of
a
desolate
beach
grew
visible
*punct* .
*break*
i
stopped
very
gently
and
sat
upon
the
time
machine
*punct* ,
looking
round
*punct* .
*break*
the
sky
was
no
longer
blue
*punct* .
*break*
north-eastward
it
was
inky
black
*punct* ,
and
out
of
the
blackness
shone
brightly
and
steadily
the
pale
white
stars
*punct* .
*break*
overhead
it
was
a
deep
indian
red
and
starless
*punct* ,
and
south-eastward
it
grew
brighter
to
a
glowing
scarlet
where
*punct* ,
cut
by
the
horizon
*punct* ,
lay
the
huge
hull
of
the
sun
*punct* ,
red
and
motionless
*punct* .
*break*
the
rocks
about
me
were
of
a
harsh
reddish
colour
*punct* ,
and
all
the
trace
of
life
that
i
could
see
at
first
was
the
intensely
green
vegetation
that
covered
every
projecting
point
on
their
south-eastern
face
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
the
same
rich
green
that
one
sees
on
forest
moss
or
on
the
lichen
in
caves
*punct* :
plants
which
like
these
grow
in
a
perpetual
twilight
*punct* .
*break*
the
machine
was
standing
on
a
sloping
beach
*punct* .
*break*
the
sea
stretched
away
to
the
south-west
*punct* ,
to
rise
into
a
sharp
bright
horizon
against
the
wan
sky
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
no
breakers
and
no
waves
*punct* ,
for
not
a
breath
of
wind
was
stirring
*punct* .
*break*
only
a
slight
oily
swell
rose
and
fell
like
a
gentle
breathing
*punct* ,
and
showed
that
the
eternal
sea
was
still
moving
and
living
*punct* .
*break*
and
along
the
margin
where
the
water
sometimes
broke
was
a
thick
incrustation
of
salt
*mdash*
pink
under
the
lurid
sky
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
sense
of
oppression
in
my
head
*punct* ,
and
i
noticed
that
i
was
breathing
very
fast
*punct* .
*break*
the
sensation
reminded
me
of
my
only
experience
of
mountaineering
*punct* ,
and
from
that
i
judged
the
air
to
be
more
rarefied
than
it
is
now
*punct* .
*break*
far
away
up
the
desolate
slope
i
heard
a
harsh
scream
*punct* ,
and
saw
a
thing
like
a
huge
white
butterfly
go
slanting
and
flittering
up
into
the
sky
and
*punct* ,
circling
*punct* ,
disappear
over
some
low
hillocks
beyond
*punct* .
*break*
the
sound
of
its
voice
was
so
dismal
that
i
shivered
and
seated
myself
more
firmly
upon
the
machine
*punct* .
*break*
looking
round
me
again
*punct* ,
i
saw
that
*punct* ,
quite
near
*punct* ,
what
i
had
taken
to
be
a
reddish
mass
of
rock
was
moving
slowly
towards
me
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
saw
the
thing
was
really
a
monstrous
crab-like
creature
*punct* .
*break*
can
you
imagine
a
crab
as
large
as
yonder
table
*punct* ,
with
its
many
legs
moving
slowly
and
uncertainly
*punct* ,
its
big
claws
swaying
*punct* ,
its
long
antennae
*punct* ,
like
carters'whips
*punct* ,
waving
and
feeling
*punct* ,
and
its
stalked
eyes
gleaming
at
you
on
either
side
of
its
metallic
front
*punct* ?
*break*
its
back
was
corrugated
and
ornamented
with
ungainly
bosses
*punct* ,
and
a
greenish
incrustation
blotched
it
here
and
there
*punct* .
*break*
i
could
see
the
many
palps
of
its
complicated
mouth
flickering
and
feeling
as
it
moved
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
stared
at
this
sinister
apparition
crawling
towards
me
*punct* ,
i
felt
a
tickling
on
my
cheek
as
though
a
fly
had
lighted
there
*punct* .
*break*
i
tried
to
brush
it
away
with
my
hand
*punct* ,
but
in
a
moment
it
returned
*punct* ,
and
almost
immediately
came
another
by
my
ear
*punct* .
*break*
i
struck
at
this
*punct* ,
and
caught
something
threadlike
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
drawn
swiftly
out
of
my
hand
*punct* .
*break*
with
a
frightful
qualm
*punct* ,
i
turned
*punct* ,
and
i
saw
that
i
had
grasped
the
antenna
of
another
monster
crab
that
stood
just
behind
me
*punct* .
*break*
its
evil
eyes
were
wriggling
on
their
stalks
*punct* ,
its
mouth
was
all
alive
with
appetite
*punct* ,
and
its
vast
ungainly
claws
*punct* ,
smeared
with
an
algal
slime
*punct* ,
were
descending
upon
me
*punct* .
*break*
in
a
moment
my
hand
was
on
the
lever
*punct* ,
and
i
had
placed
a
month
between
myself
and
these
monsters
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
was
still
on
the
same
beach
*punct* ,
and
i
saw
them
distinctly
now
as
soon
as
i
stopped
*punct* .
*break*
dozens
of
them
seemed
to
be
crawling
here
and
there
*punct* ,
in
the
sombre
light
*punct* ,
among
the
foliated
sheets
of
intense
green
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
convey
the
sense
of
abominable
desolation
that
hung
over
the
world
*punct* .
*break*
the
red
eastern
sky
*punct* ,
the
northward
blackness
*punct* ,
the
salt
dead
sea
*punct* ,
the
stony
beach
crawling
with
these
foul
*punct* ,
slow-stirring
monsters
*punct* ,
the
uniform
poisonous-looking
green
of
the
lichenous
plants
*punct* ,
the
thin
air
that
hurts
one's
lungs
*punct* :
all
contributed
to
an
appalling
effect
*punct* .
*break*
i
moved
on
a
hundred
years
*punct* ,
and
there
was
the
same
red
sun
*mdash*
a
little
larger
*punct* ,
a
little
duller
*mdash*
the
same
dying
sea
*punct* ,
the
same
chill
air
*punct* ,
and
the
same
crowd
of
earthy
crustacea
creeping
in
and
out
among
the
green
weed
and
the
red
rocks
*punct* .
*break*
and
in
the
westward
sky
*punct* ,
i
saw
a
curved
pale
line
like
a
vast
new
moon
*punct* .
*break*
so
i
travelled
*punct* ,
stopping
ever
and
again
*punct* ,
in
great
strides
of
a
thousand
years
or
more
*punct* ,
drawn
on
by
the
mystery
of
the
earth's
fate
*punct* ,
watching
with
a
strange
fascination
the
sun
grow
larger
and
duller
in
the
westward
sky
*punct* ,
and
the
life
of
the
old
earth
ebb
away
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
more
than
thirty
million
years
hence
*punct* ,
the
huge
red-hot
dome
of
the
sun
had
come
to
obscure
nearly
a
tenth
part
of
the
darkling
heavens
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
stopped
once
more
*punct* ,
for
the
crawling
multitude
of
crabs
had
disappeared
*punct* ,
and
the
red
beach
*punct* ,
save
for
its
livid
green
liverworts
and
lichens
*punct* ,
seemed
lifeless
*punct* .
*break*
and
now
it
was
flecked
with
white
*punct* .
*break*
a
bitter
cold
assailed
me
*punct* .
*break*
rare
white
flakes
ever
and
again
came
eddying
down
*punct* .
*break*
to
the
north-eastward
*punct* ,
the
glare
of
snow
lay
under
the
starlight
of
the
sable
sky
and
i
could
see
an
undulating
crest
of
hillocks
pinkish
white
*punct* .
*break*
there
were
fringes
of
ice
along
the
sea
margin
*punct* ,
with
drifting
masses
further
out
*punct* ;
but
the
main
expanse
of
that
salt
ocean
*punct* ,
all
bloody
under
the
eternal
sunset
*punct* ,
was
still
unfrozen
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
about
me
to
see
if
any
traces
of
animal
life
remained
*punct* .
*break*
a
certain
indefinable
apprehension
still
kept
me
in
the
saddle
of
the
machine
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
saw
nothing
moving
*punct* ,
in
earth
or
sky
or
sea
*punct* .
*break*
the
green
slime
on
the
rocks
alone
testified
that
life
was
not
extinct
*punct* .
*break*
a
shallow
sandbank
had
appeared
in
the
sea
and
the
water
had
receded
from
the
beach
*punct* .
*break*
i
fancied
i
saw
some
black
object
flopping
about
upon
this
bank
*punct* ,
but
it
became
motionless
as
i
looked
at
it
*punct* ,
and
i
judged
that
my
eye
had
been
deceived
*punct* ,
and
that
the
black
object
was
merely
a
rock
*punct* .
*break*
the
stars
in
the
sky
were
intensely
bright
and
seemed
to
me
to
twinkle
very
little
*punct* .
*break*
suddenly
i
noticed
that
the
circular
westward
outline
of
the
sun
had
changed
*punct* ;
that
a
concavity
*punct* ,
a
bay
*punct* ,
had
appeared
in
the
curve
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
this
grow
larger
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
minute
perhaps
i
stared
aghast
at
this
blackness
that
was
creeping
over
the
day
*punct* ,
and
then
i
realized
that
an
eclipse
was
beginning
*punct* .
*break*
either
the
moon
or
the
planet
mercury
was
passing
across
the
sun's
disk
*punct* .
*break*
naturally
*punct* ,
at
first
i
took
it
to
be
the
moon
*punct* ,
but
there
is
much
to
incline
me
to
believe
that
what
i
really
saw
was
the
transit
of
an
inner
planet
passing
very
near
to
the
earth
*punct* .
*break*
the
darkness
grew
apace
*punct* ;
a
cold
wind
began
to
blow
in
freshening
gusts
from
the
east
*punct* ,
and
the
showering
white
flakes
in
the
air
increased
in
number
*punct* .
*break*
from
the
edge
of
the
sea
came
a
ripple
and
whisper
*punct* .
*break*
beyond
these
lifeless
sounds
the
world
was
silent
*punct* .
*break*
it
would
be
hard
to
convey
the
stillness
of
it
*punct* .
*break*
all
the
sounds
of
man
*punct* ,
the
bleating
of
sheep
*punct* ,
the
cries
of
birds
*punct* ,
the
hum
of
insects
*punct* ,
the
stir
that
makes
the
background
of
our
lives
*mdash*
all
that
was
over
*punct* .
*break*
as
the
darkness
thickened
*punct* ,
the
eddying
flakes
grew
more
abundant
*punct* ,
dancing
before
my
eyes
*punct* ;
and
the
cold
of
the
air
more
intense
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
*punct* ,
one
by
one
*punct* ,
swiftly
*punct* ,
one
after
the
other
*punct* ,
the
white
peaks
of
the
distant
hills
vanished
into
blackness
*punct* .
*break*
the
breeze
rose
to
a
moaning
wind
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
the
black
central
shadow
of
the
eclipse
sweeping
towards
me
*punct* .
*break*
in
another
moment
the
pale
stars
alone
were
visible
*punct* .
*break*
all
else
was
rayless
obscurity
*punct* .
*break*
the
sky
was
absolutely
black
*punct* .
*break*
a
horror
of
this
great
darkness
came
on
me
*punct* .
*break*
the
cold
*punct* ,
that
smote
to
my
marrow
*punct* ,
and
the
pain
i
felt
in
breathing
*punct* ,
overcame
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
shivered
*punct* ,
and
a
deadly
nausea
seized
me
*punct* .
*break*
then
like
a
red-hot
bow
in
the
sky
appeared
the
edge
of
the
sun
*punct* .
*break*
i
got
off
the
machine
to
recover
myself
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
giddy
and
incapable
of
facing
the
return
journey
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
stood
sick
and
confused
i
saw
again
the
moving
thing
upon
the
shoal
*mdash*
there
was
no
mistake
now
that
it
was
a
moving
thing
*mdash*
against
the
red
water
of
the
sea
*punct* .
*break*
it
was
a
round
thing
*punct* ,
the
size
of
a
football
perhaps
*punct* ,
or
*punct* ,
it
may
be
*punct* ,
bigger
*punct* ,
and
tentacles
trailed
down
from
it
*punct* ;
it
seemed
black
against
the
weltering
blood-red
water
*punct* ,
and
it
was
hopping
fitfully
about
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
felt
i
was
fainting
*punct* .
*break*
but
a
terrible
dread
of
lying
helpless
in
that
remote
and
awful
twilight
sustained
me
while
i
clambered
upon
the
saddle
*punct* .
*break*
so
i
came
back
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
long
time
i
must
have
been
insensible
upon
the
machine
*punct* .
*break*
the
blinking
succession
of
the
days
and
nights
was
resumed
*punct* ,
the
sun
got
golden
again
*punct* ,
the
sky
blue
*punct* .
*break*
i
breathed
with
greater
freedom
*punct* .
*break*
the
fluctuating
contours
of
the
land
ebbed
and
flowed
*punct* .
*break*
the
hands
spun
backward
upon
the
dials
*punct* .
*break*
at
last
i
saw
again
the
dim
shadows
of
houses
*punct* ,
the
evidences
of
decadent
humanity
*punct* .
*break*
these
*punct* ,
too
*punct* ,
changed
and
passed
*punct* ,
and
others
came
*punct* .
*break*
presently
*punct* ,
when
the
million
dial
was
at
zero
*punct* ,
i
slackened
speed
*punct* .
*break*
i
began
to
recognize
our
own
petty
and
familiar
architecture
*punct* ,
the
thousands
hand
ran
back
to
the
starting-point
*punct* ,
the
night
and
day
flapped
slower
and
slower
*punct* .
*break*
then
the
old
walls
of
the
laboratory
came
round
me
*punct* .
*break*
very
gently
*punct* ,
now
*punct* ,
i
slowed
the
mechanism
down
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
one
little
thing
that
seemed
odd
to
me
*punct* .
*break*
i
think
i
have
told
you
that
when
i
set
out
*punct* ,
before
my
velocity
became
very
high
*punct* ,
mrs.
watchett
had
walked
across
the
room
*punct* ,
travelling
*punct* ,
as
it
seemed
to
me
*punct* ,
like
a
rocket
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
returned
*punct* ,
i
passed
again
across
that
minute
when
she
traversed
the
laboratory
*punct* .
*break*
but
now
her
every
motion
appeared
to
be
the
exact
inversion
of
her
previous
ones
*punct* .
*break*
the
door
at
the
lower
end
opened
*punct* ,
and
she
glided
quietly
up
the
laboratory
*punct* ,
back
foremost
*punct* ,
and
disappeared
behind
the
door
by
which
she
had
previously
entered
*punct* .
*break*
just
before
that
i
seemed
to
see
hillyer
for
a
moment
*punct* ;
but
he
passed
like
a
flash
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
stopped
the
machine
*punct* ,
and
saw
about
me
again
the
old
familiar
laboratory
*punct* ,
my
tools
*punct* ,
my
appliances
just
as
i
had
left
them
*punct* .
*break*
i
got
off
the
thing
very
shaky
*punct* ,
and
sat
down
upon
my
bench
*punct* .
*break*
for
several
minutes
i
trembled
violently
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
became
calmer
*punct* .
*break*
around
me
was
my
old
workshop
again
*punct* ,
exactly
as
it
had
been
*punct* .
*break*
i
might
have
slept
there
*punct* ,
and
the
whole
thing
have
been
a
dream
*punct* .
*break*
and
yet
*punct* ,
not
exactly
*punct* !
*break*
the
thing
had
started
from
the
south-east
corner
of
the
laboratory
*punct* .
*break*
it
had
come
to
rest
again
in
the
north-west
*punct* ,
against
the
wall
where
you
saw
it
*punct* .
*break*
that
gives
you
the
exact
distance
from
my
little
lawn
to
the
pedestal
of
the
white
sphinx
*punct* ,
into
which
the
morlocks
had
carried
my
machine
*punct* .
*break*
for
a
time
my
brain
went
stagnant
*punct* .
*break*
presently
i
got
up
and
came
through
the
passage
here
*punct* ,
limping
*punct* ,
because
my
heel
was
still
painful
*punct* ,
and
feeling
sorely
begrimed
*punct* .
*break*
i
saw
the
pall
mall
gazette
on
the
table
by
the
door
*punct* .
*break*
i
found
the
date
was
indeed
to-day
*punct* ,
and
looking
at
the
timepiece
*punct* ,
saw
the
hour
was
almost
eight
o'clock
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
your
voices
and
the
clatter
of
plates
*punct* .
*break*
i
hesitated
*mdash*
i
felt
so
sick
and
weak
*punct* .
*break*
then
i
sniffed
good
wholesome
meat
*punct* ,
and
opened
the
door
on
you
*punct* .
*break*
you
know
the
rest
*punct* .
*break*
i
washed
*punct* ,
and
dined
*punct* ,
and
now
i
am
telling
you
the
story
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* ,
after
a
pause
*punct* ,
that
all
this
will
be
absolutely
incredible
to
you
*punct* .
*break*
to
me
the
one
incredible
thing
is
that
i
am
here
to-night
in
this
old
familiar
room
looking
into
your
friendly
faces
and
telling
you
these
strange
adventures
*punct* .
*break*
he
looked
at
the
medical
man
*punct* .
*break*
i
cannot
expect
you
to
believe
it
*punct* .
*break*
take
it
as
a
lie
*mdash*
or
a
prophecy
*punct* .
*break*
say
i
dreamed
it
in
the
workshop
*punct* .
*break*
consider
i
have
been
speculating
upon
the
destinies
of
our
race
until
i
have
hatched
this
fiction
*punct* .
*break*
treat
my
assertion
of
its
truth
as
a
mere
stroke
of
art
to
enhance
its
interest
*punct* .
*break*
and
taking
it
as
a
story
*punct* ,
what
do
you
think
of
it
*punct* ?
*break*
he
took
up
his
pipe
*punct* ,
and
began
*punct* ,
in
his
old
accustomed
manner
*punct* ,
to
tap
with
it
nervously
upon
the
bars
of
the
grate
*punct* .
*break*
there
was
a
momentary
stillness
*punct* .
*break*
then
chairs
began
to
creak
and
shoes
to
scrape
upon
the
carpet
*punct* .
*break*
i
took
my
eyes
off
the
time
traveller's
face
*punct* ,
and
looked
round
at
his
audience
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
in
the
dark
*punct* ,
and
little
spots
of
colour
swam
before
them
*punct* .
*break*
the
medical
man
seemed
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
our
host
*punct* .
*break*
the
editor
was
looking
hard
at
the
end
of
his
cigar
*mdash*
the
sixth
*punct* .
*break*
the
journalist
fumbled
for
his
watch
*punct* .
*break*
the
others
*punct* ,
as
far
as
i
remember
*punct* ,
were
motionless
*punct* .
*break*
the
editor
stood
up
with
a
sigh
*punct* .
*break*
what
a
pity
it
is
you're
not
a
writer
of
stories
*punct* !
*break*
he
said
*punct* ,
putting
his
hand
on
the
time
traveller's
shoulder
*punct* .
*break*
you
don't
believe
it
*punct* ?
*break*
well
*mdash*
*mdash*
i
thought
not
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
traveller
turned
to
us
*punct* .
*break*
where
are
the
matches
*punct* ?
*break*
he
lit
one
and
spoke
over
his
pipe
*punct* ,
puffing
*punct* .
*break*
to
tell
you
the
truth
*punct* ...
i
hardly
believe
it
myself
*punct* ...
and
yet
*punct* ...
his
eye
fell
with
a
mute
inquiry
upon
the
withered
white
flowers
upon
the
little
table
*punct* .
*break*
then
he
turned
over
the
hand
holding
his
pipe
*punct* ,
and
i
saw
he
was
looking
at
some
half-healed
scars
on
his
knuckles
*punct* .
*break*
the
medical
man
rose
*punct* ,
came
to
the
lamp
*punct* ,
and
examined
the
flowers
*punct* .
*break*
the
gynaeceum's
odd
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
the
psychologist
leant
forward
to
see
*punct* ,
holding
out
his
hand
for
a
specimen
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
hanged
if
it
isn't
a
quarter
to
one
*punct* ,
said
the
journalist
*punct* .
*break*
how
shall
we
get
home
*punct* ?
*break*
plenty
of
cabs
at
the
station
*punct* ,
said
the
psychologist
*punct* .
*break*
it's
a
curious
thing
*punct* ,
said
the
medical
man
*punct* ;
but
i
certainly
don't
know
the
natural
order
of
these
flowers
*punct* .
*break*
may
i
have
them
*punct* ?
*break*
the
time
traveller
hesitated
*punct* .
*break*
then
suddenly
*punct* :
certainly
not
*punct* .
*break*
where
did
you
really
get
them
*punct* ?
*break*
said
the
medical
man
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
traveller
put
his
hand
to
his
head
*punct* .
*break*
he
spoke
like
one
who
was
trying
to
keep
hold
of
an
idea
that
eluded
him
*punct* .
*break*
they
were
put
into
my
pocket
by
weena
*punct* ,
when
i
travelled
into
time
*punct* .
*break*
he
stared
round
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
damned
if
it
isn't
all
going
*punct* .
*break*
this
room
and
you
and
the
atmosphere
of
every
day
is
too
much
for
my
memory
*punct* .
*break*
did
i
ever
make
a
time
machine
*punct* ,
or
a
model
of
a
time
machine
*punct* ?
*break*
or
is
it
all
only
a
dream
*punct* ?
*break*
they
say
life
is
a
dream
*punct* ,
a
precious
poor
dream
at
times
*mdash*
but
i
can't
stand
another
that
won't
fit
*punct* .
*break*
and
where
did
the
dream
come
from?
*punct* ...
i
must
look
at
that
machine
*punct* .
*break*
if
there
is
one
*punct* !
*break*
he
caught
up
the
lamp
swiftly
*punct* ,
and
carried
it
*punct* ,
flaring
red
*punct* ,
through
the
door
into
the
corridor
*punct* .
*break*
we
followed
him
*punct* .
*break*
there
in
the
flickering
light
of
the
lamp
was
the
machine
sure
enough
*punct* ,
squat
*punct* ,
ugly
*punct* ,
and
askew
*punct* ;
a
thing
of
brass
*punct* ,
ebony
*punct* ,
ivory
*punct* ,
and
translucent
glimmering
quartz
*punct* .
*break*
solid
to
the
touch
*mdash*
for
i
put
out
my
hand
and
felt
the
rail
of
it
*mdash*
and
with
brown
spots
and
smears
upon
the
ivory
*punct* ,
and
bits
of
grass
and
moss
upon
the
lower
parts
*punct* ,
and
one
rail
bent
awry
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
traveller
put
the
lamp
down
on
the
bench
*punct* ,
and
ran
his
hand
along
the
damaged
rail
*punct* .
*break*
it's
all
right
now
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
the
story
i
told
you
was
true
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
sorry
to
have
brought
you
out
here
in
the
cold
*punct* .
*break*
he
took
up
the
lamp
*punct* ,
and
*punct* ,
in
an
absolute
silence
*punct* ,
we
returned
to
the
smoking-room
*punct* .
*break*
he
came
into
the
hall
with
us
and
helped
the
editor
on
with
his
coat
*punct* .
*break*
the
medical
man
looked
into
his
face
and
*punct* ,
with
a
certain
hesitation
*punct* ,
told
him
he
was
suffering
from
overwork
*punct* ,
at
which
he
laughed
hugely
*punct* .
*break*
i
remember
him
standing
in
the
open
doorway
*punct* ,
bawling
good
night
*punct* .
*break*
i
shared
a
cab
with
the
editor
*punct* .
*break*
he
thought
the
tale
a
gaudy
lie
*punct* .
*break*
for
my
own
part
i
was
unable
to
come
to
a
conclusion
*punct* .
*break*
the
story
was
so
fantastic
and
incredible
*punct* ,
the
telling
so
credible
and
sober
*punct* .
*break*
i
lay
awake
most
of
the
night
thinking
about
it
*punct* .
*break*
i
determined
to
go
next
day
and
see
the
time
traveller
again
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
told
he
was
in
the
laboratory
*punct* ,
and
being
on
easy
terms
in
the
house
*punct* ,
i
went
up
to
him
*punct* .
*break*
the
laboratory
*punct* ,
however
*punct* ,
was
empty
*punct* .
*break*
i
stared
for
a
minute
at
the
time
machine
and
put
out
my
hand
and
touched
the
lever
*punct* .
*break*
at
that
the
squat
substantial-looking
mass
swayed
like
a
bough
shaken
by
the
wind
*punct* .
*break*
its
instability
startled
me
extremely
*punct* ,
and
i
had
a
queer
reminiscence
of
the
childish
days
when
i
used
to
be
forbidden
to
meddle
*punct* .
*break*
i
came
back
through
the
corridor
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
traveller
met
me
in
the
smoking-room
*punct* .
*break*
he
was
coming
from
the
house
*punct* .
*break*
he
had
a
small
camera
under
one
arm
and
a
knapsack
under
the
other
*punct* .
*break*
he
laughed
when
he
saw
me
*punct* ,
and
gave
me
an
elbow
to
shake
*punct* .
*break*
i'm
frightfully
busy
*punct* ,
said
he
*punct* ,
with
that
thing
in
there
*punct* .
*break*
but
is
it
not
some
hoax
*punct* ?
*break*
do
you
really
travel
through
time
*punct* ?
*break*
really
and
truly
i
do
*punct* .
*break*
and
he
looked
frankly
into
my
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
his
eye
wandered
about
the
room
*punct* .
*break*
i
only
want
half
an
hour
*punct* ,
he
said
*punct* .
*break*
i
know
why
you
came
*punct* ,
and
it's
awfully
good
of
you
*punct* .
*break*
there's
some
magazines
here
*punct* .
*break*
if
you'll
stop
to
lunch
i'll
prove
you
this
time
travelling
up
to
the
hilt
*punct* ,
specimen
and
all
*punct* .
*break*
if
you'll
forgive
my
leaving
you
now
*punct* ?
*break*
i
consented
*punct* ,
hardly
comprehending
then
the
full
import
of
his
words
*punct* ,
and
he
nodded
and
went
on
down
the
corridor
*punct* .
*break*
i
heard
the
door
of
the
laboratory
slam
*punct* ,
seated
myself
in
a
chair
*punct* ,
and
took
up
a
daily
paper
*punct* .
*break*
what
was
he
going
to
do
before
lunch-time
*punct* ?
*break*
then
suddenly
i
was
reminded
by
an
advertisement
that
i
had
promised
to
meet
richardson
*punct* ,
the
publisher
*punct* ,
at
two
*punct* .
*break*
i
looked
at
my
watch
*punct* ,
and
saw
that
i
could
barely
save
that
engagement
*punct* .
*break*
i
got
up
and
went
down
the
passage
to
tell
the
time
traveller
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
took
hold
of
the
handle
of
the
door
i
heard
an
exclamation
*punct* ,
oddly
truncated
at
the
end
*punct* ,
and
a
click
and
a
thud
*punct* .
*break*
a
gust
of
air
whirled
round
me
as
i
opened
the
door
*punct* ,
and
from
within
came
the
sound
of
broken
glass
falling
on
the
floor
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
traveller
was
not
there
*punct* .
*break*
i
seemed
to
see
a
ghostly
*punct* ,
indistinct
figure
sitting
in
a
whirling
mass
of
black
and
brass
for
a
moment
*mdash*
a
figure
so
transparent
that
the
bench
behind
with
its
sheets
of
drawings
was
absolutely
distinct
*punct* ;
but
this
phantasm
vanished
as
i
rubbed
my
eyes
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
machine
had
gone
*punct* .
*break*
save
for
a
subsiding
stir
of
dust
*punct* ,
the
further
end
of
the
laboratory
was
empty
*punct* .
*break*
a
pane
of
the
skylight
had
*punct* ,
apparently
*punct* ,
just
been
blown
in
*punct* .
*break*
i
felt
an
unreasonable
amazement
*punct* .
*break*
i
knew
that
something
strange
had
happened
*punct* ,
and
for
the
moment
could
not
distinguish
what
the
strange
thing
might
be
*punct* .
*break*
as
i
stood
staring
*punct* ,
the
door
into
the
garden
opened
*punct* ,
and
the
man-servant
appeared
*punct* .
*break*
we
looked
at
each
other
*punct* .
*break*
then
ideas
began
to
come
*punct* .
*break*
has
mr.
*mdash*
*mdash*
gone
out
that
way
*punct* ?
*break*
no
*punct* ,
sir
*punct* .
*break*
no
one
has
come
out
this
way
*punct* .
*break*
i
was
expecting
to
find
him
here
*punct* .
*break*
at
that
i
understood
*punct* .
*break*
at
the
risk
of
disappointing
richardson
i
stayed
on
*punct* ,
waiting
for
the
time
traveller
*punct* ;
waiting
for
the
second
*punct* ,
perhaps
still
stranger
story
*punct* ,
and
the
specimens
and
photographs
he
would
bring
with
him
*punct* .
*break*
but
i
am
beginning
now
to
fear
that
i
must
wait
a
lifetime
*punct* .
*break*
the
time
traveller
vanished
three
years
ago
*punct* .
*break*
and
*punct* ,
as
everybody
knows
now
*punct* ,
he
has
never
returned
*punct* .
*break*
one
cannot
choose
but
wonder
*punct* .
*break*
will
he
ever
return
*punct* ?
*break*
it
may
be
that
he
swept
back
into
the
past
*punct* ,
and
fell
among
the
blood-drinking
*punct* ,
hairy
savages
of
the
age
of
unpolished
stone
*punct* ;
into
the
abysses
of
the
cretaceous
sea
*punct* ;
or
among
the
grotesque
saurians
*punct* ,
the
huge
reptilian
brutes
of
the
jurassic
times
*punct* .
*break*
he
may
even
now
*mdash*
if
i
may
use
the
phrase
*mdash*
be
wandering
on
some
plesiosaurus-haunted
oolitic
coral
reef
*punct* ,
or
beside
the
lonely
saline
lakes
of
the
triassic
age
*punct* .
*break*
or
did
he
go
forward
*punct* ,
into
one
of
the
nearer
ages
*punct* ,
in
which
men
are
still
men
*punct* ,
but
with
the
riddles
of
our
own
time
answered
and
its
wearisome
problems
solved
*punct* ?
*break*
into
the
manhood
of
the
race
*punct* :
for
i
*punct* ,
for
my
own
part
cannot
think
that
these
latter
days
of
weak
experiment
*punct* ,
fragmentary
theory
*punct* ,
and
mutual
discord
are
indeed
man's
culminating
time
*punct* !
*break*
i
say
*punct* ,
for
my
own
part
*punct* .
*break*
he
*punct* ,
i
know
*mdash*
for
the
question
had
been
discussed
among
us
long
before
the
time
machine
was
made
*mdash*
thought
but
cheerlessly
of
the
advancement
of
mankind
*punct* ,
and
saw
in
the
growing
pile
of
civilization
only
a
foolish
heaping
that
must
inevitably
fall
back
upon
and
destroy
its
makers
in
the
end
*punct* .
*break*
if
that
is
so
*punct* ,
it
remains
for
us
to
live
as
though
it
were
not
so
*punct* .
*break*
but
to
me
the
future
is
still
black
and
blank
*mdash*
is
a
vast
ignorance
*punct* ,
lit
at
a
few
casual
places
by
the
memory
of
his
story
*punct* .
*break*
and
i
have
by
me
*punct* ,
for
my
comfort
*punct* ,
two
strange
white
flowers
*mdash*
shrivelled
now
*punct* ,
and
brown
and
flat
and
brittle
*mdash*
to
witness
that
even
when
mind
and
strength
had
gone
*punct* ,
gratitude
and
a
mutual
tenderness
still
lived
on
in
the
heart
of
man
*punct* .
*break*
